     "AB": "Senescence accelerated mice (SAMP8) exhibit age induced impairments such as loss of memory and learning disabilities by the age of 8-10 months. Analysis of hippocampus of SAMP8 mice revealed that delta 9-desaturase (delta9desaturase) activity reduced up to 44-50% with age. Correspondingly, levels of unsaturated fatty acids are also lowered in the aged animals approximately to the same levels. RNase protection assay showed that delta9specific message decreased similarly with age. As such a decrease is known to cause alterations in membrane fluidity and affect cellular signaling pathways, these results suggest that lowering of delta9gene expression may be partly involved in age induced impairments.",
