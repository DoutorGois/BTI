     "AB": "Neuronal damage and changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) following repeated brief periods of ischemia were studied in Mongolian gerbils. The cerebral ischemia was produced by three repeated occlusions of bilateral common carotid arteries for 3 min at 1-h intervals. CBF and permeability of the BBB were examined with tracers (China ink and silver nitrate) at 1, 3, and 7 days post ischemia using light and electron microscopy. Three days after the reperfusion, significant extravasation of tracers, consequential reduction of CBF, extensive neuronal destruction, and intravascular platelet aggregation were observed. Such vascular changes in the CA1 region were more severe than those in the frontal cortex. These findings strongly support the view that microcirculatory disturbance may be a mechanism responsible for delayed neuronal death in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.",
