     "AB": "The impact of prolonged injection of piracetam (2 months), meclophenoxate (5 months), and mexidole (5 months) on the bioelectrical activity of the sensomotor cortex and dorsal hippocamp was studied in rats who behaved freely. The injects increased and stabilized the predominant peak of EEC spectra power by the Fourier method. Discontinuation (24 hours) of piracetam failed to impair EEG spectra and bioelectrical activity. Increasing the basic effects of nootropic drugs given chronically versus acutely suggests that chronic injection enhanced their action. The drugs under study elevated the level of wakefulness and excitability of the animals, which is likely to underlie the neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for behaviour optimization under the influence of these agents.",
