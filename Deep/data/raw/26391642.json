     "AB": "beta-amyloid is hypothesized to harm neural function and cognitive abilities by perturbing synaptic transmission and plasticity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To assess the impact of this pathology on hippocampal neurons' ability to encode flexibly environmental information across learning, we performed electrophysiological recordings of CA1 hippocampal unit activity in AD transgenic mice as they acquired an action-reward association in a spatially defined environment; the behavioral task enabled the precise timing of discrete and intentional behaviors of the animal. We found that the proportion of behavioral task-sensitive cells in wild-type (WT) mice typically increased, whereas the proportion of place cells decreased with learning. In AD mice, this learning-dependent change of cell-discharge patterns was absent, and cells exhibited similar firings from the beginning to firings attained at the late learning stage in wild-type cells. These inflexible hippocampal representations of task and space throughout learning are accompanied by remarkable alterations of local oscillatory activity in the theta and ultra-fast ripple frequencies as well as learning abilities. The present data offer new insights into the in vivo cellular and network processes by which beta-amyloid and other AD mutations may exert its harmful effects to produce cognitive and behavioral impairments in early stage of AD.",
