This note describes tests of a fully automated MR imaging postprocessing system for volumetric analysis of structures (such as the hippocampus) known to be affected in early Alzheimer disease (AD). The system yielded results that correlated highly with independent computer-aided manual segmentation and were sensitive to the anatomic atrophy characteristic of mild AD.",
