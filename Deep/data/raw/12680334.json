This paper reviewed the distribution of AR and its mRNA in prostate, epididymis, skin of penis, and some other tissues in non-genital system and tumors, such as the skin of scalp, hippocampus, fat, gastric cancer, cancer of larynx, and so on. Besides, this paper also reviewed the detection methods to AR, and further investigated the function of androgen.",
