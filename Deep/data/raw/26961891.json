     "AB": "Silibinin, a flavonoid derived from the herb milk thistle (Silybum marianum), has been used as a hepato-protectant in the clinical treatment of liver disease. In the present study, the effect of silibinin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammatory impairment in rats is investigated. Injection of LPS into lateral ventricle caused learning and memory impairment. Rats were treated with silibinin to see the effect in comparison with resveratrol as a positive control. Y-maze and Morris water maze tests showed that silibinin significantly attenuated memory damage caused by LPS treatment. At the molecular analysis, the levels of IL-1beta and of IL-4 in the hippocampus were decreased and enhanced, respectively, by the treatment with silibinin. NF-kappaB expression was attenuated by silibinin treatment. Furthermore, generation of total reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the hippocampus was elevated in silibinin-treated groups, and so were the expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB). At the same time, LPS-induced reduction of neurons in hippocampus was reversed by silibinin. In conclusion, silibinin ameliorated the impairment of learning and memory of LPS-injection rats, possibly due to the activation of ROS-BDNF-TrkB pathway in the hippocampus as well as the suppression of inflammatory response. This study gives an insight on the beneficial consequences of ROS in central nervous system. Silibinin might be a potential candidate drug for neurodegenerative diseases.",
