     "AB": "Tyrosine phosphorylation in the gerbil hippocampus after a transient ischemia was analyzed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. In control hippocampus, the phosphotyrosine was detected in many proteins of 165 to 10 kDa and the immunostain showed a distinct distribution. The ischemic insult induced various alterations of the phosphotyrosine immunoreactivities in both ischemia-resistant and -vulnerable neurons which were associated with alterations in the expression of 165 to 19 kDa-immunoreactive bands. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in the ischemic hippocampus to play a role in the development of early and delayed neuronal deaths in CA4 and CA1 neurons, respectively.",
