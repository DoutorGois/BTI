They are both highly expressed in the rat hippocampus. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, these receptors activated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade and phospholipase A2. Arachidonic acid or its derivatives, thus produced by the activation of these receptors may play some roles in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity.",
