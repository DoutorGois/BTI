Statistical analysis of the data revealed that in the majority of cells, inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were markedly decreased and excitatory postsynaptic potentials increased prior to the development of bursting activity, although some inhibition persisted in cells exposed to opioid peptides. In a minority of cells, no alteration in synaptic potentials were observed to precede the stimulus-evoked bursts induced by the opioid peptides.",
