     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to quantify the temporal evolution and to determine the prognostic significance of spikes on serial postoperative EEGs after selective amygdala-hippocampectomy. The authors performed postoperative EEGs 4 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery in 31 patients with unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Spike frequency was determined ipsilateral to the resection (group I, no spikes; group II, 1 to 10 spikes; group III, 11 to 20 spikes; group IV, more than 21 spikes during the 30-minute recording). The temporal evolution of postoperative spike frequency was assessed, and these parameters were correlated with surgical outcome. Twenty-two patients showed spikes on postoperative EEG. Spike frequency decreased over time in 14 patients, while no changes or minimal changes occurred in seven patients, and spike frequency increased in one patient. Nine patients had no spikes. There was no correlation between occurrence, frequency, and temporal evolution of spikes with postoperative seizure control. The authors' results demonstrate a progressive decrease of spike frequency during the postoperative period after selective amygdala-hippocampectomy, although occurrence, frequency, and temporal evolution of postoperative spikes had no implications on surgical outcome.",
