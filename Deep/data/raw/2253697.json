     "AB": "5 alpha-Pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one (3 alpha-OH-DHP) blocked seizures induced by nicotine (4 mg/kg, i.p.) in C3H male mice with an ID50 of 2.37 +/- 0.66 mg/kg (average +/- 95% confidence limit). This steroid (1 microM) also increased paired-pulse inhibition in the hippocampus approximately 40% after 50 min exposure; nicotine (200 microM) partially reversed this effect. Since nicotine and 3 alpha-OH-DHP may have opposite effects on endogenous inhibitory systems, it is proposed that nicotine-induced seizures may involve a disinhibitory mechanism and that 3 alpha-OH-DHP protects against seizures by preventing disinhibition.",
