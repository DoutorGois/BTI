     "AB": "PURPOSE: Hippocampal volumetry using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a common clinical study in epilepsy patients. Most clinical MR scans operate at 1.5 tesla (T); however, there is increasing use of scanners of a higher field strength. We analyzed whether control data of hippocampal volumes can be used across different field-strength scanners. METHODS: We studied eight adult healthy controls twice at both 1.5 and 3 T. Bilateral hippocampal volumes were measured by manual outlining. Measurement error was analyzed based on the variability between two measurements at the same field strength, and intrascanner variability was analyzed based on the difference between measurements obtained at 1.5 and at 3 T. RESULTS: The measurement error was 4.0% (+/-3.1) at 1.5 T, and 3.4% (+/-2.5) at 3 T. The intrascanner variability between measurements at 1.5 and at 3 T was 6% (+/-3.9). The intrascanner variability was not different from the measurement error. CONCLUSIONS: Control hippocampal volume measurements obtained at 1.5 and at 3 T were not different.",
