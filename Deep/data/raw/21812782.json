     "AB": "The stimulation of neurogenesis is an exciting novel therapeutic option for diseases of the central nervous system, ranging from depression to neurodegeneration. One major bottleneck in screening approaches for neurogenesis-inducing compounds is the very demanding in vivo quantification of newborn neurons based on stereological techniques. To effectively develop compounds in this area, novel fast and reliable techniques for quantification of in vivo neurogenesis are needed. In this study, we introduce a flow cytometry-based method for quantifying newly generated neurons in the brain based on the counting of cell nuclei from dissected brain regions. Important steps involve density sedimentation of the cell nuclei, and staining for the proliferation marker bromodeoxy uridine and nuclear cell type markers such as NeuN. We demonstrate the ability of the technique to detect increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus of animals which underwent physical exercise and received fluoxetine treatment.",
