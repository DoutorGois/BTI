     "AB": "The present study investigated age-related changes in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginase, which shares a substrate with NOS, in the hippocampus and parahippocampal region and the relationship between NOS/arginase and age-associated behavioural impairments. Aged rats (24 months old) displayed reduced exploratory activity, enhanced anxiety, poorer spatial learning and memory, and impaired object recognition memory relative to the young adults (4 months old). There were significant increases in total NOS activity in the aged hippocampus and perirhinal, postrhinal and temporal cortices and a dramatic decrease in endothelial NOS expression in the aged postrhinal cortex. Activity and protein expression of inducible NOS were not detected in any region from either group and a significant increase in total arginase activity was found in the aged perirhinal cortex. Multiple regression analysis revealed significant correlations between NOS/arginase and behavioural measures in both groups. The present findings provide further support for a contribution of nitric oxide to the normal aging process and suggest a potential involvement of arginase in aging and learning and memory.",
