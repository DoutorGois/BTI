     "AB": "Elevated levels of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brains being a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease have been believed to play a critical role in the cognitive dysfunction that occurs in Alzheimer's disease. Recent evidence suggests that Abeta induces neuronal apoptosis in the brain and in primary neuronal cultures. In this study, we investigated the effects of puerarin, a phytoestrogen isolated from Pueraria lobata, on cognitive function and neuronal apoptosis in the intrahippocampal injection of Abeta rats and its mechanism of action. The results show the intrahippocampal injection of Abeta induced a spatial memory deficit, apoptosis, and caspase-9 activation in hippocampal neurons. Puerarin treatment ameliorated Abeta(1-42)-induced cognitive impairment and reversed the increase of apoptosis in the hippocampus. The attenuation is associated with the activation of Akt and phosphorylation of Bad. These results suggest that puerarin may be an anti-Alzheimer's disease candidate drug to suppress both Alzheimer's disease-related neuronal cell apoptosis and dysfunction of the memory system.",
