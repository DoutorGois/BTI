     "AB": "Long-term memories seem to require protein synthesis to be established. This process can be related with synaptogenesis resulting in changes in the form or even in the number or proportion of synaptic contacts. Results from behavioral studies assessing quantitative changes associated with different learning tasks are controversial. The aim of our work was to assess whether the number of CA1 hippocampal synaptic contacts can be modified after training in different tasks in the Morris water maze (MWM). We found transient changes in the synaptic density of the symmetric synapses associated with place learning. A reduced synaptic density of the symmetric synapses in the stratum radiatum of CA1 was found at 48 h posttraining, returning to control levels 72 h posttraining. The same effect was observed 1 h after training in a nonspatial task. Synaptic changes found in the CA1 shortly after water maze training suggest a possible participation of the hippocampus in the acquisition of nonspatial tasks together with a role in the short-term consolidation of spatial memory. As no changes were found in the total number of synapses counted, it is likely that subtle changes in synaptic efficacy than new synapse generation may be sufficient to support the acquisition and maintenance of new memories.",
