     "AB": "Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in stratum radiatum of CA1 and CA3 in submerged hippocampal slices from adult or newborn (postnatal days 5-25) Wistar rats. In adult slices, excitatory postsynaptic potentials were depressed by glucose removal (\"aglycemia\") more rapidly and to a greater extent in CA1 than in CA3 [respective mean times to 50% reduction in peak amplitude were 7.5 +/- 0.83 (standard error) min and 12.5 +/- 0.27 (standard error) min]. Subsequent recovery of excitatory postsynaptic potentials in normoglycemic medium was correspondingly quicker in CA3 than in CA1. Transmission failure at the synapses was indicated by the preservation of the afferent volley, and sharp depression of synaptic input-output plots. In the early postnatal period, CA1 excitatory postsynaptic potentials were much more resistant to aglycemia, substantially persisting for as long as 75 min, with full subsequent recovery in normoglycemic medium. The higher resistance of slices from newborn rats progressively disappeared over the first two postnatal weeks.",
