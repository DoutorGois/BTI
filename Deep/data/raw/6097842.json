     "AB": "The kinetic characteristics of [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNT) and [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ([3H]beta-CCE) were compared in three different areas of the human brain. As revealed by the Scatchard plot analysis the total number of binding sites labelled by [3H]beta-CCE was markedly lower than that labelled by [3H]FNT. In fact, only 50% of the binding sites for [3H]FNT were also available for [3H]beta-CCE. This finding indicates that in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of the human brain at least 50% of the benzodiazepine recognition sites are that of Type II. This conclusion is further supported by the evidence that CL-218872 (5 X 10(-6) M), a specific ligand for Type I benzodiazepine recognition site, inhibited [3H]FNT binding by 50% in membranes from the above brain areas. The results suggest that two distinct types of benzodiazepines recognition sites are present in different areas of the human brain.",
