     "AB": "The effects of two ligands with previously established high and selective potency for metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu receptors) group II have been investigated on the high frequency stimulation (HFS) induced long-term potentiation of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus in vitro. The ligands investigated were (2S,1'S,2'S,3'R)-2-(2\"-carboxy-3'-phenylcyclopropyl)glycine (PCCG-IV) and (R,S)-alpha-methyl-4-tetrazolylphenylglycine (MTPG). PCCG-IV (10 microM) strongly inhibited the induction of long-term potentiation of the field EPSP by high frequency stimulation. MTPG (50 microM) did not inhibit the induction of long-term potentiation, but prevented the inhibition of long-term potentiation induction by PCCG-IV. The inhibition of long-term potentiation induction by PCCG-IV is suggested to be due to an agonistic action on mGlu receptor group II, probably mGlu3 receptor, as the inhibition of long-term potentiation can be reversed by the application of MTPG, a well-known selective and potent antagonist of mGlu receptor group II.",
