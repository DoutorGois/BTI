     "PG": "915-23",
     "AB": "Although the extent of ischemic brain damage is directly proportional to the duration of anoxic depolarization (AD), the mechanism of cytosolic [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](c)) elevation during AD is poorly understood. To address the mechanism in this study, [Ca(2+)](c) was monitored in cultured rat hippocampal CA1 neurons loaded with a Ca-sensitive dye, fura-2FF, and exposed to an AD-simulating medium containing (in mmol/L): K(+) 65, Na(+) 50, Ca(2+) 0.13, glutamate 0.1, and pH reduced to 6.6. Application of this medium promptly elevated [Ca(2+)](c) to about 30 micromol/L, but only if oxygen was removed, the respiratory chain was inhibited, or if the mitochondria were uncoupled. These high [Ca(2+)](c) elevations depended on external Ca(2+) and could not be prevented by inhibiting NMDA or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)/kainate receptors, or gadolinium-sensitive channels. However, they could be prevented by removing external Na(+) or simultaneously inhibiting NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptors; 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea methanesulfonate (KB-R7943), an inhibitor of plasmalemmal Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, partly suppressed them. The data indicate that the [Ca(2+)](c) elevations to 30 micromol/L during AD result from Na(+) influx. Activation of either NMDA or AMPA/kainate channels provides adequate Na(+) influx to induce these [Ca(2+)](c) elevations, which are mediated by KB-R7943-sensitive and KB-R7943-resistant mechanisms.",
