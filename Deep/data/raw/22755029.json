     "AB": "We have prepared gold nanowire arrays inside nanoporous alumina templates with the goal towards neuronal interfacing and electrical recording from neurons. We have investigated biofunctionalization of such gold nanowire arrays (GNWs) and gold nanofilm (GNF) platforms to understand its impact on neuronal attachment and growth. Poly-D-Lysine (PDL) was coated on the nano-templates surfaces for adhesion of neurons which also enhanced the neuronal growth. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy images revealed strong affinity and improved growth of neurons on PDL-coated surfaces. Such results will impact future investigation of stimulation and recording of electrical activity on nanoscale surfaces.",
