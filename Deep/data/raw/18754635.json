     "AB": "The organization and dynamics of cellular membranes in the nervous system are crucial for the function of neuronal membrane receptors and signal transduction. Previous work from our laboratory has established hippocampal membranes as a convenient natural source for studying neuronal receptors. In this paper, we have monitored the organization and dynamics of hippocampal membranes and their modulation by cholesterol using pyrene fluorescence. The apparent dielectric constant experienced by pyrene in hippocampal membranes turns out to be approximately 20+/-3, depending on the experimental condition. Our results show that the polarity of the hippocampal membrane is increased upon cholesterol depletion, as monitored by changes in the ratio of pyrene vibronic peak intensities (I1/I3). This is accompanied by an increase in lateral diffusion, measured as an increase in the pyrene excimer/monomer ratio. These results are relevant in understanding the complex organization and dynamics of hippocampal membranes and could have implications in neuronal diseases characterized by defective cholesterol metabolism.",
