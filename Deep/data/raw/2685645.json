     "AB": "The literature on ionic requirements for excitotoxicity is largely contradictory. Depending on the experimental paradigms, it has been concluded that either Ca2+ or Na+ and Cl- mediate excitotoxicity. In the present study, the dependence on Ca2+ of N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced damage to neurons in immature rat hippocampal slices was investigated with light microscopy. In addition N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced cell damage was followed by measurement of release of lactate dehydrogenase from slices. When incubated in N-methyl-D-aspartate-containing (100 microM) buffer for 30 min, hippocampal neurons displayed fine chromatin aggregation and swelling of neuronal nuclei and neuropil. Slices incubated in standard medium for 90 min after exposure to N-methyl-D-aspartate contained a large number of neurons that failed to recover from the initial lesion. The acute edema was at least as severe in slices incubated in N-methyl-D-aspartate-containing, Ca2+-free buffer. In contrast, clumping of the chromatin could not be observed. CA1 neurons recovered completely from the acute changes, and granule cells recovered to some extent. While omission of Ca2+ had no obvious morphological effects on the tissue in its own right, the efflux of lactate dehydrogenase was significantly increased after incubation in Ca2+-free medium. Slices exposed to N-methyl-D-aspartate released approximately twice as much lactate dehydrogenase as controls 1-5 h after the exposure, and the same rate of release was seen if Ca2+ was absent during N-methyl-D-aspartate treatment. The morphological results suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate toxicity is Ca2+-dependent in pyramidal cells whereas the toxicity in granule cells is partly Ca2+-independent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
