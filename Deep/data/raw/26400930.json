     "AB": "Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease with clear pathological hallmarks, brain dysfunction, and unknown etiology. Here, we tested the hypothesis that there is a link between genetic risk factors for AD, cellular metabolic stress, and transcription/translation regulation. In addition, we aimed at reversing the memory impairment observed in a mouse model of sporadic AD. We have previously demonstrated that the most prevalent genetic risk factor for AD, the ApoE4 allele, is correlated with increased phosphorylation of the translation factor eIF2alpha. In the present study, we tested the possible involvement of additional members of the eIF2alpha pathway and identified increased mRNA expression of negative transcription factor ATF4 (aka CREB2) both in human and a mouse model expressing the human ApoE4 allele. Furthermore, injection of a PKR inhibitor rescued memory impairment and attenuated ATF4 mRNA increased expression in the ApoE4 mice. The results propose a new mechanism by which ApoE4 affects brain function and further suggest that inhibition of PKR is a way to restore ATF4 overexpression and memory impairment in early stages of sporadic AD. Significance statement: ATF4 mRNA relative quantities are elevated in ApoE4 allele carriers compared with noncarrier controls. This is true also for the ApoE epsilon4 human replacement mice. ApoE4 mice injected with PKR inhibitor (PKRi) demonstrate a significant reduction in ATF4 expression levels 3 h after one injection of PKRi. Treatment of ApoE4 human replacement mice with the PKRi before learning rescues the memory impairment of the ApoE4 AD model mice. We think that these results propose a new mechanism by which ApoE4 affects brain function and suggest that inhibition of PKR is a way to restore memory impairment in early stages of sporadic AD.",
