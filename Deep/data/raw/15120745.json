     "AB": "Dorsal hippocampal kindling impairs subsequent performance on spatial tasks. The relation between this effect and the extent of kindling achieved prior to testing has not been clearly established. Thus, the present study investigated the effects of dorsal hippocampal kindling on performance of a delayed-match-to-place (DMTP) task in the Morris water maze by assessing performance after each of series of different points in the kindling process including 1, 6, 11, and 16 afterdischarges, 1 stage 1 seizure, and 1 stage 5 seizure. We found that kindling produced a deficit that was apparent very early into kindling in terms of both direct swim (by 1 AD) and escape distance (by 6 ADs) measures but that did not clearly change in severity with further kindling. These results illustrate that kindling of even a few localized hippocampal seizures can disrupt spatial cognition and suggest that the mechanisms mediating memory disruption either do not change substantially as kindling progresses or that compensatory processes are engaged across training that mitigate any further kindling-related deteriorations in performance.",
