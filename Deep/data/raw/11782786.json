Morphometry showed that postresuscitation damage to neurons was more pronounced in good learners compared to poor learners. Interferometry revealed higher protein content in neurons in poor learners compared to successfully trained rats. It was hypothesized that different neuronal resistance to ischemia in rats characterized by different learning ability is determined by some peculiarities in protein metabolism preexisting in intact animals and manifesting in the postresuscitation period.",
