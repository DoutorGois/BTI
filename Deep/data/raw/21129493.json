     "AB": "Contextual fear conditioning emerges around post-natal day (PD) 23 in the rat. This is thought to reflect hippocampus-dependent conjunctive learning, which binds the individual features of the context into a unified representation (Rudy, 1993). However, context conditioning can also be supported by hippocampus-independent, feature-based simple associations (Rudy, 2009) and these may operate at PD 23-24 (Pugh & Rudy, 1996). To address this issue, we studied the ontogeny of a variant of contextual fear conditioning, termed the context-preexposure-facilitation-effect (CPFE), in which exposure to context and (immediate) foot shock occur on successive occasions. This variant requires conjunctive as opposed to feature-based simple associations (Rudy, 2009). We tested PD 17, 24, and 31 rats on the CPFE vs. conventional context conditioning (Exp. 1) and on the CPFE with stronger reinforcement (Exp. 2). The CPFE emerged on PD 24 regardless of reinforcer strength and in parallel with context conditioning. Infusions of the NMDA-receptor antagonist, MK-801, into the dorsal hippocampus just before pre-exposure on PD 24 eliminated the CPFE, whereas infusions occurring after pre-exposure had no effect (Exp. 3). These findings demonstrate a role of hippocampal NMDA receptors in the CPFE as early as PD 24 and implicate conjunctive learning mechanisms in the ontogeny of contextual fear conditioning.",
