     "AB": "Regional levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 mRNA and the cytosolic cytochrome c protein were measured after lateral fluid percussion (FP) brain injury in rats. Levels of Bcl-2 mRNA were significantly decreased in the injured left cortex (IC) and ipsilateral hippocampus (IH), but not in the contralateral right cortex (CC) and hippocampus (CH) after brain injury. Levels of Bcl-2 mRNA were significantly decreased as early as 2 h and stayed decreased as long as 48 h in the IC and IH after injury. Levels of the cytosolic cytochrome c protein were significantly increased in the IC and IH, but not in the CC and CH after brain injury. Levels of cytosolic cytochrome c were significantly increased in the IC at 30 min, 48 and 72 h, and in the IH at 2 h and as long as 72 h after injury. The increase of cytosolic cytochrome c suggests that the mitochondrial release of cytochrome is increased in the IC and IH after lateral FP brain injury. These data show that the reduction of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and increases of mitochondrial release of cytochrome c protein occur only in the IC and IH, regions which have been observed to undergo apoptosis and neuronal cell loss after lateral FP brain injury. Therefore, it is likely that the reduction of Bcl-2 and the increased cytochrome c protein in the cytosol contribute to the observed apoptosis and neuronal cell death in the IC and IH after lateral FP brain injury in rats.",
