     "AB": "To investigate the functional roles of the Ca(v)2.3 (alpha(1E)) channel in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, we studied in vitro synaptic properties and in vivo behaviors of the Ca(v)2.3 gene deficient mice. The Ca(v)2.3 channel mRNA was identified in the hippocampal formation of the wild-type mouse by in situ hybridization. The basic excitatory synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation by theta-burst stimulation were intact in CA1 region of Ca(v)2.3-/- mice. We performed two forms of behavioral tests to examine the hippocampus-dependent function, i.e., emotional and spatial learning tests. The Ca(v)2.3-/- mice were able to establish and maintain fear memories. Although general improvement in the performance of Morris water maze test was seen in Ca(v)2.3-/- mice, they displayed an obvious impairment in the probe test. These results suggest that the Ca(v)2.3 channel plays some role in formation of the accurate spatial memory but not of the fear memory.",
