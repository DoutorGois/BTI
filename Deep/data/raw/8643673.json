     "AB": "Neural pathways within the hippocampus undergo use-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy, and these changes are mediated by a number of signaling mechanisms, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The PKA holoenzyme is composed of regulatory and catalytic (C) subunits, both of which exist as multiple isoforms. There are two C subunit genes in mice, Calpha and Cbeta, and the Cbeta gene gives rise to several splice variants that are specifically expressed in discrete regions of the brain. We have used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to introduce an inactivating mutation into the mouse Cbeta gene, specifically targeting the Cbeta1-subunit isoform. Homozygous mutants showed normal viability and no obvious pathological defects, despite a complete lack of Cbeta1. The mice were analyzed in electrophysiological paradigms to test the role of this isoform in long-term modulation of synaptic transmission in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway of the hippocampus. A high-frequency stimulus produced potentiation in both wild-type and Cbeta1-/- mice, but the mutants were unable to maintain the potentiated response, resulting in a late phase of long-term potentiation that was only 30% of controls. Paired pulse facilitation was unaffected in the mutant mice. Low-frequency stimulation produced long-term depression and depotentiation in wild-type mice but failed to produce lasting synaptic depression in the Cbeta1 -/- mutants. These data provide direct genetic evidence that PKA, and more specifically the Cbeta1 isoform, is required for long-term depression and depotentiation, as well as the late phase of long-term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway.",
