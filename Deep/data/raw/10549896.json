     "AB": "When both common carotid arteries of Mongolian gerbils were occluded for 5 min to produce ischemic insult, locomotor activity was increased the following day. The effect of calcium channel blockers on this ischemia-induced hyperactivity was investigated. Nimodipine, at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, dose dependently and significantly decreased ischemia-induced hyperactivity. Nicardipine significantly decreased ischemia-induced hyperactivity and doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg. Nifedipine and flunaridine also significantly decreased ischemia-induced hyperactivity at doses of 20 mg/kg. Verapamil had no effect on ischemia-induced hyperactivity at a dose of 20 mg/kg. These findings suggest that ischemia-induced hyperactivity is related to calcium channels. These relationship between calcium channels and dopaminergic function is discussed.",
