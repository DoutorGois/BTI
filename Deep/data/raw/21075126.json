     "AB": "AIMS: Methamidophos (Meth) is a toxic organophosphorus compound (OP) that inhibits acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) and induces neurotoxicity. As the mechanism of its neurotoxic effects is not well understood, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of Meth on glutamate and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake and correlate with cell viability and AChE and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase enzyme activities in striatum and hippocampus slices exposed to low concentrations (0.05 to 1.0 muM) of Meth. MAIN METHODS: Hippocampal and striatal slices of rat brain were exposed to Meth for 5 min ([(3)H]Glutamate uptake) or 15 min ([(3)H]GABA uptake) for assays. The enzyme activities and cell viability were also accessed at both times in hippocampal and striatal slices and homogenates. KEY FINDINGS: At concentrations that did not inhibit AChE, Meth caused changes in glutamate uptake in striatal (0.05 and 1.0 muM Meth) and hippocampal (1.0 muM Meth) slices. GABA uptake was increased by the pesticide in striatum at 0.5 and 1.0 muM and in hippocampus at 0.05 muM. After 3.5h of Meth exposure, striatal and hippocampal cells showed no changes in viability as well as no inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase were observed after 5 or 15 min exposure to Meth in the same brain structures. SIGNIFICANCE: Results suggest that Meth, even without changing the AChE activity can modify somehow the neurotransmitters uptake. However, further studies are necessary to clarify if this modulation in glutamate or GABA uptake may be responsible to cause some disturbance in behavior or in other neurochemical parameters following low Meth exposure in vivo.",
