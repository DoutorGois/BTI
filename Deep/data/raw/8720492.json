     "AB": "Hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP), an undecapeptide isolated from the hippocampal tissue of young rats, enhances the cholinergic development in explant cultures of medial septal nuclei. This report concerns the distribution of HCNP immunoreactivity in the central nervous system (CNS) of 11- and 28-day-old Wistar rats; two affinity-purified anti HCNP antibodies were used. Immunoblot analyses of extracts of different regions of the brain revealed a single 23 kDa band that corresponded to the presumed HNCP precursor protein. Immunostaining of the various CNS structures of the 28-day-old rats was more intense than in those of 11-day-old animals. HCNP immunoreactivity was detected in neurons as well as in glia cells, particularly oligodendroglia. The perikarya of neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, limbic cortex, caudate, putamen, arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus, trigeminal subnuclei, rostroventrolateral reticular nucleus and dorsal horn of the spinal cord were positively stained. In addition, nerve fibers and terminals in the hypothalamic subnuclei, zona incerta, thalamic subnucleus, caudate, putamen, locus coeruleus, trigeminal subnuclei, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, dorsal horn of the spinal cord and intermediolateral column also displayed HCNP immunoreactivity. These observations would suggest that HCNP and its related molecules may have multifunctional roles in the CNS.",
