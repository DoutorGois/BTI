     "AB": "A review is given of experiments performed in the author's laboratory on slices from the rat visual cortex and hippocampus. The aim was to test the existence of the positive feedback in central synapses according to a mechanism of electrical (ephatic) linking proposed by A. L. Byzow. The hypothesis predicts that, in a subset of central synapses, artificial postsynaptic membrane potential (MP) hyperpolarization should increase the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) and potential (EPSP) not only due to a deviation from the equilibrium potential but also due to increased presynaptic transmitter release. In a part of the experiments, we found changes in several traditional parameters of transmitter release during hyperpolarization: number of response failures, coefficient of variation of response amplitude and quantal content of minimal EPSC/EPSP. The effects were especially prominent for the giant mossy fibre-CA3 synapses. For them, \"supralinear\" amplitude-voltage relations at hyperpolarized membrane potentials and voltage--dependent paired--pulse facilitation ratios were found. All these \"non-classical\" effects disappeared when composite, rather than minimal, EPSCs were evoked. These data were consistent with simulation experiments performed on the Byzov's synaptic model with the ephaptic feedback and therefore they strengthen the hypothesis. Independent of their interpretation, the data reveal a novel feedback mechanism. The mechanism provides a possibility for the central postsynaptic neurone to control the efficacy of a subset of synapses via postsynaptic MP modifications. The mechanism can essentially increase the efficacy of large (\"perforated\") synapses. It explains the significance of the increased number of such synapses following experimental challenges such as leading to induction of the long-term potentiation or to behavioural conditioning.",
