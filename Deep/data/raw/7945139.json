     "AB": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is present in the brain. It enhances glutamate release and long-term potentiation (LTP) through an action on synaptic membrane receptors sensitive to the antagonist, BN 52021, and has been proposed as a retrograde messenger in the genesis of LTP. In addition, PAF has other, metabolic actions mediated by microsomal receptors sensitive to the antagonist, BN 50730. We investigated the effect on memory of the pre- or post-training infusion of BN 52021 or BN 50730 into the hippocampus and that of BN 52021 in the amygdala and the entorhinal cortex. Male Wistar rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae aimed at these brain regions. After recovery from surgery, the animals were trained in step-down inhibitory avoidance using a 0.5-mA foot shock and tested for retention 24 h later. BN 52021 (0.5 microgram/side) was amnestic when given into the hippocampus or the amygdala either before or immediately after training but not 30 or 100 min later. BN 52021 was also amnestic when given into the entorhinal cortex 100 but not 0 or 300 min after training. Intrahippocampally administered BN 50730 had no effect on memory. The findings are compatible with the suggestion from previous findings that memory of this task depends on the generation of LTP at the time of training in hippocampus and amygdala and, 90-180 min later, in the entorhinal cortex.",
