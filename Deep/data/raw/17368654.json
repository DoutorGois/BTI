     "AB": "We measured hippocampi on baseline-, 6- and 12-month scans in a group of AD (n=36) and control subjects (n=20). We found that mean annualised atrophy rates using 6-month intervals were comparable at a group level to those generated from a 12-month interval. Higher variance was seen using shorter intervals, although this was only significant in the control group. This has implications where shorter inter-scan intervals may be advantageous, such as rapid diagnosis, and tracking of disease progression including in a clinical trial.",
