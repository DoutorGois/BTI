     "AB": "The sensitivity of prenatally protein-malnourished rats to the amnestic properties of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor agonist, chlordiazepoxide (CDP), was studied in the male offspring of rats provided with a protein-deficient diet (6% casein) for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy. Rats were tested during acquisition of the submerged platform version of the Morris water maze task using three systemic doses of CDP (3.2, 5.6, and 7.5 mg/kg i.p.) at two ages (day 30 and day 90). At 30 days, prenatally malnourished rats showed less sensitivity to the amnestic effect of the 5.6-mg/kg dose when compared with well-nourished controls by displaying shorter swim paths during acquisition and a more selective search of the target quadrant upon removal of the platform (probe trial). At 90 days, prenatally malnourished rats again showed less sensitivity to CDP at a dose of 5.6 mg/kg, but more sensitivity to the 3.2-mg/kg dose (indicated on the probe trial). No obvious relationship was identified between the nutritional group differences in behavioral sensitivity to CDP at 90 days and their BZ receptor density in the hippocampus or medial septum. It can be concluded that prenatal malnutrition alters the amnestic response to CDP in a dose-dependent and developmentally specific manner, thus providing further support for functional changes within the GABAergic system subsequent to malnutrition.",
