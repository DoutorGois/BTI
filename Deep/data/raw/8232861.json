It was demonstrated that the GM1 and GD1b gangliosides stimulate the induction and maintenance of PPTP to varying degrees and that GD1a and GT1b inhibit the phase of maintenance as compared with the active control. A conclusion was reached regarding the participation of gangliosides in the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.",
