     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide deposition into insoluble plaques is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but soluble oligomeric Abeta is considered to be more potent and has been hypothesized to directly impair learning and memory. Also, evidences from some clinical studies indicated that Abeta oligomer formation is the major cause for early AD onset. However, the biochemical mechanism involved in the oligomer-induced toxicity is not very well addressed. So, thise present study was undertaken to study the effects of single intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of protofibrillar Abeta 1-42 on the behavioral and biochemical profile in rats. METHODS: Rats were divided into two groups (n = 8 per group): (1) sham control group and (2) Abeta 1-42 injected group. A single dose of protofibrillar Abeta 1-42 (5 ul) through icv injection was bilaterally administered into the dorsal hippocampus, while sham control animals were administered with 5 microl of vehicle. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the protofibrillar Abeta significantly inhibited long-term memory retention and increased anxiety levels as shown by the behavioral studies. The amyloid deposits were present inside the brain even six weeks after injection as confirmed by thioflavin-T staining and the neurodegeneration induced by these deposits was confirmed by Nissl's staining in hippocampal and cortical regions. The amyloid aggregates induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, acetylcholinesterase activity, nitrite levels, lipid peroxidation, and inhibited antioxidant enzyme activity in hippocampus, cortex, and striatum regions of rat brain after six weeks. DISCUSSION: The present study indicated that protofibrillar Abeta 1-42 injection altered long term memory, induced anxiety-like behavior and also developed Alzheimer's disease like pathology in rats.",
