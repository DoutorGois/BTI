     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of hypercholesterolemia and sulphite on active avoidance learning. Male Wistar rats were divided into eight groups as follows: Control (C), Sulphite (S), Vitamin E (E), Sulphite + Vitamin E (SE), Hypercholesterolemia (H), Hypercholesterolemia + Sulphite (HS), Hypercholesterolemia + Vitamin E (HE), and Hypercholesterolemia + Sulphite + Vitamin E (HSE). At the end of the experimental period, the serum cholesterol level (mean +/- SD) was significantly higher in H group (111.5 +/- 11.11 mg dL(-1) ) as compared to C group (63.5 +/- 4.9 mg dL(-1) ). Levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were increased in HS group as compared to C, H, and S groups. Vitamin E reduced TBARS levels in HSE group compared with HS group. Active avoidance results indicated that hypercholesterolemia was associated with learning impairment. Our data clearly revealed that the combination of hypercholesterolemia and sulphite results in exaggerated impairment of active avoidance. Vitamin E improved active avoidance in HSE group compared with HS group. Therefore, the synergistic effect of hypercholesterolemia and sulphite may be associated with a considerable health risk.",
