     "AB": "Antisera were raised to peptides corresponding to residues 1-10 and 12-28 of the published sequence of A4 protein, a 42/43 amino acid long peptide isolated from the brains of patients with Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Immunohistochemical studies performed on sections of temporal lobe from 12 cases of Down's syndrome showed that the number of senile plaques in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus which were identified by antibody to A4(1-10) was only 23% (range 11-53%) of that recognised by antibody to A4(12-28). This observation has important consequences for both the diagnosis and the pathogenesis of Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.",
