     "AB": "AIM: To study the age-related changes of atropine (Atr), scopolamine (Sco), anisodine (AT3), and anisodamine (Ani) on behaviors and memories. METHODS: The behaviors and memories were measured with open-field test and step-through task. M-cholinergic receptors were determined by [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H] QNB). RESULTS: During acquisition session (d 1) the 18-, 28-, and 38-d-old mice pretreated with Atr, Sco, and AT3 (0.02, 0.2, 2, or 20 mg.kg-1, i.p.) in open-field test showed increase in walking counts by 26%-42%, but decrease in rearing, grooming, and defecating counts for 50%-92%, 67%-100%, and 75%-100%, respectively. On recall session (d 2) the walking and rearing behaviors in the 18- and 28-d-old mice receiving Atr, Sco, and AT3 on d 1 were higher than those in the mice receiving saline. But a lower grooming behavior on d 2 was found in the mice receiving the drugs on d 1. On d 1 Ani 20 mg.kg-1 reduced the rearing behavior by 50% in 18-d-old mice and defecation by 33%-36% in 18- and 28-d-old mice. All the 4 belladonna alkaloids increased the number of avoidance-response errors and decreased the retention latencies in step-through task. Bmax of [3H] QNB binding sites in frontal cortex and hippocampus regions in the 38-d-old mice increased 7% and 23% vs in the mice of 18 d of age, respectively. CONCLUSION: 1) The effects of the belladonna alkaloids on behaviors and memories in adult mice were weaker than those in young mice. 2) The belladonna alkaloids-induced amnesia on passive avoidance-response in step-through was more sensitive than behavioral changes and amnesia on open-field. 3) According to the lowest effective doses which insulted the behaviors or memories in young mice, Sco was about 10, 100, and 1000 times more potent than Atr, AT3, and Ani, respectively.",
