     "PG": "2997-3003",
     "AB": "Obese Zucker rats have elevated basal corticosterone levels and an increased stress response suggestive of an increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We hypothesized that altered central expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GR), mineralocorticoid receptors (MR), and/or 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11betaHSD1) contribute to these changes. In brains from young adult male rats, in situ hybridization and Western blotting showed that obese rats had normal hippocampal GR mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, in obese rats, 11betaHSD1 mRNA levels were reduced in a subpopulation of hippocampal cells in the main neuronal layers (by 37-47%, P < 0.05), whereas 11betaHSD1 levels in sparse high-expressing cells did not differ. MR mRNA was decreased in all regions of the hippocampus (by 37-49%, P < 0.05 for CA1-2 and P < 0.01 for dentate gyrus) and in frontal cortex (by 16%, P < 0.05) in obese rats. In whole hippocampal homogenates, however, neither the protein concentration of MR by Western blot nor activity of 11betaHSD1 was measurably different between the phenotypes. To test the functional importance of lower central MR expression, groups of lean and obese rats were given spironolactone before restraint stress. In vehicle-treated animals, obese rats had higher plasma corticosterone levels than lean rats after stress (by ANOVA, P < 0.05). Spironolactone markedly increased the corticosterone response in both groups, but the incremental rise was smaller in the obese rats, so that spironolactone abolished the differences between groups. We conclude that lower levels of MR, but not GR, contribute to the increased HPA activity in the obese Zucker rats and that this seems more influential during stress than in the basal state. This may be exacerbated by impaired local regeneration of corticosterone by 11betaHSD1. These abnormalities could contribute to the subtle changes in the HPA axis in rodent and human obesity.",
