     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: The association between psychotic disorders and epilepsy has been controversial. Different subtypes of psychotic disorders in epilepsy patients have been described according to temporal relationship with seizures-postictal (PIP), interictal (IIP) and bimodal (BP) psychoses are described in literature. OBJECTIVES: Determine clinical characteristics of patients with refractory partial epilepsy and psychoses and compare the results with a control group of patients with refractory partial epilepsy without psychoses. METHODS: A total of 57 patients with refractory partial epilepsy and psychotic disorders (psychotic group [PG]) and 56 patients with refractory partial epilepsy and without psychoses (control group, CG) were evaluated according to DSM-IV criteria and SCID-I. All patients underwent complete neurological, neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and psychiatric assessment. Clinical, demographic and neuroimaging data were compared between patients in CG and PG. RESULTS: In PG 15 patients (26 %) had criteria for PIP, 29 patients (51%) for IIP and 13 patients (23%) for BP. Epilepsy time duration and bilateral hippocampal sclerosis were significantly more frequent in patients with psichosis. PG patients had a longer evolution time of epilepsy and greater frequency of bilateral hippocampal sclerosis (p < 0.05). No differences were found between psychoses subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Longer evolution of seizures and the presence of bilateral hippocampal sclerosis may increase propensity to develop psychoses in patients with refractory partial epilepsy.",
