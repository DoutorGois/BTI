     "AB": "Febrile seizures (FS) are a common neurological disorder that affects children. Simple FS are thought to be benign but experimental and clinical evidence support that the risk of developing epilepsy after FS increases if the FS are prolonged and the brain is abnormal. In addition, prolonged FS (PFS) have many deleterious long-term effects characterized mainly in the hippocampus but may involve the whole brain and that prompt abortive treatment of PFS may prevent some of the adverse effects. This review focuses on some of the key factors involved in the generation of FS, factors leading to PFS and potential mechanisms and functional correlates leading to temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).",
