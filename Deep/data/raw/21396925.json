     "AB": "This study was carried out to investigate whether the congenital HCMV infection affect the induction and maintenance of LTP /DP. Rat models of Sprague-Dawley rats congenitally infected by HCMV were made. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded in the hippocampal slices of offspring rats (50-65days) to study alterations of LTP /DP in area dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus after congenital infection. The Ca(2+) and mRNA level of calmodulin (CaM) in the hippocampus neurons of the experiment group (congenital infected by HCMV) and the control group were measured;The input/output (I/O) curves of the EPSP slope PS amplitude in area DG in experiment group were significantly depressed when compared to control group (P<0.05). LTP of the EPSP slope and PS amplitude in area DG of the hippocampus was 137+/-4% (EPSP) and 225+/-11% (PS) in control rats and 115+/-9% (EPSP) and 163+/-7% (PS) in experiment rats (EPSP: F=25.29,P<0.05;PS: F=74.33 P<0.05, two-way ANOVA with Tukey test); DP of the EPSP slope and PS amplitude was 86+/-3% (EPSP) and 85+/-2% (PS) in control rats and 94+/-5% (EPSP) and 93+/-4% (PS) in congenitally infected rats (EPSP: F=5.62, P<0.05;PS: F=4.22, P<0.05, two-way ANOVA with Tukey test) . At the same time, intracellular [Ca(2+)] and mRNA level of CaM in the hippocampus neurons of the experiment group were significantly increased than that of in the controls ([Ca(2+)]: P<0.01;CaM mRNA: P<0.01) . The results demonstrate that congenital HCMV infection could reduce the range of synaptic plasticity in the Sprague-Dawley rats, which may trigger the dysfunction of learning and memory through disrupting the calcium balance.",
