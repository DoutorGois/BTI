     "AB": "Two major C-terminal variants ending at Val40 and Ala42 constitute the majority of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), which undergoes postsecretory aggregation and deposition in the Alzheimer disease (AD) brain. To probe the differential pathobiology of the two Abeta variants, we used an in vivo paradigm in which freshly solubilized Abeta1-40 or Abeta1-42 was injected into rat brains, followed by examination using Congo red birefringence, Abeta immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. In the rat brain, soluble Abeta 1-40 and Abeta1-42 formed aggregates, and the Abeta1-40 but not the Abeta1-42 aggregates showed Congo red birefringence. Electron microscopy revealed that the Abeta1-40 aggregates contained fibrillar structures similar to the amyloid fibrils of AD, whereas the Abeta1-42 aggregates contained nonfibrillar amorphous material. Preincubation of Abeta1-42 solution in vitro led to the formation of birefringent aggregates, and after injection of the preincubated Abeta1-42, the aggregates remained birefringent in the rat brain. Thus, a factor or factors might exist in the rat brain that inhibit the fibrillar assembly of soluble Abeta1-42. To analyze the postsecretory processing of Abeta, we used the same in vivo paradigm and showed that Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 were processed at their N termini to yield variants starting at pyroglutamate, and at their C termini to yield variants ending at Val40 and at Val39. Thus the normal rat brain could produce enzymes that mediate the conversion of Abeta 1-40/1-42 into processed variants similar to those in AD. This experimental paradigm may facilitate efforts to elucidate mechanisms of Abeta deposition evolving into amyloid plaques in AD.",
