     "AB": "Changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mediated signaling in the hippocampus have been implicated in the etiology of depression and in the mode of action of antidepressant drugs. There is also evidence from animal studies to suggest that BDNF-induced changes in the hippocampus may play a role in another stress-related pathology: anxiety. However, it is still unknown whether this neurotrophin plays a differential role in defensive responses associated with distinguished subtypes of anxiety disorders found in the clinic, such as generalized anxiety and panic disorder. In the present study, we investigated the effect of an acute BDNF injection into the rat dorsal hippocampus (DH) on inhibitory avoidance acquisition and escape expression measured in the elevated T-maze (ETM). We also assessed whether serotonergic neurotransmission may account for such effects. Intra-DH BDNF injection (200 pg) facilitated inhibitory avoidance in ETM. BDNF was equally anxiogenic in the light/dark transition test. Preadministration of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 fully counteracted the anxiogenic effect of BDNF in both tests. Intra-DH midazolam administration (10 nmol) impaired avoidance acquisition in ETM, suggesting an anxiolytic effect. Therefore, in the DH, facilitation of BDNF signaling seems to enhance 5-HT1A receptor-mediated neurotransmission to exert an anxiogenic effect associated with generalized anxiety.",
