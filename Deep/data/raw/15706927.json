     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe inhibiting effect of CGE (compound ginseng extract) on increased expression of IL-1beta and c-fos protein following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. METHOD: The vascular dementia model was made by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 hours. Expression of IL-1beta and c-fos were determined by immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus regions in brain tissue at the 0.5 h-7 d after reperfusion. CGE was diluted by CMC and poured into the stomach by 0.7 mL x (100 g)(-1) with a high dosage (19.34 x 10(3) g x L(-1) row herbs), a middle dosage (9.67 x 10(3) g x L(-1)), a low dosage (4.83 x 10(3) g x L(-1)). There were an IL-1ra (rhIL-1ra 20 microg injected into the left cerebral ventricle), a sham operation (NaCl 20 microL injected into the left cerebral ventricle) and a model as control. RESULT: Compared with control group, three dose groups (low, middle and high) in CGE showed significant inhibiting effects on the expression of c-fos protein at 2, 3, 4, 12 hours and 3 day following cerebral ischaemic-reperfusion. The level of the inhibiting effects in small and middle groups were lower at all time points than that in IL-1ra group (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). CGE inhibited the expression of hippocampus IL-1beta protein, taking effect from the 2 h after reperfusion. Both HD group (531 +/- 151.1) and MD group (589.3 +/- 78.6) showed more obvious effect which lasted until the 72 h compared with the model group (687.6 +/- 116.7) (P < 0.01 and 0.05). Large dose group (81.3 +/- 16.1) showed the same level of the inhibiting effect on expression of c-fos protein as IL-1ra group (67.2 +/- 25.7) from 4 hour on following cerebral ischaemic reperfusion (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: CGE with function of Yiqi Bushen, Huoxue Huatan has effect of inhibiting up-regulated expression of IL-1beta and c-fos protein following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. However, this effect of CGE starts relatively later than that of IL-1ra. The effect of CGE is associated with its dosage, i.e. a larger dosage has a better effect on expression of c-fos protein in post-stroke dementia.",
