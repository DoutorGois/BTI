     "AB": "The adult mammalian brain harbors a population of neural stem cells (NSCs) that are responsible for persistent neurogenesis in the olfactory system and hippocampus and may also play a role in tumorigenesis. Here, the authors review the evidence that NSCs within the adult brain are a special type of astrocyte. In addition, the authors examine the phylogenetic and ontogenetic relations between this astrocyte stem cell and related members of the astrocyte family. Finally, the authors compare and contrast the functional characteristics of NSCs and hematopoietic stem cells and review the potential oncogenic transformation of astrocyte NSCs that may underlie brain tumorigenesis as seen in glioblastoma and other primary brain tumors.",
