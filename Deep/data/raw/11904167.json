     "AB": "The occurrence of the novel proposed endocannabinoid, noladin ether (2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether, 2-AGE) in various rat organs and brain regions, and its inactivation by intact C6 glioma cells, were studied. 2-AGE was measured by isotope dilution liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry, with a detection limit of 100 fmol. A compound with the same mass and chromatographic/chemical properties as 2-AGE was found in whole brain, with the highest amounts in the thalamus and hippocampus. Synthetic [(3)H]2-AGE was inactivated by intact rat C6 glioma cells by a time- and temperature-dependent process consisting of cellular uptake and partial incorporation into phospholipids. Further data suggested that 2-AGE is taken up by cells via the anandamide/2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) membrane transporter(s), and biosynthesized in a different way as compared to 2-AG.",
