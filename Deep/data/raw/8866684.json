     "AB": "Patient EDS presented with an amnesic disorder of insidious onset (4 years) that remained stable and restricted to memory functions over a 10-year course. Repeated neuropsychological evaluations over 6 years showed a moderate-to-severe, stable impairment of long-term memory and of memory for public events, and a milder, stable impairment of autobiographic memory and of short-term memory. Language, perception, praxis and 'frontal' functions were fully preserved. MRI showed atrophy of the right hippocampus, of the right mammillary body and of the sylvian fissure (bilaterally, but more marked on the left). On PET scan, metabolic activity in the mesial temporal structures was significantly reduced on the right and was at lower normal levels on the left. The disorder observed in EDS is similar to that recently reported in other patients. Possible etiologies of the selective amnesia observed in EDS are considered and their implications discussed.",
