     "AB": "Pregnant rats were treated with 0.4% lead acetate through drinking water from 6th day of gestation and this treatment was continued till 21 post natal days (PND). Four regions of the brain namely hippocampus, cerebellum, frontal cortex and brain stem were dissected at 10, 20, 30 and 40 PND for estimation of lipid peroxidation products (LPP), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The results indicate that there was a significant (P < 0.05) increase of LPP in exposed rats than their corresponding control at 10, 20 and 30 PND both in hippocampus and cerebellum. At PND 40, the LPP of control and exposed were found to be almost same in both the tissues indicating recovery from lead toxicity. CAT activity was significantly (P < 0.05) high in hippocampus of exposed rats up to PND 30 but up to PND 20 in cerebellum and frontal cortex. However, in brain stem, a significant (P < 0.05) increase in CAT activity was observed only at PND 10. A significant (P < 0.05) increase in SOD activity was observed up to PND 30 both in hippocampus and cerebellum on lead exposure. Frontal cortex exhibited a similar significant (P < 0.05) increase of SOD activity up to PND 20 and for brain stem up to PND 10. There was no significant change in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (CAT and SOD) and LPP in all the four brain tissues of control and exposed rats at PND 40 indicating recovery from lead-induced oxidative stress.",
