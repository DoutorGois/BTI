     "AB": "Growth cone collapse is an easy and efficient test for detecting and characterizing axon guidance activities secreted or expressed by cells. It can also be used to dissect signaling pathways by axon growth inhibitors and to isolate therapeutic compounds that promote axon regeneration. Here, we describe a growth cone collapse assay protocol used to study signal transduction mechanisms of the repulsive axon guidance molecule ephrin-A5 in hippocampal neurons.",
