     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of acupuncture in delaying aging. METHODS: Using SAMP10 mice and normal control SAMR1 as model and applying RT-PCR and DIG probed Northern blot techniques to observe expression of NF-E2, YB-1, LRG47 genes in whole brain, cortex and hippocampus in the 8-month SAMR1 control group, 8-month SAMP10 control group, 8-month SAMP10 acupuncture group and 8-month SAMP10 non-point acupuncture group. RESULTS: In the SAMP10 control group, the expression of NF-E2, YB-1 and LRG47 were down-regulated in the whole brain, cortex and hippocampus, and after acupuncture they were up-regulated and tended to normal. CONCLUSION: Aging of the SAMP10 mouse brain is related with expression of NF-E2, YB-1 and LRG47 genes, and acupuncture can regulate the expression of NF-E2, YB-1 and LRG47 genes, improving the functions of erythrocyte series, increasing proliferation of cells and immune function of cells in anti-bacteria, hence anti-aging.",
