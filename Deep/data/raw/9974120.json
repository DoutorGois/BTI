     "AB": "In the present study we investigated whether nitroflurbiprofen (NFP) or nitro-aspirin can reduce the inflammatory response induced by continuous infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the fourth ventricular space of the rat's brain for 30 days. The chronic LPS infusion produced an extensive inflammation that was particularly evident in the hippocampus, subiculum and entorhinal and piriform cortices. Daily peripheral administration of NFP dose-dependently, and significantly, attenuated the brain inflammation as indicated by the decreased density and reactive state of microglial cells. Daily peripheral administration of nitro-aspirin also attenuated the brain inflammation, but to a much lesser degree than NFP. The results demonstrated that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could reduce brain inflammation and that NFP is an effective anti-inflammatory agent.",
