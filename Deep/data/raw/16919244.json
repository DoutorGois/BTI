     "AB": "We have examined the effects of melatonin on synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the Schaffer Collateral-CA1 and the mossy fiber-CA3 pathways in mouse hippocampus brain slices. Melatonin (0.1-1 mM) application had different actions on both the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPS) and LTP in the CA1 as compared to the CA3. In CA1, 0.1 mM melatonin blocked LTP, while 1 mM melatonin also depressed the fEPSP. In CA3, neither 0.1 nor 1 mM melatonin altered the fEPSP, whereas both concentrations only slightly reduced LTP. These results demonstrate that melatonin significantly alters synaptic transmission and LTP in the CA1 but has only modest actions in CA3.",
