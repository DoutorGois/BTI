     "AB": "Angiotensin II and eledoisin modulate drinking behaviour in rats that is mediated by monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons. In the present study we have shown that combined intracerebroventricular injections of either 0.1 or 1.0 microgram doses of angiotensin and eledoisin resulted in a decrease of about 25-35% in activities of choline acetyltransferase, ATP-citrate lyase in the hippocampus. In addition, 1 microgram quantities of these peptides depressed activity of carnitine acetyltransferase but did not alter activity of acetylcholinesterase. On the other hand, the application of 0.1 microgram of angiotensin caused no change in activity of monoamine oxidase A, while 1.0 microgram dose brought about its 67% activation. Eledoisin abolished this effect of angiotensin II. These data provide evidence that angiotensin II and eledoisin evoke non related adaptive changes in cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons of the hippocampus.",
