     "AB": "Neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine treatment of male Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in a large depletion of noradrenaline 84-87 days later, as demonstrated by an 82% reduction in the intra-synaptosomal deamination of [14C]noradrenaline within noradrenergic synaptosomes with only marginal effects upon the extrasynaptosomal deamination. The hippocampal stimulation of inositol phospholipid breakdown by noradrenaline was, however, unaffected by the neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine treatment.",
