     "AB": "Field potentials were recorded in the prelimbic cortex of anaesthetized rats after excitations of the hippocampo-prefrontal pathway. Stimuli were delivered to the hippocampal CA1 region and short-term changes of field potential amplitudes were observed in two situations. (1) Amplitudes were monitored during trains of stimulations given at frequencies between 1 and 20 Hz. Within trains, potentiation was followed by depression. Both types of changes were frequency dependent. (2) The time course of recovery from within-train plasticity was obtained from field potentials evoked at varying intervals after trains. This revealed a post-train potentiation having a maximum after 2-4 s and lasting for approximately 10 s. The maximal post-train potentiation was nearly independent of the frequency of the preceding train.",
