     "AB": "DNA cis-acting elements involved in gene regulation may actively contribute to adaptation processes because they are submitted to lower evolutionary constraints than coding DNA. In this regard, comparisons of the mechanisms underlying basal and regulated Gnrhr expression have revealed some features that promote stable and consistent Gnrhr expression in pituitary gonadotroph cells in different species. The presence of two divergent SF1 (NR5A1) response elements in all analysed mammalian Gnrhr promoters probably comprises one of the features that ensures reliable expression in the pituitary. By contrast, in other tissues, such as the hippocampus and testis, our analyses revealed dissimilar levels of Gnrhr expression among species. Indeed, Gnrhr was consistently expressed after birth in the rat but not the mouse hippocampus. Similar discrepancies were observed in foetal and adult testes. The ability of the rat promoter to drive reporter gene expression in the hippocampus and testis of transgenic mice just as it naturally directs the expression of the endogenous Gnrhr in rats strongly suggests that regulatory DNA sequences contained species-specific instructions prevailing over other controls. The major conclusion emerging from these studies is that Gnrhr promoter sequences are mainly responsible for directing transcriptional programmes and play a predominant role over the species-specific cell environment.",
