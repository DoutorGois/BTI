     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The multifunctional mitochondrial enzyme 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 could play a role in the development of Alzheimer disease via its high-affinity binding to amyloid-beta peptides and its overexpression. METHODS: We evaluated the specificity of alterations in mRNA/enzyme expression levels in human right and left hippocampi. RESULTS: We observed a trend towards right/left laterality in nondemented nonpsychotic controls; however, the degree of asymmetry was higher for mRNA when compared to enzyme expression levels. In Alzheimer disease and schizophrenia, significant shifts to left/right asymmetry were found and the changes were associated with more marked increases in mRNA/enzyme expression in the left hemisphere. On the other hand, no alterations were observed in people with multi-infarct dementia. CONCLUSION: Our results support studies reporting an impairment of mitochondria in Alzheimer disease or schizophrenia and a higher vulnerability of the dominant hemisphere to pathological processes. Overexpression of the enzyme could be used to distinguish Alzheimer disease from multi-infarct dementia.",
