     "AB": "In human temporal lobe epilepsy, seizures can begin in the hippocampus, amygdala, or surrounding cortical areas. Histologically, the seizure-induced selective neuronal damage and synaptic reorganization are best documented in the hippocampus. Little information is available about the damage in the other temporal lobe structures or whether the distribution of damage depends on the location of the primary seizure focus. We used an amygdala-kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy to study whether seizures of amygdaloid origin cause damage to the amygdala and hippocampus. All rats experienced five class 5 generalized seizures. Neuronal damage was assessed by counting the density of GABA-immunoreactive (GABA-ir) and somatostatin-immunoreactive (SOM-ir) neurons in the amygdala and hilus of the dentate gyrus six months after the last seizure. We found that the density of GABA-ir neurons did not differ from that in controls in the contralateral amygdala. The density of SOM-ir neurons was, however, decreased in the lateral (69% of neurons remaining, P < 0.01), basal (67% remaining, P < 0.05), and accessory basal (68% remaining, P < 0.05) nuclei. In the hilus, the densities of GABA-ir and SOM-ir neurons were similar to that in controls. According to our data, a few seizures of amygdaloid origin may cause more severe damage to SOM-ir neurons in the amygdala than in the hilus. Such decrease in SOM-ir neurons which form one subpopulation of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons may increase the local excitability in the amygdala and, therefore, contribute to epileptogenesis.",
