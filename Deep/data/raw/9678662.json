     "AB": "Previous studies have demonstrated that stimulation of the ventral hippocampal (VH) formation (including the ventral CA1 and subicular areas) elicits increased locomotor activity in rats. The locomotor-activating effects of VH stimulation have been hypothesized to be mediated via hippocampal output to cortical and subcortical dopamine (DA) systems. This study examined whether increased locomotor activity produced by VH stimulation was blocked by pretreatment with a DA receptor antagonist, and whether DA metabolism in subdivisions of the nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen, and prefrontal cortex was elevated by VH stimulation. Stimulation of the VH (defined as the ventral CA1 and its borders, ventral subiculum, and entorhinal cortex) with the cholinergic agonist carbachol was found to elevate locomotor activity, while pretreatment with the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol blocked this effect. Stimulation of the VH did not alter DA metabolism (i.e., ratio of the DA metabolites DOPAC or HVA/DA) in any of the brain regions studied. These results indicate that the increased locomotor activity elicited by VH stimulation is not associated with dramatic increases in DA metabolism, but that it does require tonic activation of D2 receptors.",
