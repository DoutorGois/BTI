     "AB": "In vasogenic brain edema, the neurotoxicity of extravasated serum components may contribute to neuronal damage. In the hippocampal CA1 sector and striatum, the neurotoxicity of serum was investigated. Rat serum was prepared as follows: Serum-1: whole serum, Serum-2: ultrafiltrated through a membrane with cut-off at molecular weight (MW) 100,000. Serum-3: through a membrane with cut-off at MW 20,000, and Serum-4: through a membrane with cut-off at MW 5,000. The infusion edema model was utilized for infusion of autologous serum into the brain. The brain tissue was histologically evaluated. The level of glutamate, total protein, and albumin was also measured in the sera used for infusion. The following results were obtained: 1) CA1 neurons were more vulnerable to all infused sera than striatal neurons, 2) there was a strong cellular response in the striatal site of infusion, but only a minimal in the CA1-sector, 3) the severity of damage of CA1 correlated with the glutamate concentrations of the infused sera, 4) further, there was a relationship between the degree of striatal neuronal loss and the amount of protein and albumin present in the infusate. It is, therefore, concluded that the neurotoxic properties of vasogenic edema fluid are also affected by specific features of the brain region of its extravasation. In addition, the pathological mechanisms associated with irreversible damage of neurons might be different in the CA1-sector and the striatum.",
