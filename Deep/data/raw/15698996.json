     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of streptozotocin (STZ) on the expressions of Abeta and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in rat brain. METHODS: Twenty-four adult SD rats were randomized into 2 groups to receive ICV of STZ bilaterally at the dose of 3 mg/kg (with the injection repeated on day 3) or normal saline injection in an identical manner. Twenty-one days later, the expressions of Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42), tau(202), tau(396) and tau(404) were investigated immunohistochemically. RESULTS: After STZ administration, the expressions of Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42), tau(202), tau(396) and tau(404) increased in both the cortex and hippocampus in the rat brain. CONCLUSION: ICV injection of STZ increases the expression of Abeta and promotes hyerphosphorylation of tau protein.",
