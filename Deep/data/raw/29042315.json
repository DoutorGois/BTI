     "AB": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines can affect cognitive processes such as learning and memory. Particularly, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) influences hippocampus-dependent memories. We previously reported that administration of IL-1beta in dorsal hippocampus impaired contextual fear memory reconsolidation. This effect was reversed by the melanocortin alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). Our results also demonstrated that IL-1beta produced a significant decrease in glutamate release from dorsal hippocampus synaptosomes after reactivation of the fear memory. Therefore, we investigated whether IL-1beta administration can affect GluA1 AMPA subunit phosphorylation, surface expression, and total expression during reconsolidation of a contextual fear memory. Also, we studied the modulatory effect of alpha-MSH. We found that IL-1beta reduced phosphorylation of this subunit at Serine 831 and Serine 845 60 min after contextual fear memory reactivation. The intrahippocampal administration of IL-1beta after memory reactivation also induced a decrease in surface expression and total expression of GluA1. alpha-MSH prevented the effect of IL-1beta on GluA1 phosphorylation in Serine 845, but not in Serine 831. Moreover, treatment with alpha-MSH also prevented the effect of the cytokine on GluA1 surface and total expression after memory reactivation. Our results demonstrated that IL-1beta regulates phosphorylation of GluA1 and may thus play an important role in modulation of AMPAR function and synaptic plasticity in the brain. These findings further illustrate the importance of IL-1beta in cognition processes dependent on the hippocampus, and also reinforced the fact that alpha-MSH can reverse IL-1beta effects on memory reconsolidation.",
