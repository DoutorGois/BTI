     "AB": "To assess the effects of the novel sigma receptor ligand JO 1784 ((+)-N-cyclopropyl-methyl-N-methyl-1,4-diphenyl-1-yl-but-3-en-1-ylami ne, hydrochloride or igmesine hydrochloride) on behavioural and histological changes following cerebral ischaemia, the gerbil model of cerebral ischaemia was used. Two experiments were carried out. In the first animals were either sham operated, subjected to 5 min of bilateral carotid occlusion or administered JO 1784 (25, 50, 75 or 100 mg/kg p.o.) 1, 24 and 48 h after 5 min bilateral carotid occlusion and histological evaluation carried out 96 h after surgery. In the second experiment the effects of JO 1784 administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg i.p. 30 min, 6, 24 and 48 h post-surgery on home cage activity and nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity in the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and brain stem 4 days after surgery was examined. Extensive neuronal death was observed in the CA1 region of 5 min occluded animals. JO 1784 (50, 75 and 100 mg/kg) provided significant protection against this ischaemia-induced cell death (P < 0.03-0.005). In the second experiment a large increase in home cage activity was observed for 5 min occluded animals for 12 h after surgery (P = 0.0018-0.02). A large increase in NO synthase activity was observed in all brain regions for 5 min occluded animals. Post-administration of JO 1784 attenuated the ischaemia-induced hyperactivity and increased NO synthase activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
