     "AB": "Increased but transient expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos has been recently reported in metrazol and kindling-induced seizures. Here we tested whether kainic acid-induced status epilepticus may result in a long-term increase of this oncogene. A specific pattern of immunoreactive c-fos material was observed with the development of the seizures. Intense labeling first appeared in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. Pyramidal cell layer CA3, CA4 and CA1 as well as other limbic structures were then positively stained during status epilepticus. In addition, the duration of c-fos expression was different according to the anatomical sites. In the dentate gyrus labeling did not exceed 4-5 h whereas the pyramidal cell layer CA1 exhibited increased c-fos expression for as long as 24 h. Here we propose that c-fos which has been related to growth and differentiation in previous studies, could be involved in processes inducing long-term plastic alterations in the limbic system.",
