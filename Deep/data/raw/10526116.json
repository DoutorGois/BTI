     "AB": "AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptors, in cerebral cortex, underwent upregulation (35% increase) following chronic blockade with a non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, GYKI 52466 (1-(aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7, 8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine). Such upregulation did not alter basal cerebrocortical blood flow or O(2) consumption. There was a much higher increase in blood flow and O(2) consumption in the upregulated, agonist (AMPA) stimulated cortices of anesthetized rats.",
