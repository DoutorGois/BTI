     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: 18F-(-)-NCFHEB (also known as 18F-(-)-Flubatine) is a new radioligand to image alpha4beta2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET), with faster kinetics than previous radioligands such as 18F-2-F-A85380. The goal of this study was to assess the sensitivity of 18F-(-)-NCFHEB-PET to increases in synaptic acetylcholine concentration induced by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. METHODS: Two rhesus monkeys were scanned four times each on a Focus 220 scanner: first at baseline, then during two bolus plus infusions of physostigmine (0.06-0.28 mg/kg), and finally following a bolus injection of donepezil (0.25 mg/kg). The arterial input function and the plasma free fraction fP were measured. 18F-(-)-NCFHEB volume of distribution VT was estimated using the multilinear analysis MA1 and then normalized by plasma free fraction fP . RESULTS: 18F-(-)-NCFHEB fP was 0.89+/-0.04. At baseline, 18F-(-)-NCFHEB VT /fP ranged from 7.9+/-1.3 mL plasma/cm3 tissue in the cerebellum to 34.3+/-8.4 mL plasma/cm3 tissue in the thalamus. Physostigmine induced a dose-dependent reduction of 18F-(-)-NCFHEB VT /fP of 34+/-9% in the putamen, 32+/-8% in the thalamus, 25+/-8% in the cortex, and 23+/-10% in the hippocampus. With donepezil, 18F-(-)-NCFHEB VT /fP was reduced by 24+/-2%, 14+3% and 14+/-5%, 10+/-6% in the same regions. CONCLUSION: 18F-(-)-NCFHEB can be used to detect changes in synaptic acetylcholine concentration and is a promising tracer to study acetylcholine dynamics with shorter scan durations than previous radioligands.",
