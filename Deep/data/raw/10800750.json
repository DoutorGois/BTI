     "AB": "1. The modifications of hippocampal release of norepinephrine following the administration of R-(-)-alpha-methylhistamine and thioperamide, respectively agonist and antagonist of histamine H3 receptors, were assessed in freely moving rats by microdialysis. 2. Both the systemic (2 mg/kg i.p.) and local (100 microM via the probe) administration of thioperamide caused no modifications of basal release, indicating that the histaminergic system is not tonically involved in regulating the hippocampal noradrenergic activity. 3. R-(-)-alpha-methylhistamine (1 and 100 microM) produced a slight, short-lasting and dose-dependent reduction of norepinephrine release antagonized by local perfusion (100 microM) and prevented by systemic administration of thioperamide 2 mg/kg. 4. The results seem to indicate that the modulation of norepinephrine release through presynaptic H3-receptors in the rat hippocampus plays a minor role in the memory-enhancing effects of thioperamide.",
