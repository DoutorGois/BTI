     "AB": "Patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) show structural and functional abnormalities in hippocampus and surrounding mesial temporal structures. Brain signal complexity appears to be a marker of functional integrity or capacity. We examined complexity in 8 patients with intracranial hippocampal electrodes during performance of memory tasks (scene encoding and recognition) known to be sensitive to mesial temporal integrity. Our patients were shown to have right mesial temporal seizure onsets, permitting us to evaluate both epileptogenic (right) and healthy (left) hippocampi. Using multiscale entropy (MSE) as a measure of complexity, we found that iEEG from the epileptogenic hippocampus showed less complexity than iEEG from the healthy hippocampus. This difference was reliable for encoding but not for recognition. Our results indicate that both functional integrity and cognitive demands influence hippocampal signal complexity.",
