It is concluded that anxiolytic effect dissociation revealed in different anxiety tests, are stipulated by serotonin and its agonists due to nucleus raphe and hippocampus chemical stimulation my suggest their different neurochemical contribution and nonserotoninergic component involved in the mechanism of 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine derivative anxiolytic action.",
