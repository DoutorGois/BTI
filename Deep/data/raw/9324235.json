     "AB": "The characteristics of short-term potentiation (STP) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices were determined at various times following exposure to acute stress produced by restraint and tail-shock in mice. In slices prepared from control animals, theta-burst stimulation resulted in a large increase in evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) amplitude and slope that remained stable at least up to 30 min after stimulation. Slices prepared 1 h after stress exhibited a marked decrease in the extent of both STP and LTP. STP and LTP magnitude were still significantly decreased 24 h after stress exposure and were completely restored to control levels by 48 h. These results provide evidence for a reversible impairment of STP and LTP in CA1 following an acute episode of stress, and suggest that stress activates processes different from those activated by LTP-inducing stimuli.",
