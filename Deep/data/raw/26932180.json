     "AB": "Ketamine is widely used as an anesthetic in pediatric clinical practice. However, numerous studies have reported that exposure to ketamine during the developmental period induces neurotoxicity. Here we investigate the neuroprotective effects of baicalin, a natural flavonoid compound, against ketamine-induced apoptotic neurotoxicity in the cortex and hippocampus of the Sprague-Dawley postnatal day 7 (PND7) rat pups. Our results revealed that five continuous injections of ketamine (20 mg/kg) at 90-min intervals over 6 h induced obvious morphological damages of neuron by Nissl staining and apoptosis by TUNEL assays in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of PND7 rat pups. Baicalin (100 mg/kg) pretreatment alleviated ketamine-induced morphological change and apoptosis. Caspase-3 activity and caspase-3 mRNA expression increase induced by ketamine were also inhibited by baicalin treatment. LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, abrogated the effect of baicalin against ketamine-induced caspase-3 activity and caspase-3 mRNA expression increase. In addition, Western blot studies indicated that baicalin not only inhibited ketamine-induced p-Akt and p-GSK-3beta decrease, but also relieved ketamine-induced p-CREB and BDNF expression decrease. Baicalin also attenuated ketamine-induced Bcl-2/Bax decrease and caspase-3 expression increase. Further in vitro experiments proved that baicalin mitigated ketamine-induced cell viability decrease in the MTT assay, morphological change by Rosenfeld's staining, and caspase-3 expression increase by Western blot in the primary neuron-glia mixed cultures. LY294002 abrogated the protective effect of baicalin. These data demonstrate that baicalin exerts neuroprotective effect against ketamine-induced neuronal apoptosis by activating the PI3K/Akt and its downstream CREB/BDNF/Bcl-2 signaling pathways. Therefore, baicalin appears to be a promising agent in preventing or reversing ketamine's apoptotic neurotoxicity at an early developmental stage.",
