     "AB": "Stressful aggressive interaction stimulates central serotonergic activation in telencephalon as well as brainstem. Social roles can be distinguished by monoamine activity following aggression. Pairs of male lizards, Anolis carolinensis, were allowed to fight and form dominant/subordinate relationships. In micropunched regions of telencephalon, the greatest serotonergic changes occur in subordinate males. In hippocampal cortex and nucleus accumbens, subordinate males have increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid/serotonin at 1 h following the fight. In these areas the ratio gradually decreases over a week of cohabitation, as was previously reported for brainstem. Medial and lateral amygdala develop increased serotonergic activity more slowly, with the greatest increase being evident following a week of interaction. Turnover, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels in amygdala escalate over the first week of interaction in subordinate males, and return to baseline by one month. In dominant males, the pattern is accelerated, with the most extensive serotonin system activity present at 1 h, then decreasing over a month. The patterns of serotonergic activation are so similar in hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and brainstem that a co-ordinated response may be involved in mediating short-term social stress and aggression. Similarly, medial and lateral amygdala exhibit corresponding, but delayed patterns in subordinate males, suggesting a co-ordinated response in these regions mediating longer-term stress responses. These data are consistent with rapid neuroendocrine stress modulation in dominant individuals, and delayed serotonergic activity changes in subordinate males.",
