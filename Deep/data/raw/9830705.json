     "AB": "A model with intermediate complexity is introduced to reproduce the basic firing modes of the CA3 pyramidal cell. Our model consists of a single compartment, has two variables (membrane potential and internal calcium concentration), and involves two separate stages for interspike mechanisms and firing. Interspike dynamics is governed by voltage- and calcium-dependent ionic channels but no channel kinetics are provided. This model is suitable to be included in our statistical population model (Part II, following paper). Bifurcation analysis reveals that interspike dynamics rather than sodium firing has the dominant role in the control of bursting/nonbursting behavior.",
