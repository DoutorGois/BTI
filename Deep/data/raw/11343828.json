     "AB": "Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury in neonatal mice is associated with significant cell loss in hippocampus, striatum and deep layers of the cortex. The pattern of cell death in hippocampus after a moderate focal ischemic-global hypoxic insult is studied through morphologic changes in dying neurons at both the light and ultrastructural levels. Light microscopy at 24 h showed a number of injured neurons, as evidenced by dark, round, condensed nuclei, primarily in CA1 through CA3. Nuclei appeared punctate and cytoplasm vacuolated. Electron microscopy revealed that the punctate appearance of the nuclei corresponded to clumped chromatin. At 7 days after HI, injured neurons were shrunken and had a uniformly dark, angular appearance. While dying cells had an appearance consistent with apoptosis on light microscopy, cells were neither necrotic nor apoptotic at the ultrastructural level.",
