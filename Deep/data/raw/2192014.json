     "AB": "DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr = 32,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) is a neuronal phosphoprotein that is enriched in neurons which possess dopamine D1 receptors, particularly striatonigral neurons. In rat brain slices, the phosphorylation state of DARPP-32 is regulated by dopamine, acting through the dopamine D1 receptor and the adenylyl cyclase system. This study reports that chronic blockade (21 days) of either dopamine D1 receptors by SCH-23390 or dopamine D2 receptors by raclopride does not affect the concentrations of DARPP-32 in specific rat brain regions (striatum, thalamus, hippocampus, frontal cerebral cortical pole). Northern blot analysis indicates that the steady-state level of DARPP-32 mRNA in striatum is also unchanged by these treatments.",
