     "AB": "Interaction of neighboring cells of hippocampus (CA1 area) and neocortical parietotemporal area was compared by plotting histograms of crosscorrelation in active and passive rabbits exposed to emotionally significant stimuli. The interaction of hippocampal neurons depended on the character of behavioral reactions. In active rabbits, the greatest changes (as compared to baseline) were observed during active orienting exploratory or defensive reaction. In passive animals, the greatest changes ocurred during freezing. In all states common inputs to neurons were more frequently observed in the hippocampus of passive rabbits, whereas excitatory connections with short delays (to 40 ms) more frequently appeared in active rabbits. Interaction of neocortical neurons to a lesser degree depended on the character of behavioral reactions and behavioral strategy of animals. The result testify to individual typological features in information processing in area CA1 of hippocampus of active and passive animals in negative emotional situations.",
