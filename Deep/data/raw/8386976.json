     "AB": "Percent recovery of CA1 field EPSP amplitude following various anoxic aglycemic (AA) periods was examined in rat hippocampal slices superfused with MK-801 (0.1 microM, 1 microM, 10 microM) or Mg(2+)-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Slices treated with 0.1 microM MK-801 showed greater percent recuperation of EPSP amplitude following 3 min 30 s of AA (36 +/- 12% vs 6 +/- 4% in controls). Higher concentrations of MK-801 resulted in a greater recovery of EPSP amplitudes in more than one time period of AA, with 10 microM MK-801 providing protection in up to 4 min 30 s AA. Percent recuperation of EPSP amplitude was smaller in Mg(2+)-free slices following 2 min (34 +/- 15% vs 81 +/- 11% in controls) and 2 min 30 (25 +/- 14% vs 77 +/- 10% in controls) of AA. These results suggest that the activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channel may contribute to irreversible AA induced synaptic failure in CA1.",
