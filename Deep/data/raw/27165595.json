     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of cyclooxygenase -2 selective inhibitor celecoxib on the expression of major vault protein ( MVP) in the brain of rats with status epilepticus and its possible roles in the treatment of refractory epilepsy. METHODS: Sixty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to blank control (n=16), epilepsy model (n=22) and celecoxib treatment groups (n=22). After the status epilepticus was induced in rats by injecting lithium and pilocarpine, each group had 16 rats enrolled as subjects. Immunohistochemical method and Western blot method were used to detect the expression of MVP in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. RESULTS: The expression of MVP was significantly higher in the epilepsy model group than in the control group (P<0.01). The expression of MVP in the celecoxib treatment group was significantly decreased compared with the epilepsy model group, but it was still higher than in the control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Celecoxib could decrease the expression of MVP in brain tissue of rats with status epilepticus, suggesting that it is promising for the treatment of intractable epilepsy.",
