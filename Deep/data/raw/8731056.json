     "AB": "The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of the excitatory amino acid receptor has been implicated in several kinds of learning and memory, as well as in long-term potentiation (LTP), a putative cellular mechanism for learning and memory. This experiment examined the role of the NMDA receptor in patterned single-alternation (PSA) learning in preweanling rats following intraperitoneal injections of 0.05 mg/kg MK-801, a selective NMDA antagonist. MK-801 significantly inhibited PSA at both 60-s and 30-s intertrial intervals (ITIs), and attenuated, but did not block, learning at 8-s ITI. These results are compared with effects on PSA, a form of nonspatial, memory-based learning, observed after early postnatal exposure to alcohol, infant hippocampal lesions, and infant exposure to X-irradiation, and they add strongly to these earlier demonstrations of the role of the hippocampus in learning and memory that is clearly nonspatial and non-cognitive-map-related.",
