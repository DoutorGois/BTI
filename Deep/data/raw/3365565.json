     "AB": "Injection of salmon calcitonin into the lateral ventricle or the cisterna magna was reported to potently inhibit gastric lesions induced by cold restraint stress. The forebrain sites of action were investigated using unilateral microinjection of salmon calcitonin prior to exposing conscious pylorus-ligated rats to cold restraint stress for 2 hr. Calcitonin (100 ng), microinjected in 100 nl volume by pressure ejection from glass micropipette positioned into the lateral or ventromedial hypothalamus or the paraventricular nucleus, prevented the development of gastric lesions whereas microinjections into the caudate putamen, the cerebral cortex or the hippocampus were ineffective. The antiulcerogenic effect of lateral hypothalamic injection was dose dependent and specific since calcitonin gene-related peptide, tested under the same conditions, had no effect. Microinjection of calcitonin at 100 ng dose into the ventromedial hypothalamus did not modify gastric secretion whereas microinjection into the lateral hypothalamus or the paraventricular nucleus induced 75-82% inhibition of gastric acid output in pylorus-ligated rats exposed to restraint stress. These results demonstrate that the hypothalamus including the lateral, ventromedial and paraventricular nuclei are responsive sites of action for calcitonin-induced inhibition of cold restraint stress ulcers. The antiulcerogenic effect may be related to suppression of gastric acid secretion along with other mechanisms that remain to be elucidated.",
