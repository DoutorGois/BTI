     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is essential for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), a non-conventional neurotransmitter with an important role in synaptic plasticity underlying processes of hippocampus-dependent memory and in the regulation of biological clocks and circadian rhythms. Many studies have shown that both the NOS cytosolic protein content and its enzymatic activity present a circadian variation in different regions of the rodent brain, including the hippocampus. The present study investigated the daily variation of NOS enzymatic activity and the cytosolic content of nNOS in the hippocampus of pigeons. RESULTS: Adult pigeons kept under a skeleton photoperiod were assigned to six different groups. Homogenates of the hippocampus obtained at six different times-of-day were used for NOS analyses. Both iNOS activity and nNOS cytosolic protein concentrations were highest during the subjective light phase and lowest in the subjective dark phase of the circadian period. ANOVA showed significant time differences for iNOS enzymatic activity (p < 0.05) and for nNOS protein content (p < 0.05) in the hippocampus. A significant daily rhythm for both iNOS and nNOS was confirmed by analysis with the Cosinor method (p < 0.05). The present findings indicate that the enzymatic activity of iNOS and content of nNOS protein in the hippocampus of pigeons exhibit a daily rhythm, with acrophase values occurring during the behavioral activity phase. CONCLUSIONS: The data corroborate the reports on circadian variation of NOS in the mammalian hippocampus and can be considered indicative of a dynamic interaction between hippocampus-dependent processes and circadian clock mechanisms.",
