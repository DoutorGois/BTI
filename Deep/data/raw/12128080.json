In this work we demonstrate the ability of laminin-1 and laminin-2 to inhibit fibril formation and toxicity on cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We confirm that the laminin-1-derived peptide YFQRYLI inhibits efficiently both fibril formation and neurotoxicity and show that the IKVAV peptide inhibits amyloid neurotoxicity despite its slight inhibition of fibril formation. On other hand, laminin-1 induces disaggregation of preformed fibrils in vitro, characterized as a progressive disassembly of fibrils into protofibrils and further clearance of these latter species, leading to a continual inhibition of amyloid neurotoxicity.",
