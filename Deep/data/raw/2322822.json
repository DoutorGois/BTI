     "AB": "Once daily for 60 days, hooded rats received unilateral high-frequency stimulation in the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG), at an intensity sufficient to evoke epileptiform afterdischarge (AD). Although most rats eventually developed generalized stage-5 seizures (Generalized group), some did not progress beyond partial stage-1 or stage-2 seizures (Partial group). Hilar kindling also displayed several other characteristics that distinguished it from typical limbic kindling, including low rate of development, marked instability of the seizures, and little or no growth in duration of AD.",
