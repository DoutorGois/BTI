     "AB": "MSS, a comprising mixture of maesil (Prunus mume Sieb. et Zucc) concentrate, disodium succinate and Span80 (3.6:4.6 :1 ratio) showed a significant improvement of memory when daily administered (460 mg/kg day, p.o.) into the normal rats for 3 weeks. During the spatial learning of 4 days in Morris water maze test, both working memory and short-term working memory index were significantly increased when compared to untreated controls. We investigated a molecular signal transduction mechanism of MSS on the behaviors of spatial learning and memory. MSS treatment increased hippocampal mRNA levels of NR2B and TrkB without changes of NR1, NR2A, ERK1, ERK2 and CREB. However, the protein levels of pERK/ERK and pCREB/CREB were all significantly increased to 1.5+/-0.17 times. These results suggest that the improving effect of spatial memory for MSS is linked to MAPK/ERK signaling pathway that ends up in the phosphorylation of CREB through TrkB and/or NR2B of NMDA receptor.",
