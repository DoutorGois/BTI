The enzyme activity in 14-day-old experimental offsprings. The enzyme activity in 14-day-old experimental offsprings was significantly decreased in the brain cortex, hippocampus and brain stem by 27.1; 31.1 and 33.4% respectively as compared with control animals. The results are discussed from the point of view of the activation of free radical processes in the brain of alcoholized offsprings.",
