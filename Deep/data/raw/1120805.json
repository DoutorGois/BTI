     "AB": "The frequency of occurrence and amplitude of hippocampal theta waves induced by forced locomotion is proportional to speed of movement on a treadmill. Although induction of hippocampal theta waves is related to the initiation of movement, it is not dependent upon proprioceptive feedback because it persists in the resting animal after a bout of running. It is possible to obtain cortical theta waves in the absence of hippocampal theta activity.",
