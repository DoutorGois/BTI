     "AB": "Persistent elevation of the intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration [Ca(2+)](i) is neurotoxic and therefore it is important to understand how it affects downstream components of the Ca(2+) signaling pathway. The response of calmodulin (CaM) and alphaCa(2+)/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (alphaCaMKII), to intracellular Ca(2+) overload in hippocampal neurons is studied by confocal imaging of fluorescently tagged proteins. Transient and persistent redistribution of CaM and alphaCaMKII together is seen from the cytosol to dendritic and somatic punctae. Typical persistent redistribution occurs following a lag of 138+/-(S.E.M.) 12 s and is complete at 460+/-(S.E.M.) 34 s (n=18), lack of Thr(286)-autophosphorylation of alphaCaMKII however promotes the formation of early transient punctae (peak at 40 s). In contrast, the T286D-mimick of phospho-Thr(286)-alphaCaMKII forms punctae with a delay >10 min, indicating that Thr(286)-autophosphorylation is antagonistic to CaMKII clustering. A two-state model is proposed in which phospho-Thr(286)-alphaCaMKII, formed immediately upon Ca(2+) stimulation, is primarily responsible for target interactions and memory functions of alphaCaMKII. However, a distinct clustering form denoted alphaCaMKII(c), generated upon persistent intracellular free Ca(2+) elevation, is deposited in the punctae which are made of self-interacting CaM/CaMKII complexes. Punctate deposition disables both the interactions and the activity of CaMKII.",
