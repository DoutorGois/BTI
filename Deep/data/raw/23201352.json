     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that causes a progressive loss in learning and memory capabilities and eventually results in dementia. The non-renewable nature of neurons in the central nervous system leads to the basic pathological changes that are related to the various behavioral and psychological symptoms of AD. Oligodendrocyte- and myelin-related neurite outgrowth inhibitors (NOIs) tend to hinder the regeneration of neurons. We designed a recombinant DNA vaccine composed of multiple specific inhibitory domains of NOIs. Vaccination induced effective antibodies against the specific domains in the sera of mice treated with a DNA primed-vaccinia virus boost regimen. The vaccine attenuated neuronal degeneration in the mouse brain and protected the model mice from behavioral deficits. Vaccination also decreased the formation of soluble Abeta oligomer and amyloid plaques in the co-transgenic mice brain. What's more, astrocytosis in brains of APP/PS1 co-transgenic mice was also relieved. The results suggested that immunotherapy with multiple specific domains of myelin- and oligodendrocyte-related NOIs may be a promising approach for Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative central nervous system diseases.",
