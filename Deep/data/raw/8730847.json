     "AB": "The activity of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-KII) during short-term global ischaemia was investigated in the gerbil brain hippocampus and cortex. Ischaemia of 0.5 min duration significantly stimulated Ca(2+)-independent 'autonomous' activity, indicating activation of the first step of intramolecular enzyme phosphorylation just after ischaemia has developed. Prolongation of the ischaemic period up to 5 min inhibited both Ca(2+)-dependent and, to a lesser extent, Ca(2+)-independent activities of CaM-KII. These last events coincide with an extensive translocation of CaM-KII protein from the soluble to the membranous fraction. In effect, in spite of inhibition of total CaM-KII activity, its Ca(2+)-independent, persistently active component can still remain more abundant at specific membrane regions.",
