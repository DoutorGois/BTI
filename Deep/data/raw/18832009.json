     "AB": "The Rho family of small GTPase proteins are involved in the formation and maintenance of neuronal dendrites. In this study, we show that Daam1, a member of the Diaphanous-related formin protein family and a downstream effector for RhoA, is localized to the dendrites of hippocampal neurons. Immunoblot analysis showed that Daam1 is enriched in the mouse hippocampus and co-fractionates in brain lysates with dendritic and synaptic proteins. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Daam1 protein distributes in a punctate pattern throughout the cell body and dendritic shafts of dissociated hippocampal neurons and organotypic hippocampal cultures. Although Daam1 is mostly expressed in the shaft of dendrites, co-stainings with SV2 or PSD95 revealed that Daam1 is also present at some synapses. In addition, viral directed expression of a fluorescently tagged Daam1 fusion protein in hippocampal slices resulted in targeted delivery to the dendrites of pyramidal neurons, leading to a reduction in the density of spines.",
