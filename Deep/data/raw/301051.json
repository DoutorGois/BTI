     "AB": "The ascending projections of the locus coeruleus were studied using an autoradiographic method. The major projection of locus coeruleus neurons ascends in a dorsal pathway traversing the midbrain tegmentum in a position ventrolateral to the periaqueductal gray. At the caudal diencephalon the locus coeruleus axons descend to enter the medial forebrain bundle at a caudal tuberal hypothalamic level. They are jointed in the medial forebrain bundle by a much smaller locus coeruleus projection which takes a ventral course through the midbrain tegmentum and enters the medial forebrain bundle via the mammillary peduncle and ventral tegmental area. Terminal projections are evident in the midbrain to the periaqueductal gray, tegmentum and raphe nuclei. There are widespread projections to the dorsal thalamus. The heaviest of these are to the intralaminar nuclei, the anteroventral and anteromedial nuclei, the dorsal lateral geniculate and the paraventricular nucleus. In the hypothalamus the largest projections are to the lateral hypothalamic area, periventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus. As the locus coeruleus projection ascends in the medial forebrain bundle, fibers leave it to traverse the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta and enter the internal capsule, the ventral amygdaloid bundle and ansa peduncularis. These appear to terminate in the amygdaloid complex and, via the external capsule, in the lateral and dorsal neocortex. At the level of the septum 4 projections are evident. One group of fibers enters the stria medullaris to terminate in the paraventricular nucleus and habenular nuclei. A second group joins the stria terminalis to terminate in the anygdaloid complex. The third group turns into the diagonal band and medial septum; some fibers terminate in the septal nuclei and others continue into the fornix to termimate in hippocampus. A large component continues around the corpus callosum into the cingulum to terminate in the cingulate and adjacent neocortex, the subiculum and hippocampus. The remaining fibers continue rostrally in the medial forebrain bundle to terminate in olfactory forebrain and frontal neocortex. Commissural projections arise at 4 locations. The first decussation occurs in the dorsal tegmentum just below the central gray rostral to the locus coeruleus. The crossing fibers enter the contralateral dorsal bundle. A second group of fibers leaves the ipsilateral dorsal pathway, crosses in the posterior commissure and enters the contralateral dorsal pathway at the level. The third commissural projection arises more rostrally and crosses in the dorsal supraoptic commissure to enter the contralateral medial forebrain bundle. The fourth commissural projection is through the anterior commissure. The termination of the contralateral projection appears similar to that of the ipsilateral projection.",
