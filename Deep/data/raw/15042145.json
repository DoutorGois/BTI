     "AB": "Herein we report on a large-scale analysis of gene expression in the 'learned helplessness' (LH) rat model of human depression, using DNA microarrays. We compared gene expression in the frontal cortex (FC) and hippocampus (HPC) of untreated controls, and LH rats treated with saline (LH-S), imipramine or fluoxetine. A total of 34 and 48 transcripts were differentially expressed in the FC and HPC, respectively, between control and LH-S groups. Unexpectedly, only genes for NADH dehydrogenase and zinc transporter were altered in both the FC and HPC, suggesting limited overlap in the molecular processes from specific areas of the brain. Principal component analysis revealed that sets of upregulated metabolic enzyme genes in the FC and downregulated genes for signal transduction in the HPC can distinguish clearly between depressed and control animals, as well as explain the responsiveness to antidepressants. This comprehensive data could help to unravel the complex genetic predispositions involved in human depression.",
