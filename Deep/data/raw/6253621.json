     "AB": "1. Intracellular activity was recorded from neurones in the CA1 pyramidal layer of slices of rat hippocampus maintained in vitro. 2. Application of 5-HT in a droplet or via ionophoresis produced a 3-5 mV hyperpolarization associated with a 30% decrease in input resistance. 3. The response to 5-HT was minimal with a drop concentration of 1 microM and maximal with 100 microM. The responses appeared to be blocked by methysergide applied in the superfusion medium. 4. The responses to 5-HT were minimal when the drug was applied in the apical dendritic region and maximal when it was applied near the soma. 5. 5-HT produced no substantial changes in e.p.s.p.s evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural system or in i.p.s.p.s which were occasionally encountered following stimuli to the stratum radiatum. 6. The responses to 5-HT are true post-synaptic responses and are not indirect effects since they are present in a Ca2+-deficient Mg2+-enriched medium which blocks synaptic transmission. 7. The responses to 5-HT were not dependent on extracellular Cl- concentration. 8. These experiments indicate that 5-HT produces its effects in the rat hippocampus by activating K+ channels.",
