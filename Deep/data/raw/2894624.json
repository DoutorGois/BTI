     "AB": "Brief electrical high-frequency stimulation (tetanus) via the synapses induces long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal neurons. In order to elucidate how LTP is produced, we attempted to induce long-term facilitation (LTF) by perfusing a conditioning solution (CS) instead of the tetanus. A 5 min perfusion of hippocampal slices with a CS containing glutamate, K+ at high concentration and no Mg2+ resulted in the generation of LTF in CAl and dentate neurons. CS lacking one of these 3 factors failed to produce LTF. When the glutamate of the CS was substituted by both quisqualate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), LTF was initiated. This indicates that both quisqualate and NMDA receptors play an important role in the induction of LTP.",
