     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) together with concurrent EEG recording has shown promise in the treatment of epilepsy. A novel device is capable of combining these 2 functions and may prove valuable in the treatment of epilepsy in dogs. However, stereotactic implantation of electrodes in dogs has not yet been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of implanting stimulating and recording electrodes in the brain of normal dogs using the Brainsight system and to evaluate the function of a novel DBS and recording device. ANIMALS: Four male intact Greyhounds, confirmed to be normal by clinical and neurologic examinations and hematology and biochemistry testing. METHODS: MRI imaging of the brain was performed after attachment of fiducial markers. MRI scans were used to calculate trajectories for electrode placement in the thalamus and hippocampus, which was performed via burr hole craniotomy. Postoperative CT scanning was performed to evaluate electrode location and accuracy of placement was calculated. Serial neurologic examinations were performed to evaluate neurologic deficits and EEG recordings obtained to evaluate the effects of stimulation. RESULTS: Electrodes were successfully placed in 3 of 4 dogs with a mean accuracy of 4.6 +/- 1.5 mm. EEG recordings showed evoked potentials in response to stimulation with a circadian variation in time-to-maximal amplitude. No neurologic deficits were seen in any dog. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Stereotactic placement of electrodes is safe and feasible in the dog. The development of a novel device capable of providing simultaneous neurostimulation and EEG recording potentially represents a major advance in the treatment of epilepsy.",
