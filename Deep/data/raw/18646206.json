     "AB": "Clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a noninvasive diagnostic tool for neurodegenerative diseases. MRI was performed on mice to investigate a relationship between brain atrophy and overexpression of two genes involved in such diseases, SOD1 (superoxide dismutase) and APP (amyloid precursor protein), which have been associated with pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease or Down syndrome. Additionaly, we investigated how life span and growth rate were affected by genetic background. T2-weighted MRI made possible the measurement of the volume of brain regions of interest in living transgenic mice that overexpress normal APP, SOD1, or both. The most pronounced alterations in gray matter volume were observed in 1-year-old double APP/SOD1 transgenic mice. Hippocampus, entorhinal, and cingulate cortex volumes were decreased by 8% to 25%. In contrast, mice homozygous for SOD1 exhibited atrophy specifically in cortex regions (cingulate, retrosplenial, and temporoparietal cortex), but no significant modification was found in the hippocampus region. None of these alterations was seen in single APP transgenics. However, the life span of these mice was significantly shortened. SOD1 overexpression prevented APP toxicity with regard to premature death, especially in double APP/SOD1 transgenic animals homozygous for SOD1, and increase in life span was significantly correlated to SOD1 activity. In conclusion, overexpression of both APP and SOD1, in contrast to single APP transgenics, produced a robust effect on brain anatomy but did not impair growth or life span. Consequences of genotype alterations on brain atrophy may be dissociated from their effect on life span.",
