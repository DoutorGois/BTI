     "AB": "Early morphological events associated with the genesis of epileptiform activity are essentially unknown, despite significant progress on morphological correlates of potentially related plastic neural phenomena. Hippocampal area CA1 shows the capacity to generate epileptiform bursting activity after certain patterns of electrical stimulation. Using an in vitro slice kindling preparation, we found increases in the numbers (areal densities) of shaft and sessile spine synapses in hippocampal subfield CA1 within minutes following the establishment of stable afterdischarges. These data strongly suggest that synaptogenesis is associated with the early stages of epilepsy formation.",
