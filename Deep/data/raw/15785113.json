     "AB": "We have reported that Vasogen's immune modulation therapy (IMT), a procedure involving intramuscular administration of autologous/syngeneic blood, which has been exposed ex vivo to increased temperature, UVC light and oxidation, prevents several LPS-induced inflammatory changes in the hippocampus. Here, we investigated neuroprotective effects of IMT in cortical tissue, and report that the treatment acts as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidative agent, reducing the concentration of TNFalpha and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The data couple these changes with an increase in the concentration of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and a decrease in activation of the stress-activated protein kinase, c-jun N-terminal kinase. Consistent with these putative protective effects of IMT, we report that the LPS-induced increase in TUNEL staining, which is indicative of cell death, is prevented by IMT.",
