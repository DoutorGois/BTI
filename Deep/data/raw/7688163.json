     "AB": "Presynaptic receptors for virtually all transmitters have been identified throughout the nervous system. Recent studies in the hippocampus provide new insights into the mechanisms by which the activation of these receptors leads to presynaptic inhibition of transmitter release, and characterize the second messengers involved in coupling presynaptic receptors to their effectors. Presynaptic receptors also provide a tractable route via which the amount of transmitter release may be selectively regulated in therapeutically useful ways.",
