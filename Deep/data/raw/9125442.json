     "AB": "The present study investigates the role of pharmacologic blockade of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and non-NMDA receptors at deep prepiriform cortex (area tempestas, AT) in neuronal injury during prolonged seizures in rat. Status epilepticus was induced by intravenous kainate (15 mg/kg) and neuronal death was assessed in hippocampal CA3 sector 72 h following status epilepticus. Unilateral equimolar microinjections of 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (AP-7), an NMDA receptor antagonist, or 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX), a non-NMDA receptor antagonist, into AT were given prior to kainate administration. Counts of surviving cells in CA3 ipsilateral to NBQX-injected AT were significantly greater than on the contralateral control-side, but no significant difference between the AP-7-injected and saline-injected side was found. These results indicate that neurotransmission via non-NMDA receptors is more important than that via NMDA receptors at AT in the genesis of neuronal injury in hippocampus during kainate-induced status epilepticus.",
