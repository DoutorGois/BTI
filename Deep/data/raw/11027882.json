ACP is a stable non-radical compound, but is easily deprotected with intracellular esterase to yield a hydroxylamine, which is oxidized by intracellular oxidative stress to yield an EPR-detectable nitroxide radical. From in vivo image data, the average values of EPR signal intensity from the hippocampus, striatum, and cerebral cortex were computed. There was no significant difference in cortical signal intensity between the control and KA-treated rats. The signal intensities from the hippocampus and striatum for the KA-treated rats were significantly higher than those for the control. The in vitro study showed that almost the same quantity of ACP moved into all regions of the brain of the control and KA-treated rats. These findings indicate that following a KA-induced seizure, the oxidative stress in the hippocampus and striatum is enhanced, but not so in the cerebral cortex.",
