     "AB": "Prolonged iontophoretic administrations of delta- and mu-selective opioid receptor agonists were conducted in the hippocampus of rats, in order to study the possible development of acute tolerance to the excitatory effects of the opioids. Acute tolerance (AT) to the excitatory effects of the delta-selective opioid receptor agonist Tyr-D-Ser-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr (DSLET) was observed when the drug was applied locally for 3-5 min in the CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons. The acute tolerance was expressed as a decrease in the commissurally evoked spike responsiveness during peptide's administration and led to a long-lasting potentiation of the population spike (PS) upon its withdrawal. In all cases, where AT and spike potentiation were evident, the population excitatory postsynaptic potential (pEPSP) remained unaltered. Pharmacological studies of AT and long-lasting spike potentiation showed the following: (1) the nonselective opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone, while effective in blocking the excitatory effects of DSLET when applied prior and during the application of the latter, failed to exhibit any effect on the long-lasting potentiating effect of the opioid; and (2) during the spike potentiation phase, administration of DSLET exhibited a depressant effect towards baseline values. This depressant effect of the opioid was evident 2-3 min from the beginning of the application and was completely antagonized by naloxone. The above results show that the development of acute tolerance to the excitatory effects of the DSLET led to long-lasting spike potentiation, which manifests a withdrawal phenomenon.",
