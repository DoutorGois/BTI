     "AB": "The effects of acute and long-term treatment with imipramine and buspirone on the responses of rat hippocampal neurones to low and high frequency electrical stimulation were compared. Whereas acute treatment with imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) had no effect on synaptic responses to low frequency stimulation, chronic treatment for 14 days significantly reduced the amplitude of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential. Both acute and chronic imipramine treatment markedly reduced the amplitude of the nerve volley and excitatory postsynaptic potential evoked at high frequency stimulation rates in a use-dependent manner. Buspirone (0.5-3 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a significant reduction of the excitatory postsynaptic potential at high frequencies. This was enhanced after repeated administration of a dose of 0.5 mg/kg for 14 days. We previously reported a similar effect of buspirone at low frequency stimulation. Both compounds therefore share the ability to exert strong depressant effects on transmission in the hippocampus especially after chronic treatment.",
