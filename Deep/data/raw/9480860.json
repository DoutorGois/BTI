     "AB": "In Caenorhabditis elegans, the vulval induction is mediated by tyrosine kinase receptor/Ras signal transduction pathway composed of the lin-3, let-23, and let-60 products. In addition to these gene products, the lin-2, lin-7, and lin-10 products are also implicated in this pathway. Lin-2 encodes a MAGUK and lin-7 encodes a small protein with one PDZ domain. The lin-10 product has no homology to known proteins. Here, we have cloned a rat homologue of the lin-10 product and characterized it. Rat lin-10 is ubiquitously expressed in various rat tissues and distributed in both the cytosol and membrane fractions. In brain, however, rat lin-10 is distributed only in the membrane fraction and enriched in the synaptic plasma membrane and postsynaptic density fractions. These results suggest that rat lin-10 is involved at least in synaptic functions in brain.",
