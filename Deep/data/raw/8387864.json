     "AB": "Injection of GABA and benzodiazepine (BDZ) agonists and antagonists into the medial septum produced bidirectional alterations in hippocampal high-affinity choline transport (HAChT). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected in the medial septum with either drug vehicle, a BDZ agonist, antagonist, or inverse agonist, or with a GABA-A or GABA-B agonist or antagonist and sacrificed 1 h later for assessment of HAChT in hippocampal synaptosomes. The GABA-A agonist muscimol, the GABA-B agonist baclofen, and the BDZ agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP) produced dose-related decreases in HAChT 1 h following injection into the septum. The muscimol-induced decrease in HAChT was prevented by prior intraseptal injection of the GABA-A antagonist, bicuculline. Intraseptal injection of GABA-A (bicuculline) or GABA-B (2-hydroxysaclofen) antagonists did not alter HAChT, whereas the BDZ antagonist flumazenil (RO15,1788) and the BDZ inverse agonist methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) increased this measure up to 30% in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that cholinergic neurons in the medial septum can be modulated in a bidirectional way through the pharmacological manipulation of GABA-A, GABA-B, and BDZ receptors. The potential functional and therapeutic consequences of these interactions are discussed.",
