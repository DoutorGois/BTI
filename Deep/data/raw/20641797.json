     "AB": "Adenosine is an endogenous nucleoside, which modulates a number of physiological functions in the central nervous system (CNS) and in peripheral organs, such as the heart, kidney and muscle (1, 2). The effect is mediated by two major subtypes of receptors (A1 and A2A receptors) and two minor subtypes (A2B and A3). In the CNS, A1 receptors are present both pre- and postsynaptically in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum. A2A receptors are highly concentrated and co-localized with dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle. A2A receptors are also present in the hippocampus and cortex. A2B receptors are widely distributed but high in gastrointestinal tract. A3 receptors are also widely distributed but high in testis. A1 and A3 receptors mediate inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, whereas A2A and A2B receptors mediate stimulation. Changes in the adenosine functions are implicated in epilepsy, ischemic cerebral stroke, movement disorders, sleep disorders and psychiatric disorders (3-5). A1 receptors have been studied in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) using [1-methyl-(11)C]8-dicyclopropylmethyl-1-methyl-3-propylxanthine ([18F]CPFPX ), a methyl xanthine analog of KF15372 with selective A1 antagonistic activity (6). 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine was reported to be a selective A1 receptor antagonist and its analog, 8-Cyclopentyl-3-(3-fluoropropyl)-1-propylxanthine (CPFPX) has been labeled with (18)F as 8-Cyclopentyl-3-(3-[(18)F]fluoropropyl)-1-propylxanthine ([(18)F]CPFPX). [(18)F]CPFPX is being developed as a PET agent for the non-invasive study of the human brain.",
