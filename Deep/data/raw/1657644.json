     "AB": "A cDNA clone encoding a protein with high homology to the beta-subunit of the rabbit skeletal muscle dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel was isolated from a rat brain cDNA library. This rat brain beta-subunit cDNA hybridizes to a 3.4 kb message that is expressed in high levels in the cerebral hemispheres and hippocampus but is significantly reduced in cerebellum. The open reading frame encodes 597 amino acids with a predicted mass of 65 679 Da which is 82% homologous with the skeletal muscle beta-subunit. The brain cDNA encodes a unique 153 amino acid C-terminus and predicts the absence of a muscle-specific 50 amino acid internal segment. It also encodes numerous consensus phosphorylation sites suggesting a role in calcium channel regulation. The corresponding human beta-subunit gene was localized to chromosome 17. Hence the encoded brain beta-subunit, which has a primary structure highly similar to its isoform in skeletal muscle, may have a comparable role as an integral regulatory component of a neuronal calcium channel.",
