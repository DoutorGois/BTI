     "AB": "The distribution of glucocorticoid receptor in subcellular fractions of brain cortex and hippocampus, two regions rich in glucocorticoid receptor, has revealed its presence in nuclei, cytosol, mitochondria, synaptosomes, and synaptosomal mitochondria. The identification of glucocorticoid receptor has been accomplished both by Western blotting using antibodies recognizing the carboxy and the amino terminus of the glucocorticoid receptor and by immunogold electron microscopy using the same anti-glucocorticoid receptor antibodies. Antibody-glucocorticoid receptor interaction is abolished by preincubation of each antibody with its competing peptide. In addition to the intact 95-kDa glucocorticoid receptor in all fractions, lower molecular weight glucocorticoid receptor fragments have been also detected by Western blotting. The presence of glucocorticoid receptor in brain mitochondria supports the concept of a direct action of glucocorticoids on mitochondrial gene transcription, parallel to the established primary actions of the hormones on nuclear gene transcription, as a mechanism of coordinate regulation of respiratory enzyme biosynthesis by steroid hormones.",
