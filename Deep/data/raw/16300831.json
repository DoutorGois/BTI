     "AB": "Single cell unit activity of 187 neurons of 24 rats were analysed to study the possible involvement of intracranial mast cells on modifying thalamic neuronal activity. Mast cells were activated with microiontophoretical application of compound 48/80. This substance did not modify the firing rate of cortical or hippocampal neurons (no mast cells are found here), however it caused excitation (70% in females, 11% in males), or inhibition (7% in females, 33% in males) on thalamic neurons, possibly due to mast cell activation. In consecutive anatomical evaluation many partially or fully degranulated mast cells were found in the recorded thalamic areas.",
