     "AB": "The values of quantal content (m) and quantal amplitude (q) of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) elicited in CA3 neurons by activation of granule cells were estimated in thin hippocampal sections maintained in vitro. For this purpose, DL-homocysteate was administered to granule cells, and trains of EPSPs that were typical for single granule cell activation were recorded from individual CA3 neurons. The amplitudes of the first and second EPSPs in each train were measured. Fron the mean and variance of the amplitude of the EPSPs, the values of q and m were calculated. The values of m and q for the first EPSPs were estimated at 8.3 and 0.28 mV, respectively, on the average. Potentiation of the second EPSPs was accompanied by a two-fold increase in the values of m without changes in the values of q. Therefore, frequency potentiation in synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 neurons may be explained by an increase in number of released quanta. Amplitudes of EPSPs were found to fluctuate in a manner described by Poisson's law.",
