Homosynaptic depression that occurs subsequent to either a low frequency tetanus (20 Hz, 600 pulses) or a transient exposure to Cl(-)-free (containing NO3-) medium is associated with an elevation in the amino acid binding. [3H]Glutamate uptake into slices was decreased following a high frequency (400 Hz, 200 pulses) tetanus but in the majority of cases was increased following a low frequency (20 Hz, 600 pulses) tetanus to stratum radiatum. When the high frequency tetanus was given in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, there was a further reduction in [3H]glutamate uptake.",
