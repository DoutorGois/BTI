     "AB": "Neurons from embryonic (E18) rat hippocampus were chosen to identify and characterize neurite growth-stimulating proteins accumulating in serum-free conditioned media (CM) obtained from primary or secondary cultures of cerebral astrocytes (less than 5% nonglial cells) using a quantitative cell culture bioassay. CM were fractionated by FPLC on an anion exchange column (Mono Q) and by gel filtration (Superose 6). Column fractions were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using antibodies to laminin (LN) and fibronectin (FN). The neurite-promoting activity (NPA) was tested by incubating aliquots of the eluted fractions with poly-L-lysine precoated glass coverslips prior to addition of neurons suspended in chemically defined medium. We provide evidence that the NPA in astroglial CM could be assigned mainly to a negatively charged, highly sulfated LN complex consisting predominantly of the B-chains of LN and presumably a sulfated proteoglycan that was sensitive for chondroitinase and to a lower degree to heparinase degradation. In addition, a smaller proportion of the NPA was associated with uncomplexed LN and free FN. FN reached approximately 10 times the concentration of LN in astroglial CM. As revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy, both LN and FN are simultaneously expressed by cultured astrocytes; however, only the production of FN, measured by ELISA, increased during the time astrocytes were in culture, whereas the release of LN remained unchanged. We conclude that, besides the most active LN complex, FN bound to a polycationic matrix is able to induce neurite growth in hippocampal neurons in vitro.",
