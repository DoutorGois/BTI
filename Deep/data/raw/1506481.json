     "AB": "The localization and distribution of kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT), the biosynthetic enzyme of the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist, kynurenic acid, was studied in the rat hippocampal formation with immunohistochemical methods. The enzyme was found mainly in glial cells that could be distinguished as 3 types on the basis of their shapes and locations. Typically, these cells shared the morphological features of astrocytes and exhibited glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity as demonstrated by a double-labeling technique. The distribution of KAT-containing glial cells was heterogeneous throughout the hippocampal formation. In the hippocampus, the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of Ammon's horn and the hilus contained a higher density of KAT-positive glial cells than other regions, whereas the lowest density of KAT glial cells was observed in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and in the stratum radiatum of CA subfields. In the subicular complex, the density of KAT-containing glial cells was generally higher in the superficial than in the deep layer. Hippocampal neurons exhibiting KAT immunoreactivity, distinguished as nonpyramidal cells, were very few in number and mainly distributed in strata oriens and pyramidale of Ammon's horn. Substantially more KAT-positive neurons were observed in layers II and III of the subicular complex. The organization of cellular elements containing KAT may be of relevance for the function and possible dysfunction of kynurenic acid in the rat hippocampal formation.",
