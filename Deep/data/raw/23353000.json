     "AB": "Our aim was to examine whether neonatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure is associated with changes in microglia and whether these alternations could influence later seizure-induced neurobehavioral outcomes. Male pups were first injected intraperitoneally with either LPS or saline on postnatal day 3 (P3) and postnatal day 5 (P5). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that LPS-treated animals exhibited increased microglia activation that persisted into adolescence. At P45, seizures were induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA). Rats treated with LPS neonatally showed significantly greater proinflammatory responses and performed significantly worse in the Y-maze, Morris water maze, and inhibitory avoidance tasks after KA insult. Treatment with minocycline at the time of neonatal LPS exposure to block LPS-induced microglia alternation attenuated the exaggerated neuroinflammatory responses and alleviated memory impairment associated with the KA insult. Our findings suggest that neonatal immune activation can predispose the brain to exacerbated behavioral deficits following seizures in adulthood, possibly by priming microglia.",
