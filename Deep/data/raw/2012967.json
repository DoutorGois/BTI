     "AB": "A quantitative autoradiographic study was made on the binding of the phosphatidylinositol system ligand [3H]inositol(1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) to forebrain sections from rats decapitated various times after 10 min of forebrain ischemia. To investigate the effect of a deafferentation of the hippocampal CA1, kainic acid-induced CA3-lesioned rats with or without 10 min of cerebral ischemia, were also included. The highest binding was found in the hippocampal CA1. Ten min of cerebral ischemia did not change the binding significantly. Between 5 min and 1 h of recirculation there was a 25-35% binding decline in all regions. In the CA1, where the pyramidal cells became necrotic 6 days after ischemia, there was a further decline to 16% of control. In the cortex, where there is no necrosis in this model, binding did not return to control values until day 14. Four days after a selective CA3 lesion with kainic acid, there was a significant 25% decline in the cortex, dentate gyrus and CA1, whereas in the necrotic CA3 binding declined to 54% of control. Ten min of ischemia did not alter this binding significantly. This decrease in calcium mobilizing intracellular receptors after ischemia and seizures could be due to increased membrane degradation, or to a more specific down-regulation following increased intracellular concentration of calcium and IP3.",
