     "AB": "We measured iodine-125-labeled recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha (125I-IL-1 alpha) binding in the hippocampus, pituitary, liver, spleen and testis, and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone levels after i.p. injection of various dose and treatment regimens of the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels were significantly increased at 2 h after acute administration of LPS (60 or 300 micrograms/mouse). 125I-IL-1 alpha binding in all peripheral tissues examined was significantly and comparably decreased at 2 h after a single injection of 30 micrograms or 300 micrograms LPS/mouse. On the other hand, 125I-IL-1 alpha binding in hippocampus was significantly decreased only after high dose administration of LPS (300 micrograms/mouse). In order to evaluate if activation of IL-1 in brain resulting in the observed decrease in 125I-IL-1 alpha binding may require more sustained exposure to endotoxin, we compared the effects of a single injection (60 micrograms/mouse) and two injections of LPS (30 micrograms/mouse each at 0 and 12 h). A single injection of LPS (60 micrograms/mouse) decreased 125I-IL-1 alpha binding in the testis but not in the hippocampus, while two LPS injections (30 micrograms/mouse each at 0 and 12 h) caused dramatic reductions in 125I-IL-1 alpha binding in both the hippocampus and testis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
