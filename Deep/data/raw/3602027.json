     "AB": "Exposure to acute uncontrollable footshock increased utilization of central norepinephrine (NE), and in some brain regions, most notably the hypothalamus, a decline in amine concentrations was induced. Utilization of NE was likewise increased in mice exposed to footshock on 14 consecutive days, but the NE reduction was not evident, suggesting that the chronic stressor provoked a compensatory increase of amine synthesis. In mice that were decapitated 24 hr after the chronic shock regimen, NE concentrations exceeded those of nonshocked animals or mice decapitated immediately after the last shock session, possibly reflecting a sustained increase of amine synthesis. The altered NE utilization and concentrations associated with chronic footshock were evident irrespective of whether the stressor was applied on a predictable schedule or on an intermittent basis, although the former treatment was somewhat more effective in increasing concentrations and utilization.",
