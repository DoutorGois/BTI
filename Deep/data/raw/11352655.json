     "AB": "Recently we reported the activation MAPKs, MEK, and Rafs by electroconvulsive shock (ECS) in the rat hippocampus. However, the upstream pathways for the activation of Raf-MEK-MAPK cascade after ECS have not been studied yet. Since the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) and Src were reported to be involved in the activation of the MAPKs in neuronal cells, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Pyk2 in the rat hippocampus after ECS. ECS transiently increased the phosphorylation of Pyk2 at multiple tyrosine residues (Tyr-402, Tyr-580, and Tyr-881). The phosphorylations reached the peak at 1 min and returned to basal level by 10 min after ECS. At 1 min after ECS, the binding of Pyk2 to Src and Grb2, and of Grb2 to Ras increased. These results suggested that ECS activates Pyk2, which then transmits the signal to MAPK cascade via Src, Grb2, and Ras in the rat hippocampus.",
