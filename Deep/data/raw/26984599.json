     "AB": "Much less attention has been paid to Zn(2+) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), i.e., extracellular medium, used for in vitro slice experiments than divalent cations such as Ca(2+). Approximately 2 mM Ca(2+) is added to conventional ACSF from essentiality of Ca(2+) signaling in neurons and glial cells. However, no Zn(2+) is added to it, even though the importance of Zn(2+) signaling in them is recognizing. On the other hand, synaptic Zn(2+) homeostasis is changed during brain slice preparation. Therefore, it is possible that not only neuronal excitation but also synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation is modified in ACSF without Zn(2+), in which original physiology might not appear. The basal (static) levels of intracellular (cytosolic) Zn(2+) and Ca(2+) are not significantly different between brain slices prepared with conventional ACSF without Zn(2+) and pretreated with ACSF containing 20 nM ZnCl2 for 1 h. In the case of mossy fiber excitation, however, presynaptic activity assessed with FM 4-64 is significantly suppressed in the stratum lucidum of brain slices pretreated with ACSF containing Zn(2+), indicating that hippocampal excitability is enhanced in brain slices prepared with ACSF without Zn(2+). The evidence suggests that low nanomolar concentration of Zn(2+) is necessary for ACSF. Furthermore, exogenous Zn(2+) has opposite effect on LTP induction between in vitro and in vivo experiments. It is required to pay attention to extracellular Zn(2+) concentration to understand synaptic function precisely.",
