     "AB": "This report concerns a 12-year-old male with intractable seizures over a long period. The case fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for nonherpetic acute limbic encephalitis. He had frequent convulsions starting with a partial seizure at the left angle of the mouth and progressing to secondary generalized seizures. He was treated with several anticonvulsants, combined with methylprednisolone and gamma-globulin under mechanical ventilation. However, his convulsions reappeared after tapering of the barbiturate. His magnetic resonance imaging showed a high intensity area in the hippocampus by FLAIR and diffusion. After five months he recovered without serious sequelae. Virological studies, including for herpes simplex virus, were all negative. He was transiently positive for antiglutamate receptor antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid and serum.",
