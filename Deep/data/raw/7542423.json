     "AB": "A loss of inhibitory interneurons has been reported in the hippocampus following seizure activity in various animal models of epilepsy and in human epileptic tissue. The question of whether particular populations of inhibitory neurons are similarly affected by the chronic block of inhibition that results after tetanus toxin injections directly into the brain has not previously been addressed. In the present study a unilateral intrahippocampal injection of tetanus toxin into the ventral hippocampus was used to produce a chronic epileptic syndrome characterised by brief seizures that recurred intermittently for 6-8 weeks. The results reveal, for the first time, the morphological changes in somatostatin interneurons following tetanus toxin-induced seizures in the rat. A bilateral short-term increase in immunoreactivity of somatostatin neurons is present 1 week after injection. This is accompanied by an increased intensity of somatostatin-immunoreactive axon terminals in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, which is more marked on the contralateral side. A chronic and significant loss of somatostatin-immunoreactive neurons was noted in the hilus of the dentate gyrus 2 months later. The significance of the chronic loss of the hilar somatostatin neurons in the control of excitatory activity in the dentate gyrus and whether the acute morphological changes are due to a direct action of the toxin on release mechanisms or as a result of seizure activity are discussed.",
