     "AB": "Stimulators of long-term memory (ethylnorantiphein and its analogs M1 and M2) were used to study the dynamics of several components of the neuronal calcium-regulatory system in the rat cortex and hippocampus. There were no changes in the activity of the Mg, Ca-ATPase transporter and actomyosin-like Ca-ATPase in synaptosomes 5, 15, 60, and 180 min after dosage with these agents. On exposure to ethylnorantiphein, M1, and M2, activation of RNA transcription at 60 min was accompanied by notable increases in chromatin Ca-ATPase activity, along with an increase in the synthesis of synaptosomal proteins at 180 min, with an increase in synaptic membrane protein kinase C activity. An increase in chromatin Ca-ATPase activity was also seen during fixation of a conditioned active escape reflex. It is suggested that the increase in protein kinase C activity is associated with secondary rearrangements of the synaptic membranes. The question of the role of direct activation of the genetic apparatus by neuroactive substances in the molecular mechanisms of memory formation is discussed.",
