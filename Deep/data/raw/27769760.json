     "AB": "Exposure of female rats to estradiol during the perinatal period has profound effects on GABAergic neurotransmission that are crucial to establish sexually dimorphic brain characteristics. We previously showed that neonatal beta-estradiol 3-benzoate (EB) treatment decreases brain concentrations of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, a potent positive modulator of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors (GABAAR). We thus evaluated whether neonatal EB treatment affects GABAAR expression and function in the hippocampus of adult female rats. Neonatal EB administration increased the expression of extrasynaptic alpha4/delta subunit-containing GABAARs and the modulatory action of THIP on tonic currents mediated by these receptors. The same treatment decreased the expression of synaptic alpha1/alpha4/gamma2 subunit-containing receptors, as well as phasic currents. These effects of neonatal EB treatment are not related to ambient allopregnanolone concentrations per se, given that vehicle-treated rats in diestrus, which have opposite neurosteroid levels than EB-treated rats, show similar changes in GABAARs. Rather, these changes may represent a compensatory mechanism to counteract the long-term reduction in allopregnanolone concentrations, induced by neonatal EB. Given that both alpha4/delta receptors and allopregnanolone are involved in memory consolidation, we evaluated whether neonatal EB treatment alters performance in the Morris water maze test during adulthood. Neonatal EB treatment decreased the latency and the cumulative search error to reach the platform, as well as thigmotaxis, suggesting improved learning, and also enhanced memory performance during the probe trial. These enduring changes in GABAAR plasticity may be relevant for the regulation of neuronal excitability in the hippocampus and for the etiology of psychiatric disorders that originate in development and show sex differences.",
