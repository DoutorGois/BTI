     "AB": "Racemic (m-iodobenzyl)trozamicol (6, MIBT), a high-affinity vesamicol receptor ligand, was radiolabeled, resolved, and evaluated in rats. Following iv injection, (+)- and (-)-[125I]MIBT achieved initial brain levels of 0.57 and 0.92% dose/g of tissue, respectively. The level of (+)-[125I]MIBT subsequently declined by 74% within 3 h, while that of (-)-[125I]MIBT remained stable for the duration. Ex vivo autoradiographic mapping of (-)-[125I]MIBT distribution in rat brain revealed a pattern which was inconsistent with central cholinergic innervation. However, high levels of (+)-[125I]MIBT were observed over the amygdala, striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and nuclei of the fifth and seventh cranial nerves, while moderate to low levels were detected within the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Thus, the distribution of (+)-[125I]MIBT parallels that of other presynaptic cholinergic markers. Co-injection of (+)-[125I]MIBT with 4-aminobenzovesamicol (2b), a potent vesamicol receptor ligand, reduced the levels of radiotracer in the striatum, cortex, and cerebellum by 58, 35, and 9%, respectively. Thus, (+)-[125I]MIBT binds to vesamicol receptors in vivo. In contrast, coadministration of (+)-[125I]MIBT with haloperidol (0.5 mumol/kg), reduced radiotracer levels in the cortex and cerebellum by 34 and 59%, respectively, while increasing the levels in the striatum by 32%. We conclude that although the distribution of (+)-[125I]MIBT qualitatively reflects cholinergic innervation, a fraction of radiotracer in the cortex and cerebellum is bound to sigma receptors.",
