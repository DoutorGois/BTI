     "AB": "As a metabolite of arginine-vasopressin, AVP(4-8) has been shown to have potent memory-enhancing activity and induce a series of physiological and biochemical events in rat brain. The technique known as differential display polymerase chain reaction(DD-PCR)was applied to explore genes induced to be expressed differ-ently by AVP(4-8) in rat hippocampus. Nine different primer pairs were used to perform DD-PCR after reverse transcription, and more than ten differential display fragments were observed. The most remarkable different fragment, dd1, was further cloned and sequenced. Homology searching in Genebank showed that dd1 may be a new gene. Moreover, the results from Northern blot confirmed that dd1 is indeed a gene induced by AVP(4-8).",
