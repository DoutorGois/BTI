     "AB": "Two flavonoids, 4,2',5'-trihydroxy-4'-methoxychalcone (1) and (2S)-6,7,4'-trihydroxyflavan (2), along with fourteen known flavonoids and two other known arylbenzofurans were isolated from the heartwood of Dalbergia odorifera. The structure of compounds 1 and 2 were established by spectroscopic (NMR and MS) analyses. Of the isolates, eight compounds (1, 4, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17) were found to have potent protective effect on glutamate-induced oxidative injury in HT22 cells.",
