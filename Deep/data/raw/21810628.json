     "AB": "CONTEXT: Studies have shown patterns of abnormal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) functional connectivity with other brain areas in schizophrenia and association of these patterns with a putative susceptibility gene (ZNF804A). However, whether these patterns are trait phenomena linked to genetic risk for illness is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that altered DLPFC connectivity is (1) a familial, likely heritable feature of genetic risk for schizophrenia, (2) a novel intermediate phenotype independent of altered DLPFC engagement, and (3) selectively modulated by a polymorphism in ZNF804A. DESIGN: Cross-sectional case-control study using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a working memory task and genotyping of rs1344706 in ZNF804A. SETTING: Research center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 402 subjects (153 cognitively normal controls, 171 healthy siblings of patients with schizophrenia, and 78 patients). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Task-independent and task-dependent physiologic coupling between the DLPFC and other brain \"target\" regions investigated with (1) seeded connectivity and (2) psychophysiological interaction analysis. RESULTS: Siblings and patients showed greater DLPFC \"inefficiency\" than controls. Abnormal DLPFC functional coupling with the hippocampus and, to a lesser degree, the rest of the prefrontal cortex, was observed in patients and siblings when compared with controls using both connectivity analyses. Prefrontal activation and connectivity measures within siblings did not correlate, implying that they were independent phenomena. The ZNF804A genotype significantly modulated DLPFC coupling with the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex but not DLPFC activity in the control group. Similarly, ZNF804A genotype modulated right DLPFC-hippocampal formation coupling in siblings and patients. CONCLUSIONS: Coupling between the DLPFC and hippocampus is compromised in siblings of patients with schizophrenia and is independent of DLPFC engagement. The selective association with a single-nucleotide polymorphism in ZNF804A suggests that this intermediate phenotype proxies a distinct neural system mechanism related to genetic risk for schizophrenia and the biology of this gene.",
