     "AB": "In chronic administration of sodium valproate to rats, significant disorders of structural integrity of the hippocampal gyrus and the neocortex of the temporal lobe, observed in the last two stages of the experiment (after 9 and 12 months), coexisted with increased number of microglial cells and, especially after 12 months, with intense phagocytic activity within these cells. At the ultrastructural level, phagocyte microglial cells were hypertrophied with several broadened processes. Their cytoplasm contained rich lysosomal apparatus, numerous lipofuscin-like structures, lipid droplets and multilaminated bodies. The nuclei of these cells were characteristic oval or round and sometimes triangle in shape with dense and highly clumped heterochromatin, distinctly accumulated under nuclear envelope, and sparse euchromatin. Microglia/macrophages were frequently present in a close vicinity of changed neuronal somata and also close to the altered elements of the neuropil pyramidal layer of the cortex. Microglial response may, together with abnormalities in neurones, astroglia and blood-brain barrier, play a significant role in the development of experimental valproate encephalopathy.",
