     "PG": "1481-8",
     "AB": "Arginine vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing factor are two neuroactive peptides that regulate hypothalamic-pituitary-axis and associated stress response. While the potential antidepressant and anxiolytic profiles of corticotropin-releasing factor 1 antagonists have been well studied, the concept of blockade of vasopressin system as another approach for the treatment of emotional processes has only been made available recently by the synthesis of the first non-peptide antagonist at the V1b receptor, SSR149415. In the present study SSR149415 has been compared with the corticotropin-releasing factor 1 antagonist SSR125543 and with anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs on the response of hippocampal cholinergic and cortical noradrenergic systems to the anxiogenic benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist FG 7142. Acute (0.3-10 mg/kg, i.p.) and long-term administration (10 mg/kg, i.p., 21 days) of SSR149415 and SSR125543 reduced the FG 7142-induced increase in extracellular concentrations of acetylcholine in the hippocampus of anesthetized rats measured by microdialysis. By contrast acute and long-term administration of SSR149415 failed to reduce the FG 7142-induced increase in the release of norepinephrine in the cortex of freely moving rats. The present results demonstrate that the two compounds have similar profiles in a model of activation by an anxiogenic drug of the hippocampal cholinergic system and they suggest that SSR149415 and SSR125543 may have anti-stress anxiolytic and antidepressant effects via a mechanism of action different from classical benzodiazepine ligands and noradrenergic antidepressants.",
