     "AB": "This paper focuses on the role of glycoproteins in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. The effect of the different inhibitors of protein glycosylation, Tunicamycin, Brefeldin A and Swainsonine, on long-term potentiation was studied in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. Bath application of the inhibitors 60 min before and during tetanization did not interfere with the induction of long-term potentiation of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential. However, the potentiation in inhibitor-treated slices decreased to baseline levels during 90-180 min. Significant differences in the potentiation in non-treated slices were detectable 80 min (Tunicamycin), 60 min (Brefeldin A) and 75 min (Swainsonine) after tetanization, thus indicating the prevention of long-term potentiation maintenance. The application of Swainsonine 120 and 240 min after tetanization did not influence the potentiated field excitatory postsynaptic potential. These data demonstrate the need for undisturbed glycoprotein processing in a time window around long-term potentiation induction to maintain later phases of long-term potentiation and essential functional implications of protein glycosylation in mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity.",
