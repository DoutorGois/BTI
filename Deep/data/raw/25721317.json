     "AB": "Hippocampus endogenous neurogenesis has been postulated to play a favorable role in brain restoration after injury. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have been insufficiently deciphered. Here we investigated the potential regulatory capacity of MAPK/ERK signaling on neurogenesis and the associated cognitive performance in prenatally infected neonatal rats. From our data, intrauterine infection could induce hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and promote endogenous repair by evoking neural stem cell proliferation and survival. We also found intrauterine infection could induce increased levels of p-ERK, p-CREB and BDNF, which might be responsible for the potential endogenous rescue system. Furthermore, inhibition of MAPK/ERK signaling could aggravate hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, decrease neurogenesis, and impair the offspring's cognitive performances and could also down-regulate the levels of p-ERK, p-CREB and BDNF. Our data strongly suggest that the activation of MAPK/ERK signaling may play a significant role in promoting survival of newly generated neural stem cells via an anti-apoptotic mechanism, which may be particularly important in endogenous neuroprotection associated with cognitive performance development in prenatally infected rats.",
