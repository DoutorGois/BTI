     "AB": "The glutamate analogue kainic acid (KA) generates convulsions when applied systemically or directly into the brain and produces lesions comparable to those seen in Ammon's horn sclerosis, observed in many patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The neurotoxic actions of KA in-vivo appear to be mediated by a combination of direct effects on neurons and indirect effects mediated by seizures. Understanding the contribution of both direct and indirect effects of KA towards neuronal cell death is important for elucidating excitotoxic mechanisms, which may represent a common final pathway in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders including stroke, traumatic brain injury and epilepsy. We have investigated the effects of mossy fibre innervation on the development of KA toxicity in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures in order to assess the role of this input pathway on the specific toxicity of KA toward CA3 pyramidal neurones in vitro.",
