     "AB": "Amphetamine abuse may be associated with adaptive changes in gene expression in the brain. In the present study, a newly developed cDNA array system comprising mouse KIAA (mKIAA) cDNA clones was used to examine the gene expression affected by chronic methamphetamine treatment. Approximately 800 mKIAA clones were blotted onto a nylon membrane and hybridized with 33P-labeled cDNA derived from mRNAs isolated from the whole brains of mice that had been treated daily with saline or methamphetamine (2 mg/kg, i.p.) for 2 weeks. The arrays displayed robust hybridization for almost all transcripts. The results obtained from five experiments were averaged, each performed with triplicate samples. Several clones were chosen as positive candidates for methamphetamine-induced changes; however, only Per2 and mKIAA0099 genes showed a significantly increased expression (P < .05). Subsequently, with the focus on the period-related proteins, the expression of these proteins in various parts of the rat brain were assessed by immunoblot analysis. Chronic administration of methamphetamine (8 mg/kg, i.p., for 10 days) caused increased Per2 protein expression in the hippocampus. Interestingly, chronic methamphetamine treatment at a lower dose (4 mg/kg, i.p., for 10 days) induced an increase in SCN circadian oscillatory protein (SCOP) expression, also in the hippocampus. These data suggest that long-lasting alterations of the period-related gene expressions in the hippocampus might play an important role in methamphetamine addiction.",
