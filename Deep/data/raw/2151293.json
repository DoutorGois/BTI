     "AB": "By in situ hybridization histochemistry mRNA for GAP-43 is clearly expressed in the carotid body as well as in the sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic ganglia of normal adult rats. The expression of this gene may represent, as one possibility, the potential of the formation of neurite-like processes of the chief cells of the adult carotid body, as well as the ongoing synaptic remodeling of the adult sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons. In addition, a possible involvement of this phosphoprotein in the regulation of the chemosensory transduction in the carotid body should also be considered.",
