     "AB": "Human chromosome 11 is the third gene-rich chromosome having 1304 protein-coding genes. According to the GeneCards, this chromosome contains 240 genes related to diseases, as it is well known as a disease-rich chromosome. Although there are many protein-coding genes, the proteomic identification ratio is rather low. As a model study, human hippocampal tissues from patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy were prepared to evaluate the gene-centric statistics related to the gene expression and disorders of chromosome 11. A total of 8828 protein coding genes from brain tissues were extensively off-gel fractionated and profiled by a high resolution mass spectrometer with collision induced dissociation and electron transfer dissociation. Five-hundred twenty-three of the proteins from brain tissues were determined to belong to chromosome 11, representing 37% of the proteins reported in the Global Proteome Machine Database. We extracted gene clusters from a specific biological process or molecular function in gene ontology, among which the olfactory receptor genes showed the largest cluster on chromosome 11. Analysis of the proteome data set from the hippocampus provides a significant network associated with genes and proteins and leads to new insights into the biological and genetic mechanisms of chromosome 11-specific diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.",
