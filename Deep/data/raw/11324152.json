     "AB": "Effects of herbal formulations were studied on hippocampal neuron cell bodies. Study was carried out in adult Swiss albino rats. Experimental rats (E) were divided into three groups. Group E1 rats were given immobilization stress for 14 hr/day for 30 days. Rats in E2 and E3 group were given daily single dose (40 mg/kg/body wt.) of alcoholic extract of S. anacardium and W. somnifera. After 1 hr giving the plant extract, the rats were subjected to stress. Treatment continued for 14 hr for 30 days. Control rats were kept in complete nonstress condition. Ultrastructural characteristics of neuron cell bodies in hippocampal sublayer (CA1-CA4 and Dg) was studied in rats of E1, E2 and E3 groups and compared with control. Results of the present study demonstrated, that both CA2 and Dg, 85% of neuron cell bodies exhibited degenerating characteristics, (which includes karyorrhexis, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, chromatin fragmentation and intracellular spacing). Interestingly, after the treatment with S. ancardium cells demonstrating degenerating characteristics was significantly reduced (80%) as compared to treatment with W. somnifera. Study suggests that probably both the herbal drugs have cytoprotective properties.",
