     "AB": "Video-enhanced contrast, differential-interference contrast microscopy (VEC-DICM) was used to visualize the cytoarchitecture and subcellular neuronal structure of acute brain slices from rat hippocampus and amygdala. Even at low-power magnification, the VEC-DICM system vastly improved our ability to visualize and examine the gross organization of the tissue. With medium-power magnification, the neuronal somata and proximal dendrites were clearly visible. With high-power magnification, some of the subcellular details could be clearly discerned--including cell nuclei, cell nucleoli, fine dendritic processes, and varicosities that may be synaptic expansions. We conclude that improved optical techniques should be valuable to cellular neurobiologists interested in structure-function relationships in brain slices.",
