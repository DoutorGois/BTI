     "AB": "Mast cell degranulating peptide (MCDP) is a neurotoxic agent isolated from bee venom. It produces a long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. We now report that MCDP, at nanomolar concentrations, induces a reduction of a transient voltage-dependent potassium current (ID) in CA3 rat pyramidal neurons and a persistent (>30 min) enhancement of the frequency of spontaneous miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (m.e.p.s.c.s. and m.i.p.s.c.s.). M.e.p.s.c.s. and m.i.p.s.c.s. were recorded in the presence of bicuculline (30 microM) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 10 microM), respectively. The increased frequency of m.e.p.s.c.s. (408 +/- 60%) and m.i.p.s.c.s. (583 +/- 553%) was independent of the reduction of ID because 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 30 microM - 2 mM) blocked ID but had no effects on m.e.p.s.c.s. and m.i.p.s.c.s. In the presence of the calcium channel blocker manganese (3 mM), MCDP still enhanced the frequency of m.e.p.s.c.s. (326 +/- 162%). It is concluded that MCDP augments the release of excitatory and inhibitory transmitter by an action, which is independent of calcium influx, through voltage-dependent channels.",
