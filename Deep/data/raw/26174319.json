     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Cortical dysplasias (CDs) represent a wide range of cortical abnormalities that closely correlate with intractable epilepsy. Rats prenatally exposed to 1-3-bis-chloroethyl-nitrosurea (BCNU) represent an injury-based model that reproduces many histopathologic features of human CD. Previous studies reported in vivo hyperexcitability in this model, but in vivo epileptogenicity has not been confirmed. METHODS: To determine whether cortical and hippocampal lesions lead to epileptiform discharges and/or seizures in the BCNU model, rats at three different ages (3, 5, and 9 months old) were implanted for long-term video electroencephalographic recording. At the end of the recording session, brain tissue was processed for histologic and immunohistochemical investigation including cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, as a biomarker of epileptogenicity. RESULTS: BCNU-treated rats showed spontaneous epileptiform activity (67%) in the absence of a second seizure-provoking hit. Such activity originated mainly from one hippocampus and propagated to the ipsilateral neocortex. No epileptiform activity was found in age-matched control rats. The histopathologic investigation revealed that all BCNU rats with epileptiform activity showed neocortical and hippocampal abnormalities; the presence and the severity of these lesions did not correlate consistently with the propensity to generate epileptiform discharges. Epileptiform activity was found only in cortical areas of BCNU-treated rats in which a correlation between brain abnormalities and increased pCREB expression was observed. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates the in vivo occurrence of spontaneous epileptiform discharges in the BCNU model and shows that increased pCREB expression can be utilized as a reliable biomarker of epileptogenicity.",
