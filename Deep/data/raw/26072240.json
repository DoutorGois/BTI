     "AB": "Salient events activate the midbrain dopaminergic system and have important impacts on various aspects of mnemonic function, including the stability of hippocampus-dependent memories. Dopamine is also central to modulation of neocortical memory processing, particularly during prefrontal cortex-dependent working memory. Here, we review the current state of the circuitry and physiology underlying dopamine's actions, suggesting that--alongside local effects within hippocampus and prefrontal cortex--dopamine released from the midbrain ventral tegmental area is well positioned to dynamically tune interactions between limbic-cortical circuits through modulation of rhythmic network activity.",
