     "AB": "The effect of naturally occurring cannabinoids, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinol (CBN) and cannabidiol (CBD), on the brain receptors for thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) was investigated. TRH receptors were labeled with 3H-(3-MeHis2)TRH (3H-MeTRH). 3H-MeTRH bound specifically to rat brain membranes at a single high affinity site with a Bmax value of 49.2 +/- 0.96 fmol per mg protein and a Kd value of 3.83 +/- 0.12 nM. The binding of 3H-MeTRH to whole brain membranes was inhibited when rats were injected intraperitoneally with 3 to 30 mg/kg of THC. The extent of inhibition in the binding at 10 and 30 mg/kg was similar. THC (10 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the binding of 3H-MeTRH to amygdala membranes but did not affect the binding to membranes prepared from hippocampus, septum, cortex, striatum and the rest of the brain. THC, CBN and CBD in doses of 3 to 30 mg/kg did not affect the binding of 3H-MeTRH to hypothalamic membranes. All the three cannabinoids at 30 mg/kg inhibited the binding of 3H-MeTRH to amygdala membranes. The inhibition in the binding of 3H-MeTRH by the cannabinoids was due to changes in the Kd values but the Bmax values remained unchanged. It is concluded that both psychotomimetic and nonpsychotomimetic cannabinoids inhibit the binding of 3H-MeTR to amygdala membranes selectively, which is accomplished by decreases in the affinity of the ligand to receptors, and the amygdala may be an important brain area in some of the actions of cannabinoids.",
