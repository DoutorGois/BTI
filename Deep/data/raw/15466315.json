     "AB": "Although past research has highlighted the involvement of limbic structures such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampus in learning, few have addressed the nature of their interaction. The current study of rabbit jaw movement conditioning used a combination of reversible lesions and electrophysiology to examine the involvement of the hippocampus and the ACC during acquisition, performance, and extinction. We found that microinfusions of procaine into the ACC did not significantly alter the rate of behavioral learning or the amplitude of hippocampal conditioned unit responses, but that they disrupted the rhythmic periodicity of conditioned jaw movements. During extinction, whereas controls showed a rapid decline in behavioral CRs and active inhibition of hippocampal unit responses, ACC lesioned rabbits showed a persistence of conditioning-related hippocampal activity and behavioral responding. The results show that the ACC can be important for adaptive suppression of conditioned behavior and suggest a crucial physiological modulation of hippocampus by ACC during extinction.",
