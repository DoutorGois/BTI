     "AB": "Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) have been implicated in the processes of neural development in the brain. In this study, we characterized developmentally regulated brain CS/DS chains using a single chain antibody, GD3G7, produced by the phage display technique. Evaluation of the specificity of GD3G7 toward various glycosaminoglycan preparations showed that this antibody specifically reacted with squid CS-E (rich in the GlcUAbeta1-3GalNAc(4,6-O-sulfate) disaccharide unit E), hagfish CS-H (rich in the IdoUAalpha1-3GalNAc(4,6-O-sulfate) unit iE), and shark skin DS (rich in both E and iE units). In situ hybridization for the expression of N-acetylgalac-tosamine-4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase in the postnatal mouse brain, which is involved in the biosynthesis of CS/DS-E, showed a widespread expression of the transcript in the developing brain except at postnatal day 7, where strong expression was observed in the external granule cell layer in the cerebellum. The expression switched from the external to internal granule cell layer with development. Immunohistochemical localization of GD3G7 in the mouse brain showed that the epitope was relatively abundant in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. GD3G7 suppressed the growth of neurites in embryonic hippocampal neurons mediated by CS-E, suggesting that the epitope is embedded in the neurite outgrowth-promoting motif of CS-E. In addition, a CS-E decasaccharide fraction was found to be the critical minimal structure needed for recognition by GD3G7. Four discrete decasaccharide epitopic sequences were identified. The antibody GD3G7 has broad applications in investigations of CS/DS chains during the central nervous system's development and under various pathological conditions.",
