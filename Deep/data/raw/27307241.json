     "AB": "UNLABELLED: How the integrity of laminar structures in the postnatal brain is maintained impacts neuronal functions. Ndel1, the mammalian homolog of NuDE from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, is an atypical microtubule (MT)-associated protein that was initially investigated in the contexts of neurogenesis and neuronal migration. Constitutive knock-out mice for Ndel1 are embryonic lethal, thereby necessitating the creation a conditional knock-out to probe the roles of Ndel1 in postnatal brains. Here we report that CA1 pyramidal neurons from mice postnatally lacking Ndel1 (Ndel1 conditional knock-out) exhibit fragmented MTs, dendritic/synaptic pathologies, are intrinsically hyperexcitable and undergo dispersion independently of neuronal migration defect. Secondary to the pyramidal cell changes is the decreased inhibitory drive onto pyramidal cells from interneurons. Levels of the glycoprotein Reelin that regulates MTs, neuronal plasticity, and cell compaction are significantly reduced in hippocampus of mutant mice. Strikingly, a single injection of Reelin into the hippocampus of Ndel1 conditional knock-out mice ameliorates ultrastructural, cellular, morphological, and anatomical CA1 defects. Thus, Ndel1 and Reelin contribute to maintain postnatal CA1 integrity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The significance of this study rests in the elucidation of a role for Nde1l and Reelin in postnatal CA1 integrity using a new conditional knock-out mouse model for the cytoskeletal protein Ndel1, one that circumvents the defects associated with neuronal migration and embryonic lethality. Our study serves as a basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying postnatal hippocampal maintenance and function, and the significance of decreased levels of Ndel1 and Reelin observed in patients with neurological disorders.",
