     "AB": "Epidemiological studies suggest that the treatments of anti-inflammatory agents and anti-oxidants slow the progress of neurological diseases. Lignans are anti-oxidants and phytoestrogens found in a variety of plants. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of macelignan on glutamate-induced neurotoxicity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in murine hippocampal HT22 cell line. Macelignan significantly attenuated the ROS production and neurotoxicity induced by glutamate in HT22 cell. Also, the properties of macelignan as an anti-inflammatory agent were investigated in microglials activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It potently suppressed the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, that consequently resulted in the reduction of nitric oxide in LPS-treated microglial cells. It also significantly suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. These results suggest that macelignan possesses therapeutic potentials against neurodegenerative diseases with oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.",
