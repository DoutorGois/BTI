     "AB": "To study possible cellular targets and subcellular sites of action of opioid ligands in the rat hippocampus, we examined the distribution of the delta opioid receptor (DOR) by immunocytochemistry. By light microscopy, numerous interneurons, or non-principal cells, were intensely labeled for DOR, whereas the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells were lightly labeled. DOR-immunoreactive interneurons were found throughout the hippocampus but were particularly concentrated in stratum oriens of the CA1 region. Double labeling immunofluorescence revealed that DOR-immunoreactivity was found in a subpopulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing interneurons, which included most somatostatin-immunoreactive cells. Electron microscopic analysis of sections singly labeled for DOR revealed that DOR-immunoreactive profiles were abundant and widespread throughout all hippocampal lamina and had a similar distribution in CA1 and CA3. DOR-immunoreactivity was sometimes found in dendrites, which corresponded in morphology to those of interneurons. In addition, DOR-labeling was found in the shafts and spines of many dendrites, which exhibited the morphology of pyramidal cell dendrites. Within dendrites, dense DOR-immunoreactivity was associated with the plasmalemmal surface at or near the postsynaptic density, usually of asymmetric synapses. In addition, DOR labeling was present in a heterogeneous population of axon terminals, as well as in astrocytic profiles. At mossy fiber synapses, DOR labeling was occasionally found at both pre-and post-synaptic sites. These studies demonstrate that DOR is present at multiple sites on diverse cell types where it may function to regulate neuronal activity in the hippocampus.",
