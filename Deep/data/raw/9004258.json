     "AB": "The present study examined changes in angiotensin receptors (AT1 and AT2) and angiotensinogen mRNA level after global ischemia in the rat brain. The AT2 mRNA level increased by three-fold in both the cortex and hippocampus, which are known to be sensitive to ischemic injury, 3 h after ischemia. The increase thus appeared only during the early reperfusion period. In the striatum, amygdala and cerebellum, the level increased moderately 3 h and/or 24 h after ischemia; there was no change in the hypothalamus. On the other hand, the AT1A and AT1B receptor mRNA levels were not altered in the cortex or hippocampus during the early reperfusion period, even 3 h and 24 h after ischemia. There was no significant alteration in angiotensinogen mRNA level 3 h or 24 h after ischemia. These results suggest that the transient upregulation of AT2 receptor mRNA occurs in the cortex and hippocampus after injury and these changes may be in some way related to the molecular events which lead to delayed neuronal cell death.",
