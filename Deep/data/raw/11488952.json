     "AB": "Neuronal fibres of the hippocampal formation of normal and chronic epileptic rats were investigated by fluorescent tracing methods using the pilocarpine model of limbic epilepsy. Two months after onset of spontaneous limbic seizures, hippocampal slices were prepared and maintained in vitro for 10 h. Small crystals of fluorescent dye [fluorescein (fluoro-emerald) and tetramethylrhodamine (fluoro-ruby)] were applied to different hippocampal regions. The main findings were: (i) in control rats there was no supragranular labelling when the mossy fibre tract was stained in stratum radiatum of area CA3. However, in epileptic rats a fibre network in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus was retrogradely labelled; (ii) a retrograde innervation of area CA3 by CA1 pyramidal cells was disclosed by labelling remote CA1 neurons after dye injection into the stratum radiatum of area CA3 in chronic epileptic rats; (iii) labelling of CA1 neurons apart from the injection site within area CA1 was observed in epileptic rats but not in control animals; and (iv), a subicular-hippocampal projection was present in pilocarpine-treated rats when the tracer was injected just below the stratum pyramidale of area CA1. The findings show that fibre rearrangement in distinct regions of the epileptic hippocampal formation can occur as an aftermath of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus.",
