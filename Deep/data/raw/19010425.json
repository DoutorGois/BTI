     "AB": "Late-onset depression often precedes the onset of dementia associated with the hippocampal degeneration. Using large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM), we evaluated apolipoprotein E epsilon-4 allele (apoE E4) effects on hippocampal volume and shape in 38 depressed patients without the apoE E4, 14 depressed patients with one apoE E4, and 31 healthy comparison subjects without the apoE E4. The hippocampal volumes were manually assessed. We applied a diffeomorphic template generation procedure for creating the hippocampal templates based on a subset of the population. The LDDMM mappings were used to generate the hippocampal shape of each subject and characterize the surface deformation of each hippocampus relative to the template. Such deformation was modeled as random field characterized by the Laplace-Beltrami basis functions in the template coordinates. Linear regression was used to examine group differences in the hippocampal volume and shape. We found that there were significant hippocampal shape alternations in both depressed groups while the groups of depressed patients and the group of healthy subjects did not differ in the hippocampal volume. The depressed patients with one apoE E4 show more pronounced shape inward-compression in the anterior CA1 than the depressed patients without the apoE E4 when compared with the healthy controls without the apoE E4. Thus, hippocampal shape abnormalities in late-onset depressed patients with one apoE E4 may indicate future conversion of this group to AD at higher risk than depressed patients without the apoE E4.",
