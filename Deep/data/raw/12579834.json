     "AB": "AIM: To investigate the effects of melatonin (MT) on histology and behavioral tests during global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in gerbils. METHODS: Global cerebral ischemia was induced by occluding the bilateral common carotid arteries for 10 min in gerbils. Three doses of MT were administrated intraperitoneally 30 min prior to the onset of ischemia. Locomotor activity was measured by using the open field method 3 and 7 days after the ischemic episode. T maze test was carried out 4, 5 and 6 days after ischemia to assess the working memory of gerbils. Neuronal damage was assessed in CA1 pyramidal layer of gerbil hippocampus and evaluated 7 days after ischemia. RESULTS: MT significantly reversed the locomotor activity increases, ameliorated learning and working memory deficit, and reduced the extent of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells injury after transient global cerebral ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil. CONCLUSION: MT provides significantly protective effect against both histological and behavioral consequences of global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in gerbils.",
