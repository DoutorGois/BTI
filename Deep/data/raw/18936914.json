     "AB": "RATIONALE: There are marked individual differences in the efficacy of mainstream nicotine cessation agents in preventing relapse. A rat model of novelty-seeking phenotype was reported to have predictive value for psychostimulant taking behavior where locomotor reactivity to novelty is used to rank high (HR, highest 1/3) versus low (LR, lowest 1/3) responsiveness to novelty in outbred rats. We tested the hypothesis that a cannabinoid receptor (CB) 1 antagonist that is in clinical trials for smoking cessation may reverse behaviorally sensitizing effects of nicotine in HRs and repeated nicotine-induced elevations in hippocampal 5HT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adolescent LRHR rats underwent intermittent behavioral sensitization to nicotine regimen with or without a CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 or bupropion treatment following nicotine training during 1 week of nicotine-free period. Expression of behavioral sensitization to nicotine was assessed in response to a low-dose nicotine challenge. Using the same sensitization regimen and therapeutic treatments, hippocampal 5HT levels were measured via in vivo microdialysis in response to the nicotine challenge. RESULTS: HR but not LR animals showed behavioral sensitization to a low-dose nicotine challenge following intermittent nicotine training and 1 week of injection-free period. AM251 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) but not bupropion administration during injection-free period successfully reversed locomotor sensitization to nicotine challenge in HRs. AM251 treatment also reversed nicotine-induced elevations in extracellular 5HT in the HR hippocampal hilus. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that CB1 antagonists may prevent locomotor sensitization to nicotine and reverse nicotine-induced elevations in hippocampal 5HT in high novelty seekers.",
