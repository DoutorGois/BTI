     "AB": "The recent immunological demonstration of advanced glycation end products (AGE) of the Maillard reaction in several human tissues suggests a possible involvement of AGE in the aging process. We previously prepared a monoclonal anti-AGE antibody (6D12) which recognized N epsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine. We examined, immunohistochemically, the effect of aging on AGE-immunoreactivity in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in ten brain tissue samples obtained at autopsy from subjects aged 20-85 years old. Using 6D12 antibody, our results demonstrated a positive correlation between AGE-immunoreactivity in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and age. A more intense immunoreaction was observed in the CA3-4 pyramidal neurons compared with that of the CA1 neurons, known to be vulnerable to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Our results suggest that AGE are probably involved in the aging process affecting the human central nervous system, and that AGE do not mainly contribute to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, at least in the CA1 neurons.",
