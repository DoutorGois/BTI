     "AB": "The effects of the intraventricular administration of aluminum chloride (AlCl3) on high affinity choline transport (HAChT) and norepinephrine concentration were examined in the hippocampus of the rat. Controlling for osmolarity and pH, the intraventricular administration of AlCl3 resulted in a dose-related reduction in both variables with relative selectivity for HAChT. Moreover, the neurotoxicity of intraventricular aluminum appeared to be dependent on the forms of the aluminum salt administered.",
