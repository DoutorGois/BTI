     "AB": "Research into the molecular mechanisms of epileptic brain injury is hampered by the resistance of key mouse strains to seizure-induced neuronal death evoked by systemically administered excitotoxins such as kainic acid. Because C57BL/6 mice are extensively employed as the genetic background for transgenic/knockout modeling in cell death research but are seizure resistant, we sought to develop a seizure model in this strain characterized by injury to the hippocampal CA subfields. Adult male C57BL/6 mice underwent focally evoked seizures induced by intraamygdala microinjection of kainic acid. Kainic acid (KA) effectively elicited ipsilateral CA3 pyramidal neuronal death within a narrow dose range of 0.1-0.3 microg, with mortality < 10%. With employment of the most consistent (0.3 microg) dose, seizures were terminated 15, 30, 60, or 90 min after KA by diazepam. Damage was largely restricted to the ipsilateral CA3 subfield of the hippocampus, but injury was also consistent within CA1, suggesting that this mouse model better reflects the hippocampal neuropathology of human temporal lobe epilepsy than does the rat, in which CA1 is typically spared. Confirming this CA1 injury as seizure specific and not a consequence of ischemia, we used laser-Doppler flowmetry to determine that cerebral perfusion did not significantly change (97% to 118%) over control. Degenerating cells were > 95% neuronal as determined by neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) counterstaining of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeled (TUNEL) brain sections. Furthermore, TUNEL-positive cells often exhibited the morphological features of apoptosis, and small numbers were positive for cleaved caspase-3. These data establish a mouse model of focally evoked seizures in the C57BL/6 strain associated with a restricted pattern of apoptotic neurodegeneration within the hippocampal subfields that may be applied to research into the molecular basis of neuronal death after seizures.",
