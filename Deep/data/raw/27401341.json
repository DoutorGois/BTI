     "AB": "The present study was conducted to assess the toxic effect of e-cigarette refill liquid on cognitive and motor functions in adult rats. Animals were administered 28 mul/kg of body weight of e-liquid with/without a dose of 0.5 mg of nicotine/kg of body weight, using the intraperitoneally route for a period of 4 weeks. They were then evaluated by novel object recognition test (NORT) and spontaneous alternation T-maze test for cognitive functions. Results indicated that e-liquid without nicotine induced, in the NORT, a decrease in time exploring the novel object during the test session and lower discrimination and recognition indexes compared to control and e-liquid with nicotine treated rats. Furthermore, short-term spatial memory was affected after e-liquid treatment in the spontaneous alternation T-maze test, identifying recognition memory impairments. However, none of the treatments altered motor functions assessed by inclined plane test, Kondziela's inverted screen test and weights test. Cell cytotoxicity assessment following e-liquid exposure showed a significant decrease in hippocampal cell viability, but no change in cortical cell viability. Thereby, e-liquid without nicotine causes cognitive impairments, especially on the hippocampus. Based on these results, more extensive assessments on e-cigarettes must be carried out.",
