     "AB": "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: This study is aimed at investigating neurochemical changes in scopolamine (SCP)-induced memory impairment using spatially localized in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the hippocampus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups of mice (eight mice per group) were scanned after the injection of different SCP doses: 0, 1, 3, and 5 mg/kg (intraperitoneally). All the animals received (1)H MRS of their hippocampus at two time intervals: 30 minutes and 72 hours after SCP injection. RESULTS: This work demonstrated that the doses of 3 mg/kg SCP or higher reduce the concentration of total choline-containing compounds, and these levels returned to baseline after 72 hours. These results are consistent with observations made by others using more invasive brain dialysis approaches. The levels of glutamate and glutamic compounds (glutamate + glutamine) were slightly changed at 3 and 5 mg/kg SCP dose, but the differences were not statistically significant (P > .05). These findings suggest that SCP produces transient, in vivo measurable alterations in the cholinergic system in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: On this basis, we conclude that in vivo MRS is a feasible noninvasive method to probe aspects of the alterations induced by SCP in the cholinergic neurotransmission pathways in both animal models and human studies of memory impairment.",
