     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of the excitatory synaptic inputs plasticity in the hippocampus is believed to underlie certain types of learning and memory. Especially, stressful experiences, well known to produce long-lasting strong memories of the event themselves, enable LTD by low frequency stimulation (LFS, 3 Hz) but block LTP induction by high frequency stimulation (HFS, 200 Hz). However, it is unknown whether stress-affected synaptic plasticity has an impact on the output plasticity. Thus, we have simultaneously studied the effects of stress on synaptic plasticity and neuronal output in the hippocampal CA1 region of anesthetized Wistar rats. Our results revealed that stress increased basal power spectrum of the evoked synchronized-spikes and enabled LTD induction by LFS. The induction of stress-facilitated LTD but not LFS induced persistent decreases of the power spectrum of the synchronized-spikes and the frequency of the spontaneous unitary discharges; However, HFS induced LTP in non-stressed animals and increased the power spectrum of the synchronized-spikes, without affecting the frequency of the spontaneous unitary discharges, but HFS failed to induce LTP in stressed animals without affecting the power spectrum of the synchronized-spikes and the frequency of the spontaneous unitary discharges. These observations that stress-facilitated LTD induces the output plasticity through the synchronized-spikes and spontaneous unitary discharges suggest that these types of stress-related plasticity may play significant roles in distribution, amplification and integration of encoded information to other brain structures under stressful conditions.",
