     "AB": "Our previous experiments indicated an age- and sex-dependent functional lateralization of a high-affinity choline uptake system in hippocampi of Wistar rats. The system is connected with acetylcholine synthesis and also plays a role in spatial navigation. The current study demonstrates that a single in vivo exposure of 7- or 14-day-old males to a static magnetic field of 0.14 T for 60-120 min evokes asymmetric alterations in the activity of carriers in adulthood. Namely, the negative field (antiparallel orientation with a vertical component of the geomagnetic field) mediated a more marked decrease in the right hippocampus. The positive field (parallel orientation) was ineffective. Moreover, differences between the carriers from the right and the left hippocampi were observed on synaptosomes pretreated with superparamagnetic nanoparticles and exposed for 30 min in vitro. The positive field enhanced more markedly the activity of carriers from the right hippocampus, the negative that from the left hippocampus, on the contrary. Our results demonstrate functionally teratogenic risks of the alterations in the orientation of the strong static magnetic field for postnatal brain development and suggest functional specialization of both hippocampi in rats. Choline carriers could be involved as secondary receptors in magnetoreception through direct effects of geomagnetic field on intracellular magnetite crystals and nanoparticles applied in vivo should be a useful tool to evaluate magnetoreception in future research.",
