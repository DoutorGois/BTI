     "AB": "G protein expression has been shown to be modulated by circulating plasma corticosterone in young animals. A loss of G protein expression regulation by corticosterone in the elderly could explain declines in the function of G protein-coupled receptors and their effective signal transduction processes in the nervous system found in normal and pathological aging. In this study, adrenalectomized 3- and 18-months-old female Fischer 344 rats were exposed to low, moderate or high levels of plasma corticosterone to determine the effect of this hormone on Gi protein expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Basal Gi protein expression, assessed by Western blot analysis, did not vary across age in either brain region. Hippocampal Gi protein levels increased following moderate and high corticosterone administration in the 3-months old animals (125%; P < 0.05) but not in the 18-months old animals. In contrast, in the frontal cortex, Gi protein expression increased significantly in the 18-months-old group (93%; P < 0.05) following exposure to high concentrations of corticosterone. These results suggest that steroid hormones, specifically corticosterone, may differentially modulate neurotransmitter-G protein coupling in an age-dependent manner.",
