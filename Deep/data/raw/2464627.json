     "AB": "The hippocampi of two 1-year-old female baboons (Papio anubis) were used for a combined Golgi/electron microscope (EM) study of characteristic cell types in the hippocampus proper and fascia dentata. Results were compared with previous Golgi/EM studies of hippocampal neurons in small laboratory animals. Cell bodies of pyramidal neurons in CA1 were more loosely distributed than known from studies on the rat or guinea pig. Numerous basal and horizontal dendrites originating from the perikaryon filled in the space between neighboring cell bodies. Apical stem dendrites were varying in length, depending on the position of the parent cell body in outer or inner portions of the pyramidal layer. Dendrites were densely covered with spines which in the EM showed very complex synaptic contacts. In contrast to our observations in rats and guinea pigs, CA3 pyramidal cells in the monkey hippocampus exhibited numerous large spines or excrescences not only on apical dendrites but also on basal dendrites running through stratum oriens. These excrescences appeared to be more complex than in small rodents. They often branched, protruding deeply into presynaptic mossy fiber boutons, and formed multiple asymmetric synaptic contacts. Granule cells of the monkey fascia dentata, in contrast to those of the rodent, occasionally had basal dendrites extending into the hilar region. In the EM, granule cells either with or without basal dendrites exhibited fine structural characteristics that were very similar to those described in Golgi/EM studies of granule cells in the rat fascia dentata. Of the various types of nonpyramidal neurons the horizontal cells in stratum oriens with dendrites parallel to the alveus were analyzed. As seen in rats, these cells exhibited large amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum, indentations of the nuclear membrane, and nuclear inclusions. Numerous terminals formed synaptic contacts on dendritic shafts. In contrast to rodents, numerous spines arose from dendrites and cell bodies of these neurons. In the EM, often single spines were found to establish synaptic contacts with several presynaptic boutons. In summary, our correlated light and EM study of four characteristic cell types, which are present in both nonprimates and primates, demonstrates a much more complex dendritic pattern and synaptic organization of these neurons in primates than in commonly studied small laboratory animals.",
