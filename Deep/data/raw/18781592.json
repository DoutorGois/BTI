     "AB": "This article describes a large multi-institutional analysis of the shape and structure of the human hippocampus in the aging brain as measured via MRI. The study was conducted on a population of 101 subjects including nondemented control subjects (n = 57) and subjects clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease (AD, n = 38) or semantic dementia (n = 6) with imaging data collected at Washington University in St. Louis, hippocampal structure annotated at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and anatomical shapes embedded into a metric shape space using large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) at the Johns Hopkins University. A global classifier was constructed for discriminating cohorts of nondemented and demented subjects based on linear discriminant analysis of dimensions derived from metric distances between anatomical shapes, demonstrating class conditional structure differences measured via LDDMM metric shape (P < 0.01). Localized analysis of the control and AD subjects only on the coordinates of the population template demonstrates shape changes in the subiculum and the CA1 subfield in AD (P < 0.05). Such large scale collaborative analysis of anatomical shapes has the potential to enhance the understanding of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.",
