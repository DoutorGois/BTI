     "AB": "We investigated whether ischemic tolerance can be induced repeatedly in the gerbil hippocampal neurons. The gerbils were firstly treated with two episodes of 2-min forebrain ischemia 1 day apart, which procedure is known to induce ischemic tolerance. After 4 weeks of recirculation, the animals were subjected to a 2-min period of preconditioning ischemia again and then to a 3-min period of ischemia after 3 days. The hippocampal CA1 neurons were destroyed 7 days after 3-min ischemia without the second preconditioning but not in animals with the second preconditioning. Thus, ischemic tolerance can be induced repeatedly when the first ischemic tolerance has disappeared.",
