     "AB": "The present study was designed to replicate previously reported findings of abnormal frontal and/or temporal cerebral blood flow in violent offenders and to control for the influence of major mental disorder (MMD), substance abuse, and current medication. HMPAO-SPECT-CBF and MRI scans from pretrial forensic psychiatric investigations of 21 subjects convicted of impulsive violent crimes were retrospectively re-evaluated. In 16/21 subjects, visual assessment of SPECT scans showed some hypoperfusion in the temporal and/or frontal lobes. MRI showed no corresponding structural damage. Quantified regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in defined regions of interest was compared between index cases and 11 healthy control subjects. Index subjects had significant reductions in the right angular gyrus and the right medial temporal gyrus, bilaterally in the hippocampus, and in the left white frontal matter, but they had significantly increased rCBF in the parietal association cortex bilaterally. The aberrations were as frequent and severe among the subjects without MMD, substance abuse, and current medication (n=7) as in the entire group of index subjects.",
