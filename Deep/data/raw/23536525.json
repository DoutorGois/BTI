     "AB": "Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events play a key role in memory formation and various protein kinases and phosphatases have been firmly associated with memory performance. Here, we determined expression changes of protein kinases and phosphatases following retrieval of spatial memory in CD1 mice in a Morris Water Maze task, using antibody microarrays and confirmatory Western blot. Comparing changes following single and consecutive retrieval, we identified stably and differentially expressed kinases, some of which have never been implicated before in memory functions. On the basis of these findings we define a small signaling network associated with spatial memory retrieval. Moreover, we describe differential regulation and correlation of expression levels with behavioral performance of polo-like kinase 1. Together with its recently observed genetic association to autism-spectrum disorders our data suggest a role of this kinase in balancing preservation and flexibility of learned behavior.",
