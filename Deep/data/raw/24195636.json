     "AB": "In continuance of our search for anticonvulsant agents, we reported herein the synthesis, characterization and anticonvulsant evaluation of some newer semicarbazone analogues. A few compounds were also screened for neuroprotection assay. Some of the compounds showed significant anticonvulsant activity. Compound 4a showed 25% (1/4, 0.25 h), 75% (3/4, 0.5 & 2.0 h) and 100% (4/4, 1.0 h) protection against 6 Hz psychomotor seizure test at 100 mg/kg devoid of any neurotoxicity. Compound 4d showed neuroprotection activity with 26.3 +/- 2.3 percent of total propidium iodide uptake at 100 muM and IC50 of the compound was calculated using dose response curve by probit analysis and was found to be 149 +/- 1.22 muM.",
