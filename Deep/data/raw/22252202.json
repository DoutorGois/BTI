     "AB": "A novel gene encoding 55 amino-acid residues has been identified from the brooding pouch cDNA library of Hippocampus kuda Bleeker. The deduced amino-acid sequence is highly homologous to several pleurocidin-like peptides from the winter flounder and comprises a signal peptide, a pro-peptide and a mature peptide. The glycine-rich mature peptide, designated HKPLP, contains 24 amino-acid residues and has been synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis. The purified HKPLP exhibits antimicrobial activity against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains at low concentrations (MIC 1.5-7.5 muM). Thermal stability assay data show good heat stability. CD spectroscopy experiments indicate that the dominant contents are anti-parallel and parallel sheets, which may have beta-sheet or beta-strand motif. It is inferred that HKPLP participates in the host defense during egg fertilization and embryo development as an antimicrobial peptide in brooding pouch.",
