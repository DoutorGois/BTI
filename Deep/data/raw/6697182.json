     "AB": "A simplified in vitro immunization procedure has been developed for the production of monoclonal antibodies against a variety of neural antigens. The procedure, which can be applied to both soluble and membrane-bound antigens, involves the addition of an adjuvant peptide, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine, and has been found to improve all fusion parameters.",
