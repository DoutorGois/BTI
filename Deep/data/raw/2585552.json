     "AB": "Dextromethorphan (DM) is an antitussive with anticonvulsant activity that binds to high- and low-affinity sites in guinea pig brain homogenates. We examined the autoradiographic localization of [3H]DM using the anticonvulsant ropizine, an allosteric modifier that decreases the dissociation rate of [3H]DM. Competition studies demonstrated that the binding to brain sections was identical to that of brain homogenates [Craviso and Musacchio: Mol Pharmacol 23:629-640, 1983b]. Computer-assisted quantitative analysis of the autoradiographic images demonstrated that [3H]DM binds to discrete structures throughout the brain, but with higher density in the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. The most intense labeling was observed in the rhabdoid, dorsal raphe, median raphe, caudal linear raphe nuclei, and cranial motor nerve nuclei. The central gray showed moderate to high-density labeling throughout its entire rostro-caudal extent, with very high binding in the dorsal tegmental nucleus and the locus coeruleus. Moderate and high binding was also seen in several hypothalamic structures. Distinct bands of moderate binding were seen in the pyramidal cell layer of the piriform cortex, the retrosplenial cortex, the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus, the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, and the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum. The striking similarity between the binding distribution of [3H]DM and sigma ligands, plus competition studies in brain homogenate, support the hypothesis that DM and sigma ligands share a common high-affinity binding site [Musacchio et al: Mol Pharmacol 35:1-5, 1989]. The distribution of [3H]DM binding provides possible anatomical substrates for both the antitussive and anticonvulsant actions of DM.",
