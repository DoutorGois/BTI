     "AB": "The discovery of a series of chromeno[3,4-c]pyridin-5-ones with selective affinity for the dopamine D4 receptor is described. Target compounds were tested for binding to cloned human dopamine D2, D3, and D4 receptor subtypes expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K-1 cells. Several compounds demonstrated single digit nanomolar Ki values for binding to the D4 receptor with several hundred-fold selectivities toward the D2 and D3 receptors. A limited SAR study of this series is discussed. In a mitogenesis assay measuring [3H]thymidine uptake, the target compounds showed antagonist to weak partial agonist activity at the D4 receptor, with intrinsic activities ranging from 0 to 35%. Compound 6, 3-benzyl-8-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrochromeno[3,4-c]pyridin-5-one, increased DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) synthesis 84% in the hippocampus and 10% in the striatum of rat brain when dosed orally at 10 mg/kg.",
