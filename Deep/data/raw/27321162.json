     "AB": "Recently, protein kinase M zeta (PKMzeta) has emerged as an important player for maintaining memory. It has been reported that PKMzeta regulates the trafficking of GluA2 in postsynaptic membranes to maintain memory. However, there has been no study on PKMzeta outside the synaptic region regarding memory maintenance. Here, we found that PKMzeta is transported to the nucleus in a neural activity-dependent manner. Moreover, we found that PKMzeta phosphorylates CREB-binding protein (CBP) at serine residues and that PKMzeta inhibition reduces the acetylation of histone H2B and H3. Finally, we showed that the amnesic effect of PKMzeta inhibition can be rescued by enhancing histone acetylation level. These results suggest the possibility that nuclear PKMzeta has a crucial role in memory maintenance.",
