     "AB": "A 21-year-old male presented with temporal lobe epilepsy associated with a venous angioma in the ipsilateral frontal lobe, presenting as intractable complex partial seizures. Neuroimaging showed a cerebral venous angioma in the right dorsolateral and opercular frontal lobe, and atrophy of the right hippocampus. As the ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) obtained with subdural electrodes indicated spike discharges initiating from the right mesial temporal lobe, temporal lobectomy was performed. The patient was seizure-free after the operation. Patients with epilepsy who have a cerebral venous angioma require precise analysis of the seizure pattern and an ictal EEG because of cerebral venous angioma may be associated with an another epileptogenic lesion which is surgically treatable.",
