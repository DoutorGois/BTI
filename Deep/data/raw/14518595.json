     "AB": "The distribution in parts of the brain and internal organs of 125J-labeled leucopyrokinin (LPK), an insect myotropic peptide injected into the lateral brain ventricle was determined in rats. A high accumulation of this peptide in adrenals and in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of the brain was found. A lesser but significant LPK accumulation in other internal organs and parts of the brain was also observed. The significance of this effect for the biological activity of LPK in rats is discussed.",
