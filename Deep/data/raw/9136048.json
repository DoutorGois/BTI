     "AB": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of prenatal protein deprivation on the postnatal development of the mossy fiber plexus of the hippocampal formation on postnatal (P) days 15, 30, 90, and 220. Although there is extensive information about the effects of malnutrition on cell body and dendrite morphology, little attention has been paid to axons or axon plexuses. The mossy fiber plexus represents the dentate gyrus granule cell axonal projection to areas CA4 and CA3 of the hippocampal formation and is readily demonstrated with Timm's heavy metal stain. With the use of this stain, the plexus was measured at 13 levels throughout the hippocampal complex. There was no effect of the diet on the anatomical distribution of the plexus. The current study, however, does show significant effects of prenatal protein malnutrition on postnatal development of the mossy fiber plexus that are age dependent. The prenatally malnourished rats show significant deficits in the total rostro-caudal extent and volume of the plexus on P15, P90, and P220, with the most marked dietary effect on P220. There was no significant diet effect on P30 in either extent or volume.",
