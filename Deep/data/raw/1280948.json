     "AB": "The N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) subtypes of glutamate receptors have been shown to play critical roles in various forms of synaptic plasticity (i.e., learning and memory, long-term potentiation). We previously demonstrated that the binding of [3H]AMPA to the AMPA subtype of glutamate receptors was selectively increased in hippocampus following classical conditioning of the rabbit nictitating membrane response in a delay paradigm. We report here that the same effect was observed in a variant of this learning paradigm that requires the participation of the hippocampus, i.e., trace conditioning of the rabbit nictitating membrane. The binding of [3H]TCP (N-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclo-hexyl]-3,4-piperidine) to the NMDA receptor remained unchanged in all the experimental groups tested. Paired presentations of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli resulted in an increased binding of [3H]AMPA, an agonist of the AMPA receptors, in several hippocampal subfields while the binding of an antagonist, [3H]CNQX (6-nitro-7-cyanoquinoxaline-2,3-dione), was decreased. The results suggest that the learning-induced changes in binding of the ligands to the AMPA receptor reflect changes in affinity of the receptor rather than in the number of sites. These results support the hypothesis that changes in hippocampal glutamate receptors are a corollary of synaptic plasticity in certain forms of learning.",
