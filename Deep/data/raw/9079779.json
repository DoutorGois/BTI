     "AB": "The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the functional contributions of various limbic structures to locomotion and stereotypy induced by dopaminergic drugs. Female rats were randomly assigned to one of 5 groups (n = 10-14 rats/group) that received either a lesion of the hippocampus (colchicine + kainic acid), basolateral amygdala (quinolinic acid), frontal cortex (aspiration), nucleus accumbens (ibotenic acid), or served as unoperated controls. Beginning at least 2 weeks following surgery locomotion (measured as photocell beam breaks) elicited by D-amphetamine (0.0, 0.32, 1.0 and 3.2 mg/kg), SKF 82958 (0.0, 0.04, 0.08 and 0.16 mg/kg) or quinpirole (0.0, 0.25, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) was determined. In agreement with previous results rats with hippocampal lesions were hyperactive in response to amphetamine. In comparison to these changes in drug-induced locomotion, lesions of the basolateral amygdala, and frontal cortex had only minor effects on drug-induced locomotion. Lesions of the nucleus accumbens produced consistent hyperactivity that was suppressed by doses of amphetamine or quinpirole that elicited behavioral stereotypy. These results provide evidence suggesting that, in comparison to other limbic structures that have substantial inputs to the nucleus accumbens, the hippocampus play a relatively prominent role in the modulation of drug-induced locomotion.",
