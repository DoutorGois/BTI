     "AB": "The regulated expression of type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA(A)R) subunit genes is postulated to play a role in neuronal maturation, synaptogenesis, and predisposition to neurological disease. Increases in GABA levels and changes in GABA(A)R subunit gene expression, including decreased beta1 mRNA levels, have been observed in animal models of epilepsy. Persistent exposure to GABA down-regulates GABA(A)R number in primary cultures of neocortical neurons, but the regulatory mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report the identification of a TATA-less minimal promoter of 296 bp for the human GABA(A)R beta1 subunit gene that is neuron specific and autologously down-regulated by GABA. beta1 promoter activity, mRNA levels, and subunit protein are decreased by persistent GABA(A)R activation. The core promoter, 270 bp, contains an initiator element (Inr) at the major transcriptional start site. Three concatenated copies of the 10-bp Inr and its immediate 3' flanking sequence produce full neural specific activity that is down-regulated by GABA in transiently transfected neocortical neurons. Taking these results together with those of DNase I footprinting, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, and 2-bp mutagenesis, we conclude that GABA-induced down-regulation of beta1 subunit mRNAs involves the differential binding of a sequence-specific basal transcription factor(s) to the Inr. The results support a transcriptional mechanism for the down-regulation of beta1 subunit GABA(A)R gene expression and raises the possibility that altered levels of sequence-specific basal transcription factors may contribute to neurological disorders such as epilepsy.",
