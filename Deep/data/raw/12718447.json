     "AB": "This study was designed to isolate new genes related to apoptosis in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and to characterize the roles of the genes using both in vitro and in vivo models of oxidative injury. cDNA libraries were prepared from H2O2-treated and -untreated PC12 cells, and a ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9) clone was isolated by a differential screening method. Increase of RPS9 expression in both H2O2-treated PC12 and neuroblastoma (Neuro-2A) cells was shown by Northern blot analysis. Viability of the antisense-transfected Neuro-2A (RPS9-AS) cells following H2O2 treatment was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner. In an in vivo model of transient forebrain ischemia, an increase in RPS9 expression was prominent by 1 day postischemia in the granule cell layer neurons of the dentate gyrus. Both activation of caspase-3 and significant recovery of viability following pretreatment with cycloheximide were shown in RPS9-AS cells treated with H2O2. These data suggest that RPS9 plays a protective role in oxidative injury of neuronal cells.",
