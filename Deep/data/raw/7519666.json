     "AB": "Nitric oxide release is reported to be involved in physiological processes associated with altered sensitivity of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) class of glutamate receptor. A series of compounds liberating nitric oxide were therefore tested for their ability to modulate in vitro the characteristics of [3H]AMPA binding to sections of rat brain. Pretreatment of forebrain or cerebellar sections with sodium nitroprusside (1 mM), S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP, 200 microM), glyceryl trinitrate (1 microM), or isosorbide dinitrate (0.5 mM) all increased the binding of 3 nM [3H]AMPA by 15-30%. These actions were reproduced by 8-bromo-cyclic GMP (200 microM) in the cerebellum but not in the forebrain. In a similar manner, the effect of SNAP was attenuated by an inhibitor of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase in the cerebellum but not in the forebrain. The elevated [3H]AMPA binding observed after pretreatment with SNAP was caused by an increase in binding affinity, but the capacity of the sites was unchanged. Autoradiographic analysis showed that forebrain binding was enhanced in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus but not in the striatum. Nitric oxide therefore appears to be able to increase the affinity of AMPA binding sites via two distinct mechanisms in different brain areas. This action may contribute to synaptic plasticity associated with nitric oxide release.",
