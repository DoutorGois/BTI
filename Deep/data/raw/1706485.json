     "AB": "Binding sites for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) were labelled with [3H](2-Me-His3)TRH ([3H]MeTRH) on membranes from rat brain regions at 0 degrees C for 5 h. Amygdaloid membranes bound [3H]MeTRH with high-affinity (Kd = 3.1 +/- 0.5 nM (n = 4)). Five TRH analogs competed for this binding with the same rank order and with affinities that matched the pharmacological specificity of pituitary TRH receptors. Substance P (SP) and its C-terminal fragments reduced amygdaloid TRH receptor binding in a concentration dependent manner (IC50 for SP = 65 microM). The rank order of potency of SP analogs at inhibiting TRH receptor binding was: SP greater than nonapeptide (3-11) greater than hexapeptide (6-11) greater than heptapeptide (5-11) greater than pentapeptide (7-11). However, other tachykinins were inactive in this system. SP was a potent inhibitor of [3H]MeTRH binding in hippocampus greater than spinal cord greater than retina greater than n. accumbens greater than hypothalamus greater than amygdaloid greater than olfactory bulb greater than or equal to pituitary greater than pons/medulla in parallel assays. In amygdaloid membranes SP (50 microM) reduced the apparent maximum receptor density by 39% (p less than 0.01) without altering the binding affinity, and 100 microM SP induced a biphasic dissociation of [3H]MeTRH with kinetics faster than those induced by both TRH (10 microM) and serotonin (100 microM). In contrast, other neuropeptides such as neurotensin, proctolin, angiotensin II, bombesin and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone did not significantly inhibit [3H]MeTRH binding to amygdaloid membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
