     "AB": "The role of the habenular complex (Hbc) in the hormonal onset and nonhormonal maintenance of maternal behavior in rats was examined. In Experiment 1, bilateral lesions were produced in the Hbc on Gestational Day (GD) 12. On GD 16, animals were hysterectomized-ovariectomized and given estradiol benzoate (EB); they were then tested for maternal behavior 48 hr later. Hbc lesions delayed the appearance of all components of maternal behavior for several days. In Experiment 2, large Hbc lesions that were produced on Postpartum Day 4 caused only 1- or 2-day deficits in maternal behavior. These data suggest that the Hbc mediates the hormonal onset of maternal behavior. During the postpartum period, however, the importance of the Hbc for maternal behavior diminishes as the hormones of pregnancy become less important.",
