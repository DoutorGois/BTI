     "AB": "Personality is known to influence cognitive and affective functioning as well as the risk of psychiatric disorders. Exploration of the neurobiological correlates of personality traits has the potential to enhance understanding of their significance in development of related psychopathological states. The authors examined the association between individual differences in neuroticism and brain activity in response to threat of electric shocks. Fourteen right-handed healthy men underwent functional MRI during a 5-min experiment that involved repeated presentations of two 30-s alternating conditions. In 1 of these conditions, subjects were told to expect mild but painful electric shocks; there was no possibility of receiving shocks in the other condition. The results revealed that neuroticism correlated positively with the ratings of fear of shock and negatively (indicating suppression) with brain activity from safe to shock conditions in the anterior and posterior cingulate, superior/middle temporal gyrus extending to the hippocampus, precuneus, putamen, thalamus, and middle occipital gyrus. The observations support recent psychophysiological research that has demonstrated reduced processing of pain in subjects with higher levels of neuroticism, especially the anxiety component of this trait.",
