     "AB": "The distribution of the nonconstitutive 72 kDa heat shock protein (HSP) in the brains of rats 24 h following graded periods of hyperthermia was studied immunocytochemically. Hyperthermia induced HSP-72 diffusely in cells throughout the cortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia in a dose dependent manner. The cell morphology and location in white matter appeared non-neuronal. Following ischemia, neuronal HSP expression was prominent. These data raise questions regarding prior reports of hyperthermic induction of neuronal HSP expression and the potential pathogenesis of prior hyperthermia in protection against subsequent neuronal injury from ischemia.",
