     "AB": "Orienting responses are elicited by salient stimuli, and may be indexed by skin conductance responses. Concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging and skin conductance response recording was used to identify neural correlates of orienting to abrupt sensory change (infrequent high pitch oddball 'target' tones embedded in frequent lower pitch 'standard' tones) in 16 healthy participants. 'With skin conductance response' responses to targets were distinguished by preferentially greater activity in the amygdala and ventral medial and lateral frontal cortical regions. By contrast, 'without skin conductance response' responses elicited distinctive activity in the dorsal lateral frontal cortex and supramarginal gyrus. These findings suggest that orienting to unexpected sensory change elicits a network for appraising salience and novelty, whereas, in the absence of orienting, a parallel network for sensory and context evaluation is preferentially engaged.",
