     "AB": "The tumor promoter okadaic acid is a potent and specific inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A and therefore it is a useful tool for studying the participation of protein phosphorylation in cellular processes. Since it has been shown that in cultured neurons OKA behaves as a potent neurotoxin, in the present work we have administered different doses of this compound into the dorsal rat hippocampus, in order to assess its neurotoxicity in vivo. Cresyl violet staining of hippocampal sections revealed that as early as 3 h after injection of 300 ng OKA a notable neurodegeneration occurred in the CA1 subfield, the dentate gyrus, and the hilus, particularly in the former. Neuronal death was more evident at 24 h and at this time the extent of damage was dose-dependent. The process of neuronal death was accompanied by a loss of the microtubule-associated protein MAP2, as assessed by immunocytochemistry. Moreover, OKA treatment resulted in a notable expression of the inducible heat shock protein 72 in the surviving neurons of the injected hippocampus and in the corresponding CA1 and hilus of the apparently normal contralateral hippocampus. The expression of the heat shock protein was partially prevented in the injected hippocampus and completely blocked in the contralateral CA1 region, by the systemic previous administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. These results suggest that protein hyperphosphorylation due to inhibition of phosphatases in vivo induces neuronal stress and subsequent neurodegeneration.",
