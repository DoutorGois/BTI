     "AB": "By use of a simple anticonflict procedure (Vogel test), it was demonstrated that L-pyroglutamic acid (L-pyrrolidone carboxylic acid [L-PCA]), an amino acid naturally occurring in mammalian tissues and fluids, possesses anxiolytic activity. This tissues and fluids, possesses anxiolytic activity. This effect was stereospecific (D-PCA was inactive) and, in the rat, it was not associated with a decrease in motor activity. Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist, did not modify L-PCA actions. Furthermore, anxiolytic doses of the amino acid did not change the content of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the rat cortex and hippocampus. These results suggest that the mechanism of the anxiolytic activity of L-PCA is different from that of the benzodiazepines and of 5-HT1a agonists.",
