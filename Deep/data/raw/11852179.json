     "AB": "Incubation of rat hippocampal slices with a low concentration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; 20 microM; 3 min) elicits a form of long-term depression (LTD). We used this chemical protocol to study the involvement of pre- and postsynaptic protein kinase/phosphatase activity in NMDA receptor-dependent LTD. We determined the phosphorylation states of a pre- and a postsynaptic protein kinase C substrate, B-50/growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) and RC3, respectively, using quantitative immunoprecipitation. NMDA incubation resulted in a 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate-sensitive long-lasting (>60 min) decrease in synaptic efficacy and a concomitant reduction in RC3 phosphorylation. B-50/GAP43 phosphorylation was unaffected. This suggests that NMDA-LTD, in contrast to low frequency-LTD, is only associated with activation of postsynaptic protein phosphatases.",
