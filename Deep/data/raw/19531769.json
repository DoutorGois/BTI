     "AB": "Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease induces oxidative stress through several mechanisms, including stimulation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. We examined NOS activity and expression in the senescence-accelerated mouse P8 (SAMP8) line. The SAMP8 strain develops with aging cognitive impairments, increases in Abeta, and oxidative stress, all reversed by amyloid precursor protein antisense or Abeta antibody treatment. We found here that hippocampal NOS activity in 12-month-old SAMP8 mice was nearly double that of 2-month-old SAMP8 or CD-1 mice, but with no change in NOS isoenzyme mRNA and protein levels. Antisense or antibody treatment further increased NOS activity in aged SAMP8 mice. Antisense treatment increased inducible NOS (iNOS) mRNA levels, decreased neuronal NOS mRNA and protein levels, but did not affect endothelial NOS (eNOS) or iNOS protein or eNOS mRNA levels. These results suggest a complex relation between Abeta and NOS in the SAMP8 that is largely mediated through posttranslational mechanisms.",
