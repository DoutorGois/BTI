     "AB": "Antidepressant-related protein (NDRG2) is a member of the N-myc downstream-regulated gene family and a role for differentiation and signaling has been proposed. Performing protein profiling we observed NDRG2 and decided to characterize this important biomolecule. Estrous cycle phases were determined in Sprague-Dawley rats and the hippocampus was taken. Proteins were extracted, run on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with subsequent multi-enzyme digestion followed by MALDI-TOF-TOF and nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of spots. Spots identified as NDRG2 were quantified by specific software. Five spots were identified as NDRG2 and two novel phosphorylation sites (T330 and T334) were detected. Gender and estrous cycle-dependent NDRG2 levels were observed. Results are of importance for further qualitative and quantitative studies at the protein level as well as for the design of antibodies for immunochemical applications and for the interpretation of previous studies on NDRG2 that did not take into account different expression forms and posttranslational modifications.",
