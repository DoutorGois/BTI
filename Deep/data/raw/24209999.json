     "AB": "The present study investigated the involvement of the PI3K, GSK-3beta, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and mTOR in the antidepressant-like effect of ascorbic acid in the tail suspension test (TST). Male Swiss mice were pretreated with ascorbic acid (1 mg/kg, p.o.) or vehicle and 45 min after, LY294002 (10 mug/site, i.c.v., reversible PI3K inhibitor), rapamycin (0.2 nmol/site, i.c.v., selective mTOR inhibitor), zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP - 10 ng/site, i.c.v., HO-1 inhibitor) or vehicle was administered. We also investigated the synergistic effect of ascorbic acid (0.1 mg/kg, p.o., sub-effective dose in the TST) with lithium chloride (10 mg/kg, p.o., non-selective GSK-3beta inhibitor), AR-A014418 (0.01 mug/site, i.c.v., selective GSK-3beta inhibitor) or cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP - 0.01 mug/site, i.c.v., HO-1 inducer) in the TST. The antidepressant-like effect of ascorbic acid (1 mg/kg, p.o.) was prevented by the treatment of mice with LY294002, rapamycin or ZnPP. In addition, sub-effective doses of lithium chloride, AR-A014418 or CoPP, combined with a sub-effective dose of ascorbic acid produced a synergistic antidepressant-like effect. We also demonstrated that 1 h after its administration, ascorbic acid increased the phosphorylation of p70S6K and the immunocontent of PSD-95 in the hippocampus of mice. These results indicate that the antidepressant-like effect of ascorbic acid in the TST might be dependent on the activation of PI3K and mTOR, inhibition of GSK-3beta as well as induction of HO-1, reinforcing the notion that these are important targets for antidepressant activity and contributing to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant-like effect of ascorbic acid.",
