     "AB": "The presence of complement system proteins in amyloid plaques and the up-regulation of several complement mRNAs in neurons and glial cells in affected brain regions during Alzheimer disease (AD) provided a basis for further examination of complement protein expression in a rodent lesion model of AD. Perforant path transection in rats was used as a model for the degeneration of entorhinal cortex (EC) layer II neurons and the consequent deafferentation of the hippocampus that occurs during AD. Immunostaining for C9, a key terminal component of the complement cascade membrane attack complex (MAC), showed extracellular C9 deposition in parenchyma around the EC wound and in hippocampus as early as 1 day, and disappeared by 14 days postlesion. Apoptosis of EC layer II neurons was seen and was presumably due to severing of their axonal projections to the hippocampus by the transection lesion. However, apoptotic EC layer II neurons were not immunostained by anti-rat C9 antibody, suggesting complement was not involved in inducing apoptosis. In the deafferented hippocampus, extracellular C9 immunostaining was localized to the dentate gyrus middle molecular layer, a region of synaptic loss, dendritic degeneration, and early synaptogenesis. In addition, intracellular C9 immunostaining was seen only in select hippocampal interneurons. Dentate gyrus granule neurons and pyramidal neurons were not C9 immunostained. Clusterin (SGP-2), a soluble inhibitor of the MAC that is up-regulated in AD, was also detected in the wound area (extracellular), the dentate gyrus middle molecular layer (extracellular), and intracellularly in scattered hippocampal interneurons. The data support the hypothesis that the complement system generally participates in responses to brain injury, as well as in AD.",
