     "AB": "N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (Ndrg2) is a newly identified molecule that is mainly expressed in astrocytes within the central nervous system (CNS) and is involved in the proliferation and activation of astrocytes. 17beta-estradiol (E2) is one of the most important circulating hormones, and in the CNS, astrocytes are a target and potential mediator of the action of E2. Our most recent study found that DPN, an estrogen receptor (ER) beta-specific agonist, activated the Ndrg2 promoter and elevated endogenous NDRG2 protein expression in MCF7, HSG and T-47D cells. However, whether E2 regulates Ndrg2 expression in astrocytes remains unknown. Here, we conducted both in vivo and in vitro experiments and found that ERbeta co-localized with NDRG2 in astrocytes. Furthermore, in primary cultured astrocytes, we demonstrated that E2 up-regulated Ndrg2 mRNA and protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner and that the ERbeta agonist DPN but not the ERalpha agonist PPT up-regulated Ndrg2 expression. In vivo, we found that in the hippocampus of adult ovariectomized (OVX) female mice, Ndrg2 mRNA and protein expression were significantly decreased compared with those in normal adult female mice. After the OVX mice received continuous subcutaneous injections of 50mug/kg E2, 100mug/kg E2 or the ERbeta agonist DPN for 10 days, the Ndrg2 expression significantly increased compared with that of the OVX mice. Our results indicate that E2 may affect astrocytes by regulating Ndrg2 expression.",
