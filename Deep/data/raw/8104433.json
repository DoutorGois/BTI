     "AB": "An antiserum to mGluR1 alpha labeled a 160 kd protein in immunoblots of membranes derived from rat brain or cells transfected with mGluR1 alpha. Immunoreactivity for mGluR1 alpha was present in discrete subpopulations of neurons. The GABAergic neurons of the cerebellar cortex were strongly immunoreactive; only some Golgi cells were immunonegative. Somatostatin/GABA-immunopositive cells in the neocortex and hippocampus were enriched in mGluR1 alpha. The hippocampal cells had spiny dendrites that were precisely codistributed with the local axon collaterals of pyramidal and granule cells. Electron microscopic immunometal detection of mGluR1 alpha showed a preferential localization at the periphery of the extensive postsynaptic densities of type 1 synapses in both the cerebellum and the hippocampus. The receptor was also present at sites in the dendritic and somatic membrane where synapses were not located.",
