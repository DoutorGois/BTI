     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the transplacental effects of MCI-186 (edaravone), a potent hydroxyl radical scavenger, administered to the maternal circulation to inhibit fetal brain injury caused by umbilical cord occlusion. METHODS: Nine chronically instrumented lambs were prepared. In three cases, 10-min persistent total umbilical cord occlusion (group A) was performed. Another three cases underwent occlusion and were administered 60 mg of MCI-186 through the maternal femoral vein prior to the end of occlusion (group B). The remaining three cases underwent sham operation (group C). On day 3 after insult, fetal brains were extirpated. Paraffin-embedded brain tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Bodian, Kluver-Barrera, and TUNEL. Neuronal cellular damage was evaluated by two pathologists blinded to the experimental conditions. RESULTS: Group A displayed numerous cells with eosinophilic condensation of nuclear chromatin and proliferation of microglia in the hippocampus and basal ganglia. TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the periventricular area. Group B showed microglial proliferations, but no marked changes. No pathological changes were apparent in group C. CONCLUSIONS: MCI-186 administered to the maternal circulation could inhibit fetal brain injury resulting from hypoxia-reperfusion induced by umbilical cord occlusion.",
