     "AB": "Neurotrophins have been shown to be involved in functional strengthening of central nervous system synapses. Although their general importance in this process is undisputed, it remains unresolved whether neurotrophins are truly mediators of synaptic strengthening or merely important cofactors. To address this question, we have devised a method to inactivate endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with high time resolution by \"caging\" a function-blocking mAb against BDNF with a photosensitive protecting compound. Different assays were used to show that this inactivation of the Ab is reversible by UV light. Synaptic potentiation after theta-burst [corrected] stimulation in the CA1 region of acute hippocampal slices was significantly less when applying the unmodified Ab compared with the caged Ab. Importantly, photoactivation of the caged Ab during the time of induction of synaptic enhancement led to a marked decrease in potentiation. Our experiments therefore strengthen the view that endogenous BDNF has fast effects during induction of synaptic plasticity. The results additionally show that caged Abs can provide a tool for precise spatiotemporal control over endogenous protein levels.",
