     "AB": "In these studies, we investigated the phenomenon of change in impulse activity of isolated hippocampal neurons during longtime recording. We described the use of serial tachograms during registering the electrical activity of neurons, analysis of which can improve the reliability of data. An analysis of the data identified three phases of changes in impulse activity of isolated neurons in the experimental registrations: a phase of increased activity, phase of stable activity and the phase of declining activity. It is established that in conditions of the perforated patch-clamp the phase of stable activity started at 10-15 minutes after formation of the tight junction and had an average duration of 30 minutes. It is shown that the use of the serial tahograms and phases of activity improves the quality of assessment in the measurement of the electrical activity of neurons.",
