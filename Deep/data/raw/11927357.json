     "PG": "565-73",
     "AB": "It is well known that damage to the hippocampal formation (Ammon's horn, dentate gyrus, fimbria-fornix, and other pathways) produces impairments in spatial navigation and in certain forms of learning. Lesions within these structures have also been reported to produce some motor impairments, but the nature of these impairments is less understood. The present study examined the effects of fimbria-fornix lesions on food wrenching and dodging, social interactions that occur when one rat attempts to steal food from a conspecific, who in turn attempts to protect the food by an evasive movement. Lesion effectiveness was confirmed histologically and electrophysiologically, by the loss of hippocampal rhythmical slow-wave activity (RSA or theta), and by changes in open field behavior (increased open field behavior, less thigmotaxis and more defecation). Analysis of the social interaction indicated when an eating control rat was approached by a conspecific that was attempting to steal its food, it prevented the theft by dodging, a rapid lateral maneuver involving forequarter turning and stepping with the rear limbs. Rats with fimbria-fornix lesions were significantly impaired in dodging and so were more likely to lose their food to the robber. This novel deficit in motor behavior is discussed in relation to contemporary theories of hippocampal function and it is suggested that the deficit may be caused by an inability of the fimbria-fornix damaged animals to disengage attention from eating in order to initiate an evasive movement to protect food. The finding of this novel deficit underscores the importance of considering both loss as well as release phenomena in the analysis of hippocampal formation function.",
