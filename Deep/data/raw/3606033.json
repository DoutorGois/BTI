     "AB": "The perforant pathway originates from the entorhinal cortex of the anterior parahippocampal gyrus and terminates on the outer dendritic branches of the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells of the subiculum and hippocampus. It carries the principal cortical input to the hippocampal formation. Destruction of the perforant pathway in experimental animals leads to a partial deafferentation of its target neurons, followed by a robust sprouting of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) terminals in the deafferented perforant pathway zone. In Alzheimer's disease, the cells of origin of the perforant pathway are laden with neurofibrillary tangles. AChE staining in the terminal zone of the perforant pathway in Alzheimer's disease shows several distinct patterns that are not found in control brains. These changes are consistent with the results of experimental studies demonstrating reinnervation in laboratory mammals, including nonhuman primates. The results suggest that in Alzheimer's disease sprouting of AChE-containing systems occurs in the hippocampal formation in response to disease-related cellular damage in the entorhinal cortex.",
