     "AB": "Intracellular responses were recorded in vitro from the denate granule cell layer of hippocampal slices prepared from adult rats. Spontaneous activity of granule cells in vitro consisted of action potentials and small, graded depolarizations, presumably of synaptic origin. Granule cells could be activated by injection of depolarizing current or release of hyperpolarizing current. Individual granule cells spatially summed input from the perforant path and fired multiple action potentials in vitro following strong presynaptic volleys. Depolarization decreased and hyperpolarization increased the EPSP amplitude, which is consistent with a conductance-increase mechanism. Although we could demonstrate postexcitatory inhibition in some cells, granule cells in vitro appeared to receive less inhibitory feedback than in vivo, EPSP amplitude and spike output of granule cells showed frequency potentiation and posttetanic potentiation to perforant path stimulation. These intracellular responses in vitro complement some of the findings from field-potential analyses of the dentate gyrus in intact animals.",
