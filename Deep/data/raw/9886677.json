     "AB": "Previous studies have shown that substance P (SP) may modulate the abstinence reaction to opioid withdrawal. Its N-terminal fragment SP1-7 may inhibit the intensity of the withdrawal reactions in morphine dependent mice. This study was designed to determine whether the endogenous concentrations of the SP1-7 fragment in the brain are affected during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in the male rat. The amounts of the peptide was assessed by a specific radioimmunoassay in extracts of discrete brain regions (including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, striatum, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area and the spinal cord) during morphine tolerance and withdrawal. The results indicated that the concentrations of SP1-7 were significantly elevated in the ventral tegmental area both in morphine tolerant rats and during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. During morphine withdrawal significant increases in the peptide concentration were also observed in the hypothalamus and the spinal cord. It was concluded that the enhanced content of SP1-7 may also indicate the involvement of the SP system during opioid withdrawal in the rat. The enhanced production of SP1-7 may reflect an increased release and/or metabolism of SP, which, in turn, counteracts the withdrawal.",
