     "AB": "A fiber-tracking algorithm was used to extract fractional anisotropy of bilateral cingulum bundles in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and normal aging controls. In addition, their hippocampal volumes were measured manually. Relative to normal controls, Alzheimer's disease patients showed a significant reduction of fractional anisotropy and hippocampal volumes. Significant correlation was observed between fractional anisotropy values and volumes of hippocampi and mini-mental state examination scores. This study suggests that lower anisotropy of cingulum bundles is associated with cognitive dysfunction and atrophy of the limbic system.",
