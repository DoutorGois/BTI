     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Burnout is generally recognized as a work-related stress-induced condition associated with memory problems, fatigue, a sense of inadequacy, and depressed mood. Neurogenesis, the formation of new neurons in the human adult brain, provides a newly discovered dimension of brain plasticity. OBJECTIVES: In a novel theory, we propose that the failure of adult hippocampal neurogenesis may provide the biological and cellular basis for altered brain plasticity in stress-related syndromes like burnout. METHODS: A number of recent animal studies have shown that the rate of neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus may provide an important neurobiological correlate to the symptoms of stress. RESULTS: As of yet, the normal physiological function of new neurons in the adult hippocampus remains unresolved although a number of studies and reviews indicate the importance of neurogenesis for memory and learning. CONCLUSION: In line with this hypothesis, we propose burnout to be an exponent of stress-mediated decrease in adult neurogenesis leading to a decreased ability to cope with stress through decreased hippocampal function possibly involving a disturbed hippocampal regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis).",
