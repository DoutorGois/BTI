     "AB": "The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) may play an important role in learning and memory. It has also been suggested that 5-HT abnormalities may mediate some aspects of the cognitive disorders associated with Korsakoff syndrome and Alzheimer's Disease. The effect of intracisternally applied 5-HT neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) on learning and memory in rodents was evaluated. Three-day-old rat pups were treated with pargyline (40 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by 5,7-DHT (50 micrograms/pup) and returned to the dam for a month. At 75 days of age, rats were tested on a learning set problem in the Morris water maze for 5 days followed by 30 days of testing in a 12-arm radial maze with 8 of the 12 arms baited. In the Morris water maze, the latency to locate the hidden platform did not differ significantly for 5,7-DHT treated and control rats (F less than 1.0). Similarly, 5,7-DHT treated rats performed comparably to controls on the 12-arm radial maze (F less than 1.0). At 106 days of age the assay of tryptophan hydroxylase activity in the dorsal raphe nuclei and hippocampus showed marked reduction (86%, 78%, respectively) in 5,7-DHT treated animals compared to vehicle injected controls. Immunocytochemical analysis was consistent with the biochemical results. In 5,7-DHT treated animals there was severe loss of neurons that bind 5-HT antibody in the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
