     "AB": "Recent studies indicate the existence of progenitor cells and their potential for neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) of normal adult mammalian brain. Increased neurogenesis has been shown following cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury; however, the involvement of neurogenesis in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has not been examined. Adult male CD-1 mice were subjected to SAH by endovascular perforation of the left anterior cerebral artery. Mice received intraperitoneal injections of the cell proliferation-specific marker 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) after SAH induction. BrdU incorporation was examined from 1 to 30 days after SAH by immunohistochemistry. The BrdU-positive cells were detected in SVZ and DG of normal control brain, and were significantly decreased in both areas three days after SAH. The number of these cells had recovered to its control level seven days after SAH. Double staining with BrdU and NeuN indicated that the majority of the BrdU-positive cells migrating into the granular cell layer of the DG became NeuN-positive 30 days after SAH. In conclusion, temporal changes of the neurogenesis as shown in the present study suggest that neurogenesis in the hippocampus may affect functional outcome after SAH. The induction of the neurogenesis can provide therapeutic value against SAH.",
