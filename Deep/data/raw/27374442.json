     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of parecoxib on hippocampal inflammation and short-term memory function after splenectomy in aged rats. METHODS: A total of 90 aged male SD rats were randomly divided into 9 groups (all n=10): a control group (Group C), an anesthesia day 1 group (A1 group), an operation day 1 group (O1 group), a saline day 1 group (S1 group), a parecoxib day 1 group (P1 group), an anesthesia day 3 group (A3 group), an operation day 3 group (O3 group), a saline day 3 group (S3 group), and a parecoxib day 3 group (P3 group). In the A1 group and A3 group, rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium. Under anesthesia condition, rats in the O1 group and O3 group underwent splenectomy. One hour before splenectomy, rats in the P1 group and P3 group received parecoxib injection of 10 mg/kg via tail vein. In the S1 group and S3 group, rats received the same dose of saline. The rats were trained for 5 days in shuttle box before anesthesia, surgery and drug treatment. After shuttle box test, the rats were killed at postoperative 1 and 3 d. The hippocampus was isolated to measure the CD11b expression by immunofluorescent staining, and TNF-alpha, IL-1 and COX-2 mRNA expression by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the Group C, the electric shock time was increased in the O1 and O3 groups, but the active escape time was shortened and the active avoidance reaction (AAR) was decreased (all P<0.01). Compared with the O1 or O3 group, the electric shock time was shortened, the active escape time and AAR was increased in the P1 or P3 group (all P<0.05). There were more CD11b positive cells and TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, COX-2 mRNA expression in hippocampus in the O1, O3, S1 or S3 group compared with the Group C (all P<0.01). Both CD11b positive cells and TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, COX-2 mRNA expression were decreased in the P1 or P3 group compared with that in the O1 or O3 group (all P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The parecoxib could reduce hippocampal inflammation and improve short-term memory function through the inhibition of COX-2 expression in aged rats after splenectomy.",
