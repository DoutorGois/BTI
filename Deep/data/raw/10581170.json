     "AB": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is known to induce robust feeding through the action of NPY receptors in the hypothalamus. Among the subtypes of NPY receptors, Y(1) receptors may play a key role in feeding regulation. In the present study, we demonstrated that a novel Y(1) antagonist, J-104870, shows high selectivity and potency for the Y(1) receptor with an anorexigenic effect on NPY-mediated feeding. J-104870 displaced [(125)I]peptide YY (PYY) binding to cloned human and rat Y(1) receptors with K(i) values of 0.29 and 0.54 nM, respectively, and inhibited the NPY (10 nM)-induced increase in intracellular calcium levels (IC(50) = 3.2 nM) in cells expressing human Y(1) receptors. In contrast, J-104870 showed low affinities for human Y(2) (K(i) > 10 microM), Y(4) (K(i) > 10 microM), and Y(5) receptors (K(i) = 6 microM). In rat hypothalamic membranes, J-104870 also completely displaced the binding of [(125)I]1229U91, which is known to bind to the typical Y(1) receptor, with a high affinity (K(i) = 2.0 nM). Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of J-104870 (200 microg) significantly suppressed NPY (5 microg)-induced feeding in satiated Sprague-Dawley rats by 74%. Furthermore, ICV and oral administration of J-104870 (200 microg and 100 mg/kg, respectively) significantly suppressed spontaneous food intake in Zucker fatty rats. These findings suggested that J-104870 is a selective and potent nonpeptide Y(1) antagonist with oral bioavailability and brain penetrability. In addition, the anorexigenic effect of J-104870 clearly revealed the participation of the Y(1) receptor in NPY-mediated feeding regulation. The potent and orally active Y(1) antagonist J-104970 is a useful tool for elucidating the physiological roles of NPY in obesity.",
