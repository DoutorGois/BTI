     "AB": "The effect of heptapeptide selank on the content of neurotransmitter monoamines and its metabolites in the brain structures of BALB/C and C57Bl/6 line mice under conditions of the open-field test were studied. Significant interstrain differences in the content of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) as well as in the levels of their metabolites in hippocampus, hypothalamus, striatum and frontal cortex of C57Bl/6 and BALB/C mice were demonstrated. In particular, the content of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-oxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) in hippocampus of BALB/C mice (with passive stress response) was higher than in the same structure of C57Bl/6 (stress-susceptible) animals. The injection of selank (0.3 mg/kg) led to an increase in the NE level in the hypothalamus of both mice strains. At the same time, selank produced opposite effects on the content of DA metabolites: the concentrations of dioxyphenylacetic (DOPAC) and homovanillic (HVA) acids were found to increase in frontal cortex and hippocampus of C57Bl/6 mice, while the same parameters in BALB/C mice were demonstrated to decrease. Selank induced a decrease in 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in the hippocampus of BALB/C mice, but did not affect these parameters in C57Bl/6 animals. The obtained results are indicative of selectivity of the anxiolytic effects of selank.",
