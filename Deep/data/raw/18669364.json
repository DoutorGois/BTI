After emotional painful act in initial terms of change, peroxidation of lipids had phasic character and differed in precise structural specificity. During maximal development of depression, the most expressed infringements of lipids peroxidation occurred in KHA rats in striatum and hippocampus, and at KLA rats--in the striatum and hypothalamus. The data confirm the important role of initial strategy of behavioral in mechanisms of pathogenesis of poststress psychopathology.",
