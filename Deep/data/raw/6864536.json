     "AB": "The stereoisomers of nicotine were evaluated for their effectiveness in producing antinociception and altering spontaneous activity and Rotarod performance in rats. (-)-Nicotine was found to be 6, 15 and 30 times more active than its unnatural enantiomer, (+)-nicotine, in the spontaneous activity, Rotarod and antinociceptive tests, respectively. Biodispositional studies revealed that the time course (-)-[3H]nicotine closely paralleled the time course of effects on spontaneous activity and Rotarod performance but not antinociception, which suggested that multiple mechanisms were involved in the actions of nicotine. In addition, the distribution studies showed the brain and plasma levels of (-)-[3H]nicotine were higher than those of (+)-[3H] nicotine, which indicate that the pharmacological stereoselectivity of nicotine is less than originally determined. Finally, the greatest difference in the regional localization in brain of the stereoisomers was found in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and corpus striatum.",
