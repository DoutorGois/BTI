     "AB": "Intraventricular infusion of rats with beta-amyloid for 14 days resulted in memory deficit in the water maze as well as decreases in choline acetyltransferase activities and somatostatin levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These changes were not altered by daily intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/Kg melatonin. Orally administered Ginkgo biloba extract, however, partially reversed the memory deficit and the decrease in choline actyltransferase activities in the hippocampus. The latter treatment failed to reverse the decrease in somatostatin levels. The results indicate that orally administered Ginkgo biloba extract can protect the brain against beta-amyloid from changes leading to memory deficit through its effect on the cholinergic system.",
