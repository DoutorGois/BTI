     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The study investigated a possible neuroprotective potency of minocycline in an experimental asphyxial cardiac arrest (ACA) rat model. Clinically important survival times were evaluated thus broadening common experimental approaches. METHODS: Adult rats were subjected to 5 min of ACA followed by resuscitation. There were two main treatment groups: ACA and sham operated. Relating to minocycline treatment each group consisted of three sub-groups: pre-, post-, and sans-mino, with three different survival times: 4, 7, and 21 days. Neurodegeneration and microgliosis were monitored by immunohistochemistry. Alterations of microglia-associated gene expression were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: ACA induced massive nerve cell loss and activation of microglia/macrophages in hippocampal CA1 cell layer intensifying with survival time. After 7 days, minocycline significantly decreased both, neuronal degeneration and microglia response in dependence on the application pattern; application post ACA was most effective. After 21 days, neuroprotective effects of minocycline were lost. ACA significantly induced expression of the microglia-associated factors Ccl2, CD45, Mac-1, F4-80, and Tnfa. Independent on survival time, minocycline affected these parameters not significantly. Expression of iNOS was unaffected by both, ACA and minocycline. CONCLUSIONS: In adult rat hippocampus microglia was significantly activated by ACA. Minocycline positive affected neuronal survival and microglial response temporary, even when applied up to 18 h after ACA, thus defining a therapeutically-relevant time window. As ACA-induced neuronal cell death involves acute and delayed events, longer minocycline intervention targeting also secondary injury cascades should manifest neuroprotective potency, a question to be answered by further experiments.",
