     "AB": "Cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is expressed not only in neuronal cells but also in non-neuronal cells such as astroglial cells. In the present study, the prion protein (PrP) gene (Prnp)-deficient astroglial cell line GpL1 from hippocampal cells of ZrchI Prnp(-/-) mice were established. Transfection of Prnp suppressed cell death in GpL1 cells under serum-free conditions. The PrP-expressing GpL1 cells showed increased superoxide dismutase activity compared to control GpL1 cells. These results suggest that the anti-oxidative activity of PrP(C) functions in not only neuronal cells but also astroglial cells possibly due to the increased anti-oxidative activity of astroglial cells.",
