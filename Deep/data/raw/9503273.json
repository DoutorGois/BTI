     "AB": "Lipid peroxidation an outcome of free radicals activity has been hypothesized as one of the possible factor involved in the pathogenesis of neuronal damage. We investigated the effects of free radical scavengers, alpha-tocopherol (T) and ascorbic acid (A) combination (TA-combination) to attenuate tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH)-induced lipid peroxidation in different regions of mice brain. Examinations of effect of three regimens (100, 200, 300 mg/kg body weight) of t-BuOOH on mid brain, cerebellum, striatum, cortex and hippocampus revealed dose and time dependent increase in lipid peroxidation. We observed that prior supplementation of TA-combination reduced lipid peroxidation induced by t-BuOOH in every brain region. These findings suggest that TA-combination may play a vital role in protecting the brain tissue against free radicals.",
