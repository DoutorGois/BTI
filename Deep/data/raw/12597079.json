     "AB": "This study examined the status of recollection in amnesia when recollection is supported by perceptual rather than conceptual processes. Two experiments investigated the size congruency effect-the advantage in recognition of patterns presented in the same size, rather than in different sizes-at study and test. In Experiment 1, the authors used a remember-know paradigm in nonamnesic individuals and demonstrated that the size congruency effect was due to enhanced recollection. In Experiment 2, the authors examined whether amnesic patients would show a size congruency effect when their overall level of performance was matched to that of controls. Amnesic patients failed to show a size congruency effect. These findings provide evidence for a disproportionate disruption in recollection compared with familiarity in amnesia, even when recollection is supported by perceptual processes.",
