     "AB": "Interest surrounds the role of sex-hormones in regulating brain function outside of reproductive behaviour. Declining androgen production in aging males has been associated with cognitive impairment, depression and increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Indication for testosterone replacement therapy is based on biochemically determined low circulating testosterone combined with manifest symptoms. However, which aspects of age-related cognitive decline are attributable to low circulating testosterone remain ambiguous. Studies examining cognition in aging men receiving testosterone replacement therapy have yielded equivocal results. The exact role of testosterone in maintaining cognitive function and the underlying neural mechanisms are largely unknown, though it would appear to be domain specific. Clarity in this area will provide clinical direction toward addressing an increasing healthcare burden of mental health decline coincident with increasing longevity. The premise that androgens contribute to maintaining aspects of mental health in aging men by preserving hippocampal neurogenesis will be used as a forum in this review to discuss current knowledge and the need for further studies to better define testosterone replacement strategies for aging male health.",
