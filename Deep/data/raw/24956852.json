     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of ginsenoside Rb1 on GSKbeta/IDE signal transduction pathway and Abeta protein secretion in hippocampal neurons of high glucose-treated rats. METHOD: Hippocampal neurons of 24 h-old newly born SD rats were primarily cultured, inoculated in culture medium under different conditions, and then divided into the normal group, the high glucose group, the LiCl group and the Rb1 group. After being cultured for 72 h, the expressions of their phosphorylated GSK3beta, total GSK3beta and IDE protein were detected by Western blotting analysis. The mRNA expressions of GSK3beta and IDE were determined by RT-PCR. The ELISA assay was used to detect the secretion of Abeta protein in cell supernatant. RESULT: Compared with the normal group, the high glucose group showed increase in the p/tGSK3beta protein ratio and the secretion of Abeta protein and decrease in IDE protein and mRNA (P < 0.05). Compared with the high glucose group, both Rb1 and LiCl groups showed decrease in the p/tGSK3beta protein ratio and the expression of Abeta protein and increase in IDE protein and mRNA expression (P < 0.05). Compared with the LiCl group, the Rb1 group showed no significant difference in the expressions of p/tGSK3beta protein, IDE protein, mRNA and Abeta protein expression. In addition, the GSK3beta mRNA expression of the four groups had no significant difference. CONCLUSION: Ginsenoside Rb1 may reduce the secretion of Abeta protein in hippocampal neurons by reducing the phosphorylation of GSK3beta, down-regulating the ratio of pGSK3beta/GSK3beta and upregulating the expression of IDE.",
