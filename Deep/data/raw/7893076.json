Pathogenetic mechanisms of the formation of \"epithelialization\" of neurons and of epileptic systems of a higher order in the brain of resuscitated animals were revealed. A stimulating effect of allotransplantation of embryonal sensorimotor cortical tissue in the hippocampal CA1 sector on the repair of disordered neurons and on reduction of convulsive readiness of recipient brain was demonstrated.",
