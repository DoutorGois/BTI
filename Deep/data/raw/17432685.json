     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To establish the oxygen and glucose deprive (OGD) model in cultured hippocampal neuron and study the effect of ligustrazine on intracellular Ca2+ level in the model neurons. METHODS: The OGD model was established in cultured hippocampal neuron, and the intracellular Ca2+ level in it was detected by laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). RESULTS: The OGD model was successfully established in cultured hippocampal neurons; the intracellular Ca2+ level in the OGD model group was significantly higher than that in the blank control group (P < 0.05), and that in the nemodipine and high and medium dosage of ligustrazine treated groups was lower than that in the OGD model group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Intracellular Ca2+ overload occurs in OGD model neuron, which could be antagonized by ligustrazine, indicating that ligustrazine has a protective effect on hippocampal neuron from hypoxic-ischemic injury.",
