     "AB": "Neuropsychological testing of elderly schizophrenic patients reveals that a significant portion of this population exhibit varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Since Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in geriatric patients, we investigated whether the cognitive decline observed in schizophrenia is the result of degenerative changes analogous to those characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. For this purpose, the number and distribution of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were mapped in the hippocampi of 10 cognitively impaired schizophrenic patients, 10 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 10 patients with dementia not attributed to either schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, degenerative changes invariably predominated in the CA1 subfield, subiculum, and proisocortex. By contrast, findings characteristic of Alzheimer's disease were virtually never observed in the hippocampi of schizophrenic and other cognitively impaired patients. In some patients with Alzheimer's disease, the presence of senile plaques in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus suggested the existence of an underlying entorhinal cortex lesion. Similar dentate gyrus pathology was never found in any of the other patients. The authors conclude that cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is not the result of degenerative changes analogous to those found in Alzheimer's disease.",
