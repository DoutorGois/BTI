     "AB": "The concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and its encoding mRNA in the cerebellum and hippocampal formation were assayed during the development of normal and hypothyroid rats. Neonatal hypothyroidism induced a significant reduction in the GFAP concentration in both regions from day 14. The reduction was especially marked on day 35 in the cerebellum (-43%) and the hippocampal formation (-55%). The immunocytochemical study of vimentin showed that the developmental disappearance of this protein from the Bergmann and internal astrocytes is greatly delayed in the cerebellum of the hypothyroid rats. The reduction in GFAP concentration together with the delayed vimentin-GFAP transition could explain how astrocyte morphogenesis is impaired by neonatal thyroid deficiency. The GFAP-mRNA concentration in the hippocampal formation was reduced throughout the development of thyroid-deficient rats, while the GFAP-mRNA concentration in the cerebellum first increased between birth and day 14 to reach a peak well above the normal value (+78%) and decreased thereafter to reach 53% of the normal value by day 35. This transient increase in the cerebellar GFAP-mRNA concentration may be related to the astroglial hyperplasia that occurs in these animals. The difference between the developmental profile of GFAP and its encoding mRNA, especially under pathological conditions, indicates that two distinct mechanisms control the synthesis or stability of the protein and its messenger RNA, as was previously found in the forebrain of the developing normal rat.",
