     "AB": "Background It has been proposed that multiple sclerosis lesions afflicting the pontine trigeminal afferents contribute to trigeminal neuralgia in multiple sclerosis. So far, there are no imaging studies that have evaluated interactions between supratentorial lesions and trigeminal neuralgia in multiple sclerosis patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective study and sought multiple sclerosis patients with trigeminal neuralgia and controls in a local database. Multiple sclerosis lesions were manually outlined and transformed into stereotaxic space. We determined the lesion overlap and performed a voxel-wise subtraction analysis. Secondly, we conducted a voxel-wise non-parametric analysis using the Liebermeister test. Results From 12,210 multiple sclerosis patient records screened, we identified 41 patients with trigeminal neuralgia. The voxel-wise subtraction analysis yielded associations between trigeminal neuralgia and multiple sclerosis lesions in the pontine trigeminal afferents, as well as larger supratentorial lesion clusters in the contralateral insula and hippocampus. The non-parametric statistical analysis using the Liebermeister test yielded similar areas to be associated with multiple sclerosis-related trigeminal neuralgia. Conclusions Our study confirms previous data on associations between multiple sclerosis-related trigeminal neuralgia and pontine lesions, and showed for the first time an association with lesions in the insular region, a region involved in pain processing and endogenous pain modulation.",
