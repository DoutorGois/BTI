     "AB": "In the past decades, a large number of neuropeptides with unknown functions have been identified in the brain. Among the newly discovered peptides, nociceptin or orphanin-FQ (N/OFQ) peptide has attracted considerable attention because of its sequence homology with the opioid peptide family. N/OFQ and its cognate receptor (NOP receptor) are distributed widely in the mammalian central nervous system, though particularly intense expression is found in corticolimbic structures. Such distinctive pattern of expression suggests a key role of N/OFQ system in higher brain functions, such as cognition and emotion. In this chapter, we will outline the findings supporting the role played by N/OFQ and NOP receptors in learning and memory and discuss the underlying mechanisms.",
