     "AB": "Outgrowth of axons in the central nervous system is governed by specific molecular cues. Molecules detected so far act as ligands that bind to specific receptors. Here, we report a new membrane-associated lipid phosphate phosphatase that we have named plasticity-related gene 1 (PRG-1), which facilitates axonal outgrowth during development and regenerative sprouting. PRG-1 is specifically expressed in neurons and is located in the membranes of outgrowing axons. There, it acts as an ecto-enzyme and attenuates phospholipid-induced axon collapse in neurons and facilitates outgrowth in the hippocampus. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism by which axons are able to control phospholipid-mediated signaling and overcome the growth-inhibiting, phospholipid-rich environment of the extracellular space.",
