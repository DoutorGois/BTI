     "AB": "Neurotrophins are a family of structurally related proteins that regulate the survival, differentiation, and maintenance of function of different neuron populations. Some peptides are able to affect the production and activity of neurotrophins. One of these synthetic peptides is heptapeptide Semax, an analog of the N-terminal adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 4-10. It is known that Semax has effects on learning and memory formation and exerts some neuroprotective effects in rodents and humans. Male Wistar rats were treated for 20 min, 40 min, 90 min, 3 h, 8 h, and 24 h with Semax. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression in rat brain and retina was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. It was revealed that after Semax administration the multidirectional activation of the expression of the genes under investigation in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and retina was observed. The expression of both neurotrophin genes was decreased in rat hippocampus and retina 20 min after Semax administration and was increased in the frontal cortex. The expression levels of NGF remained practically constant in the retina at the initial stage, whereas the expression levels of BDNF were significantly increased 90 min after Semax administration.",
