     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The mechanism of the effect of lead on Ca2+ homeostasis in neurons which is much concerned to lead poisoning was studied. METHODS: In the present study, incubation of postnatal rat hippocampal neurons in culture with lead at 500 micrograms/L(medium) was carried out to have knowledge of the effect of lead on energy metabolism, protein and mRNA expression of glutamate receptor2(GluR2) which is Ca(2+)-impermeable subunit of AMPA subtype of glutamate receptors in neurons. RESULTS: The results of cytochemistry, immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization showed a significant down-regulation of cytochrome oxidase activity, GluR2 immunoreactivity as well as GluR2 mRNA statement after 3 days of lead treatment(P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: By affecting the common transcriptional factor in neurons, lead could in the one hand decrease cytochrome oxidase activity to decrease the energy metabolism and down-regulate the expression of protein and mRNA of GluR2 to induce intracellular Ca2+ overload in the other hand.",
