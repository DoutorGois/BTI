     "AB": "The effect of ketamine on CA1-field EPSPs (fEPSPs) in rat hippocampal slices was investigated. Ketamine (100 microM) facilitated fEPSPs at 0.05 Hz. The fEPSP facilitation was suppressed completely by AP-5 and partially by propranolol, and also by an increase in stimulation frequency. These results indicate that ketamine facilitates excitatory synaptic transmission by activating NMDA receptors via beta-adrenoceptors under conditions in which NMDA receptor channel block is slight.",
