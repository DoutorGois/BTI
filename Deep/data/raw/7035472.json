     "AB": "Previous results have shown that severe, prolonged hypoglycemia leads to neuronal cell damage in, among other structures, the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus but not the cerebellum. In order to study whether or not this sparing of cerebellar cells is due to preservation of cerebellar energy stores, hypoglycemia of sufficient severity to abolish spontaneous EEG activity was induced for 30 and 60 min. At the end of these periods of hypoglycemia, as well as after a 30 min recovery period, cerebellar tissue was sampled for biochemical analyses or for histopathological analyses or for histopathological analyses by means of light and electron microscopy. After 30 min of hypoglycemia. the cerebellar energy state, defined in terms of the phosphocreatine, ATP, ADP, and AMP concentrations, was better preserved than in the cerebral cortex. After 60 min, gross deterioration of cerebellar energy state was observed in the majority of animals, and analyses of carbohydrate metabolites and amino acids demonstrated extensive consumption of endogenous substrates. In spite of this metabolic disturbance, histopathologic alterations were surprisingly discrete. After 30 min, no clear structural changes were observed. After 60 min, only small neurons in the molecular layer (basket cells) were affected, while Purkinje cells and granule cells showed few signs of damage. The results support our previous conclusion that the pathogenesis of cell damage in hypoglycemia is different from that in hypoxia-ischemia and indicate that other mechanisms than energy failure must contribute to neuronal cell damage in the brain.",
