     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a long-term high-fructose diet on the insulin-signaling pathway of the hippocampus. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either on a control (0% fructose solution) or high-fructose diet (10% fructose solution). Food intake and body mass were measured regularly. Eight months later, peripheral insulin sensitivity, the activity of the hippocampal insulin pathway, and memory tasks were assessed. Compared to the control group, the high fructose group exhibited more weight gain, peripheral insulin resistance, metabolic disorders, and memory impairments. In addition, insulin signaling in the hippocampus was attenuated in the high fructose group. These results suggested that a high-fructose diet induced peripheral insulin resistance and an abnormal insulin-signaling pathway in the hippocampus which exacerbated memory deficits in the rats.",
