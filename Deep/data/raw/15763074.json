     "AB": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive approach used for stimulating the brain, and has proven effective in the treatment of depression, however the mechanism of its antidepressant action is unknown. Recently, we have reported the induction of kf-1 in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus after chronic antidepressant treatment and repeated electroconvulsive treatment (ECT). In this study, we demonstrated the induction of kf-1 after rTMS in the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus, but not in hypothalamus. Our data suggest that kf-1 may be a common functional molecule that is increased after antidepressant treatment, ECT and rTMS. In conclusion, it is proposed that induction of kf-1 may be associated with the treatment induced adaptive neural plasticity in the brain, which is a long-term target for their antidepressant action.",
