     "AB": "We report that 2,3-naphthalenedicarboxaldehyde reacts rapidly with glutathione and its precursor, gamma-glutamylcysteine, to form highly fluorescent derivatives under physiological conditions. In contrast to previous accounts of 2,3-naphthalenedicarboxaldehyde labeling of primary amines, no additional CN- ion or any other additional nucleophile is required. The fluorescence spectral properties of the chromophores (lambda exc max = 472 nm, lambda em max = 528 nm) make these derivatives amenable to excitation and detection by optical instrumentation that is optimized for fluorescein wavelengths. This selective labeling chemistry enabled quantitative determination and histochemical localization of glutathione in neurobiological samples. Intracellular glutathione was labeled by incubating cultured cells or cell suspensions in a 2,3-naphthalenedicarboxaldehyde-supplemented, DMSO-containing physiological buffer (pH = 7.4) for 2-10 min. Applications include imaging of cultured NG 108-15 cells (mouse neuroblastoma x rat glioma) and primary glial and neuronal cell cocultures (rat hippocampus) using epiluminescent and confocal fluorescence microscopy. Quantitative determination of glutathione in single NG 108-15 cells was accomplished using laser-induced fluorescence detection and capillary electrophoresis.",
