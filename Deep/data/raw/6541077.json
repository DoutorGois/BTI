     "AB": "The effect of adrenalectomy (ADX) and corticosterone replacement was studied on seizures induced by hippocampal kindling. A complex series of changes occurred in after-discharge (AD) and behavioural depression (BD) during the immediate hours after ADX, culminating at day 1 in markedly decreased AD and BD, which returned to normal over the next several days. These changes were normalized after replacement of the ADX group with low doses of corticosterone. It is concluded that the expression and maintenance of hippocampal kindled seizures is under short-term control of corticosterone.",
