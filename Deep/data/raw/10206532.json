Instead of total temporal lobectomy, medial temporal lobectomy with excision of the hippocampus and amygdala was carried out. The central region including the parasagittal tissue was preserved. A few days after the surgery seizures completely ceased. Administration of anticonvulsants was stopped 5 months after the surgery, and she has been seizure-free for 42 months.",
