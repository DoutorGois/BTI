     "AB": "Light and electron microscopy were used to study the effect of hypoglycaemia on selectively vulnerable neurons of rat hippocampus with and without pharmacologic blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-preferring receptor with 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (AP-7). In control hypoglycaemic hippocampi, dark cell change occurs predominantly in dentate granule cells. The topography and ultrastructural appearance of these changes is distinct from that produced by ischaemia or status epilepticus. In hypoglycaemia, mitochondrial calcium accumulation characteristic of ischaemia or status epilepticus is not seen. NMDA receptor blockade markedly attenuates the hypoglycaemic cell injury. Similar attenuation of ischaemic and epileptic brain damage by NMDA receptor blockade suggest that excessive neuronal excitation is a common mechanism of injury in each of the three conditions.",
