     "AB": "The response decrement that occurs during continuous iontophoretic application of GABA to hippocampal neurons was characterized by intracellular methods in the rat hippocampal slice. Using several paradigms that compared the responses to GABA with those to poorly transported analogues, we then identified a large component of this decrement that appeared to be independent of GABA uptake and metabolism, and that is probably independent of intracellular chloride accumulation as well. This decrement, which both developed and recovered with half times that average between 3 and 5s, is too brief to directly account for long-term plasticity of the GABA synapse. However, its time course is appropriate to participation in the development of cellular responses to brief flurries of GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials that may occur normally, or that may occur abnormally during a seizure or artificial tetany.",
