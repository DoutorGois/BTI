The aim of this study was to examine effect of brain DHA levels on cytoskeleton expression. Rats were fed a chow or sunflower oil-based n-3 fatty acid-deficient diet supplemented with or without fish oil starting from embryo and through postnatal day 140. The various DHA levels were from 5.0% to 15.6% of total fatty acids in hippocampus, 3.9% to 13.7% in visual cortex, and 5.3% to 14.4% in olfactory bulbs. The expression of the cytoskeleton markers tyrosine tubulin, acetylated tubulin, and beta-actin in the hippocampus, visual cortex and olfactory bulb was not affected by brain DHA levels.",
