     "AB": "Voicu and Schmajuk (Rob. Auto. Syst. 35 (2001a) 23) described a model of spatial navigation and exploration that includes an action system capable of guiding, with the help of a cognitive system, the search for specific goals as determined by a motivation system. Whereas in the original model the cognitive map stores information about the connectivity between places in the environment, in the present version the cognitive map also stores information about the paths traversed by the agent. Computer simulations show that the network correctly describes experimental results including latent learning in a maze, detours in a maze, and shortcuts in an open field. In addition, the model generates novel predictions about detours and shortcuts in an open field.",
