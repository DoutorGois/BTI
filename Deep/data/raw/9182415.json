     "AB": "Population spike amplitude was measured in hippocampal slices under conditions of 20-min glucose and oxygen deficit (\"in vitro ischemia\") with or without ribonuclease A. In control slices the response was gradually decreased within 3 +/- 2 min after the onset of hypoxia/hypoglycemia. This process continued during 13 +/- 6 min of reperfusion. The reperfusion restored the amplitude up to 70 +/- 17% of its initial level within 1.5 h after the onset of this procedure. Addition of ribonuclease delayed the beginning of the response decrease (by 8 +/- 2 min) and increased the level of its restoration (up to 113 +/- 23%) after the reperfusion. It is suggested that ribonuclease prevents from the energy exhaustion by preserving the cellular energy stores.",
