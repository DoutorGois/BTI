     "AB": "Reduced cognitive function is associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases as well as brain trauma and ischemia. However, there are few compounds that enhance memory and are also orally active. We recently synthesized a pyrazole derivative of curcumin called CNB-001 that enhances the activity of Ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Since CaMKII plays a central role in long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory, it was asked if CNB-001 can facilitate the induction of LTP in rat hippocampal slices and enhance memory in a rat object recognition test. It is shown that CNB-001 enhances both LTP and memory.",
