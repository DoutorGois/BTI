     "AB": "The tetrazolium salt procedure of van Gelder (1965) for the demonstration of GABA transaminase (GABAT; the most important GABA degrading enzyme) was adapted for microphotometric measurements of GABAT activities in brain sections using the hippocampus of rats as selected brain region. The final incubation medium consisted of 50 mM GABA, 5 mM alpha-ketoglutarate, 7 mM NAD, 10 mM sodium azide, 6 mM nitroblue tetrazolium chloride, 20 mM malonate and 15% polyvinyl alcohol in 0.05 M Hepes buffer; the final pH was 8.0. There was a linear relationship between GABAT activity and section thickness up to 14 microns and between GABAT activity and reaction time at least up to 20 min (kinetic and end-point measurements). Phenazine methosulfate as an exogenous electron carrier and pyridoxal-5-phosphate as coenzyme of GABAT did not enhance the demonstrable GABAT activities, whereas sodium azide as a blocker of the respiratory chain resulted in an increase of demonstrable enzyme activities. A coreaction of succinate dehydrogenase was excluded by the use of malonate (competitive inhibitor). Using the incubation medium described GABAT activities were demonstrated via the endogenous enzymes succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and NADH tetrazolium reductase which were shown to be not rate limiting and seems to be similarly localized as GABAT.",
