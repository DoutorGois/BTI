     "AB": "Cell surface carbohydrates play an important role in the regulation of neurite outgrowth during neuronal development. We have investigated the actions of the plant lectin concanavalin A (Con A), a carbohydrate-binding protein, on neurite outgrowth from hippocampal pyramidal neurons in primary cell culture. Neurons plated in culture medium containing nanomolar concentrations of Con A have a larger number of primary neurites arising directly from the cell soma than do neurons plated in culture medium alone. Furthermore, Con A causes counterclockwise turning of neurites in over 70% of the cultured neurons. Both of these effects of Con A are blocked by the hapten sugar alpha-methyl-D-mannopyranoside, suggesting that they result from the interaction of Con A with a cell surface carbohydrate. Another lectin with a different sugar specificity, wheat germ agglutinin, does not modulate neurite outgrowth. Analysis of neurite outgrowth using video-enhanced microscopy reveals that the counterclockwise turning is accompanied by directionally biased extension of filopodia from the growth cones of growing neurites. Treatment of the neurons with cytochalasin, which disrupts actin polymerization, eliminates the neurite turning induced by Con A, suggesting that actin microfilaments are involved in directional control of neurite outgrowth.",
