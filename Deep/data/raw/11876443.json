     "AB": "Preparation of some new 1,4-substituted 2-methylpiperazine derivatives is reported. The influence of structural modifications on their affinity to 5-HT(1A) receptors is discussed. Compounds were synthesised by the reaction of 2-methylpiperazine with 2-chloropyrimidine or 2-chloroquinoline followed by condensation with 1,4 dibromobutane. The resulting quaternary ammonium salts after the reaction with an imide gave the respective final products.",
