     "AB": "Various clinical and experimental studies of epilepsy have described synaptic reorganization in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus, in the form of collateral sprouting of the mossy fibers. These reports have led to the hypothesis that reorganized mossy fibers form a functional excitatory feedback circuit that contributes to local circuit hyperexcitability and chronic seizures. Much of the evidence supporting the sprouting hypothesis has been derived from kindling. We recently reported that transection of the fimbria/fornix (FF), which produces chronic epileptiform activity in the hippocampus, also induces mossy fiber sprouting in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. In the present study, we attempted to determine whether mossy fiber sprouting contributes to epileptiform activity, by examining the effects FF transections on perforant path (PP) kindling and associated mossy fiber sprouting. We found that FF transections and PP kindling produced moderate levels of sprouting, whereas the combination of the two treatments produced significantly denser sprouting. FF transections had mixed effects on kindling: afterdischarge thresholds were decreased and clonus and afterdischarge durations were increased, suggesting increased local excitation, whereas the kindling of behavioral seizures was delayed, suggesting decreased epileptogenesis.",
