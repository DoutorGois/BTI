     "AB": "Studies in human and non-human animals have found that early life exposure to androgens may affect later spatial performance. Recent studies have suggested that the ratio of the second to fourth digit (2D:4D) may serve as an index of prenatal androgen exposure. Some studies have found that the 2D:4D ratio predicts adult spatial performance, although the nature of the relationship is equivocal. This study was designed to quantify the relationships between 2D:4D ratio, spatial cognition, and spatial navigation using a virtual Morris water task (vMWT) in a sample of young adult men and women (N = 140). The results replicated findings from the literature regarding sex differences in 2D:4D ratio, vMWT performance, and spatial cognition. However, 2D:4D ratio was not consistently related to spatial cognition or spatial navigation in men or women. Results were discussed within the framework of androgen influences on spatial cognition and the degree to which 2D:4D ratio serves as a marker for early life androgen exposure.",
