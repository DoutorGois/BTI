     "AB": "Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase) activity is inhibited in cultured hippocampal cells following direct application of glutamate. The goal of the present study was to determine if hippocampal regions that undergo delayed cell death following glutamate microinfusion would exhibit changes in CaM kinase immunoreactivity. Gerbils received bilateral intra-hippocampal infusions of L-glutamate (34 microg/microl), or control treatments of D-glutamate or saline. Animals were sacrificed at 12 or 24 hr to assess cell loss and determine changes in CaM kinase-like immunoreactivity. Hippocampi of gerbils euthanized 12 hr following L-glutamate, or 24 hr following D-glutamate, did not exhibit cell death in the hippocampal CA1 region. Animals injected with L-glutamate and sacrificed 24 hr after infusion had extensive cell damage that was restricted to the hippocampal CA1 region. CaM kinase-like immunoreactivity was absent in the hippocampal CA1 region of all L-glutamate treated animals sacrificed at 12 hr. In these same sections, CaM kinase immunoreactivity was evident in the subiculum, CA2 and CA3 regions. Reduction in CaM kinase immunoreactivity following L-glutamate were also observed using Western analysis. The results confirm and extend the findings of earlier cell culture studies by demonstrating a reduction in CaM kinase immunoreactivity that occurred prior to cell death.",
