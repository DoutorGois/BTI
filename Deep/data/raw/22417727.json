     "AB": "There are several known neurogenic areas including subventricular zone and subgranular layer in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Both germinal centers exhibit an age-dependent decline in cell proliferation and neurogenesis, which may be associated with age-related decline in brain function. We recently identified the subcallosal zone (SCZ) as a novel neural stem cell niche with a potential to spontaneously produce new neuroblasts. We examined whether SCZ neurogenesis is also regulated by the age of mice. The number of newly generated neuroblasts was reduced in the SCZ with age, and only marginal number of DCX-labeled neuroblasts was found in 6-month-old SCZ, which is most likely due to reduced proliferation of progenitor cells and loss of neural stem cells (NSCs). This age-dependent changes in the SCZ occurred earlier than that of other neurogenic brain regions. The neurosphere assay in vitro confirmed the depletion of NSCs within the SCZ of young adults. However, marked induction of neuroblast production in the SCZ was seen in 6-month-old mice after traumatic brain injury. Taken together, these results indicate that a rapid decline in SCZ neurogenesis in mice is due to depletion of NSCs and reduced capacity to produce neuroblasts.",
