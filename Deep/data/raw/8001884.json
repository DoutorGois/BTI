     "AB": "The parahippocampal (ventral) surface of the lateral part of the transverse fissure (LTF), formed by the parahippocampal gyrus, was examined in 53 human brain hemispheres without pathological changes. Cytoarchitectonics of this region was studied on the frontal histological sections stained either with cresyl violet or with Weil method. Four types of the shape of the parahippocampal surface of LTF were distinguished. In type 1 the surface is either flat or elevated in its medial part (medial eminence; 34.0%). In type 2 the surface is elevated in its lateral part (lateral eminence, 24.5%). In type 3 there are two eminences--the lateral and the medial; both of similar height (20.8%). In type 4 the lateral eminence is distinctly higher than the medial one (20.7%). The eminences contain cytoarchitectonically different structures. The lateral eminence is formed mainly by the subiculum and CA1 area, the medial by the presubicular region. The shape of the parahippocampal surface of LTF may be of importance in assessment of the Alzheimer's disease pathology.",
