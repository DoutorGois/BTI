     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Cell-to-cell transmission of alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn) is hypothesized to play an important role in disease progression in synucleinopathies. This process involves cellular uptake of extracellular amyloidogenic alphaSyn seeds followed by seeding of endogenous alphaSyn. Though it is well known that alphaSyn is an immunogenic protein that can interact with immune receptors, the role of innate immunity in regulating induction of alphaSyn pathology in vivo is unknown. Herein, we explored whether altering innate immune activation affects induction of alphaSyn pathology in wild type mice. METHODS: We have previously demonstrated that recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated expression of the inflammatory cytokine, Interleukin (IL)-6, in neonatal wild type mice brains leads to widespread immune activation in the brain without overt neurodegeneration. To investigate how IL-6 expression affects induction of alphaSyn pathology, we injected mouse wild type alphaSyn fibrils in the hippocampus of AAV-IL-6 expressing mice. Control mice received AAV containing an Empty vector (EV) construct. Two separate cohorts of AAV-IL-6 and AAV-EV mice were analyzed in this study: 4 months or 2 months following intrahippocampal alphaSyn seeding. RESULTS: Here, we show that IL-6 expression resulted in widespread gliosis and concurrently reduced alphaSyn inclusion pathology induced by a single intra-hippocampal injection of exogenous amyloidogenic alphaSyn. The reduction in alphaSyn inclusion pathology in IL-6 expressing mice was time-dependent. Suppression of alphaSyn pathology was accompanied by reductions in both argyrophilic and p62 immunoreactive inclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Our data supports a beneficial role of inflammatory priming of the CNS in wild type mice challenged with exogenous alphaSyn. A likely mechanism is efficient astroglial scavenging of exogenous alphaSyn, at least early in the disease process, and in the absence of human alphaSyn transgene overexpression. Given evidence that a pro-inflammatory environment may restrict seeding of alphaSyn pathology, this can be used to design anti-alphaSyn immunobiotherapies by harnessing innate immune function.",
