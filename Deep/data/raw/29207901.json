     "AB": "The cell fate regulator Fas-associated death domain (FADD) balances cell death with non-apoptotic actions via its phosphorylated form. A recent study associated loss of cortical FADD with cognitive decline and increased risk of clinical dementia. Since the activation of cortical alpha2A-adrenoceptors improved memory deficits in various animal models of working memory loss, the present study evaluated whether UK-14304, an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist known to acutely regulate brain FADD forms, would improve cognitive function in middle-aged rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with UK-14304 (0.3 or 1 mg/kg) or saline (1 mL/kg) for seven days. Cognitive performance was evaluated in the eight-arm radial maze. FADD protein content was measured in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus by Western blot analysis. The results showed that UK-14304 (1 mg/kg) improved cognitive performance (less time: -310+/-45 s, p=0.025 and fewer errors: -2.75+/-1.06, p=0.043 to complete the maze) and increased FADD selectively in the hippocampus (+35+/-11%, p=0.029). Interestingly, hippocampal FADD content negatively correlated with the time ( r=-0.651, p<0.01) needed to complete the maze. Thus, better cognitive scores were associated with higher FADD hippocampal content. These results support a role for alpha2-adrenoceptors in ameliorating cognition and suggest FADD protein content as a possible correlate for cognitive performance.",
