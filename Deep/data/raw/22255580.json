     "AB": "As epilepsy affects approximately one percent of the world population, electrical stimulation of brain has recently shown potential as an additive seizure control therapy. In this study we applied focal transcranial electrical stimulation (TFS) on the surface of the skull of rats via concentric ring electrodes. We recorded electric potentials with a bipolar electrode consisting of two stainless steel wires implanted into the left ventral hippocampus. TFS current was gradually increased by 20% starting at 103 muA allowing us to assess the relationship between TFS current and both potentials recorded from the bipolar electrode and the resulting electric field. Generally, increases in TFS current resulted in increases in the electric field. This allows us to estimate what extra-cranial TFS current would be sufficient to cause the activation of neurons in the hippocampus.",
