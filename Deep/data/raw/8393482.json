     "AB": "Adenosine is a potent inhibitory modulator of synaptic transmission in the CNS, but its role in normal physiological function is unclear. In the present experiments, we have found electrophysiological evidence for activity-dependent release of adenosine from hippocampal slices evoked by physiologically relevant stimulation, and have demonstrated that this adenosine modifies synaptic activity in this brain region. When two independent excitatory pathways to the CA1 pyramidal neurons are used to evoke field EPSP responses, prior activation of one pathway will inhibit the EPSP evoked via the other input. This inhibition can be antagonized by the nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline, and by the selective A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyltheophylline, suggesting that the inhibitory response is due to the release of endogenous adenosine that activates presynaptic release-modulating A1 receptors. This inhibition can be observed following a single stimulus to the conditioning pathway, although it is more pronounced when a train of conditioning pulses is used, and is maximal following a train of 16-32 stimuli (at 100 Hz). When a train of four conditioning pulses is used, the inhibition appears with a latency of approximately 50 msec, peaks approximately 200-250 msec following the conditioning train, and recovers to baseline between 1 and 2 sec. Further evidence that this inhibition of excitatory transmission is mediated via adenosine is provided by the observation that superfusion with dipyridamole (an adenosine uptake inhibitor), and the adenosine deaminase inhibitor erythro-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, enhanced both the duration and amplitude of the inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
