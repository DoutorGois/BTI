     "AB": "This study investigates characteristics of aging in the central nervous system of the senescence accelerated prone mice (SAMP8). We examined 3 and 10-months old senescence-accelerated-prone mice (SAMP8) for functional and molecular changes in their brains, specifically in the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex. There was no statistically significant increase in the apoptosis indicators as revealed by Western Blotting for BAD and TUNEL experiments. However, the functional magnetic resonance imaging showed an increase in the area of BOLD images from the 3-month old to the 10-months old SAMP mice upon the application of tail stimulus. These results demonstrated a lack of neuronal deaths but an increase in the activated brain area with age.",
