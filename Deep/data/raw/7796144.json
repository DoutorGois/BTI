In this study, we investigated whether inhibition of morphine-induced tolerance and dependence by diazepam involved a change in cyclic AMP levels in discrete rat brain regions and spinal cord. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were made tolerant and dependent by subcutaneous (s.c.) implantation of six morphine pellets (two pellets on the first day, and four on the second day). Diazepam (0.25 mg/kg b. wt) was injected once daily intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 5 days. Control rats were implanted with placebo pellets and injected once daily with saline or diazepam (i.p.). Tail-flick antinociception was measured 1 h after injections everyday. Animals were administered s.c. naloxone (10 mg/kg) to induce naloxone-precipitated withdrawal syndrome on the final day of the experiment (day 5), and the jumping behavior was observed for 30 min. Concomitant treatment with diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) significantly decreased the development of morphine tolerance and dependence. Diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) treated rats also showed a significant decrease in the jumping behavior compared to animals treated with morphine alone. Rats were sacrificed 2 h after the injection of saline or diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) on the fifth day. Cyclic AMP was estimated by RIA. In the control rats, the concentration of cyclic AMP in cortex was > hippocampus > cerebellum > hypothalamus > striatum > midbrain > pituitary > pons/medulla > spinal cord. There was no change in the concentration of cyclic AMP in any of the brain regions examined from morphine tolerant animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
