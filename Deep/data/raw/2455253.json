     "AB": "The permeability to various cations of the voltage-dependent sodium channel of isolated rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons was investigated under the voltage-clamp condition. The neurons were dispersed enzymatically and mechanically and perfused internally using a suction pipette technique. The permeability sequence, estimated from the reveral potential of the inward current was Li+ greater than Na+ greater than hydrazine+ greater than formamidine+ greater than guanidine+ greater than methylguanidine+ greater than monomethylamine+. Thus the ionic selectivity of the voltage-dependent sodium channel of rat central nervous system neurons is similar to that in the squid axon, myelinated frog nerve fiber and rat ventricle muscle.",
