     "AB": "Many synapses contain two types of receptors - integrins and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors - that have been implicated in peptide internalization. The present studies tested if either class is involved in the uptake of the 42-residue form of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta1-42), an event hypothesized to be of importance in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Cultured hippocampal slices were exposed to Abeta1-42 for 6 days in the presence or absence of soluble Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro, a peptide antagonist of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-binding integrins, or the disintegrin echistatin. Abeta uptake, as assessed with immunocytochemistry, occurred in 42% of the slices incubated with Abeta peptide alone but in more than 80% of the slices co-treated with integrin antagonists. Uptake was also found in a broader range of hippocampal subfields in RGD-treated slices. Increased sequestration was accompanied by two characteristics of early stage Alzheimer's disease: elevated concentrations of cathepsin D immunoreactivity and activation of microglia. The selective NMDA receptor antagonist D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate completely blocked internalization of Abeta, up-regulation of cathepsin D, and activation of microglia. Our results identify two classes of receptors that cooperatively regulate the internalization of Abeta1-42 and support the hypothesis that characteristic pathologies of Alzheimer's disease occur once critical intraneuronal Abeta concentrations are reached.",
