     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is an important process underlying learning and memory in the brain. At CA3-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus, three discrete forms of LTP (LTP1, 2, and 3) can be differentiated on the basis of maintenance and induction mechanisms. However, the relative roles of pre- and post-synaptic expression mechanisms in LTP1, 2, and 3 are unknown. Neurotransmitter release in the expression of LTP1, 2, and 3 was measured via FM 1-43 destaining from CA3 terminals in hippocampal slices from male Wistar rats (7-8 wk). No difference in vesicle turnover rate was observed for LTP1 up to 160 min following induction by one train of theta-burst stimulation (1TBS). A presynaptic enhancement was found for LTP2 at 160 min after induction by 4TBS, and for LTP3 at both 80 and 160 min after induction by 8TBS. Inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) signaling blocked both LTP2 and LTP3 maintenance and the associated enhanced release. LTP2 maintenance and its presynaptic expression were dependent on protein synthesis, but not gene transcription. LTP3 maintenance was dependent on both translation and transcription, but like LTP2, the enhanced release only required translation. These data considerably strengthen the mechanistic separation of LTP1, 2, and 3, supporting a model of multiple, discrete forms of LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses rather than different temporal phases.",
