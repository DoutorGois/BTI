     "AB": "Adrenal steroids can have prodigious effects on the structure, function, and survival of hippocampal neurons. In the rat hippocampus, the actions of adrenal steroids are mediated by two receptor types, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Using in situ hybridization, we have examined the regulation of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, by aldosterone, which acts selectively through MR, and by RU28362, which acts selectively through GR. Our results demonstrate that there is autoregulation of each receptor subtype, such that activation of GR regulates GR mRNA levels and MR activation regulates MR mRNA expression. In addition, there is evidence that aldosterone, acting through MR, can affect the expression of GR mRNA. The extent to which a specific agonist can produce a significant change in the expression of a particular steroid receptor mRNA varies between the different subfields of the hippocampus.",
