     "AB": "The methanolic extract of the fruits of Cornus officinalis S et Z. (Cornaceae) showed the significant neuroprotective activity against glutamate-induced toxicity in HT22 hippocampal cells. Chemical profile of n-BuOH fraction of the methanolic extract of C. officinalis fruits, which showed the most potent activity, was established using HPLC-diode array detector-electrospray-MS (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS). Through bioactivity-guided isolation, five iridoid glycosides including one new compound, 7-O-butylmorroniside (1), loganin (2), morroniside (3), 7R-O-methylmorroniside (4), 7S-O-methylmorroniside (5) were isolated from the n-BuOH fraction. The protective activities of the isolated compounds, themselves, were not statistically significant. However, the hydrolyzed products of compounds 1, 4 and 5 significantly protected glutamate-injured HT22 cells up to 78+/-2.2%, 60+/-3.2% and 59+/-2.5% of non-treated control, respectively.",
