     "AB": "We examined the effects of dantrolene, an inhibitor of intracellular calcium release, on alterations associated with the intrahippocampal injection of the TsTX scorpion toxin. Male Wistar rats (230-250 g) were injected with Ringer solution (1 microl; n = 6); TsTX toxin (1 microg/microl; n = 8); and dantrolene (10.0 mg/kg) plus TsTX toxin (1 microg/microl; n = 6). After injection, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and observation of animals behaviour were performed continuously for 4 h. One week later, animals were submitted to histopathological analysis. TsTX caused electrographic seizure expressed by moderate or intense discharges and neuronal loss in hippocampal areas in all injected animals (n = 8). Dantrolene reduced the effect of TsTX. Thus, 67% of rats (four out of six) treated with toxin and dantrolene had electrographic convulsions, but only for 30 min after injection and none of them presented neuronal damage. Dantrolene or Ringer had no effects on the EEG.",
