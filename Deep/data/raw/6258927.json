     "AB": "In vitro radioautographic experiments were performed on coronal rat brain slices to determine the precise localization of [3H]dihydromorphine binding sites sensitive to naloxone, within the hippocampus. Binding was observed in all cell fields and in dentate gyrus (DG) in the order CA2 greater than CA1 greater than CA3 greater than DG. Within each cell field the density of receptors was greatest in the stratum pyramidale, which in field CA2 was 77% as dense as the striatum. The existence of a dense population of opiate binding sites within the hippocampus is consistent with the view that this structure is involved in opiate actions.",
