     "AB": "The effects of environment enrichment on motor activity, exploration, and cognitive performances were studied in aged rats. Both nonimpaired (NI) and impaired (I) rats were submitted to daily training in a complex-enriched environment (cEE) for 60 days. Animals were examined at spatial water maze task, passive avoidance test, open-field test, and sensorimotor coordination tasks (bridges test and Marshall scales). At the end of experiments, animals were killed for brain biochemical determinations (gluthatione content and specific-ChAT activity). Results after the first evaluation (before training) corroborate that the aged rat population showed a heterogeneity in behavioral patterns like that observed in humans. Also, cEE modified exploration activity, cognition, motor functions, and biochemical markers in both NI and I groups, but changes reached significant relevance for the last group. It is significant that neurotrophins, \"novo\" synthesis of neurotransmitters, and oxidative stress levels may mediate the observed changes, indicating that the aged brain still has appreciable plasticity in response to well-manipulated environmental stimulation. Finally, our results also support the novel concepts and programs in prevention/reduction both in incidence/severity and outcome of age-associated neurodegenerative conditions.",
