     "AB": "Primary hippocampal neurons from newborn rats treated with glutamate showed clear excitotoxicity. This excitotoxicity could be reversed by treatment of the cells with cytokines of the interleukin-6 family. Stimulation of gp130 on hippocampal neurons resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and activation of p42 and p44 MAP kinases. Receptors for the interleukin-6 type cytokines are active in membrane bound and soluble form. To address the question whether the neurotrophic effect of interleukin-6 type cytokines requires soluble cytokine receptors we used fusion proteins of interleukin-6 coupled to the soluble interleukin-6 receptor and ciliary neurotrophic factor coupled to the soluble ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor. Ciliary neurotrophic factor was as active as the cytokine-receptor fusion protein, indicating that hippocampal neurons express ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor on the cell surface. In contrast, interleukin-6 was only active at very high concentrations whereas the fusion protein of interleukin-6 coupled to the soluble interleukin-6 receptor (Hyper-IL-6) exhibited high neurotrophic activity at the same concentrations as ciliary neurotrophic factor. These data indicate that interleukin-6 receptor expression is very low on hippocampal neurons and that gp130 stimulation can be used to rescue hippocampal neurons from excitotoxicity.",
