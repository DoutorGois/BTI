     "AB": "The effects of stimulus intensity and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (AP5) were studied on the induction of short-term potentiation (STP) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 of the rat hippocampal slice. A tetanus of very weak intensity stimuli produced STP, and also LTP providing the stimuli were applied in the form of a series of high frequency trains rather than one continuous train. Increasing the intensity of the stimuli to just threshold for spike initiation produced larger amplitude STP and LTP. AP5 strongly inhibited the STP as well as the LTP produced by a series of high frequency trains, indicating a large component of this STP was generated by activation of NMDA receptors. A further residual component of STP in AP5, which was associated with a decrease in paired pulse facilitation, is probably generated by a presynaptic increase in the probability of transmitter release.",
