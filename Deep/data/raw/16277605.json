     "AB": "Previous studies have shown that brief application of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist (S)-3, 5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) to hippocampal slices can induce a chemical form of long-term depression (DHPG-LTD) in the hippocampal CA1 region; however, the expression mechanisms of this LTD remain unclear. We show here that the expression of DHPG-LTD can be specifically reversed by application of the broad-spectrum mGluR antagonists, (S)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG) and LY341495, and mGluR5 antagonist, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethyl)pyridine, but not by NMDA receptor antagonist, D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, mGluR1 antagonist, LY367385, group II mGluR antagonist, (2S)-alpha-ethylglutamic acid, or group III mGluR antagonist, (S)-2-amino-2-methyl-4-phosphonobutanic acid (MAP4). In addition, the ability of MCPG to reverse DHPG-LTD was mimicked by the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, phenylarsine oxide and orthovanadate, but not phospholipase C inhibitor, U73122, protein kinase C inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide 1, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, SB203580, or protein phosphatases 1/2 A inhibitor, okadaic acid. Moreover, MCPG reversed the DHPG-LTD without affecting the paired-pulse facilitation. The expression of DHPG-LTD was associated with the reduction of both tyrosine phosphorylation and surface expression of AMPA receptor GluR2 subunits. Together, these results suggest that sustained activation of mGluR5 and in turn triggering a protein tyrosine phosphatase-dependent regulation of postsynaptic expression of AMPA receptors may contribute to the expression of DHPG-LTD.",
