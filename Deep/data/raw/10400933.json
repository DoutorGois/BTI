     "AB": "Short-term depression of monosynaptic GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) evoked between pairs of cultured rat hippocampal neurons was investigated using dual whole cell patch-clamp recordings. Paired stimuli applied to the GABAergic neuron resulted in paired-pulse depression (PPD) of the second IPSC (IPSC2) at interpulse intervals from 25 to 2,000 ms. CGP 55845A, but not CGP 35348, reduced PPD marginally. Brief paired-pulse applications of exogenous GABA indicated that postsynaptic factors made only minimal contribution to PPD of IPSCs. IPSC1 and PPD was reduced on lowering [Ca2+]o and enhanced on increasing [Ca2+]o. The potassium-channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), which increases presynaptic Ca2+ influx, enhanced IPSC1 and PPD. Chelation of residual Ca2+ in the GABAergic boutons with EGTA-AM enhanced PPD. Stimulation of the presynaptic neuron at frequencies (f) ranging from 2.5 to 80 Hz resulted in tetanic depression of IPSCs, which declined rapidly and reached a plateau depending on f and [Ca2+]o. CGP 55845A decreased tetanic depression in the first part of the train, but this could be overcome with continued stimulation. We show that GABAergic IPSCs are robustly depressed by paired-pulse stimulation in cultured hippocampal neurons. The depression of IPSCs is mainly independent of presynaptic GABAB receptors and could be caused by depletion of releasable vesicles. Depleted synapses recover with a slow time course, depending on factors that regulate [Ca2+]i in the GABAergic boutons.",
