     "AB": "Catamenial epilepsy is a common phenomenon in female epileptic patients that is, in part, influenced by the 17-beta-estradiol level during the menstrual cycle, which modulates the strength of the epileptic seizures. However, the underlying mechanism(s) for catamenial epilepsy remains unknown. In the present study, the effect of 17betaestradiol on modulating epileptiform activities was investigated in cultured hippocampal neurons by focusing on the transient outward potassium current. Using the patch clamp technique, 17betaestradiol was demonstrated to have a dosedependent Ushape effect on epileptiform bursting activities in cultured hippocampal neurons; only the low dose (~0.1 ng/ml) of 17betaestradiol had a suppressive effect on the epileptiform activities. The blockade effect of the low dose 17betaestradiol could be suppressed by phrixotoxin2 (PaTx2), a selective channel blocker for voltagegated potassium channel type 4.2 (Kv4.2), which mediates the transient outward potassium current. Furthermore, the 17betaestradiol bellshapelike dosedependently enhanced the transient outward potassium current, which was inhibited by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780. In conclusion, these results indicate that reduced activation of the transient outward potassium current by a high (or none) 17betaestradiol level may enhance the epileptiform bursting activities in neurons, which may be one of the triggering causes for catamenial epilepsy, and therefore, maintaining a certain low 17betaestradiol level may aid in the control of catamenial epilepsy.",
