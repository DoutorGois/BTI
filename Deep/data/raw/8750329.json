However, even with the use of reformatted images, an underlying cause for epilepsy cannot be found in many of these patients. We show that further processing of the data, including three-dimensional reconstruction and quantitative analysis of the volume and complexity of the images in three dimensions, reveals additional positive information in up to 75% of patients. This may be useful for surgical planning, prognostication, and understanding of the structure and development of the human brain.",
