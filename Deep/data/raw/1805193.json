     "AB": "The effect of oxiracetam on passive avoidance conditioned response and acetylcholine (ACh) levels in rats with selective lesions of the central monoaminergic pathways was investigated. The lesions were followed by a marked decrease in cortical serotonin (-88%), noradrenaline (-54%) and striatal dopamine (-57%) levels, while neither the performance of a passive avoidance conditioned response nor brain ACh levels were affected. Scopolamine (hyoscine) administration (0.63 mg/kg, s.c.) to lesioned rats exerted the expected amnesic effect, associated with a decrease in hippocampal, cortical and striatal ACh levels. In the rats with degeneration of dopaminergic and noradrenergic but not serotoninergic pathways, oxiracetam (50 and 100 mg/kg, s.c.) was unable to prevent both amnesia and the decrease in brain ACh levels caused by scopolamine. The effect of oxiracetam was prevented by haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.). Our findings support the hypothesis that an interaction between monoaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmitter systems may be involved in the actions of nootropic drugs on cognitive functions.",
