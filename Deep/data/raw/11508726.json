     "AB": "Three experiments investigated the role of response requirements in the Morris water maze for pre- and postweanling rats. Fischer-344N pups were required to locate a hidden platform using extramaze cues in a tank modified for the pups' immature response repertoire. Weanlings (20-22 days) displayed spatial learning in a pool 1/2 the size of the adults' (Experiment 1); by 26-28 days of age, probe performance was comparable to adults' on quadrant preference and platform-crossing measures. Preweanlings (17 days), in a pool 1/3 the original size, significantly reduced escape latencies and displayed quadrant preference and platform-crossing scores indicative of spatial navigation. These results suggest that despite its protracted postnatal development, the preweanling hippocampus allows neural integration of visual-spatial information; however, the capacity to demonstrate such learning is dependent on task parameters and the pup's response repertoire.",
