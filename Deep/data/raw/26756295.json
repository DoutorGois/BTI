     "AB": "This study demonstrated the protective efficiency of extracts of the Indian variety of Ophiocordyceps sinensis (=Cordyceps sinensis) (CSEs) in HT22 (murine hippocampal) cells under hypoxic conditions. Various parameters such as cell viability, reactive oxygen species, levels of endogenous antioxidants, inflammatory cytokines, transcription factors, and oxidation of macromolecules were analyzed. In addition, the radical scavenging abilities of hydroxyl radicals, nitric oxide, and superoxide radicals were also studied. Antioxidant compounds, ascorbic acid, hesperidin, and rutin were quantified by high-performance thin-layer chromatography. The information acquired from high-performance thin-layer chromatography profiling was subjected to principal component analysis for data clustering. Findings of this research revealed that ascorbic acid and rutin were highest in aqueous CSE, whereas the maximum amount of hesperidin was found in 25% alcoholic CSE. In vitro studies showed that all the CSEs protected HT22 cells well by upregulating the level of endogenous antioxidants and preventing the oxidation of lipids and proteins. These extracts also reduced the amount of hypoxia-induced inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors on par with the normoxic control with more or less equal protection in the cells under hypoxia, and indicated significant radical scavenging potential.",
