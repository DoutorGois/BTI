     "AB": "Recent studies of the problem of ictogenesis, or the ways that seizures develop in an already hyperexcitable brain, are leading to paradigm-shifting concepts that may lead to exciting new therapies for seizures. Research on the equally important area of epileptogenesis, or the ways that a normal brain becomes epileptic, is also expanding, but comparable research into translation of laboratory findings into successful clinical interventions for those at high risk needs to be developed.",
