     "AB": "Chronic administration of electroconvulsive seizures (ECS), one of the most effective treatments for depression, induces sprouting of the mossy fibers in the hippocampus. This sprouting requires chronic ECS administration and appears to occur in the absence of hilar neuronal loss. Dynamic regulation of cytoarchitecture plays a vital role in such profound alterations of neuronal morphology. In particular, alterations in the neurofilament protein subunits have been implicated in neurite sprouting, neuronal regeneration, and growth. The present study was carried out to determine the influence of chronic ECS administration on the neurofilament subunits and other molecular markers of neuronal plasticity. Chronic ECS administration decreases the level of phosphorylated heavy neurofilament subunit (NF-H). In addition, the total level of the light neurofilament subunit (NF-L) but not the medium neurofilament subunit (NF-M) is decreased following chronic ECS treatment. Other cytoskeletal proteins, including actin, microtubule-associated protein (MAP-2), and tau, are not influenced by chronic ECS administration. Expression of the growth-associated protein (F1/GAP-43) also remains unchanged following chronic ECS treatment. The changes observed in neurofilaments may be part of the cytoskeletal remodeling that contributes to the mossy fiber sprouting induced by chronic ECS treatment.",
