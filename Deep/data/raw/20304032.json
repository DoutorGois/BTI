     "AB": "Tau phosphorylation and hypoxia are both linked to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. To find out the possible connection between hypoxia and tau phosphorylation, we performed this study to evaluate the level of phosphorylated tau under hypoxic or normal condition. We found in our study that hypoxia promoted the phosphorylation of tau protein via ERK pathway, which suggest hypoxia might be involved in the process of tau pathology.",
