     "AB": "Status epilepticus (SE) is associated with a dynamic plasticity of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors. The plasticity of AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated glutamatergic transmission during established SE (ESE), after development of benzodiazepine resistance, was evaluated. There was increased frequency and inward rectification of AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents at Schaffer collateral - CA1 pyramidal neuron synapses during ESE. Surface expression of the GluA1 subunit increased, and this was a consequence of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation. Further, diminishing glutamate release by activation of somatostatin receptors prevented SE. These studies suggest that AMPAR-mediated glutamatergic transmission is strengthened during ESE.",
