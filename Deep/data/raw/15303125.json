     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of acetylcholine (Ach) on gap junctional intercellular communication in rat hippocampus. METHODS: Ach was applied to primary co-cultured hippocampus neurons and glial cells. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to monitor the change of Ca(2+) in the cytoplasma. The effect of Ach on gap junctional intercellular communication(GJIC) was measured by scrape loading method. RESULTS: Ach(0.05-0.10 mmol/L) induced all changes in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration and calcium waves and calcium oscilation in cytoplasma. The Ca(2+) change could be blocked by scopolamine. Using scrape-loading method, we found GJIC notably enhanced 60 h after applying Ach to these cultured cells. CONCLUSION: Ach can enhance GJIC in hippocampus cells.",
