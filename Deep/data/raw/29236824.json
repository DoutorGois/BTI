     "AB": "Mesial temporal sclerosis creates a focal epileptic syndrome that usually requires surgical resection of mesial temporal structures. OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel operative technique for treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy and its clinical results. METHODS: Prospective case-series at a single institution, performed by a single surgeon, from 2006 to 2012. A total of 120 patients were submitted to minimally-invasive keyhole transtemporal amygdalohippocampectomy. RESULTS: Of the patients, 55% were male, and 85% had a right-sided disease. The first 70 surgeries had a mean surgical time of 2.51 hours, and the last 50 surgeries had a mean surgical time of 1.62 hours. There was 3.3% morbidity, and 5% mild temporal muscle atrophy. There was no visual field impairment. On the Engel Outcome Scale at the two-year follow-up, 71% of the patients were Class I, 21% were Class II, and 6% were Class III. CONCLUSION: This novel technique is feasible and reproducible, with optimal clinical results.",
