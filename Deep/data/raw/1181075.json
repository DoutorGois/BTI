     "AB": "Similar to thymocytes in the thymic cortex, certain brain structures, such as nerve tracts and nerve cells of the Ammon's horn, show an affinity to rabbit erythrocytes (RRBC) which is exemplified by the adherence of RRBC to frozen brain sections. The experimental conditions of this adherence reaction are identical with that previously found with guinea-pig thymus and lymph node sections. From the results it may be concluded that receptor substances similar in nature on thymocytes and brain are responsible for this adherence phenomenon.",
