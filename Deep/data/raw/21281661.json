     "AB": "The present study aimed to investigate the effects of tamoxifen (TMX) on locomotor behavior and on the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and creatine kinase (CK) in the brain of rats subjected to an animal model of mania induced by d-amphetamine (D-AMPH)-reversion and prevention protocols. The D-AMPH administration increased locomotor activity in saline-treated rats under prevention and reversion treatment; furthermore, there was evident reduction in the locomotion in the D-amphetamine group treated with TMX. D-AMPH significantly decreased the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in saline-treated rats in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and amygdala in both prevention and reversion treatment. Depending on the cerebral area and evaluated complex, TMX was able to prevent and reverse this impairment. A decrease in CK activity was also verified in the brain of rats when D-AMPH was administrated in both experiments; the administration of TMX reversed but not prevented the decrease in CK activity induced by D-AMPH. The present study demonstrated that TMX reversed and prevented the alterations in behavioral and energy metabolism induced by D-AMPH (alterations were also observed in bipolar disorder), reinforcing the need for more studies about inhibitors of PKC as possible targets for new medications in the treatment of bipolar disorder.",
