     "AB": "We compared the expression patterns of neurotrophin genes in the brain of senescence-accelerated mouse (SAMP8) which shows age-related impairment of learning behavior, with SAMR1 control which shows normal aging. By Northern blot analysis, NT-3 mRNA levels in the cortex were higher in SAMP8 than in SAMR1 mice during development, whereas in the midbrain, hippocampus and forebrain, NT-3 expression levels in SAMP8 were lower than those in SAMR1. At early stages, although NGF mRNA levels in SAMP8 were lower than those in SAMR1, BDNF mRNA levels were almost equivalent in both strains. By in situ hybridization analysis, NT-3 mRNA signals in the CA1 and CA2 regions in SAMP8 were shown to be reduced at early stages. However, BDNF mRNA signals were almost equivalent in both SAMR1 and SAMP8.",
