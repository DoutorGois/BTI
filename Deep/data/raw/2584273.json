     "AB": "The distribution and time course of altered cerebral metabolism following permanent focal ischemia was studied in rat using the 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) technique. Increased 2DG uptake preceded decreased 2DG uptake and infarction in the caudate putamen and cortex. Decreased 2DG uptake without infarction was observed for 72 h in thalamus and for 24 h in hippocampus (areas remote from the ischemic zones). This study supports the concept of cell excitation as a pathophysiologic process in permanent focal ischemia. The time course of increased metabolism may demarcate the time window of opportunity for the previously demonstrated attenuation of stroke size with inhibition of cell excitation by pharmacologic blockade of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission.",
