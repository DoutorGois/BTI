     "AB": "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, is a potent neurotrophic factor, which has a variety of biological activities that affect several types of neurons in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In this study, we examined the effects of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor on delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region of rats after transient forebrain ischemia. In the control rats pretreated with the vehicle, transient forebrain ischemia-induced delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region was observed seven days after reperfusion. Pretreatment with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (1.0 microg), which was directly microinjected into the right hippocampal CA1 region, gave significant protection against the delayed hippocampal neuronal death. On the contralateral side of the hippocampus, which was not injected with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, delayed neuronal death similar to that seen in vehicle-treated control animals was observed. Intracerebroventricular glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (2.5 microg) injection also protected against delayed neuronal death. In addition, pretreatment with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor gave significant protection against apoptotic cell death induced by brain ischemia in the hippocampal CA1 region, as determined by in situ staining for DNA fragmentation. These findings suggest that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor plays an important role in delayed neuronal death induced by brain ischemia.",
