     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: In mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), the rate of correct seizure lateralization of ictal semiology and ictal EEG is better for patients with unilateral interictal spikes (UIS) than for patients with bilateral interictal spikes (BIS), possibly due to rapid seizure propagation patterns associated with bilateral epileptogenesis. In this study, the authors investigated if ictal SPECT is a reliable diagnostic test for both UIS and BIS patients. METHODS: Video-EEG recording was used as the gold standard to examine the accuracy of ictal SPECT and its relationship with interictal and ictal EEG. Ninety-three consecutive patients with MTLE associated with hippocampal sclerosis were included in the analysis. Ictal SPECT was considered accurate if two blinded observers independently lateralized the scan correctly. RESULTS: Ictal SPECT correctly lateralized 75 (80.6%) of 93 scans. The rate of correct seizure lateralization was 87.6% for the UIS group and only 55.0% for the BIS group (p = 0.0027). In the EEG epochs, 66.7% of BIS patients vs 43.4% of UIS patients had nonlateralized ictal EEG (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that the accuracy of ictal SPECT is worse for MTLE patients with BIS than for those with UIS. The role of ictal SPECT in presurgical evaluation of patients with BIS must be reviewed.",
