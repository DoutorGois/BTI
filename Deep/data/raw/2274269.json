     "AB": "In order to observe acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and its distribution into soluble and membrane-bound molecular forms in cholinergically denervated hippocampus, AChE was analyzed in the hippocampus of adult mice with and without bilateral fornix lesions made by stereotactically positioned knife cuts. Homogenates from lesioned mice contained an average of 3% of choline acetyltransferase-specific activity, 12% of AChE-specific activity and 98% of protein compared to homogenates from controls. After lesioning, the relative proportion of membrane-bound G4 decreased from 77% to 56% of total AChE while soluble G4, membrane-bound G1-G2, and soluble G1-G2 each increased in relative abundance.",
