     "AB": "Different classes of ion channels have been implicated in sensing cold temperatures at mammalian thermoreceptor nerve endings. A major candidate is TRPM8, a non-selective cation channel of the transient receptor potential family, activated by menthol and low temperatures. We investigated the role of TRPM8 in cold sensing during transient expression in mouse cultured hippocampal neurones, a tissue that lacks endogenous expression of thermosensitive TRPs. In the absence of synaptic input, control hippocampal neurones were not excited by cooling. In contrast, all TRPM8-transfected hippocampal neurones were excited by cooling and menthol. However, in comparison to cold-sensitive trigeminal sensory neurones, hippocampal neurones exhibited much lower threshold temperatures, requiring temperatures below 27 degrees C to fire action potentials. These results directly demonstrate that expression of TRPM8 in mammalian neurones induces cold sensing, albeit at lower temperatures than native TRPM8-expressing neurones, suggesting the presence of additional modulatory mechanisms in the cold response of sensory neurones.",
