     "AB": "In the present study, we performed an analysis of tandem of P domains in a weak inwardly rectifying K+ channel (TWIK)-related acid-sensitive K+ (TASK)-1 channel immunoreactivity in the rat hippocampal complex following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). In control animals, TASK-1 immunoreactivity was strongly detected in astrocytes in the hippocampal complex. One day after SE, TASK-1 immunoreactivity in astrocytes was markedly reduced only in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. One week after SE, loss of astrocytes was observed in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. At this time point, TASK-1 immunoreactive cells were detected mainly in the subgranular region. These cells had bipolar, elongated cell bodies with fusiform-shaped nuclei and showed vimentin immunoreactivity. Four weeks after SE (when spontaneous seizure developed), typical reactive astrogliosis was observed in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 region. Almost no astrocytes in the molecular layer showed TASK-1 immunoreactivity, whereas astrocytes in the CA1 region showed strong TASK-1 immunoreactivity. These findings indicate that, after SE, TASK-1 immunoreactivity was differentially altered in astrocytes located in different regions of the hippocampal complex, and these changes were caused by astroglial degeneration/regeneration. Therefore, alteration in TASK-1 immunoreactivity may contribute to acquisition of the properties of the epileptic hippocampal complex.",
