The emission wavelengths were predicted by computational analysis, which enabled us to visualize multicolor images by two-photon excitation with single wavelength, and to design a turn-on, two-photon fluorescence sensor for endogenous H2 O2 in Raw 264.7 macrophage and rat brain hippocampus ex vivo.",
