     "AB": "Using a combination of the selective opioid receptor-like1 (ORL1) receptor agonist, Ro 64-6198, and orphanin FQ/nociceptin (OFQ/N) peptide knockout (KO) mice, the influence of OFQ/N on cognition has been studied in the rodent. In wild type, C57BL/6J mice, Ro 64-6198 (0.3-1 mg/kg i.p.) impaired the acquisition of spatial learning in the Morris water maze, although a mild neurological impairment was evident which complicated precise interpretation. In Lister hooded rats, Ro 64-6198 (6 mg/kg i.p.) produced delay dependent impairments in rats performing either a delayed matching or a delayed nonmatching to position task with only a modest (< 20%) effect on omissions - an effect consistent with a short-term memory impairment. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated an inhibitory effect of OFQ/N on LTP recorded from the CA1 region of wild type mice, but not in ORL1 receptor knockout mice. In contrast to the ORL1 agonist, mice deficient in the OFQ/N peptide showed some evidence of improved spatial learning, fear conditioning and passive avoidance retention. However, CA1 LTP was similar between OFQ/N peptide KO mice and wild type controls. Subsequent receptor radioautography studies demonstrated the presence of ORL1 receptors within various regions of the medial temporal lobe system: i.e. CA1, dentate gyrus molecular layer, subiculum, perirhinal cortex. Taken together, these results suggest a bi-directional effect of OFQ/N containing systems on aspects of cognitive behaviour, particularly those elements associated with hippocampal function. This is consistent with a likely modulatory role of OFQ/N on hippocampal and associated cortical circuitry.",
