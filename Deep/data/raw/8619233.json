     "AB": "A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that describes the kinetics of organic anions by using 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic (2,4-D) as a representative compound was constructed for the developing rabbit brain at near-term pregnancy (Gestation Day 30). The model consisted of brain, body, and venous and arterial compartments for the mother which were linked to the fetus by a placenta. Maternal brain compartments in the model were brain plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain tissue including hypothalamus, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, forebrain, brainstem, and cerebellum. The fetus consisted of brain, body, amniotic fluid, and venous and arterial compartments. the maternal body had both a central and a deep compartment; the fetal body had only one compartment. Maternal blood flow to the fetus was modeled as blood flowing to the placenta, where it was equilibrated before it reached the fetus. The brain uptake was membrane-limited by the blood-brain barrier, with saturable clearance from the CSF into the venous blood by the choroid plexus in both fetus and mother. The model was used to compare concentrations of 2,4-D in maternal and fetal brain, maternal and fetal plasma, and amniotic fluid over time with experimental data from pregnant rabbits given 2,4-D intravenously (1, 10, or 40 mg/kg). The model adequately simulated the 2-hr time course of 2,4-D concentrations in both mother and fetus. With continued development, this generic PBPK model should be a useful tool for evaluating the safety of organic acid neurotoxicants in the developing brain.",
