     "AB": "The central nervous system produces many of the enzymes responsible for corticosteroid synthesis. A model system to study the regulation of this local system would be valuable. Previously, we have shown that primary cultures of hippocampal neurons isolated from the fetal rat can perform the biochemical reactions associated with the enzymes 11beta-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase. Here, we demonstrate directly that these enzymes are present within primary cultures of fetal rat hippocampal neurons.",
