     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a decline in cued recall is observable in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer disease (AD) in clinically normal older adults with elevated beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden on PET imaging. METHODS: Clinically normal older adults underwent baseline neuroimaging (PET to assess Abeta(+/-) status and MRI) and annual neuropsychological testing. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the relative risk of cued memory decline (drop of 1, 2, 3, or 4 points on the total score of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test) in relation to neuroimaging measures, functional status, age, sex, and education. RESULTS: A total of 276 older adults (Clinical Dementia Rating = 0, mean Mini-Mental State Examination score = 29 +/- 1.06) were followed up for a mean of 3.6 +/- 1.2 years. Despite the infrequency of cued memory decline (only 19% of participants scored </=46/48 in total recall by year 3), Abeta(+) participants were 3.55 times (95% confidence interval = 1.77-7.12) more likely to exhibit decline in total recall (</=46/48) compared with their Abeta(-) peers. Furthermore, Abeta(+) participants who scored </=46/48 had smaller hippocampal volumes (t = 3.37, p = 0.001) and evidence of early functional decline, i.e., greater risk of progression to global Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5 (chi(2) = 14.30, p < 0.001), compared with their Abeta(+) peers with intact total recall. CONCLUSIONS: Cued memory decline in healthy older adults may be particularly indicative of Abeta-related decline during the preclinical stage of AD and useful for identifying Abeta(+) clinically normal individuals at greatest risk of short-term clinical progression.",
