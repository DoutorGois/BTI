     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying limbic epileptogenesis may reveal novel targets for preventive therapy. Studies of TrkB mutant mice led us to hypothesize that signaling through a specific phospholipase (PLC), PLCgamma1, promoted development of kindling. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we examined the development of kindling in PLCgamma1 heterozygous mice. We also examined the cellular and subcellular location of PLCgamma1 in adult wild-type mice. RESULTS: The development of kindling was impaired in PLCgamma1 heterozygous mice compared to wild-type controls. PLCgamma1 immunoreactivity was localized to the soma and dendrites of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus of adult mice. SIGNIFICANCE: This study implicates PLCgamma1 signaling as the dominant pathway by which TrkB activation promotes limbic epileptogenesis. Its cellular localization places PLCgamma1 in a position to modify the efficacy of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. These findings advance PLCgamma1 as a novel target for therapies aimed at preventing temporal lobe epilepsy induced by status epilepticus.",
