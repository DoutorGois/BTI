     "AB": "Tryptophan metablolism via kynureninc pathway leads to the formation of several neuroactive substances including kynurenine, anthranilic acid and quinolinic acid, which are involved in numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Also chronic renal insufficiency is associated with neurological disturbances but it is still not clear which substances are responsible for those disorders. Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate the concentration of tryptophan, kynurenine and anthranilic acid in plasma as well as in different brain regions in uremic rats. We have shown that tryptophan concentrations in plasma and in brain were decreased, whereas kynurenine and anthranilic acid levels were elevated, both in plasma and in central nervous system. Only in cerebellum and hippocampus were no difference in concentration of antranilic acid between control and uremic rats. Accumulation of tryptophan metabolites in nervous tissue may be involved in pathogenesis of several neurological disorders in uremia.",
