The authors present three patients encountered consecutively with TD and compare them to previously published cases. Lesions causing TD included a right splenial/cuneus infarct, a right > left medial temporo-occipital infarct, and a left splenial infarct. TD as an isolated symptom may occur from lesion in a variety of posterior medial locations, including the parahippocampus, splenium, and retrosplenial cortex.",
