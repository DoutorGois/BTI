Subsequent transplantation of the embryonal hippocampal tissue suspension brought about an increase of the number of neurons. Groups of nerve cells were located at the tips of the implantation tracts. Neurons formed dendritic trees of various complexity. Most of them had an irregular dendritic branching pattern. Only those located within the pyramidal layer, had the typical arrangement of several basal and one apical dendrite.",
