The RNA polymerases I and II activities generally increased during maturation, i.e., from 10 days to 6 months of postnatal age and then showed a decrease from 6 months to 2 years of age in all the regions except in cerebral cortex where the RNA polymerase II activity was highest at 10 days but showed a gradual decrease through the lifespan up to 2 years.",
