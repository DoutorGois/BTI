     "AB": "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are extremely toxic environmental contaminant speculated to accelerate neurochemical and behavioral damages. Developmental and behavioral development relies on the proper functioning of the endogenous neurotransmitters that remain the pivotal target of neurotoxicants. This study intent to evidence the neuroprotective efficacy of quercetin against PCBs induced hippocampal degeneration. Animals were sorted into four (n=6), Group I: received corn oil (vehicle) intraperitoneally (i.p.); Group II: received quercetin 50 mg/kg bwt (gavage); Group III: were induced with Aroclor 1254 (commercial mixture of PCB) at 2 mg/kg bwt (i.p); Group IV: received quercetin 50 mg/kg bwt (gavage) and along with PCBs 2 mg/kg bwt (i.p.) for 30 days. Cognitive behaviors such as learning and memory were assessed by 8-arm radial maze behavior test throughout the experimental period. Subsequently, anxiety and stress were studied by open field test at the termination of experiment. Hippocampal tissue and blood were collected after the intended experimental period to analyze the levels of oxidative stressors, antioxidants in tissue and estimation of neurotransmitters. Perhaps, PCBs evoke detrimental deterioration of the neurotransmitters and integrative antioxidant defense by elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Concurrent treatment with quercetin prominently suppresses the oxidative stressors, improved the levels of enzymatic antioxidants and neurotransmitter levels significantly at the level of p<0.05. Behavioral analysis claims drastic revitalization of cognitive functions like learning and memory on treatment with quercetin. The results coalesced depicts neurotoxicity stimulated by PCBs is augmented by simultaneous quercetin administration.",
