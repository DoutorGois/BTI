     "AB": "NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (NMDAR-LTD) is a form of synaptic plasticity leading to long-lasting decreases in synaptic strength. NMDAR-LTD is essential for spatial and working memory, but its role in hippocampus-dependent fear memory has yet to be determined. Induction of NMDAR-LTD requires the activation of caspase-3 by cytochrome c. Cytochrome c normally resides in mitochondria and during NMDAR-LTD is released from mitochondria, a process promoted by Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein). Bax induces cell death in apoptosis, but it plays a nonapoptotic role in NMDAR-LTD. Here, we investigated the role of NMDAR-LTD in fear memory in CA1-specific Bax knock-out mice. In hippocampal slices from these knock-out mice, while long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission, basal synaptic transmission, and paired-pulse ratio are intact, LTD in both young and fear-conditioned adult mice is obliterated. Interestingly, in CA1-specific Bax knock-out mice, long-term contextual fear memory is impaired, but the acquisition of fear memory and innate fear are normal. Moreover, these conditional Bax knock-out mice exhibit less behavioral despair. These findings indicate that NMDAR-LTD is required for consolidation, but not the acquisition of fear memory. Our study also shows that Bax plays an important role in depressive behavior.",
