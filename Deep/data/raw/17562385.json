     "AB": "In the present study, we examined nociceptive behaviors on various pain models after the pretreatment of kainic acid intracerebroventricularly. We found that intracerebroventricular administration of kainic acid shows significant neuronal damage on the hippocampal CA3 region in the brain slices stained with cresyl violet. Compared to the control group, intracerebroventricular pretreatment of kainic acid significantly attenuated nocifensive behaviors induced by intraplantar formalin (only in the 2nd phase), intrathecal glutamate, TNF-alpha or IL-1beta. However, nocifensive behaviors induced by intraperitoneal acetic acid (writhing test), intrathecal substance P or IFN-gamma were not affected by the pretreatment of kainic acid. These results suggest that (1) KA-induced alterations of nocifensive behaviors are related to the neuronal death of the hippocampal formation, especially CA3 pyramidal neurons and (2) nocifensive behaviors induced by formalin, acetic acid, SP, glutamate, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were modulated in a different manner.",
