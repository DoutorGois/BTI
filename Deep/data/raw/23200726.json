     "AB": "Expression of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and spatial learning and memory were observed in rat model of diffuse traumatic brain injury (TBI) due to lateral head acceleration with an aim at investigating the relation between GRs expression and cognitive deficits. Immunohistochemical staining, Western blotting, and RT-PCR indicated that down-regulation of GRs expression occurred in the hippocampus among TBI-rats which demonstrated reduced performance of learning and memory in Morris water maze. As the GRs expression bounced up, the cognitive function approached to normal. It is concluded that reduced expression of hippocampal GRs was closely associated with learning and memory deficits in TBI-rats. Hippocampal GRs was involved in the biochemical mechanisms of cognitive deficits after TBI.",
