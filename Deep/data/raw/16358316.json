     "AB": "It has been suggested that the vestibular system may contribute to the development of higher cognitive function, especially spatial learning and memory that uses idiothetic cues (e.g., dead reckoning). However, few studies have been done using behavioral tasks that could potentially separate the animals' ability for dead reckoning from piloting. The food foraging task requires the animal to continuously monitor and integrate self-movement cues and generate an accurate return path. It has been shown that bilateral vestibular-lesioned rats were impaired on this task. The present study used the same task to further examine the contribution of vestibular information to spatial navigation by comparing unilateral and bilateral lesions and by testing the animals at different time points following the lesion. The results demonstrated that animals with unilateral vestibular deafferentation were impaired in performing the task in the dark at 3 months after the lesion, and this impairment disappeared at 6 months after the lesion. This supports the notion that vestibular information contributes to dead reckoning and suggests possible recovery of function over time after the lesion. Animals with bilateral vestibular deafferentation were not able to be tested on the foraging task because they exhibited behavior distinct from the unilateral-lesioned animals, with significant hesitation in leaving their home cage for as long as 6 months after the lesion.",
