     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that the expression of Abeta and clusterin is positively correlated. However, the causal relationship between Abeta and clusterin has not been exactly clarified. METHODS: In this study, primary hippocampal neurons were treated with Abeta42; clusterin mRNA and protein expression was assessed. Furthermore, we evaluated Abeta and clusterin protein expression in the brains of APP/PSEN1 mice, as well as serum clusterin concentration. RESULTS: We observed here that the exposure of primary hippocampal neurons to Abeta42 induced an overexpression of intracellular clusterin, but the level of clusterin in supernatants was not changed. Moreover, in APP/PSEN1 mice, there was a significant increase in intracellular clusterin in cortex and hippocampus, compared to age-matched WT mice, while serum clusterin level in APP/PSEN1 mice and in WT mice has no significant difference. CONCLUSION: Abeta42 upregulated intracellular clusterin, but secretory clusterin did not change. These findings reveal that clusterin is upregulated by Abeta and is responsive to AD pathology, although plasma clusterin concentration is not evidenced to be a stand-alone biomarker for AD.",
