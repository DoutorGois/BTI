     "AB": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease and familial ALS accounts for 10% of cases. The identification of familial ALS mutations in the actin-binding protein profilin 1 directly implicates actin dynamics and regulation in the pathogenesis of ALS. The mechanism by which these mutations cause ALS is unknown. In this study we show that expression of the ALS-associated actin-binding deficient mutant of PFN1 (PFN1(C71G)) results in increased dendritic arborisation and spine formation, and cytoplasmic inclusions in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons.",
