     "AB": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term neurodevelopmental consequences of currently applied acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy containing chemotherapy alone or combined with 12 Gy radiotherapy. Seventy-nine children aged 6.3-21.7 years diagnosed with ALL and treated according to ALL IC-BFM 2002 have been studied. The control group consisted of 23 children newly diagnosed with ALL. We assessed subcortical gray matter volume using automatic MRI segmentation and cognitive performance to identify differences between three therapeutic schemes and patients prior to treatment. Irradiated patients had smaller selected subcortical volumes than those treated with chemotherapy alone and than the controls, while the chemotherapy group had similar volumes as the control one. In neurocognitive assessment, irradiated children performed worse in major domains than the control group. There were no significant results for patients after high dose chemotherapy without radiotherapy. There was a significant relationship between full scale IQ together with verbal learning and volumes of hippocampus, amygdala, and pallidum. In all children treated for ALL, both decreased volume of selected subcortical structures and cognitive impairment were observed, especially in children who were irradiated.",
