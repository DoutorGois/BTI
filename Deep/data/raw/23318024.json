     "AB": "According to different studies, between 5% and 10% of people suffer a single isolated seizure episode at some time in their life. However, little is known about the effects of a single seizure episode on cognitive function, and clinical investigations of this issue are not easy to perform. In this situation, animal models may be a reasonable choice. The aim of our study was to follow the time course of delayed effects of generalized clonic-tonic convulsions on learning and memory functions in rats. A clonic-tonic seizure episode was induced by a single i.p. injection of pentylenetetrazole (70 mg/kg). Different behavioral tests were performed between days 10 and 100 after the convulsant administration. A single seizure episode resulted in a gradual decline in short-term memory function as assessed by novel object recognition and social recognition tests. The seizure episode induced a quick increase in hippocampal cell proliferation; however, the excessive newly generated cells seemed to be eliminated by the time of obvious cognitive impairment. These observations are indicative of a slowly developing and long-lasting influence of a single seizure episode on cognitive function. A rather long time period between the seizure episode and the manifestations of cognitive decline provides a window for a possible therapeutic intervention, and an elaboration of such \"post-conditioning\" treatments may be a promising opportunity to prevent subsequent mental impairments in patients.",
