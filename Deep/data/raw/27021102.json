     "AB": "We studied the contribution of large conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels (BKCa) in the mechanisms of neuromodulatory effects of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 on hypoxiainduced changes in activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampus. We used the method of registration of population spikes from CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices before, during, and after exposure to short-term episodes of hypoxia. Selective blocker (iberiotoxin) and selective activator of BKCa (BMS-191011) were used to evaluate the contribution of these channels in the mechanisms of suppressive effects of IL-10 on changes in neuronal activity during hypoxia and development of post-hypoxic hyperexcitability. It was shown that BKCa are involved in the modulatory effects of IL-10 on hypoxia-induced suppression of activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and development of post-hypoxic hyperexcitability in these neurons.",
