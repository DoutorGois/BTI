     "AB": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) can result in impaired cognition and mental acuity, and the generation of mood disorders, including depression. However, the mechanisms of neuronal damage for these complications have not been elucidated. Accordingly, using immunohistochemical technique with monoclonal antibody against single-stranded DNA, we examined the morphological effects of chronic recurrent apnea on neurons in the hippocampus and related forebrain sites in guinea pigs. Our results show that a large number of neurons labeled by anti-ssDNA antibody were present in the cingulate, insular and frontal cortices, the hippocampus and the amygdala in conjunction with periods of recurrent apnea. However, no labeling was observed in comparable regions of the brain in control guinea pigs. In the cortices of experimental animals, labeled neurons were detected mainly in the superficial layers (II-III) in the frontal, insular and cingulate cortex. In the hippocampus, most labeled neurons were located in the CA1 region, in which most of stained neurons were observed in strata pyramidal, while only a few positive neurons were located in the strata radiatum and the strata oriens. In addition, a large number of labeled neurons were also detected in the central nucleus of amygdala in the guinea pigs underwent recurrent periods of apnea. The present data indicate that recurrent apnea results in cell death in the hippocampus and related forebrain regions via mechanisms of apoptosis, which may represent the basis for the clinical complications of obstructive sleep apnea and sleep-disordered breathing.",
