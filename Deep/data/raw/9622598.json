     "AB": "We investigated the effectiveness of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and muramyl dipeptide (MDP) administered into the brain to induce anorexia in acutely fasted Wistar rats allowed to refeed. We also assayed for changes in mRNA levels of IL-1 system components, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1, glycoprotein 130 (gp 130), leptin receptor (OB-R), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), neuropeptide Y (NPY), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and CRF receptor (CRF-R) in selected brain regions. The data show that LPS and MDP induced anorexia differentially during refeeding. LPS-induced anorexia was of a stronger magnitude and duration than that of MDP. RNase protection assays showed that LPS and MDP significantly increased the expression of IL-1beta, IL-1 receptor type I, and TNF-alpha mRNAs in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus; LPS was more potent in all cases. MDP treatment, on the other hand, induced a stronger increase in hypothalamic levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and TGF-beta1 mRNAs relative to LPS. In addition, competitive RT-PCR analysis showed that LPS induced an eleven-fold increase in IL-1alpha mRNA in the hypothalamus relative to vehicle. These findings suggest that LPS and MDP mediate anorexia through different cytokine mechanisms. A stronger up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Ra and TGF-beta1) mRNA expression by MDP may be involved in the weaker MDP-induced anorexia relative to LPS. No significant changes were observed in the peptide components examined except for an up-regulation in cerebellar gp 130 mRNA and down-regulation of hypothalamic GR mRNA expression in response to LPS or MDP. This study shows that LPS and MDP induce anorexia in fasted rats allowed to refeed, and suggests an important role for endogenous cytokine-cytokine interactions.",
