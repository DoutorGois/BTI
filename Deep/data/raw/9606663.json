     "AB": "Peculiarities of the CNS response to chronic treatment with L-DOPA were revealed by quantitative cytochemical methods in August (stress-sensitive) and Wistar (emotionally resistant) rats. In August rats L-DOPA administration caused aminopeptidase activity increase in sensomotor cortex layer 3 and nucleus accumbens, glutamate dehydrogenase activity growth in nucleus accumbens as well as the elevation of monoaminoxidase (MAO) activity in nucleus caudatus and nucleus accumbens (serotonin as substrate) and in nucleus caudatus and hippocampus (tryptamine as substrate), while acetyl cholinesterase activity did not change at all. At the same time in Wistar rats only glutamate dehydrogenase activity increase was observed in nucleus caudatus and nucleus accumbens.",
