     "AB": "Our previous microdialysis study of freely moving rats demonstrated that 3 pyrethroids, allethrin (type I), cyhalothrin (type II) and deltamethrin (type II) differentially modulate acetylcholine (ACh) release in the hippocampus. To better understand the mechanisms of their modulatory effects and also other effects on the cholinergic system in the brain, the activities of ACh hydrolyzing enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), ACh synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and ACh synthesizing rate-limiting step, high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) were examined in the present study. The pyrethroids studied had no effect on AChE activity in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum. These pyrethroids had no significant effect on ChAT in the cortex and hippocampus, but striatal ChAT was increased at higher dosage (60 mg/kg) by all three compounds. Lineweaver-Burk analysis of hippocampal HACU revealed that the pyrethroids did not alter the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) value but caused alteration of maximal velocity (Vmax). Allethrin (60 mg/kg) and cyhalothrin (20 and 60 mg/kg) decreased while deltamethrin (60 mg/kg) increased the Vmax for HACU. In vitro study showed that at higher concentrations (> or = 10(-) (6) M) allethrin and cyhalothrin reduced the hippocampal HACU but deltamethrin increased it. These results suggest that mechanisms of ACh synthesis are involved in the modulatory effects of the pyrethroids on ACh release and other cholinergic activities.",
