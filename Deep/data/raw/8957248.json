     "AB": "Here we investigate the effects of the novel selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, N-[2-[4-(2 methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl cyclo-hexanecarboxamide (WAY 100635), and the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, R-(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepin++ +-7-ol (SCH 23390), on the increase in extracellular noradrenaline in rat hippocampus induced by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 and 1 mg/kg s.c.) caused a dose-related increase in extracellular noradrenaline. WAY 100635 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg s.c.) did not block the release of noradrenaline induced by the higher dose of 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg s.c.) but abolished the response to the lower dose (0.1 mg/kg s.c.). When administered alone, WAY 100635 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg s.c.) had no effect on extracellular noradrenaline. The postsynaptically mediated 5-HT behavioural syndrome induced by the higher dose of 8-OH-DPAT, in contrast to the increase in noradrenaline, was completely blocked by WAY 100635 (0.3 mg/kg s.c.). Finally, the noradrenaline response to 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) was blocked by SCH 23390 (0.5 mg/kg s.c.). Our data confirm that noradrenaline can be released by activation of 5-HT1A receptors but show that these receptors are not tonically activated, and may be more sensitive to stimulation than classical postsynaptic 5-HT1a receptors. A role for the dopamine D1 receptor in the noradrenaline response to 8-OH-DPAT is also suggested.",
