     "AB": "The whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was used to study the effects of chlorpromazine (CPZ), a widely used antipsychotic drug, on miniature GABAA-mediated synaptic currents (mIPSCs) in hippocampal cells in culture. CPZ (10-30 microM) induced a clear dose-dependent increase of mIPSCs frequency that was associated with a decrease in amplitude and with an acceleration of their decay kinetics. When applied in a calcium-free medium, CPZ was less effective in enhancing mIPSCs frequency, suggesting that this effect was partially calcium dependent. While a low (10 microM) CPZ concentration induced a 2-fold increase in the total charge transfer a higher (30 microM) dose of this drug produced no changes, indicating that the presynaptic effect was counterbalanced by the postsynaptic one.",
