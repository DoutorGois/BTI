The latter's 'local' (Poincarean) rather than standing (Helmholtzian) display may have advantages in 3-dimensional diagnostic imaging. At the same time, the system provides a technologically realizable abstract model in terms of which to express (and perhaps eventually explain) the experimental results of O'Keefe and Nadel on the functioning of the hippocampus in the mammalian brain.",
