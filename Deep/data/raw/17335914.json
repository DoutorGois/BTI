     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) remain widely accepted vertebrate models for the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie synaptic changes during learning and memory. Although LTD is a phenomenon that occurs in many regions of the CNS, it is clear that the mechanisms recruited in its induction and expression can vary, depending on many factors, including brain region and developmental time point. LTD in the hippocampus and cerebellum is probably the best characterized, although there are also other brain areas where mechanisms of LTD are well understood, and where it is thought to have a functional role.",
