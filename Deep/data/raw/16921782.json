     "AB": "Schizophrenia is a clinically heterogeneous state without clearly defined pathogenesis. This limits the classification approaches with consequent lack of ability for individual treatment strategies. It becomes evident that hippocampus is a key structure in the neuropathology of schizophrenia and a concept of hippocampal reduction as an endophenotype of schizophrenia was established. The biggest support came from MRI volumetric studies. Despite that, due to some inconsistent findings, clinical consequences of hippocampal shrinkage are not yet clear. Contemporary methods of brain imaging (computation morphometry, voxel-based morphometry) could help us to outline the concept of schizophrenia and to clarify the clinical consequences of brain structure changes.",
