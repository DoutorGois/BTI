     "AB": "The delay in clinical effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) suggest the existence of adaptive phenomena, such as receptor sensitivity changes. To examine the effects of repeated administration of SSRIs on serotonin neurotransmission, we investigated the effects of acute and chronic administration of the SSRI fluvoxamine on the extracellular levels of 5-HT in the median raphe nucleus and dorsal hippocampus of conscious rats by means of brain microdialysis. A single oral dose of fluvoxamine (30 mg/kg) augmented extracellular 5-HT in the median raphe and dorsal hippocampus to 270 and 191% of baseline level, respectively. Administration of fluvoxamine (30 mg/kg) or vehicle for 14 days did not affect 5-HT baseline levels. Moreover, the increase in extracellular 5-HT in the median raphe nucleus and dorsal hippocampus after an oral dose of fluvoxamine (30 mg/kg) in rats chronically treated with fluvoxamine was not different from rats treated with vehicle. Using RU 24969 as a probe for the sensitivity of the 5-HT1B autoreceptors in the dorsal hippocampus, no change in receptor sensitivity could be observed. These results demonstrate that repeated oral treatment with fluvoxamine does not affect extracellular 5-HT in the median raphe and dorsal hippocampus, suggesting that presynaptic functional changes of 5-HT in the brain areas tested are not implicated in the observed delayed onset of action of this SSRI in humans.",
