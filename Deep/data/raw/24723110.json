     "AB": "Soluble amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) oligomers have been recognized to be early and key intermediates in Alzheimer's disease-related synaptic dysfunction. In this study, using in vitro electrophysiology, we investigated interactions of the acidic oligosaccharide sugar chain (AOSC), a marine-derived acidic oligosaccharide, with oligomeric Abeta. We found that the inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by Abeta oligomers can be dose dependently reversed by the application of AOSC, whereas AOSC alone did not alter normal LTP induction. Interestingly, treatment with Abeta monomers with or without AOSC did not affect LTP induction. Additionally, when fresh-made Abeta was co-incubated with AOSC before in vitro testing, there was no impairment of LTP induction. The results from Western blots demonstrated that AOSC prevent the aggregation of Abeta oligomers. These findings indicate that AOSC may reverse Abeta oligomer-mediated cytotoxicity by directly disrupting the amyloid oligomer aggregation, and this action is concentration dependent. Thus, we propose that AOSC might be a potential therapeutic drug for Alzheimer's disease due to its protection against oligomeric Abeta-induced dysfunction of synaptic plasticity.",
