     "AB": "The primary function of neurons is to integrate synaptic inputs and to transmit the results to other cells. Recent studies with somatic whole-cell recordings have shown that separate excitatory inputs to hippocampal or cortical pyramidal neurons are summated non-linearly. In the present study, we examined how postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) are summated along the dendrites employing fast optical voltage imaging techniques. Rat hippocampal slices were stained with a fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye (JPW1114) and optical signals were monitored with a 16 x 16 photodiode array system. Two independent input pathways were stimulated individually or in pairs through glass electrodes such that different locations of the dendrites received separate synaptic inputs. We found that (1) the summation of PSPs was sub-linear along the entirety of dendrites, (2) the blockade of GABA(A) receptors suppressed sub-linearity and (3) further blockade of GABA(B) receptors suppressed sub-linearity of the summation of separate inputs on apical dendrites. Our study demonstrates that pyramidal neurons integrate PSPs linearly along the entirety of dendrites; moreover, GABAergic inputs are responsible for maintaining sub-linear summation in CA1 pyramidal neurons.",
