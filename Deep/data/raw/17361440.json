     "AB": "Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-2alpha (CTLA-2alpha), an inhibitor peptide homologous to the proregion of mouse cathepsin L, was originally discovered and expressed in mouse-activated T-cells and mast cells. Expressed recombinant CTLA-2alpha is shown to exhibit selective inhibition to cathepsin L-like cysteine proteinases. However, its in vivo targets in mammalian tissues are yet to be identified. We carried out in situ hybridization studies to examine the expression pattern of CTLA-2alpha mRNA and determine the specific cell types synthesizing CTLA-2alpha in the mouse brain. CTLA-2alpha mRNA was detected in various neuronal populations within the telencephalon in cerebral cortices, olfactory system, septum, basal ganglia, amygdala and highest levels were observed in the hippocampus. Within the diencephalon high density of positive cells was found in mediodorsal and lateral posterior thalamic nuclei and medial habenular nucleus (MHb). In the hypothalamus, high density of CTLA-2alpha mRNA labeling was seen in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (Sch), optic tract, arcuate nucleus, and median eminence. The fasciculus retroflexus and its termination in the mesencephalic interpeduncular nucleus were also densely labeled. Other mesencephalic expression sites were the superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, paramedian raphe nucleus, and inferior colliculus. In the rhombencephalon, strong labeling was detected in the pontine, vestibular, and reticular nuclei. Intense expression was also noted within cerebellar cortex in Purkinje neurons and at a moderate level in granule cell layer, stellate, and basket cells. A possible function of this novel inhibitor peptide in relation to learning, memory, and diseases is discussed.",
