     "AB": "The brains of adult rats, exposed prenatally to one of four intensities (between 10 nanoTesla and 1.2 microTesla) of either a frequency-modulated magnetic field or a complex sequenced field designed to affect brain development, were examined histologically. Although from each intensity some rats that had been exposed to the complex sequenced magnetic field showed minor anomalies, those exposed to intensities between 30 nT and 180 nT exhibited conspicuous anomalous organizations of cells within the hippocampal formation. In other studies, rats that had been exposed during their entire prenatal development to the complex sequenced field displayed significantly more activity in the open field and poorer spatial memory during maze learning. Photomicrographs are shown of one conspicuous morphological anomaly within the right hippocampus of an adult rat exposed prenatally to the complex sequenced magnetic field with intensities between .3 mG and .5 mG (30 nT to 50 nT). The results suggest that complex magnetic fields, whose temporal structures approach the time constants of normal biochemical processes, can permanently alter the development of the brain.",
