     "AB": "Cell therapy using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) seems to be a new alternative for the treatment of neurological diseases, including stroke. In order to investigate the response of hippocampal tissue to factors secreted by MSC and if these factors are neuroprotective in a model of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), we used organotypic hippocampal cultures exposed to conditioned medium from bone marrow-derived MSC. Our results suggest that the conditioned medium obtained from these cells aggravates lesion caused by OGD. In addition, the presence of the conditioned medium alone was toxic mainly to cells in the CA1, CA2 and CA3 areas of the hippocampal organotypic culture even in basal conditions. GABA stimulation and NMDA and AMPA receptors antagonists were able to reduce propidium iodide staining, suggesting that the cell death induced by the toxic factors secreted by MSC could involve these receptors.",
