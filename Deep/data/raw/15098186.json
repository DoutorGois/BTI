     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Psychosis is an acknowledged, although infrequent, complication that occurs in 0.5 9% of all cases of epilepsy. In this work, we present a case of complex partial epilepsy due to a dysembryoplastic neuroectodermal tumour in the right hippocampus, which began as acute psychosis and was cured following its surgical removal. Both its aetiology and its pathogenesis are discussed. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 17 year old male with a family history of schizophrenia. While studying his last years of secondary education, and apparently well adapted, he was taken into custody and hospitalised urgently because of personality disorders. The patient suffered from somatic and auditory hallucinations, simple visual pseudohallucinations, formal alterations to his thinking, cosmovisions, delusions of influence, persecution, grandeur and of a mystic nature, with no other neurological focus. At the same time, the patient also had complex partial seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic tumour in the right temporal lobe. Pathology laboratory findings showed a dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour. For a period of two years following surgical removal, the schizophrenic symptoms and the complex partial seizures disappeared and the patient no longer required antipsychotic medication. CONCLUSIONS: Epileptic psychosis may be related to pathological conditions of the hippocampus. In this study we present what we believe to be the first case of a dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour giving rise to such psychosis. Surgical removal of the tumour cured both entities.",
