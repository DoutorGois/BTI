     "AB": "The levels of PLCgamma, a phospholipase C (PLC) isozyme, were higher in the cytosol fraction than in the membrane fraction in several control brain regions. The levels of PLCgamma were significantly elevated in the membrane, but not in the cytosolic fraction of the hippocampus of AD subjects. In the superior and middle temporal gyri (SMTG) of AD subjects, the levels of PLCgamma were significantly elevated in both the membrane and cytosolic fractions. In the inferior parietal lobule and cerebellum of AD subjects, no significant changes were found in the PLCgamma levels of either cytosolic or membrane fractions. These results suggest that the increased levels of PLCgamma, by increasing the hydrolysis of PIP2 in the hippocampus and SMTG, may contribute to pathophysiology of AD. These results also support a role for excitatory neurotransmitters and their receptors in AD.",
