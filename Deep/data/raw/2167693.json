     "AB": "Multiunit activity was chronically recorded in the hippocampus (CA3 field), the magnocellular medial geniculate (MGm) and the auditory cortex (AC) of rats during acquisition (12 daily sessions, 10 trials per session) and long-term retention of differential classical conditioning (tones paired with footshocks). Marked increases of multiunit discharges to CS + presentations were first detected in the MGm (5-10 trials) followed (10-20 trials) by the emergence of discriminative responses in the hippocampus and in the AC. During long-term retention tests, 45 days after the end of conditioning, CS + selective responses were observed in the 3 structures. We propose that learning-induced changes in the conditioned stimulus (CS) sensory pathway can have the same temporal stability as the sensory plasticity observed during development or post injury in adult animals.",
