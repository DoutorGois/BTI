     "AB": "Cells of origin of the entorhinohippocampal pathway were retrogradely labeled by injection of Fast Blue into the ipsilateral hippocampus. The cells, which were located in layers I, II and III of the lateral entorhinal cortex, were then intracellularly injected with Lucifer Yellow to reveal their complete morphology. We could thus establish that among the hippocampally projecting entorhinal cells there are pyramidal and pyramid-like cells, spiny stellate cells of various shapes, sparsely spinous horizontal and multipolar cells. The involvement of horizontal and multipolar neurons in projections has not previously been recognized although all of these cell types have already been described in Golgi studies. The results indicate that the organization of the perforant path is more complex than has been assumed. Finally, they are at variance with the classical concept which subdivides cortical neurons into projection neurons (pyramidal and spiny stellate) and interneurons (non-pyramidal, local circuit neurons).",
