     "AB": "In-vitro quantitative receptor autoradiography with [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) was used to determine the affinity constant (Kd) and the maximum number of receptor sites (Bmax) for protein kinase C (PKC) in subregions of the gerbil hippocampus, and to compare the distribution of [3H]PDBu binding sites in the gerbil hippocampus with that in the rat hippocampus. The Kd and Bmax values in the subregions of the gerbil hippocampus were estimated at 2.6-3.8 nM and 2.38-2.54 pmol (mg tissue)-1, respectively. The distribution of hippocampus [3H]PDBu binding sites was uniform in the gerbil but not in the rat. The [3H]PDBu binding activities in the strata oriens of the CA1 and CA3 subfields and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in the rat hippocampus were significantly higher than in the gerbil hippocampus. However, binding activity in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the rat CA1 subfield was statistically lower. These data demonstrate a difference in the distribution of [3H]PDBu binding activity in the hippocampus between the gerbil and rat.",
