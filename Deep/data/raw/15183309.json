     "AB": "The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a conserved multiprotein complex, with an important developmental role in several organisms, ranging from plants to mammalians. The influence of the CSN on several signaling and developmental processes has been ascribed to its ability to regulate degradation of a number of signaling proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The CSN controls the function of the SCF ubiquitin-ligase complex through an enzymatic activity that removes the small ubiquitin-like molecule NEDD8 from the cullin component of the SCF and that requires subunit 5 of the CSN (JAB1/CSN5). Mutants of the CSN display early embryonic lethality, a feature that has hindered further characterization of the role of the CSN at later stages of mammalian development. Here we report the analysis of JAB1/CSN5 expression pattern in the mouse embryo. At early stages of development, JAB1/CSN5 transcripts were present with low expression levels in all tissues. Preferential expression in selected tissues was detected starting at E11.5, with higher levels in dorsal root ganglia; at later stages, prominent expression of JAB1/CSN5 transcripts was observed in cranial nerve, spinal and sympathetic ganglia, as well as in selected epithelia, such as the oral and the olfactory epithelium. In the adult brain, additional areas of JAB1/CSN5 expression were the hippocampus and the Purkinjie layer of the cerebellum. We also analyzed the temporal and spatial expression pattern of NEDD8, and found that it substantially overlapped JAB1/CSN5 expression at all stages analyzed, supporting the model of a functional interaction between the two proteins during developmental processes.",
