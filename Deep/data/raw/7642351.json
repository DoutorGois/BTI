     "AB": "Kindling epileptogenesis was induced by periodic electrical stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway in the CA1 area of the rat hippocampus. The progressive nature of hippocampal kindling is demonstrated by a detailed description of the behavioral signs and the progressive increase of the after-discharge duration in the course of kindling acquisition. Furthermore, the evolution of the alterations in the paired-pulse local evoked field potentials and the modifications of the GABAA receptor binding and of the expression of mRNAs encoding for the subunits of the GABAA and glutamate receptors are considered. Evidence is presented that during kindling opposite changes occur in the CA1 and the fascia dentata in terms of the balance between excitation and inhibition due to contrasting changes in GABA-mediated inhibitory function.",
