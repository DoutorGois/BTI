     "AB": "Hippocampal CA1 neurons express both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors. Due to the difference in affinity of the two receptor types for corticosterone and variations in endogenous steroid levels, occupation of the receptors will range between a situation of predominant mineralocorticoid receptor activation and conditions where both receptor types are occupied. It was observed that local signal transduction is regulated by activation of the corticosteroid receptors. Particularly, transmission mediated by biogenic amines appears to be sensitive to steroid control. The data indicate that cholinergic and serotonergic responses are small with predominant mineralocorticoid receptor activation, while additional glucocorticoid receptor activation results in large responses; the reverse has been found for noradrenalin. The steroid-dependent control over transmission by biogenic amines will influence local excitability and therefore functional processes in which the hippocampal system is involved.",
