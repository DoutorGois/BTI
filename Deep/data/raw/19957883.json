     "AB": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorder in human characterized by progressive loss of movement and cognitive disturbances. 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP; a mitochondrial toxin) produces age-dependent oxidative linked striatal damage, responsible for HD like symptoms. In the present study protective effect of sertraline in 3-NP induced HD like symptoms was evaluated in rats. Systemic administration of 3-NP (10 mg/kg for 14 days) resulted in impairment of memory as assessed in Morris water maze and elevated plus paradigm tasks. Biochemical analysis revealed that systemic 3-NP administration significantly impaired reduced glutathione, total glutathione, oxidized glutathione and glutathione-S-transferase levels, whereas the level of acetylcholinesterase enzyme increased in striatum, cortex and hippocampus regions of rat brain. Sertraline (5 and 10 mg/kg po) treatment once daily for 14 days significantly improved cognitive performance tasks and glutathione levels in 3-NP treated group. However, combination of yohimbine (2 mg/kg) (non selective serotonin receptors antagonist) with the higher dose of sertraline (10 mg/kg) did not influence the protective action of sertraline. Result shows that neuroprotective and antioxidant like effect of sertraline is independent of its conventional action on 5-HT receptor.",
