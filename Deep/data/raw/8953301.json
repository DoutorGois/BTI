     "AB": "Long-latency components of event-related potentials (like the P300 or P3) correlate with the ability of subjects to detect and process unexpected, novel or task-relevant events. Task-relevant late positive components were recorded in the neocortex and hippocampus of rats performing an auditory discrimination task, similar to the \"odd-ball\" paradigm used in human experiments. Surface and depth electrodes were implanted in anaesthetized rats at frontal, temporal and anterior occipital neocortical regions and the hippocampus. After recovery from surgery rats were trained to discriminate two auditory signals, a frequent irrelevant tone and a rare tone related to water reward. In response to the task-relevant tone but not the irrelevant tone, P300-like late positive components (mean latency of 274 ms) were recorded throughout the surface of the neocortex. The largest amplitudes were found at the anterior occipital cortex situated above the hippocampal CA1 region. The amplitude of the task-relevant positive component increased further with cortical depth without reversing its polarity. An amplitude maximum was found in the CA1 region with a polarity reversal at the pyramidal cell layer and the largest negative amplitude in stratum radiatum. Power spectra of differences between responses evoked by task-relevant tones and those evoked by irrelevant tones revealed peaks in the theta range (4-12 Hz). It is suggested that the P300-like component in rats corresponds to a theta wave out of a burst of hippocampal theta cycles.",
