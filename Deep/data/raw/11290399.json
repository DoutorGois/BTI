     "AB": "The homozygous anorexia mutant (anx/anx) mice present with premature death during the third or fourth postnatal week: this phenotype is caused by a lethal mutation, anx, on chromosome 2, which has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. These animals also present phenotypically with decreased food intake, weight loss, and neurological deficits such as hyperactivity, body tremors, uncoordinated gait, and head weaving. In order to investigate changes in the occurrence of cell proliferation and apoptosis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of anx/anx mice, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay were performed in this study. In addition, the volume of the dentate gyrus was estimated via stereological analysis. anx/anx mice showed significantly higher numbers of both BrdU- and TUNEL-positive cells in the dentate gyrus than those of the control mice. Furthermore, the volume of the dentate gyrus of anx/anx mice was significantly reduced compared to that of the control mice.",
