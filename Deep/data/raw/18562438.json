     "AB": "We have previously found that neonatal treatment with clomipramine (CLI) induced a decrease in brain orexins during the juvenile period and that these changes were reversed at adulthood. This study investigated the effect of CLI on the orexinergic component and sleep/wake states. Two groups of adult male rats were conducted for 48-h polysomnographic recording. One group of rats was treated with CLI (20 mg/kg every 12 h), and a second group was treated with equivolume of saline (SAL) simultaneously after the first 24 h of polysomnographic recording. Rats were killed 2 h after the third dose of treatment. Brain tissues were collected for radioimmunoassay quantification of orexins and real-time PCR analysis of prepro-orexin and orexin receptor mRNA. The CLI group had significantly shorter rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and longer REM latency compared with both the baseline day and the SAL group and had significantly less active wake and more quiet wake. Compared with the control rats, the CLI rats had significantly higher mRNA expression of prepro-orexin in the hypothalamus and the frontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus. The CLI rats also had significantly less orexin B in the hypothalamus than the control rats. These results suggest that suppression of active wake and orexin B by CLI may be a factor responsible for CLI-induced depression and that the increase of prepro-orexin mRNA may be a sign of increased brain orexins found in this model.",
