     "AB": "Effects of bifemelane hydrochloride, idebenone and indeloxazin hydrochloride on ischemia-induced decrease in acetylcholine (ACh) levels were studied in gerbils. Among these three drugs, only bifemelane hydrochloride significantly inhibited the decrease in ACh concentration in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum of ischemic gerbils. This suggests that bifemelane hydrochloride has an anti-ischemic action and beneficial effects on various symptoms induced by ischemia.",
