     "AB": "Damage to the left medial temporal lobe (MTL) leads to an impairment of verbal recognition memory, affecting both the process of conscious recollection and familiarity-based recognition. Neuroimaging evidence, on the other hand, suggests a bilateral MTL contribution to verbal recollection. We investigated verbal recognition memory in three patients with focal ischemic lesions to the right MTL. The dual-process signal detection model and the process-dissociation procedure were applied to assess the contributions of recollection and familiarity to recognition memory. Compared to a group of 27 healthy age-matched controls, patients were impaired at recollection while familiarity was intact, and this effect was found for both estimation procedures. Detailed single-case analyses confirmed this pattern in two of the three right MTL patients. The findings suggest that, when task demands are high, as during recollective recognition, the right anterior hippocampus may also contribute to verbal recollection, thereby confirming neuroimaging evidence of a joint involvement of the left and the right MTL in verbal recollection.",
