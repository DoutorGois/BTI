     "AB": "We investigated whether neurotoxic effects of the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) in hippocampal slice cultures are dependent on glucose levels in the culture medium and whether such effects occur via apoptosis or necrosis. In addition, 3-NP toxicity was investigated at two developmental stages of the cultures, prepared from rat brain at postnatal day 5-7 and grown in Neurobasal medium for 1 or 3 weeks. Cultures were exposed to 3-NP in the presence of high (25 mM), normal (5 mM), or low (3 mM) glucose for 48 h, followed by 48 h incubation in medium without 3-NP. Cellular propidium iodide (PI) uptake and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) efflux into the medium revealed time- and dose-dependent cell death by 3-NP, with EC(50) values of about 60 microM in high or normal glucose. Regional vulnerability, as assessed by PI uptake and MAP2 immunostaining, in 3-week-old cultures was as follows: CA1 > CA3 > fascia dentata. In low glucose much lower concentrations of 3-NP (25 microM) triggered neurotoxicity. One-week-old cultures were less susceptible to 3-NP toxicity than 3-week-old cultures, but the dentate granule cells were relatively more affected in the immature cultures. We found no evidence for apoptotic cell death by 3-NP in 3-week-old cultures, but in 1-week-old cultures the putative apoptotic marker c-JUN/AP1 and nuclear fragmentation (Hoechst) were significantly increased in the dentate granule cells.",
