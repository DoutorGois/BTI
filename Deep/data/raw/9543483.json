     "AB": "'Minimal' excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) are often recorded from central neurones, specifically for quantal analysis. However the EPSPs may emerge from activation of several fibres or transmission sites so that formal quantal analysis may give false results. Here we extended application of the principal component analysis (PCA) to minimal EPSPs. We tested a PCA algorithm and a new graphical 'alignment' procedure against both simulated data and hippocampal EPSPs. Minimal EPSPs were recorded before and up to 3.5 h following induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 neurones. In 29 out of 45 EPSPs, two (N=22) or three (N=7) components were detected which differed in latencies, rise time (Trise) or both. The detected differences ranged from 0.6 to 7.8 ms for the latency and from 1.6-9 ms for Trise. Different components behaved differently following LTP induction. Cases were found when one component was potentiated immediately after tetanus whereas the other with a delay of 15-60 min. The immediately potentiated component could decline in 1-2 h so that the two components contributed differently into early (< 1 h) LTP1 and later (1-4 h) LTP2 phases. The noise deconvolution techniques was applied to both conventional EPSP amplitudes and scores of separate components. Cases are illustrated when quantal size (upsilon) estimated from the EPSP amplitudes increased whereas upsilon estimated from the component scores was stable during LTP1. Analysis of component scores could show apparent double-fold increases in upsilon which are interpreted as reflections of synchronized quantal releases. In general, the results demonstrate PCA applicability to separate EPSPs into different components and its usefulness for precise analysis of synaptic transmission.",
