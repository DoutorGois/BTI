     "AB": "Amnesia or memory loss is associated with brain aging and several neurodegenerative pathologies including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This can be induced by a cholinergic antagonist scopolamine but the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. This study of proteome profiling in the hippocampus could provide conceptual insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in amnesia. To reveal this, mice were administered scopolamine to induce amnesia and memory impairment was validated by novel object recognition test. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-MS/MS, we have analyzed the hippocampal proteome and identified 18 proteins which were differentially expressed. Out of these proteins, 11 were downregulated and 7 were upregulated in scopolamine-treated mice as compared to control. In silico analysis showed that the majority of identified proteins are involved in metabolism, catalytic activity, and cytoskeleton architectural functions. STRING interaction network analysis revealed that majority of identified proteins exhibit common association with Actg1 cytoskeleton and Vdac1 energy transporter protein. Furthermore, interaction map analysis showed that Fascin1 and Coronin 1b individually interact with Actg1 and regulate the actin filament dynamics. Vdac1 was significantly downregulated in amnesic mice and showed interaction with other proteins in interaction network. Therefore, we silenced Vdac1 in the hippocampus of normal young mice and found similar impairment in recognition memory of Vdac1 silenced and scopolamine-treated mice. Thus, these findings suggest that Vdac1-mediated disruption of energy metabolism and cytoskeleton architecture might be involved in scopolamine-induced amnesia.",
