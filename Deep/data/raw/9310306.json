     "AB": "The morphological analysis in a congenic line of angiotensinogen knock-out mice (AgKO) revealed the decreased density in granular layer cells of hippocampus and cerebellum, suggesting neuronal cells of AgKO susceptible to apoptotic cell death. This phenomenon was further studied by culture of the hippocampal neurons with decreased concentration of serum. AgKO neuronal cells, which showed apoptosis by lower concentration of the serum within several hours, however, survived much longer in the presence of angiotensin II (AII) and IV (AIV). This anti-apoptotic action was not interfered by AII receptor antagonists, CV11874 and PD123319. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system could play a critical role in central nervous system, preventing neuronal cells from apoptosis not only by AII but also AIV.",
