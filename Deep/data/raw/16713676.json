     "AB": "The effects of antipsychotics on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression have been controversial. This study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic quetiapine administration on the BDNF mRNA expression in hippocampus and neocortex of rats with or without immobilization stress. The chronic administration (21 days) of quetiapine (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the decreased BDNF mRNA expression in the both hippocampal and cortical regions of rats caused by immobilization stress, and significantly increased the BDNF mRNA expression in the dentate gyrus of rats even without the immobilization stress. These results could add some theoretical bases to explain why quetiapine may improve cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia by stimulating BDNF mRNA expression.",
