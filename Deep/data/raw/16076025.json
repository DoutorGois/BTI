     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in brain ischemic tolerance induced by ischemic preconditioning. Forebrain cerebral ischemia was induced in rat by four vessel occlusion. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD and CAT were measured in the hippocampus, striatum and cortex after 5 min of ischemia used as a preconditioning and subsequent reperfusion, by spectrophotometric methods. In all ischemia-reperfusion groups (5 h, 1 and 2 days of reperfusion), CuZn-SOD activities were found to be increased if compared to the sham operated controls. The increase was significant (P < 0.05) in all reperfusion groups, particularly after 5 h of reperfusion (3 times) in all studied brain regions; the largest increase was detected in the more vulnerable hippocampus and striatum. Very similar changes were found in Mn-SOD activity. The activity of CAT was increased too, but reached the peak of postischemic activity 24 h after ischemia. Our attempt to understand the mechanisms of increased SOD and CAT activities by application of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide showed that this increase was caused by de novo synthesis of enzymes during first hours after ischemia. Our findings indicate that both major endogenous antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT are synthesized as soon as 5 h after ischemia. In spite of significant upregulation of these enzymes a large number of neurons in selectively vulnerable CA1 region of hippocampus undergoes to neurodegeneration within 7 days after ischemia.",
