     "AB": "Local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) in spontaneously epileptic rats (SER) and in their parent strains, zitter (ZI) and Kyoto-Wistar (KW) rats was studied by autoradiography with [14C]2-deoxyglucose. Compared to the LCGU in age-matched KW rats, LCGU in 8-week-old SERs, which had not yet exhibited epileptic seizures, was low in all brain regions examined, and there were no significant differences among the regions. Moreover, there were no differences in LCGU among all regions examined in both SERs and in ZI rats. By contrast, the interictal LCGU in 13-week-old SERs, which did exhibit epileptic seizures, was generally lower than in the other two strains, particularly in the hippocampus and amygdala. These findings suggest that the epileptogenic focus in SERs may lie in the hippocampus and amygdala.",
