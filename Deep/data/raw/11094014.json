     "AB": "We investigated the contribution of adenosine neuromodulation to mechanisms of pentobarbital-induced depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in vitro. Transverse hippocampal slices were prepared from brains removed from isoflurane-anesthetized male Wistar rats. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), elicited by orthodromic electrical stimulation of Schaffer collateral at 0.05 Hz, were recorded from the CA1 region in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Amplitude of fEPSP was analyzed for assessing drug effects. Pentobarbital (100 microM) transiently depressed fEPSPs (P<0.01); i.e., fEPSP was initially depressed to approximately 60% of control and then recovered to approximately 80% of control. The fEPSP depression was partially suppressed by pretreatment with 50 microM aminophylline, a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist, and 0.2 microM 3, 7-Dimethyl-1-propagylxanthine, an adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist (P<0.01 each). However, the fEPSP depression was not affected by pretreatment with 10 microM 8-cyclopentyl-1, 3-dipropylxanthine, an A(2) receptor antagonist, or 10 microM bicuculline, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor antagonist. The results indicate that adenosine neuromodulation through A(1) receptors and other undefined mechanisms, which are independent from GABAergic mechanisms, are involved in pentobarbital-induced depression of excitatory synaptic transmission.",
