     "AB": "In vitro quantitative autoradiography was used to localize in rat brain binding sites for [3H]ouabain, an inhibitor of the Na+,K+-ATP-ase. High levels of [3H]ouabain binding sites were found in the superior and inferior colliculi, the mammillary nucleus, the interpeduncular nucleus, and in various divisions of the olfactory, auditory and somatomotor systems. The heterogeneous distribution of [3H]ouabain binding closely parallels the regional brain glucose consumption as determined by the [14C]deoxyglucose method. Lesion studies of the rat hippocampus using the excitotoxin, ibotenic acid, showed both a marked decrease of neuronal cell types on the injected side and a corresponding decrease in [3H]ouabain binding, indicating that some of the [3H]ouabain binding sites are localized to neurons. The close correlation between [3H]-ouabain binding and regional glucose utilization provides further evidence for a linkage between glucose utilization and the neuronal Na+,K+-ATPase.",
