     "AB": "Exponential rise in the use of mobile communication devices has generated health concerns due to radiofrequency (RF) exposure due to its close proximity to the head. Calcium binding proteins like calretinin regulate the levels of calcium (Ca(2+)) which plays an important role in biological systems. Ginseng is known for maintaining equilibrium in the human body and may play a beneficial radioprotectant role against electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure. In the present study, we evaluated the radioprotective effects of red ginseng (RG) extract in a mouse model. Calretinin (CR) expression was measured using a free-floating immunohistochemical method in the hippocampus of mice after 835 MHz EMF exposure for 5 h/d for 5 d at specific absorption rate=1.6 W/kg for the different experimental groups. The control animals were treated with NaCl while the experimental animals received 10 mg/kg ginseng, or 30 mg/kg; EMF exposed mice were also treated with NaCl, 10 mg/kg ginseng (E10), or 30 mg/kg (E30). Decreases in CR immunoreactivity (IR) along with loss of CA1 and CA3 interneurons and infragranular cells were observed in the ENaCl group while such losses were not observed in the E10 and E30 groups. CR IR significantly increased in the RG-treated group compared to control and EMF-exposed groups treated with NaCl. The study demonstrates that RG extract can serve as a radioprotective agent that maintains Ca(2+) homeostasis and prevents neuronal loss in the brain hippocampal region caused by RF exposure.",
