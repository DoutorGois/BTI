     "AB": "Since metabolic activity is accompanied by heat release, measurement of brain temperatures offers a method for assessing behavior-associated changes in neural activity. To explore this possibility, we monitored local brain (nucleus accumbens, medial-preoptic hypothalamus, and hippocampus) and body (temporal muscle) temperature in an experienced male rat during sexual behavior with a sexually receptive female. Placement of the female into a neighboring compartment increased the male's temperature and additional increases occurred when rats were allowed to see and partially interact with the female through a Plexiglas barrier with dime-size holes. The temperature increase was robust (1.5-2.0 degrees C), faster in all brain areas than in muscle, and peaked (38-39 degrees C) when the barrier was removed and full interaction was allowed. As the male repeatedly mounted and achieved intromission with the female, temperature further increased, peaking at ejaculation (+0.2-0.4 degrees C). Following ejaculation, the temperature abruptly dropped, until sexual interest and interaction resumed. These biphasic temperature fluctuations were generally similar in each recording location, but all brain sites (particularly, nucleus accumbens and medial-preoptic hypothalamus) showed more profound changes than the muscle. These data generally match single-unit and other physiological findings, suggesting that male sexual behavior is accompanied by sustained and generalized neural activation. This activation is triggered by sexually relevant stimuli (arousal), maintained during repeated mounts and intromissions, and peaked at ejaculation. These findings suggest brain temperature fluctuations not only as a sensitive index of functional neural activation, but as a powerful factor affecting various neural functions and an important part of brain mechanisms underlying motivated behavior.",
