     "AB": "A series of 1-(3-aryl-2-propenoyl)-4-oxopiperidines (1) as well as some related semicarbazones (2) and thiosemicarbazones (3) were prepared in order to determine whether the relative locations of aryl rings and amidic groups would lead to novel anticonvulsant agents. Initially the compounds were administered intraperitoneally to mice and examined in the maximal electroshock (MES), subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (scPTZ) and neurotoxicity (NT) screens. The biodata revealed that anticonvulsant properties were displayed by most of the compounds in series (1), in half of the semicarbazones (2) while protection was absent by members of series (3). Molecular modeling was utilized in order to compare the positions of a phenyl ring in relation to amidic groups in representative compounds in series (1-3) with previously reported anticonvulsant agents. Molecular simplification of 4-oxo-1-(3-phenyl-2-propenoyl)piperidine (la) led to 1-(3-phenyl-2-propenoyl)piperidine (7) and N,N-diethylcinnamamide (8) with retention of anticonvulsant properties. Both (la) and (8) afforded protection in the hippocampal kindling screen in rats. When administered orally to rats, (la) and (8) demonstrated activity in the MES screen and in the case of (8), a huge protection index was observed revealing it to be an important lead compound. The IC50 values of all of the compounds towards murine P388 cells were in excess of 50 microM while several compounds displayed cytotoxicity towards Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",
