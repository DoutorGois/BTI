     "AB": "Neuroplasticity has been investigated considering the neuronal growth-associated phosphoprotein as a marker of neuronal adaptive capabilities. In the present work, studying the hippocampal reorganization observed in the epilepsy model induced by pilocarpine, we carried out quantitative western blotting associated with immunohistochemistry to determine the distribution of growth-associated phosphoprotein in the hippocampus of rats in acute, silent and chronic periods of this epilepsy model. The fibers and punctate elements from the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus were strongly immunostained in animals killed 5 h after status epilepticus, compared with the same region in control animals. Rats presenting partial seizures showed no alterations in the immunostaining pattern compared with saline-treated animals. The hippocampal dentate gyrus of animals during the seizure-free period and presenting spontaneous recurrent seizures was also characterized by strong growth-associated phosphoprotein immunostaining of fibers and punctate elements in the inner molecular layer, contrasting with the control group. As determined by western blotting analysis, growth-associated phosphoprotein levels increased following status epilepticus and remained elevated at the later time-points, both during the silent period and during the period of chronic recurring seizures. Pilocarpine-treated animals, which did not develop status epilepticus, showed no change in growth-associated phosphoprotein levels, indicating that status epilepticus is important to induce growth-associated phosphoprotein overexpression. The measurement of this overexpression could represent one of the early signals of hippocampal reorganization due to status epilepticus-induced damage.",
