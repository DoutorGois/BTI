     "AB": "The activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was measured in homogenates from cortex, striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, pons, thalamus and midbrain of the brain of newborn piglets and the effects of hypoxia and posthypoxic period on this activity was evaluated. The control activities were 19.7, 31.5, 26.8, 16.7, 33.6, 19.3 and 39.4 pmol/mg protein per min, respectively. A 1 h period of hypoxia (an FiO2 of 7%) resulted in statistically significant decreases in the activity of NOS in every region of the brain except for the cortex, where the activity was not significantly altered compared to control. By 2 h of reoxygenation following such a hypoxic episode, the NOS activities increased to above control levels in all regions of the brain, but this increase was statistically significant compared to control only in thalamus. Since hypoxia induced the greatest decrease in NOS activity in the cerebellum, the kinetic constants of the enzyme were measured in homogenates from this region of brain. The decreased activity following the hypoxic episode was associated with an approximately four-fold increase in the apparent affinity (KM) for arginine with no significant change in the maximal rate of reaction (Vmax). The decrease in NOS activity subsequent to a hypoxic episode may contribute to the disturbances in cellular metabolism in the immature brain induced by episodes of hypoxia-reoxygenation.",
