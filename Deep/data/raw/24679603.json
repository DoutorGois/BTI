     "AB": "Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a base recoding process within precursor messenger RNA, catalyzed by members of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family. A notable example occurs at the Q/R site of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid glutamate receptor subunit GluA2. Abnormally, low editing at this site leads to excessive calcium influx and cell death. We studied hippocampus and caudate samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and age-matched healthy controls, using direct sequencing and a high accuracy primer-extension technique to assess RNA editing at the Q/R GluA2 site. Both techniques revealed lower, more variable RNA editing in AD, specific to the hippocampus and the GluA2 site. Deficient editing also characterized the hippocampus of apolipoprotein epsilon4 allele carriers, regardless of clinical diagnosis. In AD, messenger RNA expression of neuronal markers was decreased in the hippocampus, and expression of the Q/R-site editing enzyme ADAR2 was decreased in caudate. These findings provide a link between neurodegenerative processes and deficient RNA editing of the GluA2 Q/R site, and may contribute to both diagnosis and treatment of AD.",
