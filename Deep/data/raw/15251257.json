     "AB": "Steroid hormones, such as androgens, can modulate seizure processes. This review summarizes prior research and presents new data that support the role of androgens in modulating seizure processes. Testosterone, the primary endogenous androgen, has antiseizure effects in people and in animal models of epilepsy. Furthermore, testosterone's antiseizure effects may involve actions of its 5alpha-reduced metabolite and neuroactive steroid, 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol (3alpha-diol). The hippocampus is a target for androgen action and is involved in many types of seizure disorder. Data suggest that actions of androgens in the hippocampus may be important for androgens' antiseizure effects. Interestingly, there may also be a reciprocal relationship between androgens and seizures. Ictal activity can alter the gonadal responsiveness of people with epilepsy and in animal models of seizure disorder. Thus, this paper will review data in support of androgens' antiseizure effects. Further understanding of androgens' role in seizure processes is important for potential therapeutic effects.",
