     "AB": "Subiculum is the primary output area of the hippocampus and serves as a key relay center in the process of memory formation and retrieval. A majority of subicular pyramidal neurons communicate via bursts of action potentials, a mode of signaling that may enhance the fidelity of information transfer and synaptic plasticity or contribute to epilepsy when unchecked. In the present study, we show that a Ca(2+) tail current drives bursting in subicular pyramidal neurons. An action potential activates voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels, which deactivate slowly enough during action potential repolarization to produce an afterdepolarization that triggers subsequent action potentials in the burst. The Ca(2+) channels underlying bursting are located primarily near the soma, and the amplitude of Ca(2+) tail currents correlates with the strength of bursting across cells. Multiple channel subtypes contribute to Ca(2+) tail current, but the need for an action potential to produce the slow depolarization suggests a central role for high-voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels in subicular neuron bursting.",
