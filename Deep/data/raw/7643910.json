     "AB": "The effects of the antidepressant desipramine on the tissue concentrations of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in 9 different regions of the brain and also in the pituitary and liver were investigated in male rats. The investigations were carried out at three different times of the light/dark cycle: 5 a.m., 1 p.m. and 11 p.m. After fourteen days' treatment with 20 mg/kg/day desipramine by gavage the concentrations of triiodothyronine in the frontal and parieto-occipital cortex were significantly higher than in the saline-treated controls, those in the hippocampus lower and those in the 6 remaining brain regions the same. In 8 areas of the brain the concentrations of thyroxine were lower in the desipramine-treated rats and the tissue ratios of triiodothyronine to thyroxine were enhanced in 6 regions. These effects are most likely the result of the action of desipramine on the activity of the isoenzyme 5'II deiodinase. This enzyme catalyzes the deiodination of thyroxine to triiodothyronine in rat brain and its activity has recently been reported to be enhanced by desipramine. The observed effects were dose-dependent and also strongly dependent upon the time within the 24 h light/dark cycle at which the hormone concentrations were measured. No effects of desipramine were seen in the pituitary or liver after 14 days' treatment, or in various areas of the central nervous system 24 h after administration. In view of the psychotropic properties of thyroid hormones, it seems possible that the observed increases in triiodothyronine concentrations, particularly in cortical areas, are involved in the mechanisms of action of desipramine.",
