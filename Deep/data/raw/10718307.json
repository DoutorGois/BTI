     "AB": "Generalized tonic-clonic convulsions were induced on 2 consecutive days by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in immature rats (postnatal days 10 and 20), and hippocampal slices were prepared at different intervals post-injection. The anticholinesterase eserine provoked interictal-like discharges in the CA3 area of PTZ-injected rats (19/33), but not in controls (0/15), an effect mimicked by carbachol and reversed by atropine. This enhanced response to eserine was recorded in slices from 25-100% of the PTZ-injected rats, the percentage varying with the age at injection and post-injection interval. These results suggest that seizures in immature brain may have long-term consequences in cholinergic neurotransmission, converting a rise in endogenous ACh into an epileptogenic stimulus, which in turn would presumably facilitate the recurrence of seizures.",
