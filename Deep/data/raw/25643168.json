     "AB": "Tissue glyco-capture (TGC), a highly sensitive MS-compatible method for extraction of glycans from tissue, was combined with structure-specific nano-LC/MS for sensitive and detailed profiling of the mouse brain glycome. Hundreds of glycan structures were directly detected by accurate mass MS and structurally elucidated by MS/MS, revealing the presence of novel glycan motifs such as antennary fucosylation, sulfation, and glucuronidation that are potentially associated with cellular signaling and adhesion. Microgram-level sensitivity enabled glycomic analysis of specific regions of the brain, as demonstrated on not only brain sections (with a one-dimensional spatial resolution of 20 mum) but also isolated brain structures (e.g., the hippocampus). Reproducibility was extraordinarily high (R > 0.98) for both method and instrumental replicates. The pairing of TGC with structure-specific nano-LC/MS was found to be an exceptionally powerful platform for qualitative and quantitative exploration of the brain glycome.",
