     "AB": "It is now well established that variation in hippocampal circuitry correlates with various behavioural measures. In order to formulate more precise hypotheses about the functional role of the supra (SP-MF) and intra-infra mossy fibres (IIP-MF) layers, we investigated their covariation with a large number of behavioural measures in the classic and the spatial open-field taken from a genetically heterogeneous population composed of subjects from 12 isogenic mice groups (9 inbred strains and 3 F1's). The hippocampus-behaviour intercorrelation matrix reveals that behavioural reactions and inferred psychological processes only correlate with IIP-MF. Detailed analysis of correlates shows that IIP-MF positively correlate with locomotor activity, rearings and central sector crossings in the classic open-field and correlate negatively with the short-term habituation index to the objects in the spatial open-field. Surprisingly the memory of the spatial arrangement of a set of objects does not correlate with any hippocampal measure.",
