     "PG": "431-57",
     "AB": "An animal (rat) model of chronic stress (corticosterone in the drinking water) was used to study the interaction of stress and the organophosphorus (OP) neurotoxicants chlorpyrifos (60 mg/kg subcutaneously in a single dose) and tri-ortho-tolyl phosphate (TOTP, at 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg given 7 times orally in a 2-wk period). Adult male Long-Evans rats were provided with corticosterone in drinking water (400 microg/ml, w/v) for a total of 28 d, which led to significantly decreased weight and decreased cellularity of the thymus and spleen. Seven days after initiation of corticosterone treatment, half of the rats were given chlorpyrifos, and an additional 7 d later the 2-wk, 7-dose treatment of TOTP was initiated. During the 28-d test period, behavior of rats was evaluated using a functional observational battery (FOB), motor activity, and passive avoidance. Reductions in body weight, grip strength, and ambulatory movements occurred as a result of corticosterone treatment. Decreased body weight and grip strength were also elicited by TOTP, and the interactions of corticosterone and TOTP enhanced the effects on body weight and grip strength. Blood cholinesterase levels were obtained during the 28-d study period and found useful for monitoring OP exposure. At the end of the 28-d testing period, rats were sacrificed and activities of cholinesterase, neurotoxic esterase (neuropathy target esterase), and/or carboxylesterase were evaluated in blood, liver, and/or brain regions (basal forebrain, caudate putamen, cerebral cortex, hippocampus). All these esterases in brain were inhibited in a dose-related manner by TOTP, with some enhancement in rats drinking corticosterone-containing water. In addition, choline acetyltransferase, glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP), glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase were evaluated in one or more of the brain regions already identified. Choline acetyltransferase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase activities were unaffected by treatments. However, GFAP was elevated above control levels in the cerebral cortex of rats by all treatments (corticosterone, chlorpyrifos, TOTP). Neuropathological examination revealed early stages of dose-related increased distal myelinated fiber axonal degeneration seen in the medullary fasciculus gracilis at only the highest dose of TOTP (300 mg/kg).",
