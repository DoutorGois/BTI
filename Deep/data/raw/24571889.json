     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Brain dysfunction is a frequent complication of sepsis, usually defined as sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Although the Notch signaling pathway has been proven to be involved in both ischemia and neuronal proliferation, its role in SAE is still unknown. Here, the effect of the Notch signaling pathway involved gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT on SAE in septic rats was investigated in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model. METHODS: Fifty-nine Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups, with the septic group receiving the CLP operation. Twenty-four hours after CLP or sham treatment, rats were sacrificed and their hippocampus was harvested for Western blot analysis. TNF-alpha expression was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Neuronal apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL staining, and neuronal cell death was detected by H&E staining. Finally, a novel object recognition experiment was used to evaluate memory impairment. RESULTS: Our data showed that sepsis can increase the expression of hippocampal Notch receptor intracellular domain (NICD) and poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), as well as the inflammatory response, neuronal apoptosis, neuronal death, and memory dysfunction in rats. The gamma-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-1-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) can significantly decrease the level of NICD and PARP-1, reduce hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and death, attenuate TNF-alpha release and rescue cognitive impairment caused by CLP. CONCLUSION: The neuroprotective effect of DAPT on neuronal death and memory impairment in septic rats, which could be a new therapeutic approach for treating SAE in the future.",
