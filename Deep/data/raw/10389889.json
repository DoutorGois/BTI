     "AB": "OBJECT: Recently, several studies have demonstrated that hypothermia has a beneficial effect on clinical outcome; however, it is difficult to determine the appropriate rewarming conditions in clinical use. The purpose of the present study was to examine the influence of rewarming conditions in gerbils with transient forebrain ischemia. METHODS: Ischemia was induced in the gerbils by a 5-minute bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, after which the animals were immediately subjected to moderate or deep hypothermia. After moderate hypothermia (30.5 degrees C for 4 hours) the animals were rewarmed over standard, fast, or slow time periods. After deep hypothermia (24 degrees C for 2 hours) the animals were rewarmed in a standard, fast, slow, or stepwise manner. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), extracellular glutamate, and lactate were monitored. Hippocampal CA I cell damage was assessed 7 days after induction of ischemia. In animals treated with moderate hypothermia, the rewarming rate had no influence on the number of surviving neurons. However, fast rewarming from deep hypothermia (to 37 degrees C for 30 minutes) failed to provide the neuroprotective effect of hypothermia. Furthermore, this group showed a poor recovery of CBF (p < 0.01) and, consequently, an increase in extracellular glutamate (p < 0.01) and lactate (p < 0.01) in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate a transient uncoupling of CBF and cerebral metabolism during fast rewarming from deep hypothermia, whereas slow and stepwise rewarming periods were found to be useful for protection against uncoupling of CBF and cerebral metabolism during rewarming.",
