     "AB": "Motilin and motilin receptors have been found in most regions of the brain, including the amygdala, one of the most important parts of the limbic system. Our previous study found that administration of motilin in the hippocampus stimulates gastric motility. We now explore the effect of motilin in the amygdala on gastric motility. In conscious rats, gastric motility was recorded after microinjection of motilin, motilin receptor antagonist (GM-109) or a mixture of the two into the basomedial amygdala nucleus (BMA). In anesthetized rats the changes of spontaneous discharges of gastric distention sensitive neurons (GDSN) in the BMA were recorded after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) microinjection of motilin or GM-109. In conscious rats the amplitude of gastric contractions increased dose-dependently after microinjection of motilin in the BMA, and decreased after microinjection of GM-109. The excitatory or inhibitory effects induced by motilin or GM-109 alone, were weakened by microinjection of a mixture solution of both. The spontaneous discharge frequency of gastric distention excitatory neuron (GDEN) was mainly inhibited by i.c.v. microinjection of motilin but excited by GM-109. In contrast, the spontaneous discharge frequency of gastric distention inhibitory neuron (GDIN) was mainly excited by motilin, but inhibited by GM-109. Our findings suggest that motilin may regulate gastric motility by modulating neural pathways in the BMA.",
