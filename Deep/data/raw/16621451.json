     "AB": "Due to the limited efficacy and side effects of current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), the search for new therapeutic agents is critical. Uridine, a possible endogenous antiepileptic modulator, has been demonstrated to have anticonvulsant effects in some models of epilepsy, but not others. In this study, we examined possible neuroprotective effects of uridine by administering the agent following lithium-pilocarpine induced status epilepticus. The effects of uridine were assessed on EEG patterns, visual-spatial memory in the water maze and histopathology. There was a trend for reduced EEG spike frequency, improved visual spatial memory and better histology score in rats receiving uridine. The antiepileptogenic and anticonvulsant effects of uridine were studied by administering uridine to rats undergoing rapid kindling or following full kindling. In the rapid kindling models, uridine had a moderate antiepileptogenic and anticonvulsant effect. These results suggest uridine may have potential to aid in the prevention and treatment of epilepsy.",
