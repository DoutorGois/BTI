     "AB": "In the present study, we established a role of individual differences in locomotor response to novelty or social position in modulatory effect of chronic (14 consecutive days) antidepressant drug desipramine pretreatment (10mg/kg i.p.) on acute (30 min), white and illuminated open field (OF)-induced changes in spleen anti-tumor activity of natural killer (NK) cells (chromium release assay) in parallel to the brain anti-inflammatory interleukin 10 (IL-10) and Fos expression (immunohistochemistry), splenocytic pro-inflammatory interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-10 production (ELISA), and plasma corticosterone concentration (RIA) in rats. The involvement of individual differences (high (HR) and low (LR) responders to novelty or dominants (D) and subordinates (S)) in the anti-depressive responsiveness, was investigated in the desipramine treated by itself (DES) or following 7 consecutive days of OF exposure (ChS-DES) group. In the desipramine pretreated groups, OF stress decreased spleen NKCC, behavioral activity, the Con A-stimulated splenocyte IFN-gamma response and plasma corticosterone concentration whereas it increased the brain and splenocyte IL-10 response. The percentage of OF-induced IL-10/Fos(+) cells was increased in the CA1 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and amygdaloid nucleus, particularly in the LR-D (DES) and LR-S (ChS-DES) rats. Moreover, a decreased splenocytic ability to produce IFN-gamma and IL-10, particularly in the HR-S (DES) and LR-S (ChS-DES) rats, was noted. There were no significant differences in the OF-induced NKCC suppression between the behavioral groups. These studies emphasize that chronic desipramine pretreatment had anti-inflammatory but not immunoprotective properties against OF stress-induced neuroimmunological effects which depend on the animal's behavioral characteristics and treatment.",
