     "AB": "1. Long-term depression (LTD) is an activity-dependent reduction in the strength of synaptic transmission that can persist for hours. It is a neural model for processes underlying learning and memory, such as extinction and forgetting. LTD of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in cells of the CA1 region of hippocampal slices can be induced in an anti-Hebbian paradigm, i.e., by conditioning stimuli that activate the postsynaptic neuron in the absence of evoked synaptic transmission in the test pathway. Past work showed that LTD was not produced consistently in a pharmacologically untreated slice, but it could be induced more reliably when the conditioning stimuli were applied during block of evoked transmitter release. We have now defined further the conditions in which LTD can be obtained using postsynaptic conditioning by investigating 1) whether intracellular conditioning is effective, 2) the requirement for extracellular Ca2+, and 3) the consequences of selective block of glutamate ionotropic receptor subtypes during the conditioning procedure. 2. Intracellular recordings were made from CA1 pyramidal neurons. Test shocks were applied to the stratum radiatum except during conditioning, and the depolarizing slopes and amplitudes of evoked EPSPs were measured. The conditioning procedure activated the postsynaptic neuron either antidromically (via trains of shocks at 100 Hz applied to the axons in the alveus) or intracellularly (via depolarizing pulses of 1.5-3.5 nA). During conditioning, postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) evoked by the conditioning stimuli either were transiently blocked by bathing slices for 5 min in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing a high [Mg2+] or were reduced by glutamate antagonists. 3. When slices were bathed in CSF containing 25 mM Mg2+ and 2 mM Ca2+, evoked PSPs were transiently abolished; conditioning, either by antidromic or intracellular stimulation, always evoked a significant LTD. During the LTD produced by antidromic stimulation, the mean EPSP slope was 52.6 +/- 11.4% (mean +/- SE) of its control at 30-35 min after conditioning (n = 7). The LTD produced by intracellular conditioning was of similar magnitude: the mean EPSP slope was 57.2 +/- 11.6% of its control at 30-35 min postconditioning (n = 7). When slices were bathed in CSF containing 25 mM Mg2+ and 2 mM Ca2+ without conditioning stimuli, there was no LTD (mean EPSP slope 109 +/- 8.1% of its control at 30-35 min after reperfusion with CSF; n = 5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
