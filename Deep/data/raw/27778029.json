     "AB": "ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP), as an inward rectifying potassium channel, are widely distributed in many types of tissues. KATP are activated by the depletion of ATP level and the increase in oxidative stress in cells. The activity of KATP couples cell metabolism with electrical activity and results in membrane hyperpolarization. KATP are ubiquitously distributed in the brain, including substantia nigra, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, dorsal nucleus of vagus and glial cells, and participate in neuronal excitability, mitochondria homeostasis and neurotransmitter release. Accumulating lines of evidence suggest that KATP are the major contributing factors in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). This review discussed the association of KATP with the pathogenic processes of PD by focusing on the roles of KATP on the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, the functions of mitochondria, the firing pattern of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, the alpha-synuclein secretion from striatum, and the microglia activation.",
