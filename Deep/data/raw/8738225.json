     "AB": "Whole-cell patch-clamp recording of GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were made in ventral horn neurons of neonatal rat lumbar spinal cord in slice. In contrast to the hippocampus where paired pulse depression is reported to be observed for GABAergic IPSCs, double pulse stimulation of GABAergic inputs resulted in enhancement in the amplitude of the second IPSC in the spinal ventral horn. The facilitation ratio was decreased during enhanced synaptic transmission by increasing Ca2+ concentration in the external recording solution. Baclofen and adenosine. which are reported to depress synaptic transmission by presynaptic mechanisms, depressed IPSCs and increased the facilitation ratio. A postsynaptic manipulation such as application of bicuculline or changing the driving force did not affect the facilitation ratio. These results suggest that paired pulse facilitation of GABAergic IPSCs observed in neonatal rat spinal ventral horn appears to be based upon a mechanism similar to that underlying frequency-dependent facilitation of excitatory synaptic transmission, and is sensitive to presynaptic changes in synaptic strength.",
