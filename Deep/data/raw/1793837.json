     "AB": "In acute experiments on rats it was shown that activation of SC by bilateral microinjection of penicillin (5-15 IU) or bicuculline (25-50 ng) resulted in the increased latency and decreased severity of i.p. picrotoxin-induced seizures (2 mg/kg). The suppression of behavioral convulsions and the decreased epileptic activity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were followed by occurrence of spike discharges in SC with an amplitude of 200-500 mcV and frequency of 5-12/sec which testifies to the formation of penicillin- or bicuculline-induced generator excitation in SC. The lesions of SC by kainic acid administration resulted in the decreased seizure threshold and, also, facilitated the development of seizure under conditions of picrotoxin kindling. The conclusion is made that SC activation plays an important role in the realization of functional integrative activity of the antiepileptic system.",
