     "AB": "Synaptic strength can be modified by the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic activity, a phenomenon termed spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Studies of neurons in the hippocampus and in other regions have found that when presynaptic activity occurs within a narrow time window, typically 10 or 20 ms, before postsynaptic activity, long-term potentiation (LTP) is induced, while if presynaptic activity occurs within a similar time window after postsynaptic activity, long-term depression (LTD) results. The mechanisms underlying these modifications are not completely understood, although there is strong evidence that the postsynaptic Ca (2+) concentration plays a central role. Some previous modeling of STDP has focused on the dynamics of the postsynaptic Ca (2+) concentration, while other work has studied biophysical mechanisms of how a synapse can exist in, and switch between, different states corresponding to LTP and LTD. Building on previous work in these two areas we have developed the first low level STDP model of a tristable biochemical system that incorporates induction and maintenance of both LTP and LTD. Our model is able to explain the STDP observed in hippocampal neurons in response to pre- and postsynaptic pulse pairs, using only parameters derived from previous work and without the need for parameter fine-tuning. Our results also give insight into how and why the time course of the postsynaptic Ca (2+) concentration can lead to either LTP or LTD, and suggest that voltage dependent calcium channels play a key role.",
