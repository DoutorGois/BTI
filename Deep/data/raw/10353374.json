     "AB": "Redundant-targets effects (RTE) for visual search were investigated in 2 commissurotomy patients (L.B., N.G.). L.B., who showed no evidence of visual interhemispheric transfer, exhibited a paradoxical enhancement of the redundancy gain in the bilateral compared with the within-hemifield redundant-targets conditions, whereas N.G., who showed evidence of interhemispheric transfer of visual information, exhibited no enhancement of the bilateral redundancy gain. When only uncrossed responses were considered, both bilateral and within-field RTE were evident only when attentional demands were high. Bilateral redundant targets led to stronger gains, some indicative of coactivation, in the slower response hand. The authors suggest that the enhancement of the bilateral RTE comes about by neural coactivation, which is especially pronounced when the slower hemisphere elicits the response.",
