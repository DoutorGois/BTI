     "AB": "The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of hyperphosphorylation of tau induced by okadaic acid on the expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and the neurotoxicity of beta-amyloid peptide. Primary cultures of neurons isolated from the hippocampus of the brains of neonatal rats were exposed to okadaic acid or/and Abeta1-42 Tau phosphorylated at Ser404 and Ser202, and the protein expressions of alpha7, alpha4 and alpha3 nAChR subunits were quantified by Western blotting, and their corresponding mRNAs by real-time PCR. Superoxide dismutase activity was assayed biochemically and malondialdehyde by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance. As compared to controls, phosphorylations of tau at Ser404 and Ser202 in the neurons were elevated by exposure to 20 nM okadaic acid for 48 h but not by 1 or 2 microM Abeta1-42 Treatment with 20 nM okadaic acid or 1 microM Abeta1-42 for 48 h resulted in the reduced alpha7, alpha4 and alpha3 proteins, and alpha4 and alpha3 mRNAs, as well as the decreased activity of superoxide dismutase and the increased malondialdehyde. Okadaic acid and Abeta1-42 together caused more pronounced changes in the expressions of alpha7 and alpha4, superoxide dismutase activity and lipid peroxidation than either alone. When pre-treatment with vitamin E or lovastatin, the neurotoxicity induced by okadaic acid was significantly attenuated. These findings indicate that hyperphosphorylation of tau induced by okadaic acid inhibits the expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at both the protein and mRNA levels, as well as enhances the neurotoxicity of beta-amyloid peptide.",
