     "AB": "Severe autonomic dysfunction occurs in Rett syndrome (RS). Substance P, a tachykinin peptide that localizes to several brain regions, including the autonomic nervous system, is reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with RS. The anatomic localization and intensity of substance P immunoreactivity and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes in the brains of 14 patients with RS were compared with those in the brains of 10 age-matched normal patients. Substance P immunoreactivity expression was significantly decreased in RS tissue compared with control tissue in the following regions: dorsal horns, intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, spinal trigeminal tract, solitary tract and nucleus, parvocellular and pontine reticular nuclei, and locus ceruleus. A less significant decrease of substance P immunoreactivity occurred in the substantia nigra, central gray of the midbrain, frontal cortex, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus. Antiglial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes were increased in the areas in which substance P immunoreactivity was decreased and in other brain regions. Because many of the brain regions with the greatest decrease in substance P immunoreactivity are involved in the control of the autonomic nervous system, especially the solitary tracts and reticular formation, reduced substance P may contribute to the autonomic dysfunction in RS.",
