     "AB": "Objective To observe the influence of rotenone on the distribution of alpha-synuclein (ASN) in rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups and received 2 mg/kg rotenone (s.c.) or sunflower oil (as control group) for about 4 weeks. The hippocampus, substantia nigra and striatum of brain were observed. Hematoxylin and eosin stain were used to observe the Lewy body like inclusion. The expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or ASN protein was determined by anti-TH or anti-alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results In control rats, ASN protein distributed widely in brain, especially in hippocampus, cortex and striatum. Rotenone obviously increased TH positive neurons and fibers loss in substantia nigra and striatum (P < 0.05). In rotenone treated rats, ASN positive cells increased in global brain but not distributed in an even manner. In substantia nigra, ASN positive stuff was found aggregate in both cytoplasm and nucleus, and some formed spherical inclusion; in striatum, ASN positive neurites end aggregated and agglomerated around neurons; and in hippocampus, few dot-like ASN were aggregated in cell body, and no notable change was found in nucleus. Conclusion In rotenone administrated PD rats, ASN protein aggregated in several brain regions but most obviously in striatum and substantia nigra, and the distribution region of ASN was changed from peri-synapse to the cytoplasm and nucleus of dopaminergic neuron.",
