     "AB": "Riluzole is a neuroprotective agent the efficacy of which was proven in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in human and in animal models of cerebral ischemia. However, the dosage used in animal experiments was much higher than that in human. We investigated the efficacy of low dose riluzole, which was similar to the dose used in human trials, in animal model of global ischemia. Global ischemia was induced in male Mongolian gerbils for 5min under monitoring of rectal temperature. Riluzole (0.8 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally 30min before ischemia. Seven days after ischemia, animals were decapitated and surviving nerve cells in hippocampal CA1 area were quantified. The number of surviving cells was compared between in riluzole-treated and control groups and the former showed statistically significant better survivals than the latter (P<0.001).",
