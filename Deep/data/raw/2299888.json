     "AB": "The frequency and the diameter of nuclear pore complexes, and the nuclear perimeter, were studied in CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampi from 3-, 9-, 24-, and 30-month-old rats (Fischer 344). No changes with age in any of these parameters were observed. This finding is discussed in terms of varied responses of different brain areas to the effects of aging.",
