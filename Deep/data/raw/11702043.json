     "AB": "The contributions of calpain and caspase-3 to apoptosis and necrosis after central nervous system (CNS) trauma are relatively unexplored. No study has examined concurrent activation of calpain and caspase-3 in necrotic or apoptotic cell death after any CNS insult. Experiments used a model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in primary septo-hippocampal cultures and assessed cell viability, occurrence of apoptotic and necrotic cell death phenotypes, and protease activation. Immunoblots using an antibody detecting calpain and caspase-3 proteolysis of alpha-spectrin showed greater accumulation of calpain-mediated breakdown products (BDPs) compared with caspase-3-mediated BDPs. Administration of calpain and caspase-3 inhibitors confirmed that activation of these proteases contributed to cell death, as inferred by lactate dehydrogenase release. Oxygen-glucose deprivation resulted in expression of apoptotic and necrotic cell death phenotypes, especially in neurons. Immunocytochemical studies of calpain and caspase-3 activation in apoptotic cells indicated that these proteases are almost always concurrently activated during apoptosis. These data demonstrate that calpain and caspase-3 activation is associated with expression of apoptotic cell death phenotypes after OGD, and that calpain activation, in combination with caspase-3 activation, could contribute to the expression of apoptotic cell death by assisting in the degradation of important cellular proteins.",
