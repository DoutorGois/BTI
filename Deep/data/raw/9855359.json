     "AB": "We examined the effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on rat hippocampal neurons in culture to determine whether it caused a similar intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) increase in these cells to that seen with renal epithelial cells and found that PTH induced the effect in about 30% of the neurons. The effects appeared gradually during continuous administration of full-length PTH(1-84) or its active fragment, PTH(1-34), but not of an inactive fragment, PTH(39-84). However, the active fragment of the PTH-related peptide (PTHrP(1-34)) had little effect on [Ca2+]i during 60 min of administration. The PTH effect was inhibited by nifedipine, an L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist, and facilitated by S-(-)-BAY K 8644, an L-type Ca2+ channel agonist. Our findings suggest that PTH is one of the causal factors for the age-related increase in the density of voltage gated Ca2+ channels in hippocampal neurons.",
