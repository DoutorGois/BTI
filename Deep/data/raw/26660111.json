     "AB": "UNC5C, which is a transmembrane receptor for netrin-1 to trigger the apoptosis, has been confirmed as a new risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) recently. However, there is lack of the evidence on the brain structure associated with the polymorphisms of UNC5C in AD. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of UNC5C loci on the neuroimaging of strategic regions of AD. In 812 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, we explored the genotypes of UNC5C loci in the volumes of the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, middle temporal and precuneus, and the thickness of the entorhinal cortex which are measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We also investigated the atrophy rate of above structures influenced by UNC5C loci using the longitudinal data. UNC5C loci were associated with the volume of right middle temporal (rs34585936 Pc = 0.0031). Meanwhile, the polymorphisms of UNC5C loci could alter the atrophy rate of strategic regions especially the left hippocampus (rs72672784 Pc = 0.0090; rs13120458 Pc = 0.0434; rs34875919 Pc = 0.0434) and right precuneus (rs72672784 Pc = 0.0068; rs2001246 Pc = 0.0055; rs74690179 Pc = 0.0055). UNC5C genotypes were significantly associated with the volume of the middle temporal on MRI; meanwhile, UNC5C loci could alter the atrophy of strategic regions of AD such as the hippocampus and precuneus. And the above effects of polymorphisms of UNC5C were more obvious in the population with the impaired cognition than those with the normal cognition.",
