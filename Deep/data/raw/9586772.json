Current imaging methods are well suited to the detailed measurement of the volume of the hippocampus, which has received little attention in previous imaging studies in autism. We report the results of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of 35 autistic and 36 control subjects. Detailed (1.5 mm) MRI did not reveal differences in the volume of the hippocampus in autistic individuals.",
