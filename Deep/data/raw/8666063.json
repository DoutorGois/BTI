     "AB": "The present studies assessed the levels of [125I][Sar1,ILE8]angiotensin II-labelled angiotensin AT1 and AT2 receptor recognition sites in homogenates of various brain areas (including caudate nucleus, putamen, substantia nigra, hippocampus, frontal cortex, temporal cortex and cerebellum) from patients with clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease and those from age-, sex- and post-mortem delay-matched neurologically and psychiatrically normal patients. Radiolabelled angiotensin AT1 receptor recognition site levels were significantly decreased by approximately 70%, 70% and 90% in the caudate nucleus, putamen and substantia nigra, respectively, from patients with Parkinson's disease relative to matched controls. Furthermore, radiolabelled angiotensin AT2 receptor levels were decreased by some 60% in the caudate nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease relative to control patients. In brain tissue homogenates from patients with Huntington's disease, the angiotensin AT1 receptor recognition site levels were decreased by approximately 30% in putamen relative to the control patients whilst angiotensin AT2 receptor levels were increased by some 90% in the caudate nucleus relative to the control patients. In brain tissue homogenates from patients with Alzheimer disease, the angiotensin AT2 receptor recognition site levels were significantly increased by approximately 200% in the temporal cortex relative to the control patients. The present results indicate that the reduction of angiotensin AT1 and/or AT2 receptor recognition site levels in the caudate nucleus, putamen and substantia nigra correlates with the principal neuropathology associated with Parkinson's disease and as such indicates that at least a significant population of angiotensin AT1 and AT2 receptors are located on the human dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway. In addition, the marked increase in the levels of angiotensin AT2 receptor recognition sites in temporal cortex from patients with Alzheimer's disease correlates with some other markers associated with the renin-angiotensin system previously investigated in tissue from patients with this neurological disease.",
