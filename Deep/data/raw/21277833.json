     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to explore whether the kainate (KA) model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) can be used as a model of comorbid epilepsy and depression to study diurnal behavioral variations in rats. Development of chronic epilepsy was confirmed by the detection of spontaneous motor seizures (SMS) with video monitoring (24 hours/3-5 months after status epilepticus [SE]). KA-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) exhibited higher seizure frequency than Wistar rats during the light phase in the fourth and fifth months after SE. Although epileptic Wistar rats showed depression-like behavior and reduced anxiety mostly during the light phase, there were no diurnal variations in depression-like patterns in SHRs. Anxiety levels of control and epileptic SHRs were similar. Decreases in serotonin, tryptophan, and dopamine concentrations in the hippocampus were detected in epileptic Wistar rats compared with naive controls. However, monoamine levels of epileptic SHRs were close to those of their controls. Wistar rats and SHRs develop stable depression-like behavior during the chronic epileptic phase with strain-dependent diurnal differences.",
