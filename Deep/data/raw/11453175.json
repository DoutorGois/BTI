     "AB": "Psychological theorizing about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has developed considerably since early behavioural formulations (Brewin, Dalgleish, & Joseph, 1996; Mowrer, 1960) and there have been parallel developments in biological understanding (Yehuda, 1998). However clinical practice has not been affected by the new psychobiology. It is suggested that it is possible to translate this new understanding into a clinically useful analogy that will help circumvent the difficulties of forming a therapeutic alliance with trauma victims which have been reported (Pitman et al., 1991; Scott & Stradling, 1997).",
