     "AB": "The nervous system must provide a mechanism for very precise discrimination of differing patterns of activity, yet at the same time, there must be a mechanism for generalization to prevent all experiences from being independent and novel. Pattern separation and completion by cortical circuits contribute to these processes, respectively. Based on theoretical and computational models of the piriform cortex and experimental designs developed for hippocampal spatial memory, we provide evidence for pattern separation and completion in the olfactory system and demonstrate the predictive power of these two processes for behavioral odor perception.",
