     "AB": "Through bidirectional selective breeding, lines of rats that differ greatly in their voluntary alcohol drinking behavior have been developed--namely, the alcohol-preferring (P) and high-alcohol-drinking (HAD) lines and the alcohol-nonpreferring (NP) and low-alcohol-drinking (LAD) lines. The present experiments were designed to determine if an association exists between ethanol preference and features of the electroencephalogram (EEG) during various sleep-wake behaviors. Of the EEG parameters measured, only theta activity in the hippocampus revealed differences in the lines. However, these differences were not generally associated with ethanol preference. The peak frequency and distribution mean of hippocampal theta activity during REM sleep were significantly higher in NP rats than in P, HAD, and LAD rats. In addition, theta frequency during alert immobility tended to be higher in NP rats than in P, HAD, and LAD rats. A qualitative comparison of these data with published data from unselected rats further suggested that the NP rats are uniquely different with respect to theta frequency.",
