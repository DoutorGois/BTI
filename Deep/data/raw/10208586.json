     "AB": "We studied pronociceptin gene expression following limbic seizures. Northern blot analysis revealed increased pronociceptin mRNA levels in the thalamus (but not in the hippocampus) 3-24 h after kainate administration, with maximal effect (2-fold increase over basal levels) reached at 6 h. No variation in pronociceptin mRNA levels was observed 1-6 h after a stimulus-evoked kindled seizure. Carrageenan failed to affect pronociceptin gene expression in the thalamus, indicating that pain and/or acute stress do not account for kainate effects. In situ hybridization revealed that kainate evokes a dramatic (4-fold) increase in pronociceptin mRNA levels over the thalamic reticular nucleus. Kindled seizures evoked only a small, non-significant increase in pronociceptin gene expression over the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.",
