     "AB": "The present study investigated the effects of andrographolide on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in aged rats to gain insight of the underlying mechanism, which may provide theoretical basis for the clinical application of andrographolide to prevent POCD in older patients. Thirty aged male rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups: Control, model and andrographolide groups. The Morris water maze test was used to examine the spatial memory and learning ability of the rats postoperatively. The histological alterations of neuronal cells in the hippocampus were visualized by H&E staining. The serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), human soluble protein-100beta (S-100beta) and the inflammation factors of interluekin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha involved in the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were detected by ELISA. The NF-kappaB/MAPK signaling pathway-associated proteins in rat serum were detected by western blotting. Following andrographolide treatment, the rats significantly gained learning ability after surgery. Is it ameliorated hippocampal neuronal injury in rats following surgery. Andrographolide decreased NSE, S-100beta, and the inflammation factors, IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in serum. Andrographolide reduced NF-kappaB/MAPK pathway-associated protein expression. Andrographolide ameliorated POCD in aged rats following surgery. The underlying mechanism may be associated with the downregulation the inflammatory factors and NF-kappaB/MAPK-associated protein expression.",
