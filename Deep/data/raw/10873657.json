     "AB": "Various kinds of acute pathological events in the central nervous system, such as ischemia, hemorrhage, and trauma, often cause brain edema. The edema may advance for days or weeks while inducing extensive damage in neural function, regardless of the extent of the original damage, and often results in death. Delayed edema is thought to be vasogenic; however, the mechanism underlying edema induction remains unknown. We found delayed vascular cell proliferation with a blood-brain barrier breakdown in and around the gerbil CA1 hippocampus, a region known to be involved in delayed apoptotic neuronal death 2-6 days after transient ischemia. Vascular cell proliferation, assessed by (3)H-thymidine incorporation, was most prominent 4-6 days after ischemia, and extravasation of exogenously applied dye or endogenous serum albumin from blood vessels was observed concomitantly. We propose neovascularization in delayed neuronal death as a cause of brain edema advancing days after neurological events.",
