O-acetylated gangliosides have been found to play important roles in the embryonic development of the nervous system. We have isolated rat Acatn cDNA by PCR cloning. The amino acid sequence of rat Acatn exhibited 92% and 96% homology with human and mouse sequences, respectively. The mRNA was expressed in brain at all developmental stages. Acatn expression was higher in embryonic and postnatal rats than in adult rats. Cellular localization of Acatn mRNA in adult rat brain was also analyzed by in situ hybridization. Acatn mRNA expression was detected in the neuronal cells of cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cortex, olfactory bulb, and dorsal and ventral anterior olfactory nucleus in adult rat brain.",
