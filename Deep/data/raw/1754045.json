     "AB": "The features of the development of hippocampal kindling as a function of intracentral interstructural relationships formed during electrostimulations has been studied in 13 rabbits by means of electrodes chronically implanted in the brain (cerebral cortex, hippocampi, amygdalar nuclei, rostral portions of the caudate nuclei). The interstructural relationships were evaluated on the basis of the expressivity of the epileptic activity in various structures of the brain and on the basis of its dependence on the activity in the primary pathological focus. It was shown that in the case of the formation in the primary hippocampal epileptic focus of the pathological determinant (as described by G.N. Kryzhanovskii), which determine the activity of other structures, the kindling syndrome develops rapidly. If, on the other hand, competitive suppressive influences predominate in the interrelationships between the primary and secondary epileptic foci, which was most strikingly manifested between the hippocampal epileptic foci, then the pathological determinant does not form in this region and the kindling syndrome does not develop.",
