     "AB": "The effect of chronic ethanol administration on the density of basket cells in the dentate gyrus of mice selectively bred for their sensitivity to acute ethanol exposure (long-sleep, LS and short-sleep, SS) was assessed in two experiments. In addition, the effect of chronic ethanol on the density of dentate granule cells and astrocytes was examined. In the first experiment, mice received 3 weeks of a liquid ethanol diet with 35% of their calories derived from ethanol (EDC). In this experiment, LS mice did not demonstrate a change in the density of granule cells or in the density of basket cells. There was, however, a significant increase in the density of astrocytes as a result of this treatment for the LS mice. The SS mice were unaffected on all measures. In the second experiment, portions of which have been reported previously, mice received a diet with 23% EDC for 3 months. As a result of this exposure, LS mice showed a significant decrease in the density of basket cells, but there was no change in the density of granule cells or astrocytes. There was no difference between controls and experimental mice from the SS group on any of these parameters. These results suggest that at least in the dentate gyrus, chronic ethanol treatment selectively reduces the density of basket cells but only in mice that are more sensitive to the hypnotic effects of acute ethanol exposure. Furthermore, this effect seems to be preceded by an apparent increase in the density of astrocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
