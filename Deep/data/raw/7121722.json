     "AB": "Microanalysis methods were used to determine the effect of bilateral carotid occlusion on net levels of energy metabolites in discrete cellular regions of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus of the Mongolian gerbil. Glucose, glycogen, ATP and phosphocreatine levels were not decreased after one minute of bilateral occlusion. Three minutes of ischemia, however, produced a dramatic fall in net levels with no further decrease observed at fifteen minutes. Re-establishment of blood flow for five minutes after a fifteen minute ischemic episode resulted in replenishment of metabolites to pre-ischemic levels. Glucose was increased two to three times in sham-operated animals as compared to control (non-operated) animals. The increase was the result of the Na-pentobarbital anesthetic employed. The present data indicate that regions of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus respond in a uniform manner to bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries. Further, most cells maintained enough viability to resume production of high-energy phosphate and carbohydrate metabolites.",
