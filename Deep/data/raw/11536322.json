     "AB": "This study investigated the expression patterns of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha) and -beta (ER beta) in the cultured hippocampal cells of neonatal rats by combined application of cell culture and immunocytochemistry. The results revealed that the expression difference between ER alpha and ER beta seemed to be not obvious in the cultured hippocampal cells of neonatal rats. Moreover, immunoreactivity for either ER alpha or ER beta was observed to be localized in the majority of not only neurons but also astrocytes. The coexpression of both ER alpha and ER beta in the same individual cell was also demonstrated by the double-label immunocytochemistry. Western blot analysis showed that immunoreactivity for ER alpha in the neonatal hippocampal tissues was much higher than in the adult (became rather weak), although there was not such a great difference of immunoreactivity for ER beta. The data also provide direct evidence for the expression of ER subtypes within GABAergic neurons in hippocampal cell cultures and suggest that estrogen's effect on the hippocampus may be mediated at least in part by its ER-containing GABAergic neurons.",
