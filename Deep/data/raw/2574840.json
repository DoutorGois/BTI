     "AB": "The pharmacological properties of presynaptic calcium (Ca) channels on rat hippocampal mossy fiber synaptosomes were characterized by determining the inhibitory potencies for various classes of Ca antagonists on depolarization-induced Ca mobilization and the release of dynorphin A(1-8)-like immunoreactivity (Dyn-LI). Flunarizine and cinnarizine were the most potent inhibitors of both parameters (IC50 values less than 10(-5) M). Gadolinium and omega-conotoxin (omega-CgTx) were also effective inhibitors of Dyn-LI release (IC50 values less than 3 x 10(-5) M), but omega-CgTx only partially reduced the level of cytosolic free Ca. The release of Dyn-LI was relatively insensitive to both the L-type (dihydropyridines, verapamil and diltiazem) and T-type (amiloride and phenytoin) channel blockers. It appears that presynaptic N-type Ca channels make the most substantial contribution to the Ca influx required for the exocytosis of Dyn-LI from hippocampal mossy fiber nerve endings.",
