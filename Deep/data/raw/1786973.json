     "AB": "Effect of corticosterone on lipid contents of different brain regions and the effect of age on the sensitivity of these regions to corticosterone have been studied. Corticosterone administration (40 mg/kg body wt, sc) to 17-day-old rat for 3 days led to significant decrease in phospholipid content of cerebellum and increase in cholesterol contents of hippocampus and striatum. However, there was no effect on cerebral cortex and brain stem lipids. This alteration in lipids was associated with decrease in [U-14C] glucose incorporation into cholesterol and phospholipids, decrease in plasma beta-hydroxy butyrate levels and increase in beta-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase activity in hippocampus and striatum, thereby suggesting that suppression of glucose utilization by corticosterone was compensated by higher utilization of ketone bodies for lipid synthesis in these regions. The sensitivity to corticosterone appears to be age-specific as, at 20-day, cerebellum, hippocampus and striatum were susceptible, at 10-day only hippocampus and at 40- and 90-day none of these regions responded to the treatment.",
