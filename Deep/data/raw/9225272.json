     "AB": "The effect of repeated administration of the reuptake inhibitor citalopram (10 mg/kg s.c., b.i.d. for 14 days) or saline on extracellular 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and autoreceptor sensitivity was assessed using microdialysis in the frontal cortex (FCx) and dorsal hippocampus (DH) of unanesthetized rats. Acute citalopram (5 mg/kg s.c.) challenge produced significant increases in DH and FCx 5-HT. The nonselective 5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist (-)+penbutolol (8 mg/kg s.c.), administered 2 hr after citalopram challenge, significantly enhanced 5-HT in FCx and DH of both the chronic citalopram and saline pretreatment groups. Administration of the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 (0.3 mg/kg s.c.) after citalopram challenge significantly enhanced 5-HT in FCx but not DH of both pretreatment groups. This suggests that there may be differences between DH and FCx in regulation of 5-HT release. Nevertheless, these results provide evidence that 5-HT autoreceptors are still active in restraining 5-HT release. Nevertheless, these results provide evidence that 5-HT autoreceptors are still active in restraining 5-HT release even after repeated administration of an antidepressant drug.",
