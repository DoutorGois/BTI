     "AB": "Considerable evidence exists for an involvement of serotonergic mechanisms in the control of alcohol consumption. In the present study, an extensive 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) receptor autoradiographical investigation was performed using two genetically selected rat strains, alcohol preferring (P) and Alko alcohol (AA) alcohol-preferring rats, as well as the corresponding alcohol nonpreferring (NP) and Alko nonalcohol (ANA) alcohol-nonpreferring rats. The aim was to determine if there are any differences in 5-HT3 binding levels that may illuminate mechanisms of alcohol preference in these animals. For quantitating 5-HT3 binding sites, [3H]S(-)zacopride (0.5 nM) was used. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of granisetron 10(-6) M. The [3H]S(-)zacopride binding density was measured in two subregions of the amygdaloid nucleus, frontal cortex, piriform cortex, cingulate laminae, parietal anterior cortex, parietal medial cortex, hippocampus CA1, hippocampus CA3, and entorhinal cortex. In all the brain areas investigated, the results showed no differences between AA and ANA rats. In P rats, compared to NP controls, there was a 30% lower 5-HT3 binding level in the lateral nucleus and the posteromedial cortical nucleus of the amygdala. These findings suggest that the expression of high alcohol preference in genetically selected P and AA rats is not associated with a general alteration of central 5-HT3 receptors, although a lower 5-HT3 receptor level in the amygdala of P rats may contribute to the phenotype of this strain of animals.",
