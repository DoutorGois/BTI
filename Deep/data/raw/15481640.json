     "AB": "Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Alternation of NOS expression is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous secondary complications of diabetes. Aqueous extract of Ginseng radix has traditionally been used for the various disorders including diabetes. In this study, the effect of Ginseng radix on the NOS expression in the hippocampus of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats was investigated via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry. Enhanced NOS expression was detected in the hippocampus of diabetic rats and administration of Ginseng radix suppressed NOS expression. Ginseng radix may aid the treatment of central nervous system complications in diabetes.",
