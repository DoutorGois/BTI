     "AB": "We investigated whether microRNAs could regulate AMPA receptor expression during activity blockade. miR-92a strongly repressed the translation of GluA1 receptors by binding the 3' untranslated region of rat GluA1 (also known as Gria1) mRNA and was downregulated in rat hippocampal neurons after treatment with tetrodotoxin and AP5. Deleting the seed region in GluA1 or overexpressing miR-92a blocked homeostatic scaling, indicating that miR-92a regulates the translation and synaptic incorporation of new GluA1-containing AMPA receptors.",
