We report here the expression of sFRP-1 mRNA, encoding a putative inhibitor of Wnt, in the developing mouse neocortex during the entire period when neurons for the neocortex are born. We show that sFRP-1 mRNA expression is spatially restricted to the proliferative zones during the period, when neurons are known to be generated in large numbers for the enlarging cortical plate.",
