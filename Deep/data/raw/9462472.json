     "AB": "We investigated the spatiotemporal GFAP mRNA expression over a period of 11 days following brain injury in rats caused by impact acceleration, which is known to produce diffuse axonal injury (DAI). We observed widespread GFAP mRNA expression throughout the brain, which was more rapid and intense in the hippocampus. This expression was obvious in most animals 2 days after injury and appeared maximal at day 6. Although it decreased by day 11, the level of expression remained high compared with control levels. We noted slight differences in time of onset and the magnitude of the response between hippocampus and white matter structures or cortical areas. The different mechanisms able to trigger this response are discussed in regard to histopathological changes observed in DAI models.",
