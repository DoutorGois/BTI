     "AB": "Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) represents the phenomenon of CNC adaptation, which results in increased tolerance of CNS to lethal ischemia. Brain ischemia/reperfusion (IRI) initiates a catastrophic cascade in which many subcellular organelles play an important role. The Golgi apparatus, which is a part of secretory pathways (SP), represents the Ca(2+) store and regulates secretion of proteins for growth/reorganization of neuronal circuit by secretory Ca(2+)ATPases (SPCA1). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of IRI and preconditioning on SPCA1 gene expression and oxidative damage after 4-vessel occlusion for 15 min and after being exposed to different reperfusion periods. Rats were preconditioned by 5 min of sub-lethal ischemia and 2 days later, 15 min of lethal ischemia was induced. Our experiments conclusively showed IRI-induced depression of SPCA activity and lipo- and protein oxidation in rat hippocampal membranes. IRI also activates the induction of SPCA1 gene expression in later reperfusion periods. IPC partially suppresses lipo- and protein oxidation in hippocampal membranes and leads to partiall rovery of the ischemic-induced depression of SPCA activity. In addition, IPC initiates earlier cellular response to the injury by the significant elevation of mRNA expression to 142% comparing to 1 h of corresponding reperfusion and to 11% comparing to 24 h of corresponding reperfusion, respectively. Similar patterns were observed on the translational level by Western blot analysis. Our results indicate the specific SPCA1 expression pattern in ischemic hippocampus. It also shows that the SPCA expression and the post-translational changes induced by ischemia are modulated by the IPC. This might serve to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the structural integrity and function of the SP after ischemic challenge. It also suggests that there is a correlation of SPCA function with the role of SP in the response to pre-ischemic challenge.",
