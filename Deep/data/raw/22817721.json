     "AB": "The stepwise progression of tau pathology [NFTs (neurofibrillary tangles) and NTs (neuropil threads)] in AD (Alzheimer's disease) is generally assumed to begin in the transentorhinal region (entorhinal stage) from which it progresses to the hippocampus (limbic stage) and to neocortical regions (neocortical stage). This stepwise progression is reflected in the NFT Braak stages. However, it has been shown recently that tau pathology is frequently seen in subcortical nuclei, in particular the LC (locus coeruleus) in over 90% of individuals under 30 years of age, suggesting that AD-associated tau pathology begins in the LC and not in the transentorhinal region. On the other hand, only minimal amounts of tau pathology are seen in the LC in cases with considerable entorhinal tau pathology, while the severity of tau pathology in the LC significantly increases with increasing NFT Braak stages. These findings suggest that the LC becomes increasingly involved during AD progression rather than representing the site initially affected. Further studies are warranted to answer the question of whether tau pathology in the LC of young individuals is associated with AD or whether it rather reflects non-specific neuronal damage.",
