     "AB": "L-PGlu-(2-propyl)-L-His-L-ProNH(2) (NP-647) is a CNS active thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) analog with potential application in various CNS disorders including seizures. In the present study, mechanism of action for protective effect of NP-647 was explored by studying role of NP-647 on epileptiform activity and sodium channels by using patch-clamp methods. Epileptiform activity was induced in subicular pyramidal neurons of hippocampal slice of rat by perfusing 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) containing Mg(+)(2)-free normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (nACSF). Increase in mean firing frequency was observed after perfusion of 4-AP and zero Mg(+)(2) (2.10+/-0.47 Hz) as compared with nACSF (0.12+/-0.08 Hz). A significant decrease in mean firing frequency (0.61+/-0.22 Hz), mean frequency of epileptiform events (0.03+/-0.02 Hz vs. 0.22+/-0.05 Hz of 4-AP+0 Mg), and average number of action potentials in paroxysmal depolarization shift-burst (2.54+/-1.21 Hz vs. 8.16+/-0.88 Hz of 4-AP+0 Mg) was observed. A significant reduction in peak dV/dt (246+/-19 mV ms(-)(1) vs. 297+/-18 mV ms(-)(1) of 4-AP+0 Mg) and increase (1.332+/-0.018 ms vs. 1.292+/-0.019 ms of 4-AP+0 Mg) in time required to reach maximum depolarization were observed indicating role of sodium channels. Concentration-dependent depression of sodium current was observed after exposure to dorsal root ganglion neurons to NP-647. NP-647 at different concentrations (1, 3, and 10 muM) depressed sodium current (15+/-0.5%, 50+/-2.6%, and 75+/-0.7%, respectively). However, NP-647 did not show change in the peak sodium current in CNa18 cells. Results of present study demonstrated potential of NP-647 in the inhibition of epileptiform activity by inhibiting sodium channels indirectly.",
