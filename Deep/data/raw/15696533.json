     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the capacity of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize the normal anatomic features of the human hippocampus in vitro, using high field imaging equipment, parameters, and acquisition times appropriate for imaging human subjects in vivo. This research compared high field, high-resolution MRI of formalin-fixed normal human hippocampus specimens to histologic sectioning of the same hippocampus samples. Four specimens were evaluated using an 8 Tesla (T), 80 cm bore whole-body MRI scanner equipped with a 12.7 cm single strut transverse electromagnetic resonator (TEM) coil. Hahn spin echo images were acquired with a repetition time (TR) of 800 msec, echo times (TE) of 20, 50, 90, and 134 msec, and an acquisition time (TA) of 3.25 min. The image quality was superb with demonstration of most of the features of the hippocampus. High field, high-resolution MRI can be used to depict multiple layers of the formalin-fixed human hippocampus in vitro using an 8 T whole-body scanner, a TEM coil, and short acquisition times compatible with human imaging in vivo.",
