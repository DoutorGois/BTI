     "AB": "Interactions between cannabinoid and opioid systems have been reported in many studies. In the present study, we have investigated influence of cannabinoid CB1 receptor mechanism on the acquisition of conditioned place preference (CPP) induced by morphine in male Wistar rats. The cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist (WIN55,212-2) and antagonist (AM251) were injected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus. Morphine and naloxone were injected subcutaneously (s.c.). The conditioning treatments with injections of morphine (6 and 9 mg/kg) induced a CPP for the drug-associated place. When administered into the dorsal hippocampus, WIN55,212-2 (1 microg/rat) induced CPP, but significantly did not alter CPP induced by a sub-effective dose of morphine (3 mg/kg). Moreover, administration of different doses of AM251 (50 and 100 ng/rat) into the dorsal hippocampus induced CPP, while did not change CPP by the sub-effective dose of morphine. Naloxone alone (1 mg/kg) induced conditioned place aversion (CPA). The drug (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) also caused CPA when co-administered with WIN55,212-2 (1 microg/rat). These results suggest that endocannabinoid system in the dorsal hippocampus is important for the CPP paradigm. However, agents did not alter morphine-induced CPP.",
