     "AB": "The effects of various types of experimentally-induced neural damage involving selective areas of the hippocampal system on spontaneous non-operant activity were studied in adult male rats using stabilimeter apparatus. A hierarchy of lesion-induced activity increases relative to sham-lesioned controls was revealed in which colchicine-induced dentate granule cell lesions produced the greatest increase in activity and kainic acid-induced pyramidal cell lesions produced the least. Methylphenidate (0.2, 0.4, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 mg/kg) tended to increase this activity in a dose-dependent manner while pentobarbital (0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0 mg/kg) tended to decrease it. These results indicate that such neural damage does not sufficiently alter the responsivity of rats to these drugs to produce a \"paradoxical\" effect although some lesion group differences in drug responsivity were seen. All this is discussed in light of the neuro-architecture of this system.",
