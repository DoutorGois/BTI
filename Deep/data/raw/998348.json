In 4 animals contralateral and/or ipsilateral, cortical and subcortical secondary epileptic foci were present. The results indicate that integrity of interhemispheric transfer through the corpus callosum and anterior and posterior commissures is not necessary for the transmission of epileptic activity to contralateral hemisphere. Partial epileptic seizures of Jacksonian type were observed in 6 cats. In 1 cat grand mal epileptic seizure developed. The possible mechanisms of secondary epileptic foci and generalized type of seizure are discussed.",
