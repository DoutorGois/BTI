     "AB": "The present findings show that an atypical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, such as acetaminophen, retains the ability to recover amyloid beta-peptides driven neuronal apoptosis through the impairment of oxidative stress. Moreover, this compound reduces the increased NF-kappaB binding activity, which occurs in these degenerative conditions. Therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing the inflammatory response in Alzheimer's disease (AD) recently suggested the application of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Although the anti-inflammatory properties of acetaminophen are controversial, it emerged that in an amyloid-driven astrocytoma cell degeneration model acetaminophen proved to be effective. On these bases, we analyzed the role of acetaminophen against the toxicity exerted by different Abeta-peptides on rat primary hippocampal neurons and on a rat pheochromocytoma cell line. We found a consistent protection from amyloid beta-fragments 1-40 and 1-42-induced impairment of mitochondrial redox activity on both cell cultures, associated with a marked reduction of apoptotic nuclear fragmentation. An antioxidant component of the protective activity emerged from the analysis of the reduction of phospholipid peroxidation, and also from a significant reduction of cytoplasmic accumulation of peroxides in the pheochromocytoma cell line. Moreover, activation of NF-kappaB by amyloid-derived peptides was greatly impaired by acetaminophen pre-treatment in hippocampal cells. This evidence points out antioxidant and anti-transcriptional properties of acetaminophen besides the known capability to interfere with inflammation within the central nervous system, and suggests that it can be exploited as a possible therapeutic approach against AD.",
