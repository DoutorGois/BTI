     "AB": "Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP or amylin) potently reduces food intake in rats at or near physiological concentrations. Although the mechanisms of action of IAPP are not understood, the brain is a suggested site. Changes in hypothalamic and striatal neurotransmission have been reported following acute systemic administration of a pharmacological concentration of IAPP. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of chronic administration of low doses of IAPP on satiety-related neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum, left cortex, and right cortex of the rat. Doses of 0, 5 and 25 pmol IAPP/kg-min were administered subcutaneously for 2 or 5 days. Food intake was reduced by 27 and 44% (both P<0.001) for the 5 and 25 pmol/kg-min groups, respectively, in the 2-day experiment and was decreased by 14% (P<0.01) and 24% (P<0.001), respectively, in the 5-day experiment. Body weight was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent fashion. In the 2-day experiment, norepinephrine increased in the hypothalamus in the 5 pmol IAPP/kg-min group, and neurotensin increased in the hippocampus in the 25 pmol/kg-min rats (both P<0.05). In the 5-day, 5 pmol/kg-min rats, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) increased in the hypothalmus and cholecystokinin (CCK) increased in the striatum (both P<0.05). In the 5-day, 25 pmol/kg-min group, neuropeptide Y (NPY) increased in the hypothalamus (P<0.01) and CCK increased in the hypothalmus and striatum (both P<0.05). The present study confirms that IAPP is a potent anorectic peptide at low doses and suggests that IAPP not only affects classical neurotransmitters in the brain but also alters concentrations of neuropeptides known to be involved in food intake.",
