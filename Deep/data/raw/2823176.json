     "AB": "Previous intracellular investigations in the rat hippocampus have demonstrated that N-methyl-D-aspartate, ibotenate and 2,3-pyridine dicarboxylate (quinolinate) all evoke burst firing of CA1 pyramidal neurons, whereas kainate and quisqualate, which are thought to react with different receptors, do not. The purpose of the present study has been to investigate the ability of a series of compounds either to trigger burst firing or to antagonize this pattern of excitation. We report here that N-methyl-L-aspartate, 1,2-benzene dicarboxylate (phthalate) and methylene succinate (itaconate) are also capable of evoking burst firing. The results of this investigation suggest that since both quinolinate and phthalate are rigid planar molecules and only the 2 and 3 positioning of the carboxylates of pyridine was active, a cis configuration of the carboxyls with respect to the 2,3 carbon bond appears to be necessary for excitation. While a nitrogen atom is not necessary for activity (this is absent in phthalate and itaconate) a third functional group, bearing at least a partial positive charge, and in a position alpha to one of the carboxyl groups is required. The requirements for pyridine derivatives to trigger burst firing is similar to that reported as necessary for evoking convulsions and neurotoxicity after intrahippocampal infusion and a correlation between N-methyl-D-aspartate-like burst firing and depolarization and this neuropathology is considered. An important observation has been that the addition of a benzene ring to either quinolinate or phthalate to yield 2,3-quinoline dicarboxylate and 2,3-napthalene dicarboxylate, respectively, converted these excitants into antagonists of burst firing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
