     "AB": "Kv4.2, a pore-forming alpha-subunit of voltage-gated A-type potassium channels, is expressed abundantly in the soma and dendrites of hippocampal neurons, and is responsible for somatodendritic I(A) current. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the surface levels of Kv4.2 potassium channels might be relevant to synaptic plasticity. Although the function and expression of Kv4.2 protein have been extensively studied, the dendritic localization of Kv4.2 mRNA is not well described. In this study, Kv4.2 mRNAs were shown to be localized in the dendrites near postsynaptic regions. The dendritic transport of Kv4.2 mRNAs were mediated by microtubule- based movement. The 500 nucleotides of specific regions within the 3'-untranslated region of Kv4.2 mRNA were found to be necessary and sufficient for its dendritic localization. Collectively, these results suggest that the dendritic localization of Kv4.2 mRNAs might regulate the dendritic surface level of Kv4.2 channels and synaptic plasticity.",
