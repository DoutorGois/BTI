     "AB": "Fornix transection in the marmoset produces a specific pattern of cognitive deficits, notably a lack of ability to recall visuospatial tasks learnt preoperatively, and a deficit in acquiring new visuospatial tasks following transection. Previous work has shown that this learning impairment can be ameliorated by cholinergic agonists, suggesting that it occurs as a consequence of destroying the cholinergic projection from the vertical limb of the diagonal band to the hippocampus which runs through the fornix. We have now shown that this deficit in new learning can be significantly alleviated by the 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY 100635. This result supports the suggestion that 5-HT1A projections are inhibitory on the same target cells for which cholinergic projections are excitatory, and that loss of function in the target cells caused by loss of excitatory tone can be compensated by blockade of inhibitory tone. Since cholinergic loss in the hippocampus (and neocortex) occurs in association with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, these results suggest that 5-HT1A antagonists may have a role in the treatment of some of the cognitive symptoms of dementia.",
