     "AB": "There is currently no treatment for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury. Although limited clinical trials of stem cell therapy have been initiated in a number of neurological disorders, the preclinical evidence of a cell-based therapy for neonatal HI injury remains in its infancy. Stem cell therapy, via stimulation of endogenous stem cells or transplantation of exogenous stem cells, has targeted neurogenic sites, such as the hippocampus, for brain protection and repair. The hippocampus has also been shown to secrete growth factors, especially during the postnatal period, suggesting that this brain region presents a highly conducive microenvironment for cell survival. Based on its neurogenic and neurotrophic factor-secreting features, the hippocampus stands as an appealing target for stem cell therapy. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of intrahippocampal transplantation of multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs), which are pluripotent progenitor cells with the ability to differentiate into a neuronal lineage. Seven-day old Sprague-Dawley rats were initially subjected to unilateral HI injury, that involved permanent ligation of the right common carotid artery and subsequent exposure to hypoxic environment. At day 7 after HI",
