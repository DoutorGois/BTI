     "AB": "In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, action potentials generated in the axon back-propagate in a decremental fashion into the dendritic tree where they affect synaptic integration and synaptic plasticity. The amplitude of back-propagating action potentials (b-APs) is controlled by various biological factors, including membrane potential (Vm). We report that, at any dendritic location (x), the transition from weak (small-amplitude b-APs) to strong (large-amplitude b-APs) back-propagation occurs when Vm crosses a threshold potential, x. When Vm > x, back-propagation is strong (mostly active). Conversely, when Vm < x, back-propagation is weak (mostly passive). x varies linearly with the distance (x) from the soma. Close to the soma, x << resting membrane potential (RMP) and a strong hyperpolarization of the membrane is necessary to switch back-propagation from strong to weak. In the distal dendrites, x >> RMP and a strong depolarization is necessary to switch back-propagation from weak to strong. At approximately 260 micrometer from the soma, 260 approximately RMP, suggesting that in this dendritic region back-propagation starts to switch from strong to weak. x depends on the availability or state of Na+ and K+ channels. Partial blockade or phosphorylation of K+ channels decreases x and thereby increases the portion of the dendritic tree experiencing strong back-propagation. Partial blockade or inactivation of Na+ channels has the opposite effect. We conclude that x is a parameter that captures the onset of the transition from weak to strong back-propagation. Its modification may alter dendritic function under physiological and pathological conditions by changing how far large action potentials back-propagate in the dendritic tree.",
