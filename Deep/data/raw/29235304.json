     "AB": "\"Haima\" (Hippocampus) has a long history in China as an important traditional animal medicine, but many closely-related members of the Hippocampus genus are also used as Haima in particular regions. To investigate the real origin of \"Haima\", a herbalogical studies, particularly inpictures and photographs of the ancient literature are corroborated with seahorse specimens in museum, we confirm Chinese material medica \"Haima\" in China Pharmacopoeia is origin from H. kelloggi, 1901, H.spinosissimus, 1913, H. kuda, 1852, H. trimaculatus, 1814, or H. mohnikei, 1853. The so-called \"Ci Haima\" is H. spinosissimus, instead of H. histrix, 1856. The paper also suggests to revise of \"macroscopical identification\" item and add identification methods of \"Haima\" in China Pharmacopoeia, which may improve quality controls tandards of \"Haima\".",
