     "AB": "Recordings were made from human hippocampal tissue surgically removed for treatment of epilepsy. In 70% of cases, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated component was present in excitatory synaptic input to gyrus dentatus. NMDA receptors are normally present, but do not participate in low-frequency synaptic transmission, in this region of the mammalian brain. These findings suggest that recruitment of normally dormant excitatory amino acid receptors may be a feature of the epileptic brain.",
