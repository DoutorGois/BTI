     "AB": "The involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) in Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is rare. We report a 47-year-old woman who presented with acute encephalitis and was subsequently diagnosed as having Sweet's syndrome. She developed altered consciousness following fever and erythematous skin plaques in the extremities. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination disclosed neutrophilic pleocytosis without decreased glucose level. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed abnormal signal intensity lesions in the basal ganglia and the hippocampus. Skin biopsy revealed a dense dermal infiltration of neutrophils, which is compatible with Sweet's syndrome. Treatment with acyclovir and antibiotics failed, but the subsequent corticosteroid therapy was effective. Awareness of neurological complication in Sweet's syndrome may avoid unnecessary empiric therapy for meningoencephalitis and will lead to a successful treatment with corticosteroids.",
