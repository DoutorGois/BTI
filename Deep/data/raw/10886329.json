     "AB": "Substantial evidence suggests that the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta)-derived peptides, and to a lesser extent free radicals, may contribute to the aetiology and/or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) is a well-defined plant extract containing two major groups of constituents, i.e. flavonoids and terpenoids. It is viewed as a polyvalent agent with a possible therapeutic use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases of multifactorial origin, e.g. AD. We have investigated here the potential effectiveness of EGb 761 against toxicity induced by (Abeta)-derived peptides (Abeta25-35, Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42) on hippocampal primary cultured cells, this area being severely affected in AD. A co-treatment with EGb 761 concentration-dependently (10-100 microg/mL) protected hippocampal neurons against toxicity induced by Abeta fragments, with a maximal and complete protection at the highest concentration tested. Similar, albeit less potent protective effects were seen with the flavonoid fraction of the extract (CP 205), while the terpenes were ineffective. Most interestingly, EGb 761 (100 microg/mL) was even able to protect (up to 8 h) hippocampal cells from a pre-exposure to Abeta25-35 and Abeta1-40. EGb 761 was also able to both protect and rescue hippocampal cells from toxicity induced by H2O2 (50-150 microM), a major peroxide possibly involved in mediating Abeta toxicity. Moreover, EGb 761 (10-100 microg/mL), and to a lesser extent CP 205 (10-50 microg/mL), completely blocked Abeta-induced events, e.g. reactive oxygen species accumulation and apoptosis. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of EGb 761 are partly associated with its antioxidant properties and highlight its possible effectiveness in neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. AD via the inhibition of Abeta-induced toxicity and cell death.",
