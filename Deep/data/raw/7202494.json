     "AB": "The existence of DA receptors in the rat hippocampus was demonstrated with an in vivo [3H]spiperone radioreceptor assay. Kinetic studies revealed that maximum binding of [3H]spiperone in hippocampus was much smaller than in striatum and frontal cortex but much higher than in cerebellum. In inhibition studies of [3H]spiperone binding, all neuroleptics tested were active in hippocampus as well as in striatum. In contrast, 5HT antagonists were definitely less potent in these two brain regions than in frontal cortex. Finally, even when 5HT receptors were blocked, dipropyl-ATN and haloperidol remained fully effective in hippocampus, striatum, but also in frontal cortex although to a lesser degree. From these results it was concluded that [3H]spiperone binds mainly to DA receptors in hippocampus as well as in striatum, whereas both 5HT and DA receptors are present in frontal cortex.",
