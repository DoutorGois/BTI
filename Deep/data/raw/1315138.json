     "AB": "Three doses of MK801 (0.05 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg) were given systemically to adult male rats, which were then tested on a battery of previously learned, reactive and spontaneous behaviors. Hyperactivity, hyper-reactivity, reductions in rearing behavior and deficits in tongue extension were found at the 0.05 mg/kg dose. Similar, but more severe results were found at the 0.3 mg/kg dose, with the addition of difficulties in climbing, balancing on a beam, and abnormalities in orienting to tactile stimuli. A number of tasks could not be performed at the 1.0 mg/kg dose including tongue extension, orienting, balancing on a beam, and climbing. Additionally, abnormal postures, gaits, and swimming behaviors were observed at this dose. These results characterize the behavioral effects of MK801 as a syndrome of hyperactivity, hyper-reactivity, and sensorimotor deficits. Evidence of this syndrome was present at all three doses, including the 0.05 mg/kg dose, which previously has been claimed to induce deficits similar to hippocampal lesions. Learning literature employing MK801 is discussed in the context of the behavioral deficits found in this study.",
