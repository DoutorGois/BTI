     "AB": "Phosphoinositide hydrolysis induced by norepinephrine, quisqualate, or trans-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (ACPD), but not by carbachol, was approximately 50% greater in hippocampal slices from adrenalectomized (14 days) rats compared with controls. These changes appeared to be selective for the hippocampus because no effects of adrenalectomy on phosphoinositide hydrolysis were detected in cortical or striatal slices. The enhanced response to norepinephrine in hippocampal slices after adrenalectomy was observed throughout the effective concentration range of norepinephrine, was not influenced by in vitro addition of corticosterone, was not mimicked or altered by incubation with dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (AMP), and did not appear to be due to impaired inhibition of the response to norepinephrine which was elicited by activation of protein kinase C or by inclusion of an inhibitory concentration of quisqualate. These findings indicate that adrenalectomy either removes an inhibitory influence of glucocorticoids on the phosphoinositide system in the hippocampus or that the neurodegeneration of granule cells in the dentate gyrus following adrenalectomy is associated with neurotransmitter-selective increases in phosphoinositide hydrolysis. These data provide further evidence that glucocorticoids modify signal transduction in the brain and extends their known influence to the phosphoinositide second messenger system.",
