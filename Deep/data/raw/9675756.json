     "AB": "The literature regarding magnesium sulfate central nervous system inhibitory effect will be reviewed. We suggest that its mechanism of action be through the excitatory amino acid receptors. We have demonstrated that magnesium sulfate enters the cerebrospinal fluid and brain after systemic administration. The significant rise in brain magnesium concentration is associated with an elevation of the seizure threshold and a marked resistance of the animal to electrically as well as NMDA stimulated hippocampal seizures. Using autoradiography we have studied the effect of magnesium sulfate on the NMDA receptor-channel complex, as well as on the AMPA and Kainate receptors. The results provide further information on the mechanism by which magnesium' central anticonvulsant activity is mediated in the rat model.",
