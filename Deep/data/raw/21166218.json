     "AB": "AIM: To investigate the effects of oxygen-glucose deprivation on cultured rat hippocampal neurons. METHODS: The hippocampal neurons cultured for 12 d were exposed to combined oxygen-glucose deprivation for 0.5 - 4 h and then cultured with original medium in normoxia for 28 h. Necrotic neurons were identified by 0.4% trypan blue staining and apoptotic neurons were detected by a TUNEL technique. Meanwhile, the area, perimeter and circle diameter of cell bodies were measured respectively by a photography analysis system. RESULTS: The percentage of necrotic cells in cultured hippocampal neurons increased significantly during oxygen-glucose deprivation, but the percentage of apoptotic cells increased significantly after 28 h oxygen-glucose recovery. Photography analysis showed that area, perimeter and circle diameter of the necrotic cell bodies were larger than those of the apoptotic ones. CONCLUSION: Oxygen-glucose deprivation can lead to severe damage of cultured hippocampal neurons. The necrosis is major during acute oxygen-glucose deprivation, while the apoptosis is major 28 h after oxygen-glucose recovery.",
