     "AB": "Many epidemiological studies and in vitro experiments have found that chronic arsenic exposure may influence memory formation. The goal of this study was to create an animal model of memory impairment induced by chronic arsenite exposure and to study the underlying mechanisms. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats were randomly divided into a control group, a low-dose sodium arsenite exposure group and a high-dose sodium arsenite exposure group. Sodium arsenite was administered by adding it to drinking water for 3 months. Then, the spatial memory of the rats was examined with Morris water maze and Y maze. The concentration of arsenic in the blood and the brain was determined by an atomic fluorescence absorption spectrometer. The ultra-structure of hippocampal neurons was observed by an electron microscope. Timm staining was used for observing mossy fibers. We found that the concentration of arsenic in the blood and the brain increased in a dose-response manner (P<0.05). The performance of rats in the arsenite exposed group (15 mg/kg) was significantly impaired in the Morris water maze and Y maze tasks than those in the control group (P<0.05). Sodium arsenite exposure resulted in abnormal structural changes in the myelin sheaths of nerve fibers and decreases in the terminals of mossy fibers. Together, chronic sodium arsenite exposure through drinking water results in detrimental changes in the neuronal synapses, which may contribute to the arsenite-induced impairment of spatial memory.",
