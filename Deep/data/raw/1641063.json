     "AB": "A procedure for labeling rat CNS proteins in vivo which is useful for behavioral and pharmacological studies has been developed. Intraventricular administration of 35S-methionine through bilateral indwelling cannulae provided reproducible and highly specific radiolabeling of proteins from frontal cortex (FC), parietal cortex (PC), occipital cortex (OC), striatum (ST), septal nuclei (SN), amygdala (AM), hippocampus (HIP), thalamus (TH), brain stem (BS) and cerebellum (CB). Relative rates of synthesis of over 200 individual proteins were subsequently analyzed by 2DGE. Regional analysis demonstrated increased labeling of a protein of MW 28 kD and pI 6.4 in the hippocampus that was barely detectable in striatum of control rats. In heat-shocked animals, there was increased relative synthesis of the 74 kD Heat Shock Protein in both the septal nuclei and hippocampus.",
