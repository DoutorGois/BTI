     "AB": "Synapsin I is the best characterized member of a family of neuron-specific phosphoproteins thought to be involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. In this report, we present the first extensive in situ hybridization study detailing the regional and cellular distribution of synapsin I mRNA in the adult rat brain. Both the regional distribution and relative levels of synapsin I mRNA established by in situ hybridization were confirmed by RNA blot analysis. Our data demonstrate the widespread yet regionally variable expression of synapsin I mRNA throughout the adult rat brain. The greatest abundance of synapsin I mRNA was found in the pyramidal neurons of the CA3 and CA4 fields of the hippocampus, and in the mitral and internal granular cell layers of the olfactory bulb. Other areas abundant in synapsin I mRNA were the layer II neurons of the piriform cortex and layer II and V neurons of the entorhinal cortex, the granule cell neurons of the dentate gyrus, the pyramidal neurons of hippocampal fields CA1 and CA2, and the cells of the parasubiculum. In general, the pattern of expression of synapsin I mRNA paralleled those encoding other synaptic terminal-specific proteins, such as synaptophysin, VAMP-2, and SNAP-25, with noteworthy exceptions. To determine specifically how synapsin I mRNA levels are related to levels of synapsin I protein, we examined in detail the local distribution patterns of both synapsin I mRNA and protein in the rat hippocampus. These data revealed differential levels of expression of synapsin I mRNA and protein within defined synaptic circuits of the rat hippocampus.",
