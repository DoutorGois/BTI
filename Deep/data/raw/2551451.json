     "AB": "Glycine enhanced the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-stimulated sodium flux in rat hippocampal slides in a concentration-dependent manner. The potentiation by glycine was apparently not competitive to NMDA with a maximal effect of about 50% enhancement at approximately 150 microM glycine. Glycine also reversed the kynurenic acid inhibition of NMDA-stimulated sodium flux, increasing flux two-fold. In the absence of glycine, the kynurenic acid inhibition of NMDA-stimulated sodium flux appeared not competitive to NMDA, with a Schild plot slope of 0.6 +/- 0.1, significantly less than 1 (P less than 0.05). Addition of 100 microM glycine gave a Schild plot slope of 1.0 +/- 0.3, classically defining competitive inhibition. However, the pKb of 4.5 obtained from the x intercept gives an inaccurate estimate of the affinity of kynurenic acid for the NMDA recognition site since glycine is present. Addition of 400 microM glycine resulted in a Schild plot slope of 1.9 +/- 0.2. By varying the concentrations of glycine, we have apparently reproduced a portion of the theoretical set of curves for various ratios of affinities of the antagonist for the agonist recognition site and a second site. These results support a model where glycine modulates NMDA receptor function and where kynurenic acid acts both as a competitive antagonist to NMDA and at a second site from which it is displaced by glycine.",
