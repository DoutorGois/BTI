     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced in the commissural pathway to CA3 in vivo. Tissue slices were prepared from potentiated and control hippocampi and preloaded with [14C]glutamate ([14C]glu). K+-stimulated release of [14C]glu from these slices was compared in the absence and presence of extracellular Ca2+. High-affinity uptake and Ca2+-independent release of [14C]glu were not affected by the induction of LTP, but Ca2+-dependent release from potentiated tissue was significantly greater than that from control tissue. These results demonstrate that LTP induced in vivo in the commissural pathway to CA3 is associated with enhanced release of preloaded glutamate in vitro.",
