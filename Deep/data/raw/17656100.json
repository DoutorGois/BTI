     "AB": "Infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder of children, characterized by selective death of neocortical neurons. To understand early disease mechanisms in INCL, we have studied Ppt1(Deltaex4) knock-out mouse neurons in culture and acute brain slices. Global transcript profiling showed deregulation of key neuronal functions in knock-out mice including cholesterol metabolism, neuronal maturation, and calcium homeostasis. Cholesterol metabolism showed major changes; sterol biosynthesis was enhanced and steady-state amounts of sterols were altered at the cellular level. Changes were also present in early maturation of Ppt1(Deltaex4) neurons indicated by increased proliferative capacity of neuronal stem cells. Knock-out neurons presented unaltered electrophysiological properties suggesting uncompromised synaptic function in young animals. However, knock-out neurons exhibited more efficient recovery from glutamate-induced calcium transients, possibly indicating neuroprotective activation. This study established that the neuronal deregulation in INCL is linked to neuronal maturation, lipid metabolism and calcium homeostasis.",
