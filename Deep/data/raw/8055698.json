Because MAS has biological properties related to the growth and differentiation of cells of neuroectodermal origin, we investigated the distribution of MAS expression in the rhesus macaque retina by in situ hybridization. A 330 base pair (bp) segment of the human MAS sequence was subcloned and used to generate single-stranded cRNA probes for these studies. Our results demonstrated little, if any, positive signal over the neurons of the retina. The use of epi-polarization microscopy, however, revealed a distinct positive labelling of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. These studies suggest the use of MAS as a possible marker for the retinal pigment epithelium.",
