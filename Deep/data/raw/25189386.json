     "AB": "Since it was first identified to play an important role in relaxation of blood vessels, nitric oxide has been demonstrated to regulate many biological processes, especially in the central nervous system. Of the three types of enzymes that produce nitric oxide in humans and rodents, neuronal type is found almost exclusively in the nervous system. This gaseous molecule is a nonclassical neurotransmitter, which maintains the activities of neural cells and regulates the normal functions of brain. It appears to play a role in promoting the transfer of nerve signals from one neuron to another, maintaining the synaptic strength. Meanwhile, nitric oxide is a unique regulator on neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, producing the positive or negative effects upon different signal pathways or cellular origins and locations. Based on its significant roles in neural plasticity, nitric oxide is involved in a number of central nervous diseases, such as ischemia, depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease. Clarifying the profiles of nitric oxide in the brain tissues and its participation in pathophysiological processes opens a new avenue for development of new therapeutic strategies. Thus, this chapter specifies the effects of nitric oxide in the hippocampus, a key structure implicated in the modulation of mood and memories, exhibiting the trend of future research on nitric oxide.",
