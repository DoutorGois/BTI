     "AB": "Corticosteroids receptors were characterized and compared in central and peripheral tissues of two pig breeds, the Meishan (MS) and the Large White (LW) pigs, that display differences in the basal activity and stress-induced reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In vitro kinetic experiments on kidney and liver cytosols from adrenalectomized pigs allowed to identify two distinct corticosteroid receptors referred to as mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors. The binding specificities were determined for kidney and hippocampal MR and for liver and hippocampal GR. In hippocampus and peripheral tissues, cortisol showed a greater affinity for MR than for GR. As already described in the dog, mouse and human, dexamethasone and progesterone display a moderate affinity for MR. Putative differences in corticosteroid receptors binding capacities and affinities were investigated by saturation binding studies in specific regions implicated in the regulation of HPA axis (hippocampus and pituitary). The MS pigs evidenced higher densities of hippocampal MR, while LW pigs had higher densities of pituitary GR. Thus, this study suggests that a difference in the MR/GR balance in hippocampus and pituitary could be implicated in the different HPA activity between MS and LW pigs.",
