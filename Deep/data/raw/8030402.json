     "AB": "The effect of ischemia-induced hippocampal neuronal damage on acquisition and performance in the Morris water maze task was investigated in male Wistar rats, subjected to 8 min of transient forebrain ischemia, induced by the 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) method. After a morphological scoring of the neuronal damage within the CA1, CA2, and CA3 subfields of the anterior-dorsal part of hippocampus we found that rats with a total neuronal cell loss of the anterior-dorsal CA1 region showed memory performance impairments in the acquisition trials, in a probe trial, and in a reversal experiment. However, rats with only partial damage to the CA1 region did not exhibit significant impairments during the acquisition trials of the water maze test or in the probe trial and the reversal experiment. In conclusion, these results suggest that it is possible to relate the histological damage score of CA1 in the anterior-dorsal hippocampus to impaired memory performance in the present water maze setup.",
