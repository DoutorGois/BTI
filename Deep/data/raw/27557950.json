     "AB": "RATIONALE: Epilepsy is a debilitating seizure disorder that affects approximately 50 million people. Noradrenaline reduces neuronal excitability, has anticonvulsant effects and is protective against seizure onset. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of alpha2-adrenoceptors in vivo in a neonatal domoic acid (DOM) rat model of epilepsy. METHODS: We injected male Sprague-Dawley rats daily from postnatal day 8-14 with saline or one of two sub-convulsive doses, 20 mug/kg (DOM20) or 60 mug/kg (DOM60) DOM, an AMPA/kainate receptor agonist. The rats were observed in open field, social interaction and forced swim tests at day 50, 75 and 98, respectively. At ~120 days of age, four rats per group were injected and scanned with [(11)C]yohimbine, an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, and scanned in a Mediso micro positron emission tomography (PET) scanner to measure alpha2-adrenoceptor binding. RESULTS: DOM60-treated rats spent more time in the periphery during the open field test and had a significant 26-33 % reduction in [(11)C]yohimbine binding in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and orbital prefrontal cortex compared to saline-treated rats. On the other hand, DOM20 rats had a significant 34-40 % increase in [(11)C]yohimbine binding in the hypothalamus, amygdala and entorhinal cortex compared to saline-treated rats, with no obvious behavioural differences. CONCLUSIONS: The current data clearly indicate that low concentrations of DOM given to rats in their second week of life induces long-term changes in alpha2-adrenoceptor binding in rat brain that may have relevance to the progression of an epilepsy phenotype.",
