     "AB": "We established an in vitro hypoxia model and investigated the protective effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) against neuronal cell death caused by hypoxia. Hippocampal neurons obtained from rats on embryonic day (E) 17 and 20 and on postnatal day (P) 4 were cultured for 6-24 h in an oxygen-deprived state. This in vitro hypoxia study showed that the cultured neurons were sensitive to the oxygen deprivation. The cultured P4 rat hippocampal neurons seemed to be weaker in the hypoxia condition than those of E17 and E20 rats, suggesting that the cultured postnatal cells might be sensitive to hypoxia. bFGF, but not nerve growth factor, prevented the neuronal cell death caused by hypoxia in a dose-dependent manner.",
