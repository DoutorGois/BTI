     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect and mechanism of meloxicam on the inflammatory reaction induced by beta amyloid protein (AB) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats. METHODS: The rat model was established by microinjection of Abeta(1-40) into hippocampus. The expression of NF-kappaB p65 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in hippocampus were detected by immunohistochemistry. The content of GFAP in cortex was tested by Western-blot. The content of TNF-alpha in cortex was tested by ELISA. The expression of IL-1beta mRNA was tested by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The expression of NF-kappaB p65, GFAP and TNF-alpha as well as IL-1beta mRNA were decreased by meloxicam. CONCLUSION: Meloxicam can reduce the proliferation of astrocyte by decreasing the expression of GFAP in AD model rat's hippocampus and cortex. And the depression of NF-kappaB p65 may significantly decrease the expression of TNF-alpha1 and IL-1beta to lessen the inflammatory reaction in cerebral tissue.",
