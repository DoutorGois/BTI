     "AB": "Stress activated protein kinases (SAPK) are key enzymes mediating the cellular response to stressful stimuli. While they are intensively studied in cultured cells, little is known about their physiological role in vivo, or relevance to pathological conditions. Therefore we examined the effect of various times of immobilization on c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activity in several rat stress responsive tissues and in a number of other locations. The abundance and relative distribution of JNK isoforms, the basal levels, time course and relative magnitude of stress induced JNK activity differed among tissues and regions of the brain of the same animal. JNK immunoreactive proteins were most abundant in the brain, especially in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and frontal cortex. Marked activation in response to immobilization stress was observed in adrenal medulla, adrenal cortex, aorta and hippocampus, less pronounced in locus coeruleus. JNK was not affected in superior cervical ganglia, pituitary, hypothalamus, frontal cortex and cerebellum. In adrenal medulla, the activation of JNK by single immobilization stress is correlated with increased transcription of stress-responsive genes, tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase. These data suggest a potential role of JNK signal transduction pathway in mediating the long term adaptation to stressful stimuli in vivo.",
