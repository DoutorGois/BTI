     "AB": "Although regular physical exercise is beneficial to the body, it is well known that exhaustive exercise causes oxidative stress in muscle. Recent studies suggest that regular moderate physical exercise has the beneficial effects on brain. However, there is little information regarding whether or not exhaustive exercise could generate oxidative stress in brain and the findings are conflicting. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exhaustive exercise on thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, as an indicator of lipid peroxidation, in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum. Additionally we examined antioxidant enzymes activities, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, to assess the effects of reactive oxygen species. Exhaustive exercise did not change superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase enzyme activities and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels neither immediately (0 min) nor at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after the cessation of exercise in the brain. These results indicate that acute exhaustive exercise may not cause significant lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum during the post-exercise period.",
