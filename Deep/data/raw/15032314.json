     "AB": "PURPOSE: AMPA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity is thought to be a critical process in diseases accompanied by neuronal cell loss following a hypoxic/anoxic state of the central nervous system. It has been suggested that blockade of AMPA receptors might result in significant protection of neurons against cellular damage. For testing the hypothesis, in vitro efficacy and in vivo neuroprotective action of new 2,3-benzodiazepine (2,3BDZ) AMPA antagonists have been compared. METHODS: 2.3BDZs were tested on kainate-evoked whole-cell currents in cultured neurons as well as on population spikes (PS) in rat hippocampal slices. Data were correlated with those obtained from the spreading depression (SD) experiments in chicken retina. Compounds were also examined in the gerbil bilateral carotid occlusion model (BCO), where percentage decrease of ischemia-related hypermotility (HM), impaired spatial memory (SA), and hypoxia-induced hippocampal CA1 neuronal cell death (CA1) were evaluated. RESULTS: Certain structural modifications of classical 2,3BDZs resulted in increased in vitro activity and improved in vivo efficacy. In particular, the halogen-substituted compounds EGIS-9879 and EGIS-9883 showed the highest neuroprotective efficacy (84% and 47% protection in CA1, 71% and 82% decrease in HM, respectively; 4 x 5 mg/kg i.p.) in BCO. PS and SD were correlated to the decrease of neuronal loss in the CA1 area. Lack of significant correlation was found between PS and CA1 (r = 0.437, p = 0.079) or SD and CA1 (r = 0.380, p = 0.146). CONCLUSIONS: Several new 2.3BDZ AMPA receptor antagonists have been synthesized at EGIS Pharmaceuticals characterized by remarkable in vitro and corresponding in vivo neuroprotective properties.",
