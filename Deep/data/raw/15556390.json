     "AB": "The aim of the study was to measure beta-adrenergic (beta-AR) and serotonergic (5-HTR) receptor concentrations in different brain areas (frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and thalamus) of normal and aggressive dogs. Eight adult male dogs, 4.2+/-0.6 years old, showing no clinical signs but aggression, were used for the study. Eight healthy male dogs, 4.4+/-0.8 years old, with no history of neurological and/or behavioural disorders and accidental death, were used as controls. The whole frontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus were collected after euthanasia and plasma membrane fractions obtained by ultracentrifugation. beta-AR and 5-HTR were measured by binding assays using specific radioligand [(-)[3H]CGP 12177 and 5-hydroxy[3H]-tryptamine trifluoroacetate, respectively]. A significant decrease in beta-AR levels was observed in the frontal cortex (P=0.001), hippocampus (P<0.0001), and thalamus (P<0.0001) of aggressive dogs compared to controls. As far as 5-HTR are concerned, two receptor subtypes were detected. The two subtypes were classified as low-affinity (5-HTR LA) and high-affinity (5-HTR HA) serotonergic receptors for [3H]-hydroxytryptamine, on the basis of their affinity for [3H]-hydroxytryptamine. 5-HTR LA significantly increased in the whole central nervous system (CNS) area of aggressive dogs (frontal cortex P=0.071; hippocampus P=0.0013; thalamus P<0.0001; hypothalamus P=0.0004); 5-HTR HA significantly increased only in the thalamus (P=0.0005) and hypothalamus (P=0.0002). Results suggest the possible role played by the catecholaminergic and serotonergic systems in canine aggressive behaviour. The understanding of the biological basis of canine aggression may enable the development of pharmacological treatments that would target specific neurotransmitter systems.",
