     "AB": "The reelin signaling pathway plays a crucial role during the development of laminated structures in the mammalian brain. Reelin, which is synthesized and secreted by Cajal-Retzius cells in the marginal zone of the neocortex and hippocampus, is proposed to act as a stop signal for migrating neurons. Here we show that a decreased expression of reelin mRNA by hippocampal Cajal-Retzius cells correlates with the extent of migration defects in the dentate gyrus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. These results suggest that reelin is required for normal neuronal lamination in humans, and that deficient reelin expression may be involved in migration defects associated with temporal lobe epilepsy.",
