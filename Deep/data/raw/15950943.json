     "AB": "The Prnd-encoded prion protein (PrP)-like protein, Doppel (Dpl), is a homologue of Prnp-encoded PrP, and is N-glycosylated protein with glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor like PrP. Recently, ectopic expressions of Prnp/Prnd chimeric mRNAs have been identified as the cause of late-onset ataxia observed in several lines of Prnp-knockout mice such as ZrchII, Ngsk, Rcm0, and Rikn mice. However, it remains unclear whether the toxic effect of Dpl expression is a cell-autonomous mechanism but rather reflect a systemic process of heterogeneous cell population in the brain. In this study, the cell-autonomous role of Dpl was estimated by investigating PrP-deficient cells (HpL3-4)-the SV40 large T-antigen immortalized and Rikn Prnp(-/-) mice-derived neuronal cell line expressing Prnp/Prnd chimeric mRNAs. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that serum deprivation did not increase Prnp/Prnd chimeric mRNAs, which in fact was translated into a small amount of Dpl in HpL3-4 cells, whereas serum deprivation induced apoptotic cell death of HpL3-4 cells. Dpl overexpression enhanced apoptotic cell death, whereas the toxic effect of Dpl on apoptotic cell death was neutralized by PrP expression. These results indicate that Dpl elicited dose-dependently toxic effects on PrP-deficient cells without affecting on PrP-expressing cells, suggesting that the PrP-Dpl interaction can regulate cell death in a cell-autonomous manner.",
