     "AB": "Protein kinase C inhibitor was injected intracellularly by iontophoresis into CA1 somata either before or after long-term potentiation in the hippocampal slice preparation. Two different protein kinase C inhibitors, polymyxin B (PMXB) or 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), injected 10 min before long-term potentiation induction caused potentiated responses to return to baseline 15-35 min after induction without significantly affecting the initial magnitude of potentiation. There was no effect on long-term potentiation persistence when H-7 or PMXB was injected intracellularly 5 min after long-term potentiation induction. In contrast, focal extracellular micro-pressure ejection of protein kinase C inhibitor in the stratum radiatum, 15 or 30 min, but not 60 min after long-term potentiation induction caused decay of long-term potentiation to baseline. This is probably a presynaptic action since intracellular inhibitors injected postsynaptically were ineffective 5 min after long-term potentiation induction. Focal application to stratum pyramidale produced a weaker decay than to stratum radiatum suggesting a Schaffer collateral presynaptic terminal site of action. We propose that activation of postsynaptic protein kinase C activity is necessary for long-term potentiation persistence but this activity persists for less than 5 min after induction. Presynaptic protein kinase C activity is also necessary for persistence and is time-limited to less than 60 min. It is attractive to think that these two events are sequentially activated and employ different protein kinase C subtypes differentially localized to presynaptic or postsynaptic elements.",
