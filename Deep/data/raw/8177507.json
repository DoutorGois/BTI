     "AB": "Activation of noradrenergic receptors has been shown to increase expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) gene in brain cells in vitro. The present studies were undertaken to determine if this stimulation was effective in vivo as well. Rats were administered the norepinephrine-releasing drug, yohimbine (YOH), and had their hippocampi assayed for NGF mRNA and protein at various times after the injection. It was found that yohimbine caused a 3-fold increase of NGF mRNA levels at 24 h. Protein levels, however, were unaltered at this time. Thus norepinephrine release in vivo appears to be sufficient for increasing mRNA level but not for translation to protein.",
