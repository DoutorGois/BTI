     "AB": "After scientific successes in the study of synaptic activation and inhibition of motoneurons and unraveling mechanisms underlying presynaptic inhibition, Sir John Eccles was interested in studying synaptic mechanisms governing the activity of neurons in the brain stem, cerebellum, and various cortical areas. In this new arena, his group discovered several principles, which have later been shown to generalize across brain structures and have substantial functional significance. Among these were the first identification and location of inhibitory synapses in the cerebral cortex and recurrent inhibitory systems in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and thalamus.",
