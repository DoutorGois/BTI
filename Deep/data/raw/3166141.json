     "AB": "The studies described here tested the hypothesis that the changes in synaptic efficacy produced by phorbol esters in hippocampal slices are equivalent to the long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation. In contrast to the extremely stable synaptic potentiation induced by electrical stimulation, the facilitatory effects of phorbol 12,13-diacetate and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate were transient: washout of the drugs restored normal responses in approximately 1-2 and 2-4 hr for phorbol diacetate and phorbol dibutyrate, respectively. It is noteworthy that the more liposoluble of the phorbol esters required longer washout periods. Robust LTP still occurred in response to high-frequency stimulation after washout of phorbol esters and to a lesser degree during their application. Treatment of slices with H-7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, did not prevent LTP induction although it significantly affected neuronal excitability and produced effects opposite to those of phorbol esters. Finally, phorbol esters altered responses to repetitive stimulation in a way that could account for the reduced LTP elicited in their presence. These results indicate that the increases in synaptic responses caused by phorbol esters and high-frequency electrical stimulation are quite different and thus do not support the hypothesis that activation of protein kinase C, the presumed target of the phorbol esters, triggers LTP.",
