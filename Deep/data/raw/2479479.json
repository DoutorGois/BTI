     "AB": "Hippocampo-septal fibers, labeled by anterograde degeneration following transection of the fimbriafornix, were found to establish asymmetric synaptic contacts on spines of identified (Golgi-impregnated and gold-toned) multipolar neurons in the dorsolateral nucleus of the septal region. Evidence from the literature suggests that these cells project onto medial septal neurons, which in turn project back to the hippocampal formation. The present study thus establishes a missing link in this circuitry, viz., one group of target cells of the hippocampal fibers.",
