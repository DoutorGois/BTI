     "AB": "Remote memory was investigated in an unselected sample of 26 patients with either unilateral tumours in the temporal lobes or traumatic brain injuries. Six patients underwent excisions within the left temporal lobe, and nine patients were operated on within the right temporal lobe. In both groups, patients with excisions including and sparing the hippocampal formation were studied. Their performance was compared to that of 11 patients with moderate to severe head trauma and to a normative sample of 214 healthy controls. Remote memory was assessed using a famous events test with items of extremely low salience that had been proven to be of low difficulty for those old enough at the time of the event's actuality. The results show severely disturbed retrograde memory functions in the left temporal tumour group. These patients achieved similar scores to patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Right hemispheric patients showed a pattern of results comparable to that of healthy controls. The strongest effects were in the free recall part of the test. In most of the patients, no graded memory loss was observable. No consistent association to recent memory function could be identified. Since most of the remote memory test items used denoted famous names which were cued by rich semantic information, the type of deficit seen may be best understood in terms of a specific dysfunction of the semantic stores containing information about famous proper names.",
