     "AB": "The distribution of 14C-bisphenol A (BPA) in plasma and neuroendocrine organs was determined in Fischer 344 female rats following three oral doses (0.1, 10 or 100mg/kg). Plasma and tissue maximum concentrations (Cmax) were reached within 15-30 min of dosing. Plasma areas-under-the-curve (AUC) ranged from 0.06 to 53.9 microg-h/mL. The AUCs of the pituitary gland and uterus/gonads were 16-21% higher than that of plasma. The AUCs of hypothalamus and the rest of the brain were 43.7% and 77% of the plasma AUCs, respectively. In the brain tissue, the exposure increased linearly with the oral dose, as the dose was increased from 0.1 to 10 and 100 mg/kg; the exposure in the brain relative to the plasma increased by factors of 1, 1.19 and 1.24. This indicates that the brain barrier systems do not limit the access of the lipophilic BPA to the brain. The increases of the uterus/gonads relative to the plasma were 1, 1.07 and 1.04. Tissue partitioning was also examined in vitro by the uptake of 14C-BPA. The BPA tissue/blood partition coefficients were as follows: heart, 7.5; liver, 6.1; kidney, 6.4; fat, 3.6; muscle, 2.6; breast, 3.6; ovaries, 9.1; uterus, 5.9; stomach, 5.1; and small intestine, 6.7. The tissue/cerebrospinal fluid partition coefficients were as follows: pituitary gland, 12.8; brain stem, 6.1; cerebellum, 6.4; hippocampus, 7.1; hypothalamus, 6.1; frontal cortex, 4.9; and caudate nucleus, 6.8.",
