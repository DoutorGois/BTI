     "AB": "Transglutaminase-catalyzed epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine cross-links exist in Alzheimer's disease (AD) paired helical filament (PHF) tau protein but not normal soluble tau. To test the hypothesis that these cross-links could play a role in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), we used single- and double-label immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and immunoaffinity purification and immunoblotting to examine epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine cross-links in AD and control brains. The number of neurons that are immunoreactive with an antibody directed at the epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bond was significantly higher in AD cortex compared with age-matched controls and schizophrenics. PHF tau-directed antibodies AT8, MC-1 and PHF-1 co-localized with epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine immunolabeling in AD NFT. Immunoaffinity purification and immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that PHF tau contains epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds in parietal and frontal cortex in AD. In control cases with NFT present in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, indicative of Braak and Braak stage II, epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds were present in PHF tau in parietal and frontal cortex, despite the lack of microscopically detectable NFT or senile plaques in these cortical regions. The presence of PHF tau with epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds in brain regions devoid of NFT in stage II (but regions, which would be expected to contain NFT in stage III) suggests that these bonds occur early in the formation of NFT.",
