     "AB": "The main histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the extracellular deposition of neuritic amyloid plaques, composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, and the intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles, composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Both traits are emulated in the 3xTg-AD mouse model. Because the relevance of this model in the bibliography and the main role of Abeta in neuronal impairment, here we have detailed the brain Abeta/AbetaPP distribution to subsequently quantify cellular density and intracellular burden for specific neuronal populations in the early stages of the disease. 6E10 immunoreactivity was evident in the deep layers of the cerebral cortex, in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, in the basolateral amygdala nucleus, and in the deep cerebellar nuclei macroneurons; whereas the specific neuronal populations with decreased cellular density were the large pyramidal neurons from the layers V-VI in the cerebral cortex, the pyramidal neurons from the CA2-3 region in the hippocampus, and the large neurons from the basolateral nucleus in the amygdala, apart from the already reported deep cerebellar nuclei. Interestingly, we found a strong correlation between intracellular Abeta/AbetaPP burden and cellular density in all these populations. In addition, behavioral testing showed the functional consequences of such a neuronal depletion. Concretely, anxious-like behavior is manifested in the corner and open-field tests, as well as cognitive functions shown to be impaired in the novel object recognition test and Morris water maze paradigm. To our knowledge, this is the first deep characterization of the specific neuronal populations affected in the 3xTg-AD mouse model.",
