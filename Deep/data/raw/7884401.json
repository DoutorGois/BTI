     "AB": "In 40 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) 56 patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) and 45 patients with vascular dementia (VAD) degree of dementia was rated into mild, moderate and severe according to DSM-III-R and on the GBS scale. Basal cortisol levels were determined and a dexamethasone test (DST) performed. Basal cortisol levels were high in all the dementia groups. Forty percent of AD patients, 54% of SDAT patients and 49% of VAD patients were non suppressors. Significant correlations between post DST cortisol levels and rated variables were seen mainly in the VAD group. The pathological DST could hardly be explained by presence of depression. In dementia, especially those with white matter disturbances, disconnections between cortical areas (hippocampus) and hypothalamus can be assumed explaining a reduced inhibitory tone on hypothalamus. When characterizing VAD patients with pathological DST these patients were significantly more intellectually impaired, showed higher degree of anxiety, restlessness and fear-panic than VAD patients with normal DST. Some behaviourial disturbances in dementia disorders may be a consequence of HPA over activity rather than a consequence of the dementia process itself.",
