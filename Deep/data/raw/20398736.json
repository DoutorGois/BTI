     "AB": "Exercise could play a beneficial role in stress, but its underlying mechanism especially about heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in brain has not been fully clarified. Moreover, few studies have investigated swimming exercise and its effects on the combined stress of both chronic and acute stress. In this study we tried to investigate the role of swimming exercise in combined stress and whether its biological mechanism was related to the HSP70 and iNOS in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. 32 Wistar rats were enrolled and divided into four groups: control, CUMS, labetalol and exercise. After the animal model of chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) was built in the latter three groups, all the rats were given the novel acute stress of inescapable footshock. The behavioral changes were measured by open field test. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) was adopted to test the change of serum corticosterone (CORT). The expression of HSP70 and iNOS in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was analyzed by Western blot. The results demonstrated that swimming exercise could not only improve the behavior changes and protect the function of HPA axis stable in CUMS animals exposed to novel acute stress, but also increase the HSP70 expression and decrease the iNOS expression in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, swimming exercise could play a beneficial role in combined stress by up-regulating HSP70 level and down-regulating iNOS level in brain.",
