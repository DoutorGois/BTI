     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Different anesthesia regimes are commonly used in experimental models of cardiac arrest, but the effects of various anesthetics on clinical outcome parameters are unknown. We conducted a study in which we subjected rats to cardiac arrest under medetomidine/ketamine or sevoflurane/fentanyl anesthesia. METHODS: Asystolic cardiac arrest for 8 minutes was induced in 73 rats with a mixture of potassium chloride and esmolol. Daily behavioral and neurological examination included the open field test (OFT), the tape removal test (TRT) and a neurodeficit score (NDS). Animals were randomized for sacrifice on day 2 or day 5 and brains were harvested for histology in the hippocampus cornus ammonis segment CA1. The inflammatory markers IL-6, TNF-alpha, MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha were assessed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Proportions of survival were tested with the Fisher's exact test, repeated measurements were assessed with the Friedman's test; the baseline values were tested using Mann-Whitney U test and the difference of results of repeated measures were compared. RESULTS: In 31 animals that survived beyond 24 hours neither OFT, TRT nor NDS differed between the groups; histology was similar on day 2. On day 5, significantly more apoptosis in the CA1 segment of the hippocampus was found in the sevoflurane/fentanyl group. MCP-1 was higher on day 5 in the sevoflurane/fentanyl group (p = 0.04). All other cyto- and chemokines were below detection threshold. CONCLUSION: In our cardiac arrest model neurological function was not influenced by different anesthetic regimes; in contrast, anesthesia with sevoflurane/fentanyl results in increased CSF inflammation and histologic damage at day 5 post cardiac arrest.",
