     "AB": "The ability of hippocampal CA1 basal synapses to express N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-independent long-term potentiation (non-NMDA LTP) was studied and compared to the simultaneously induced apical dendritic non-NMDA LTP. Non-NMDA LTP in basal and apical dendrites was induced using stimulation pattern similar to the sharp wave-associated CA3 bursts. Basal dendritic non-NMDA LTP was input-specific and displayed similar development and magnitude to the apical dendritic non-NMDA LTP. Both apical and basal dendritic non-NMDA potentiations were inhibited by the voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) inhibitor verapamil and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and levandustin A. However, the difference in the degree and time course of these inhibitions suggests involvement of distinct mechanisms in the two dendritic subfields.",
