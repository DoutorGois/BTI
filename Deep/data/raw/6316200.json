     "AB": "In order to identify the specific targets of the septohippocampal projection in the rat, horseradish peroxidase localization at the electron microscopic level was used. Following injections of free horseradish peroxidase into the medial septum, sections of the dorsal hippocampal formation were reacted with diaminobenzidine and processed for electron microscopy by routine methods. Sections were viewed unstained. Horseradish peroxidase labeling in the dentate gyrus was predominantly in the supra- and infragranular layers. All postsynaptic elements were neuronal. They included granule cell somata and somata and dendrites of hilar cells; these may include pyramidal basket cells. No synaptic contacts with vascular or glial elements were found. These results provide a basis for comparing the specific targets of the septohippocampal projection with those of the sympathohippocampal pathway, which innervates the dentate following lesions of the septohippocampal projection.",
