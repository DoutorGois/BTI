     "AB": "A study was made of 3H-leucine incorporation into water- and tween-soluble proteins of the hippocampal CA3 field under the development of prolonged post-tetanic potentiation (PPTP) because of stimulation of mossy fibers. The mixture of supernatant proteins was assayed by ion-exchange microchromatography while each fraction was evaluated for the radioactive label incorporation. In the course of the assay of the chromatograms obtained, no significant alterations in the protein spectrum were found during the development of the PPTP. Substantial changes were identified in the rate of the labeled leucine incorporation in the acid part of the spectrum represented by acid proteins and polypeptides including brain specific ones. It is assumed that the development of the PPTP in the hippocampal pyramids is associated with activation of the proteins under consideration.",
