     "AB": "Immunocytochemical techniques were used to localize cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8)-like immunoreactivity in the hippocampal formation of the guinea pig. As in the rat, CCK immunoreactive perikarya are most dense in and around the stratum pyramidale, within the superficial cell layer of the subiculum, and within the polymorph zone of the hilus. Immunoreactive axons are observed within and loosely surrounding the stratum pyramidale, within the stratum lacunosum moleculare, and diffusely distributed across the subiculum. In contrast to the rat, the mossy fiber system also exhibited significant CCK immunoreactivity. The latter system has previously been demonstrated to contain enkephalin-like immunoreactivity in the guinea pig. The present results suggest, therefore, that the enkephalin-like and CCK-like substances either coexist within the mossy fiber boutons or are present within separate subpopulations of the mossy fibers.",
