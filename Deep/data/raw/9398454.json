     "PG": "110-23",
     "AB": "Systemically administered kainate (10 mg.kg-1) caused neuronal loss in both the hippocampus and the entorhinal regions of the rat brain. This resulted in a loss of 68.3 +/- 13.8 and 53.3 +/- 12.8% of pyramidal neurones in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3a regions, respectively. Chlormethiazole attenuated the loss of neurones in the hippocampal cell layers CA1 (cell loss 10 +/- 3.2%) and CA3a (cell loss 10 +/- 7.7%). The neuroprotective activity of chlormethiazole was apparent in the presence or absence of a low dose of clonazepam (200 micrograms.kg-1 i.p.). The kainate-induced damage could also be measured by the increase in binding of the peripheral benzodiazepine ligand ([3H]PK11195) in the hippocampus. In kainate-treated rats there was a 350-500% increase in binding indicative of reactive gliosis. Chlormethiazole prevented this elevation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with an ED50 of 10.64 mg.kg-1 and an effective therapeutic window from 1 to 4 h posttreatment. Dizocilpine also attenuated damage significantly. The GABAA agonist muscimol was also able to attenuate the increase in [3H]PK11195 binding in a dose-dependent manner, with an ED50 of approximately 0.1 mg.kg-1. If muscimol, dizocilpine, or the adenosine A1 receptor agonist R-N6-phenylisopropyl-adenosine were administered together with chlormethiazole at their respective ED25 doses, a potentiation was apparent in the degree of neuroprotection. It is concluded that the combination of neuroprotective agents with different mechanisms of action can lead to a synergistic protection against excitotoxicity.",
