     "AB": "In elderly people, vascular alterations and degenerative alterations of the Central Nervous System (CNS) are two of the most common reasons for illness and death. Lipid pattern modifications and menopause in women are some of the causes for the appearance of these alterations. Vascular endothelium is in part responsible for vascular homeostasis, through the production of several vasoactive factors. Growth hormone (GH) exerts effects on the CNS and on the vascular endothelium, since GH deficient subjects exhibit endothelium-dependent alterations, which recover under substitutive GH treatment. Growth hormone has important actions on lipid metabolism that also play a role on vascular and endothelial function. Moreover, cardiac function improves when GH is associated to angiotensin II receptor blockers. Elderly people exhibit a physiological GH deficiency that could affect their vascular and cerebral functions. A study was carried out using old Wistar rats to clarify the effects of GH on the vessels under chronic \"in vivo\" conditions. The response to various vasoactive substances in aortic rings has been evaluated. An increase in the aortic media thickness was seen in old rats, which showed also a reduction in the vasodilator response to isoprenaline as compared to young animals. GH treatment partially restored the vasodilator response and reduced media thickness. Neuronal population was reduced in the hypocampus of old rats as compared to young ones and GH treatment was able to significantly enhance the number. Neurotransmitters were measured in several cerebral areas to establish differences between young and old GH-treated or untreated animals. Glutamine, Arginine and Aspartate were reduced in old animals whereas Citruline was increased. GH treatment restored in all cases the levels corresponding to young rats.",
