     "AB": "Dopaminergic blocking agents have been known to suppress intracranial self-stimulation, but whether the suppression results from a reduction in the rewarding value of stimulation or from motor deficits has remained controversial. We have resolved this controversy by developing an operant technique minimally dependent on motor activity: Rats were trained to perform a bar-holding response for 3s or to produce hippocampal theta waves for 3s when the bar was retracted. Decamethonium bromide (a muscle relaxant) reduced bar holding without affecting theta production for brain stimulation. Pimozide (a dopaminergic blocking-agent) reduced both bar holding and theta production for stimulation, though rats were still capable of making the theta response at a rate comparable to the preinjection rate. Dopaminergic blocking at low doses reduces the rewarding value of brain stimulation at the level of the lateral hypothalamus. The method described in this report has wide applicability.",
