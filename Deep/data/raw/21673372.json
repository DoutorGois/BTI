     "AB": "In this study we investigated the potential neuroprotective effect of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) on the hippocampus in the transient vessel occlusion ischemia model in the Mongolian gerbil. The morphological and biochemical studies were performed at 7 days after occlusion of carotid arteries. The acute reduction of NeuN-positive neurons in the CA1 pyramidal layer of the hippocampus was accompanied by increased staining intensity for GFAP-positive astrocytes, indicative of glial reaction. The neuron death in the CA1 area coincided with a strong 2.4 fold decrease in the membrane forms of neuronal cell adhesion molecules and elevated levels of astrocyte-specific proteins (soluble GFAP to 2,6 times; filament GFAP to 1,5 times; calcium-binding protein S-100b to 1,6 times). Treatment with 2-oxoglutarate (2.28 g/l drinking water) for between 7 and 21 days attenuated the neuronal death and reactive astrogliosis in this model of experimental ischemia by 20-50%. Our results suggest that 2-OG may prevent the disturbances of neural cells that usually take place during ischemic pathology.",
