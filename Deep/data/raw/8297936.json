     "AB": "It is argued that, in addition to investigations of life span parameters, a large number of biomedically important phenotypes can be profitably studied from a gerontological perspective. These would include \"private\" patterns of aging, especially in our own species, which exhibits extraordinary genetic heterogeneity. These, as well as a number of relatively common age-associated phenotypes, have been comparatively neglected by the gerontological community, and therefore warrant the designation as \"orphan\" phenotypes. From a tabulation of examples from each of the major body systems, five are elaborated upon: \"hyperhippocampals,\" defined as individuals with intrinsically enhanced functional reserve in relevant neural circuitry; patients with a heterogeneous set of pathologies collectively referred to as \"normal pressure hydrocephalus\"; patients with late life activation of herpes zoster; individuals with unusually early onset of loss of olfactory function; and geriatric subjects with unusual sensitivity to \"jet lag.\"",
