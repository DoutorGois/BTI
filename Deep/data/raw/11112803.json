     "AB": "This study compared a fornix cross-sectional-area measurement and hippocampal volume in 86 traumatic brain injury (TBI) subjects with 46 normal controls. The TBI group showed a significant reduction in fornix area and hippocampal volume. It was also shown that initial injury severity was related to the degree of atrophy in both structures. Although fornix size and hippocampal volume correlated, such a modest correlation between these two structures suggests differential and potentially independent mechanisms of injury. The General Memory Index score from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised was shown to be significantly correlated with hippocampal volume following TBI.",
