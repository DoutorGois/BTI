     "AB": "It has been reported that delayed neuronal death (DND) in the hippocampus following transient forebrain ischemia is associated with internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, indicating apoptosis. This suggests that the process of DND is energy dependent. Transient severe forebrain ischemia was induced in Mongolian gerbils by bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries. Post-ischemic administration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a glucose antimetabolite, markedly reduced the occurrence of ischemia-induced DNA fragmentation and DND in the hippocampus. These results suggest that the reduction of energy dependent metabolism after ischemia may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for preserving hippocampal neurons vulnerable to ischemia.",
