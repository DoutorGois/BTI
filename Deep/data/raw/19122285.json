     "AB": "In this study we elucidated the effects of berberine, a major alkaloid component contained in medicinal herbs, such as Phellodendri Cortex and Coptidis Rhizoma, on ischemic neuronal damage in mouse organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) caused by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -type glutamate receptor stimulation. Hippocampal slices obtained from 7-d-old ICR mice were cultured for 10 d before the experiments. Ischemia-related damage was induced by OGD (5, 15, 45 min) or NMDA (10 microM) treatment, and was evaluated by measuring propidium iodide (PI) uptake. Levels of apoptotic marker proteins, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and phosphorylated-Bcl-2 (p-Bcl-2), in the OHSCs were measured as indices of biochemical neuronal cell damage by Western blotting. Berberine (5, 25 microM) or the NMDA antagonist MK-801 (25 microM) was added to the medium 30 min before OGD or NMDA treatment. OGD time-dependently increased PI uptake of the OHSCs. Both berberine (5, 25 microM) and MK-801 (25 microM) significantly inhibited PI uptake at 24 h after 45-min OGD treatment and PI uptake in OHSCs exposed to NMDA for 24 h. OGD treatment also significantly increased the level of p-Bcl-2 but not that of Bcl-2 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in OHSCs. Berberine (5-25 microM) significantly suppressed the OGD-induced increase of p-Bcl-2 level in OHSCs when tissue was exposed to the alkaloid prior to OGD or simultaneously with OGD. These findings suggest that berberine has protective effects against ischemic damage in mouse OHSCs and that the effects are at least partly mediated by suppression of Bcl-2 phosphorylation.",
