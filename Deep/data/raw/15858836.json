     "AB": "A role for kinin B1 receptors was suggested in the spinal cord and peripheral organs of streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats. The present study aims at determining whether B1 receptors are also induced and over-expressed in the brain of STZ-rats at 2, 7, and 21 days post-treatment. This was addressed by in situ hybridization using the [35S]-UTPalphaS-labeled riboprobe and by in vitro autoradiography with the radioligand [125I]-HPP-des-Arg10-Hoe 140. In control rats, B1 receptor mRNA was found widely distributed in many brain regions. Low mRNA levels were found in thalamus and hypothalamus (7-12 nCi/g) while high mRNA signals were detected in cortical regions and hippocampus (18-29 nCi/g). In diabetic rats, B1 receptor mRNA was markedly increased in hippocampus, temporal/parietal cortices and amygdala at 2 and 7 days (+88 to +150%). Low densities of B1 receptor binding sites were detected in all analyzed regions in control rats (0.18-0.37 fmol/mg tissue). In diabetic rats, B1 receptor binding sites were significantly increased in hippocampus, amygdala, temporal/parietal, and perhinal/piriform cortices (+ 55 to + 165 %) at 7 days only. Results highlight an early but transient and reversible up-regulation of B1 receptors in specific brain regions of STZ-diabetic rats. This may offer the advantage of reducing putative central side effects with B1 receptor antagonists if used for the treatment of diabetic complications in the periphery.",
