     "AB": "In Wistar rats susceptible to audiogenic seizures (Wistar AS) inbred in our laboratory, the exposure to an intense sound induces an epileptic seizure characterized by a running episode followed by a tonic phase showing the major involvement of brainstem structures. After 10-20 sound-induced seizures, development of facial and forelimb clonus and/or tonic-clonic seizures characterize the generalization from brainstem to the forebrain as a result of seizure repetition. In order to specify the anatomical substrates of repeated audiogenic seizures in Wistar AS, we used the 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) technique over a 5 min period to map the midbrain and forebrain structures activated by audiogenic seizures before and after seizure repetition. In naive Wistar AS, six of the 22 structures showed a significant 20-56% increase in relative optical densities compared to non-epileptic controls; these were central and medial amygdala nuclei, perirhinal cortex, medial septum, subthalamic and caudate nuclei. In kindled Wistar AS, 12 additional structures showed a significant 16-121% increase in 2DG labeling. These structures were the substantia nigra, all layers of the hippocampus, the basolateral amygdala, three thalamic nuclei, the frontal motor and prefrontal cortices. In conclusion, the metabolic activation of midbrain and forebrain areas in kindled versus naive Wistar AS rats reflects the changes in the nature of the seizures and the involvement of these structures in the spread of seizure activity from the brainstem to the forebrain during seizure repetition.",
