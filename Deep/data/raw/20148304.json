     "AB": "Despite reduction in environmental lead, chronic lead exposure still possess a public health hazard, particularly in children, with devastating effects on developing CNS. To investigate the mechanism of this neurotoxicity, young and adult rats were used to study whether exposure to 500 ppm concentrations of lead could induce apoptosis in hippocampus. 2-4 and 12-14-week-old rats received lead acetate in concentration of 500 ppm for 40 days. Control animals received deionized distilled water. In lead-treated groups, the blood lead levels were increased by 3-4 folds. Light and electron microscopical study of hippocampus revealed increased apoptotic cells. Western blot analysis of Bax and Bcl-2 (pro- and anti-apoptotic gene products, respectively) indicated higher expression of Bax protein and no significant change in bcl-2 expression and accordingly increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio compared to control group, confirming the histological study. In conclusion, these data suggest that neurotoxicity of chronic lead exposure in hippocampus in vivo may partly be due to facilitation of apoptosis.",
