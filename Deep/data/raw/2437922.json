     "AB": "The interaction of various neuropeptides with calcium antagonist binding was investigated in rat hippocampus. Among the peptides examined Substance P selectively increased the binding of phenylalkylamine and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists; this action was receptor mediated. No effect was observed with Substance P in other brain areas and with neurotensin and met-enkephalin in all the areas examined. The modification in calcium antagonist binding is functionally paralleled by an area specific increase in voltage-dependent calcium uptake. These data suggest that in hippocampus Substance P may be an endogenous regulator of voltage sensitive calcium channels.",
