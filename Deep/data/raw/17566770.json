     "AB": "For patients with refractory epilepsy it is important to search for alternative treatments. One of these potential treatments could be introducing new cells or modulating endogenous neurogenesis to reconstruct damaged epileptic circuits or to bring neurotransmitter function back into balance. In this review the scientific basis of these cell therapy strategies is discussed and the results are critically evaluated. Research on cell transplantation strategies has mainly been performed in animal models for temporal lobe epilepsy, in which seizure foci or seizure propagation pathways are targeted. Promising results have been obtained, although there remains a lot of debate about the relevance of the animal models, the appropriate target for transplantation, the suitable cell source and the proper time point for transplantation. From the presented studies it should be evident that transplanted cells can survive and sometimes even integrate in an epileptic brain and in a brain that is subjected to epileptogenic interventions. There is evidence that transplanted cells can partially restore damaged structures and/or release substances that modulate existent or induced hyperexcitability. Even though several studies show encouraging results, more studies need to be done in animal models with spontaneous seizures in order to have a better comparison to the human situation.",
