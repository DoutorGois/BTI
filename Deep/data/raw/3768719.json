     "AB": "Cats were stimulated in the lateral amygdala with low-frequency square-wave pulses. All subjects were kindled until generalized convulsion occurred. During the kindling process, a prolongation of the interpulse interval and a reduction of the number of pulses required for the provocation of afterdischarges were observed. We refer to this phenomenon as the 'saving-effect' of stimulating pulses to provoke afterdischarges.",
