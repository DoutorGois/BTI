     "AB": "1. The effects of intravenous injections of procaine HCl on population cellular activity in limbic tissue and overlying cortex, and on transmission of evoked activity between limbic structures was investigated in awake cats. Clear dose-related increases in cellular activity were seen in amygdala and ventral hippocampus. Changes in cellular activity in the nucleus accumbens and temporal neocortex were also dose-related, but in a complex time-dependent manner. Changes in ventromedial hypothalamus only appeared at the second highest dose of procaine. 2. Procaine facilitated transmission of evoked excitatory activity from the amygdala to the ventromedial hypothalamus, but only after a considerable delay from the time of injection. On the other hand, procaine had no effect on activity evoked in the ventral hippocampus, nucleus accumbens or temporal cortex by amygdala stimulation. 3. It was concluded that intravenous procaine functions as an excitant of limbic system cells, and that procaine alters synaptic transmission in some, but not all, output pathways from the amygdala. The neuroexcitant effects of procaine appear to be idiosyncratic, however, varying over dose with limbic and cortical area examined.",
