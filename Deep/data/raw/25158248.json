     "AB": "The amyloid C-terminal fragment (betaCTF) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is the cleaved component of APP by beta secretase-1 (BACE1), which shows similar neurotoxicity as amyloid beta (Abeta) in many ways. Evidence suggested that in addition to Abeta, betaCTF might also participate in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, the relationship between betaCTF processing and hyperphosphorylated tau has attracted increasing research attention. In this study, we established an animal model of tau hyperphosphorylation with okadaic acid (OA) treatment, and analyzed betaCTF processing in vivo. The betaCTF level was found to increase in neurons, which was most likely caused by the induction of OA and BACE1 overexpression. Furthermore, these results provide the first evidence that betaCTF can predominately accumulate in the axons of neurons in a hyperphosphorylated tau state in vivo, and suggested that the redistribution of betaCTF is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. These results indicate that BACE1 could be a therapeutic target of AD by affecting the processing of betaCTF.",
