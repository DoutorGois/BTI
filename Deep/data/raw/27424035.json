     "AB": "Environmental enrichment (EE) is a typical experimental method that promotes levels of novelty and complexity that enhance experience-dependent neuroplasticity and cognitive behavior function in laboratory animals. Early EE is associated with resilience in the face of later-life challenges. Since increased synaptic activity enhances endogenous neuronal antioxidant defenses, we hypothesized that long-term EE beginning at an early stage may alter the levels of oxidative stress. We investigated global protein expression and oxidative stress in hippocampal proteins from rats nurtured for a 6-month EE beginning in the prenatal period. The analysis of protein expression was carried out using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis with matrix-associated laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Proteins with altered expression were involved in energy metabolism (phosphoglycerate mutase 1, alpha-enolase isoform 1, adenylate kinase 1, and triose phosphate isomerase) and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase 1, glutathione S-transferase omega type 1, peroxiredoxin 5, DJ-1, and glial maturation factor beta). Using Western blot assays, some of the proteins with altered expression and NADPH oxidase 2 were confirmed to be decreased. Further confirmation was demonstrated with attenuated expression of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-deoxyguanine, a DNA oxidative stress marker, in the hippocampus of EE group rats. Our data demonstrate that a long-term EE program beginning in the prenatal and early postnatal phase of development modulates energy metabolism and reduced oxidant stress possibly through enhanced synaptic activity. We provide evidence that EE can be developed as a tool to protect the brain from oxidative stress-induced injury.",
