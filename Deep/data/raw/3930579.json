     "AB": "The ascending projections of the mammillary region of the hypothalamus and adjacent posterolateral hypothalamus were investigated by autoradiographic and horseradish peroxidase histochemical techniques. Analysis of the anterograde data revealed that the main contingent of mammillary fibers ascends in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) in the lateral hypothalamic area. These fibers distribute to a number of telencephalic regions via three pathways. (1) Fibers course dorsomedially into the medial and lateral parts of the septum and continue into the hippocampus with a dense terminal field in the parahippocampal area. (2) Laterally coursing fibers project to area corticoidea dorsolateralis, area temporo-parieto-occipitalis, cortex piriformis, and the posterior part of archistriatum. (3) The fibers remaining in the MFB ascend into the \"ventral paleostriatum,\" olfactory tubercle, and into the lateral and ventral borders of the rostral portion of lobus parolfactorius (LPO). Numerous fibers leave the LPO region and course dorsally into the deep layer of the Wulst, hyperstriatum dorsale (HD). Many fibers continue dorsolaterally through the HD and enter an unnamed region of the dorsolateral telencephalon (lateral to the vallecula) at the level of the olfactory bulb. Retrograde transport experiments revealed that the perikarya of origin-of-fiber projections to the parahippocampal area and to the rostral, dorsolateral telencephalon reside not only in nucleus mammillaris lateralis but also in posterolateral hypothalamic cells rostral and dorsal to this nucleus. The projection of these hypothalamic cells to the hippocampal formation and many other telencephalic regions in birds suggests that these cells are similar to the mammalian supramammillary nucleus and posterolateral hypothalamus rather than the mammillary nuclei.",
