     "AB": "We compared regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) of CBF-SPECT brain imaging in two brain perfusion agents, N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) and 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime (99mTc-HMPAO), in the same patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. In eight healthy volunteers and 16 patients with chronic stage of cerebral infarction, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) data was normalized to the count density of the tracer in the whole brain, and then converted to the absolute units of CBF by multiplying average 133Xe-CBF in the whole-brain. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), grouped by the affected and contra lateral hemispheres of patients and right and left hemispheres of normal volunteers, was used to assess the changes in pattern of regional CBF (rCBF) among disease and control groups. Regional CBF was significantly reduced in patients compared with normal controls in all the brain regions on both tracers: F = 6.6-14 and p = 9.1 x 10(-4) - 1.6 x 10(-6) in IMP, and F = 5.8-14.8 and p = 2 x 10(-3) - 8.2 x 10(-7) in HMPAO. F value was higher in IMP than that of HMPAO in five of nine brain regions of interests (the frontal, temporal and occipital cortices, thalamus and the striatum), whereas F value was higher in HMPAO than IMP in the other four regions (the central lobule, parietal cortex, hippocampus and the centrum semiovale).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
