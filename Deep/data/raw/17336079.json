     "AB": "\"Brain tolerance\"--a phenomenon in which a subtoxic challenge confers resistance to subsequent brain injuries--provides an ideal opportunity for investigating endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms. We investigated the potential role of the polysialylated (PSA) form of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), which is thought to play a key role in plasticity. In a model where prior exposure to heat shock protects against kainate-induced cell damage in the hippocampus, we show that hyperthermia upregulates PSA-NCAM expression for at least 1 week, without affecting neurogenesis. Pharmacological manipulation of heat shock protein (HSP) expression demonstrates a tight positive link between HSP70 and PSA-NCAM. Finally, the presence of PSA was functionally linked to brain tolerance, as protection against kainate-induced cell death by heat shock pre-exposure was abolished in the absence of NCAM polysialylation. The upregulation of PSA-NCAM by hyperthermia may have a significant impact on hippocampal plasticity, permitting induction of the complex molecular cascade responsible for neuroprotection.",
