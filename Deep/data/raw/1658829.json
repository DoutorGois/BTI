     "AB": "It was investigated in rats whether hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) influences working and/or reference memory processing in the radial maze. After preliminary training to an intermediate level of performance, experimental subjects received a series of high-frequency trains of electrical pulses applied to the right perforant path. Two control groups were adopted in order to control for possible effects of stimulation plus operation, and operation alone, respectively. Twenty-four hours after the experimental treatment, animals were administered one trial of radial maze training. This sequence of hippocampal stimulation and radial maze training was replicated 15 times. After a retention interval of 2 months, one radial maze trial was presented on each of 3 consecutive days. The analysis of field potential data showed that periodic LTP stimulation produced a state of hippocampal LTP confined to the initial portion of the acquisition phase. Evaluation of radial maze data revealed a marginal improvement of working memory performance in the experimental group during the rising phase of hippocampal LTP.",
