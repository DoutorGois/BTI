     "AB": "GABAergic neurons in different fields of the hippocampus and pyriform cortex were examined 2 weeks and 1 month after electric stimulation of the ventral hippocampus. The counts of GABAergic neurons in the studied structures decreased significantly. The most pronounced shifts in the pyriform cortex were found in the central compartment. Decreased number of inhibitory elements in the two major epileptogenic structures attests to appreciable restructuring in the functions of their neuronal circles.",
