     "AB": "Extensive evidence from contextual fear conditioning experiments suggests that the hippocampus is involved in processing memory for contextual information. Evidence also suggests that the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) may be selectively involved in memory for nociceptive stimulation. In contrast, many findings indicate that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is more broadly involved in modulating the consolidation of different kinds of information. To investigate further the differential involvement of these brain regions in memory consolidation, the present experiments used a modified inhibitory avoidance training procedure that took place on 2 sequential days to separate context training from footshock training. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with unilateral cannulae aimed at the (i) hippocampus, (ii) rACC, or (iii) BLA, and given infusions of the muscarinic cholinergic agonist oxotremorine (OXO) immediately after either context training (day 1) or footshock training in that context (day 2). OXO enhanced retention when infused into the hippocampus after context, but not footshock, training. Conversely, OXO infusions enhanced memory when administered into the rACC immediately after footshock, but not context, training. Lastly, intra-BLA OXO infusions enhanced retention when administered after either context or footshock training. These findings are consistent with evidence that the hippocampus and rACC play selective roles in memory for specific components of training experiences. Additionally, they provide further evidence that the BLA is more liberally involved in modulating memory consolidation for various aspects of emotionally arousing experiences.",
