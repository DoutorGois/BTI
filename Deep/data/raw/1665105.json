     "AB": "The distribution of neurons expressing the calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin (CN) was characterized in developing and adult rat brain using a combination of immunocytochemical, immunoblot and in situ hybridization approaches. Immunoblot analysis revealed a strong increase postnatally in CN protein expression. Four differently-charged isoforms of CN were observed in adult brain with apparent regional differences in isoform expression. Immunocytochemistry showed highest levels of CN in hippocampus, striatum, substantia nigra, amygdala and septal nuclei with immunoreactivity first appearing in striatum and septal nuclei, followed by hippocampus, neocortex and limbic structures. In situ hybridization demonstrated that mRNA for the catalytic subunit of CN was seen as early as postnatal day (PND) 1 in striatum, cortex and hippocampus. Since immunoreactivity was not detectable until day 4, this suggests that mRNA expression may precede that of protein by several days in these regions. Lesioning of developing and adult nigrostriatal dopamine neurons either with 6-hydroxydopamine or by surgical hemitransection had little effect on expression of CN, suggesting that CN expression is not influenced transsynaptically by dopamine. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that CN protein and mRNA expression are subject to regional and temporal control during brain development suggesting that specific synaptic connections may influence CN gene expression. However, in striatum, dopaminergic innervation does not appear to affect CN levels.",
