     "AB": "Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) has well characterized effects on memory and cognitive performances. Recently we have reported that repetitive administration of DHEAS lowers the threshold pulse number in inducing activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in rat hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, in which a sub-threshold high frequency stimulation (HFS, 30 pulses at 100 Hz) for normal rats could induce robust LTP in DHEAS-treated rats (Chen et al., 2006). Here we report that the sub-threshold HFS could trigger the phosphorylation of Src and ERK2 in the DHEAS-treated rats, but not in control rats. We found in slices obtained from the DHEAS-treated rats that NMDA-induced intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]i) transients in CA1 pyramidal neurons were significantly potentiated, which was essential for the Src and ERK2 phosphorylations. The activation of ERK2, a downstream factor of Src family kinase, was required for the DHEAS-facilitated LTP. The Src family kinase inhibitor PP2, but not its inactive homologue PP3, attenuated the NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i increase and abolished the DHEAS-facilitated LTP. These findings suggest that the chronic administration of DHEAS brings the NMDA receptor (NMDAr) to a potentiated state that causes an enough level of [Ca2+]i increase for LTP induction even by the sub-threshold HFS. The potentiated [Ca2+]i transient by the sub-threshold HFS may trigger the Src phosphorylation that will further potentiate NMDAr followed by an activation of ERK2 and LTP induction. This novel postsynaptic NMDAr/Src-mediated signal amplification through \"NMDAr-Ca2+-->Src-->NMDAr-Ca2+\" cycle may play a pivotal role in the DHEAS-facilitated LTP induction.",
