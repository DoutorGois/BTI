     "AB": "The aim of the present study was to identify potential biomarkers for depression in the search for novel disease targets and treatment regimens. Furthermore, the study includes a search for biomarkers involved in treatment resistance and stress resilience in order to investigate mechanisms underlying antidepressant drug refraction and stress-coping strategies. Depression-related transcriptomic changes in gene expression profiles were investigated in laser-captured microdissected (LCM) rat hippocampal granular cell layers (GCL) using the chronic mild stress (CMS) rat model of depression and chronic administration of two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), escitalopram and sertraline. CMS rats were segregated into diverging groups according to behavioral readouts, and under stringent constraints, the associated differential gene regulations were analyzed. Accordingly, we identified four genes associated with recovery, two genes implicated in treatment resistance, and three genes involved in stress resilience. The identified genes associated with mechanisms of cellular plasticity, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and synaptic release. Hierarchical clustering analysis confirmed the subgroup segregation pattern in the CMS model. Thus antidepressant treatment refractors cluster with anhedonic-like rats, and, interestingly, stress-resilient rats cluster with rats undergoing antidepressant-mediated recovery from anhedonia, suggesting antidepressant mechanisms of action to emulate endogenous stress-coping strategies.",
