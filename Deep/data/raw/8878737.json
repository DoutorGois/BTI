     "AB": "The authors examine the potential role of the different sources of dendritic Ca2+ influx in long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic efficacy. Recent data on the location and functional distribution of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels obtained from fluorescence imaging and patch clamp experiments are presented. This is followed by a discussion of the existing evidence for different sources of Ca2+ playing a role in the induction of LTD. The authors conclude that a number of key issues need to be resolved before any conclusions are drawn as to the involvement of any specific route of Ca2+ entry in LTD.",
