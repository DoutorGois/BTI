     "AB": "Vasopressin is known to mediate its action on the kidney through increasing the concentrations of cyclic AMP. As vasopressin is widely distributed in many extra hypothalamic areas of the brain and can be shown to act centrally, we have investigated the effect of vasopressin on cyclic AMP levels in homogenates of the striatal and locus coeruleus areas. In contrast with the effect obtained on the kidney, vasopressin did not stimulate adenyl cyclase activity in rat brain homogenates in a dose-related manner. The stimulation of cyclic AMP observed with dopamine or noradrenaline in these brain areas and the hippocampus was not affected by the presence of vasopressin. These observations suggest that the action of vasopressin on the brain is not mediated through cyclic AMP.",
