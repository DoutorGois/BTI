     "AB": "A larger number of discrete patches of active glycogen phosphorylase (alpha GP) were found in the molecular layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus in rats sacrificed during the daily dark phase (mean = 28.7/section) than during the light phase (mean = 7.8/section). Light-dark differences in the patterns of alpha GP may reflect circadian differences in metabolic demand in the hippocampus. Patch sizes were consistent with increased activation of single astrocytes or perisynaptic astrocyte clusters by focal input at night.",
