     "AB": "Hippocampus has been implicated in participating in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, the functional and anatomical connectivities between hippocampus and other regions are rarely concurrently investigated in schizophrenia. In the present study, both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during rest and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed on 17 patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 14 healthy subjects. Resting-state functional connectivities of the bilateral hippocampi were separately analyzed by selecting the anterior hippocampus as region of interest. The fornix body was reconstructed by diffusion tensor tractography, and the integrity of this tract was evaluated using fractional anisotropy (FA). In patients with schizophrenia, the bilateral hippocampi showed reduced functional connectivities to some regions which have been reported to be involved in episodic memory, such as posterior cingulate cortex, extrastriate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and parahippocampus gyrus. We speculated that these reduced connectivity may reflect the disconnectivity within a neural network related to the anterior hippocampus in schizophrenia. Meanwhile the mean FA of the fornix body was significantly reduced in patients, indicating the damage in the hippocampal anatomical connectivity in schizophrenia. The concurrence of the functional disconnectivity and damaged anatomical connectivity between the hippocampus and other regions in schizophrenia suggest that the functional-anatomical relationship need to be further investigated.",
