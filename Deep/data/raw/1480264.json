     "AB": "The informativeness of the high-frequency EEG for the assessment of the functional state of the brain has been proven by means of a new method of analysis of the EEG which is suitable, by contrast with the traditional spectral correlation analysis, for the description of nonlinear processes. Evidence has been obtained in favor of the hypothesis that a deterministic chaotic component, the parameters of which depend on the region of recording of the EEG and which changes conjointly with change in the functional state of the brain, is present in the EEG of the neocortex and hippocampus of the rabbit.",
