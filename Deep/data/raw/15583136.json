     "AB": "Alterations in hippocampal neuronal Ca(2+) and Ca(2+)-dependent systems have been implicated in mediating some of the long-term neuroplasticity changes associated with acquired epilepsy (AE). However, there are no studies in an animal model of AE that directly evaluate alterations in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and Ca(2+) homeostatic mechanisms (Ca(2+) dynamics) during the development of AE. In this study, Ca(2+) dynamics were evaluated in acutely isolated rat CA1 hippocampal, frontal, and occipital neurons in the pilocarpine model by using [Ca(2+)](i) imaging fluorescence microscopy during the injury (acute), epileptogenesis (latency), and chronic-epilepsy phases of the development of AE. Immediately after status epilepticus (SE), hippocampal neurons, but not frontal and occipital neurons, had significantly elevated [Ca(2+)](i) compared with saline-injected control animals. Hippocampal neuronal [Ca(2+)](i) remained markedly elevated during epileptogenesis and was still elevated indefinitely in the chronic-epilepsy phase but was not elevated in SE animals that did not develop AE. Inhibiting the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) during SE with the NMDA channel inhibitor MK801 was associated in all three phases of AE with inhibition of the changes in Ca(2+) dynamics and the development of AE. Ca(2+) homeostatic mechanisms in hippocampal neurons also were altered in the brain-injury, epileptogenesis, and chronic-epilepsy phases of AE. These results provide evidence that [Ca(2+)](i) and Ca(2+)-homeostatic mechanisms are significantly altered during the development of AE and suggest that altered Ca(2+) dynamics may play a role in the induction and maintenance of AE and underlie some of the neuroplasticity changes associated with the epileptic phenotype.",
