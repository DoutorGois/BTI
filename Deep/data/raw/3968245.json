     "AB": "The organization of thalamic projections in the nucleus accumbens (NA) and the caudate nucleus of cats and its relation to other subcortical striatal afferents were studied with a retrograde tracing technique by use of lectin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase. The study showed that the paraventricular and medial parafascicular nuclei (PF) of the thalamus project to the medial NA and the parataenial and medial PF project to the lateral NA. The ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars dorsalis (SNpd) project to medial and lateral NA. The midline thalamic nuclei, rostral intralaminar nuclei, ventroanterior nucleus, medial and lateral PF, lateral posterior complex, and nucleus limitans project to medial caudate nucleus. The most medial substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and rostral SNpd project to medial caudate nucleus. The center median, ventrolateral, and the central lateral nuclei of thalamus, SNpc, and SNpd project to lateral caudate nucleus. These results suggest that the thalamic and subcortical nuclei known to connect with the limbic and frontal cortices project to NA and medial caudate nucleus. Those thalamic nuclei connected with the motor system project to lateral caudate nucleus. The hippocampus projects selectively to medial NA. The amygdala, raphe, and other mesencephalic nuclei project only to NA and medial caudate nucleus. The organization of hippocampal, amygdala, and other subcortical afferents suggests that NA and caudate nucleus can be separated into medial \"limbic\" and lateral nonlimbic \"sensory-motor\" compartments. A brief review of the distribution pattern of some neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and their receptors and behavior studies provides additional support to the concept that the striatum can be divided into several subcompartments.",
