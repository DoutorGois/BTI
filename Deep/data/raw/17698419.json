     "AB": "The inducible transcription factor Egr-1 has been extensively studied in the adult brain but potential roles during development are largely unexplored. Here we describe the analysis of a new transgenic rat model (egr-1 promoter driving a destabilized GFP molecule) that has provided novel information about the postnatal roles of Egr-1. We show that Egr-1 is more widely expressed in the neonatal brain than was previously appreciated, and is not restricted to neurons; it is expressed in glial cells in the postnatal neocortex and hippocampus. This pattern of expression has been revealed due to cellular filling by GFP, permitting co-localization with glial markers. The transgene/Egr-1 is also expressed in a novel population of cells associated with Cajal-Retzius-like neurons within the marginal zone of the postnatal neocortex. Both of these cellular populations are transient, being limited to the neonatal period, before Egr-1 expression becomes established in an adult-like pattern within neocortical neurons, CA1 hippocampus, and striatum. Another transient population of transgene/Egr-1 cells in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis is maintained until pre-adolescence. The transient phenotype of these cells involves a low relative expression of the neuronal marker NeuN, perhaps indicating a failure to achieve full neuronal differentiation. Egr-1 is therefore present in a diverse range of cell-types during postnatal development. Transgenic expression of a destabilized fluorescent marker has permitted identification of these novel cell populations and will facilitate further analysis of the transcriptional mechanisms that underlie the specific functions and fate of these cells during postnatal brain development.",
