     "AB": "Mnemonic and executive performance is encoded into activity patterns of complex neuronal networks. Lesion studies revealed that adult recognition memory critically depends on the activation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HP). However, its developmental profile remains poorly elucidated. We previously showed the rat PFC and HP are functionally coupled in theta- and gamma-band oscillations during neonatal [postnatal day (P) 5-8] and pre-juvenile (P10-15) stages of development. Here, we assess the behavioral readout of this early prefrontal-hippocampal activation by investigating the ontogeny and the mechanisms of novelty detection and recognition memory in relationship to the functional integrity of the PFC and HP. Excitotoxic lesion of the HP at birth led to abnormal oscillatory entrainment of the PFC throughout neonatal and pre-juvenile development. Although the onset of novelty detection correlated rather with the maturation of sensory perception and motor skills than with hippocampal integrity, the pre-juvenile performance in item, spatial and temporal order recognition memory significantly decreased after HP lesion at birth. This poorer performance does result neither from abnormal developmental milestones and locomotion nor from increased anxiety. Thus, novelty recognition in rat emerges during the second postnatal week and requires functional integrity of communication within neuronal networks including the PFC and HP.",
