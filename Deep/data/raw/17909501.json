     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of daidzein on the apoptotic pathway in the hippocampus and cortex of D-galactose treated mice. For this purpose we have examined the expression of bcl-2 mRNA, bax mRNA and caspase-3 in the hippocampus and cortex of D-galactose-treated mice after fed with 10 or 5 mg/kg of daidzein. The results of in situ hybridization experiments indicate that daidzein could help increase the transcriptions of bcl-2 and decrease the transcriptions of bax in those brain regions of D-galactose-treated mice. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies showed that daidzein could reduce the expression of caspase-3 in both brain regions. These results suggest that daidzein in soybean can inhibit the D-gal induced apoptosis via Bcl-2/Bax apoptotic pathway and be a potential medical candidate for neurodegeneration therapy.",
