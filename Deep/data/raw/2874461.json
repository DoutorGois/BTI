     "AB": "Many neurotransmitter systems appear to be altered with aging. The effects of aging on the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines in the brain has been examined. The endogenous basal activity of tyrosine hydroxylase was lower in the hypothalamus of 24 month old Fisher 344 rats than in the hypothalamus of 3 month old or 6 month old animals. There was no difference in the basal activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in the locus ceruleus, frontal cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra, or the striatum of rats of ages 3 months, 6 months and 24 months. Tyrosine hydroxylase activity was increased in the striatum of 3 month old (60%) and 6 month old (28%) rats after treatment with haloperidol or reserpine, whereas no change in enzyme activity followed administration of these drugs to 24 month old animals. In conclusion, increases in tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the brain that normally occur in the striatum of 3 month old rats after haloperidol or reserpine treatment are significantly decreased in 6 month old rats and not apparent in 24 month old rats.",
