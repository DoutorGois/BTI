     "AB": "Coriandrum sativum L., commonly known as coriander and belonging to the Apiaceae family is cultivated throughout the world for its nutritional value. In traditional medicine, coriander is recommended for the relief of pain, anxiety, flatulence, loss of appetite and convulsions. In the present study, the effects of inhaled coriander volatile oil (1% and 3%, daily, for 21days) extracted from C. sativum var. microcarpum on spatial memory performance were assessed in an Abeta(1-42) rat model of Alzheimer's disease. The Abeta(1-42)-treated rats exhibited the following: decrease of spontaneous alternations percentage within Y-maze task and increase of working memory errors, reference memory errors and time taken to consume all five baits within radial arm maze task. Exposure to coriander volatile oil significantly improved these parameters, suggesting positive effects on spatial memory formation. Assessments of oxidative stress markers in the hippocampal tissue of Abeta(1-42)-treated rats showed a significant increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and a decrease of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) specific activities along with an elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Coriander volatile oil significantly decreased SOD and LDH specific activities, increased GPX specific activity and attenuated the increased MDA level. Also, DNA cleavage patterns were absent in the coriander rats, thus suggesting antiapoptotic activity of the volatile oil. Therefore, our results suggest that exposure to coriander volatile oil ameliorates Abeta(1-42)-induced spatial memory impairment by attenuation of the oxidative stress in the rat hippocampus.",
