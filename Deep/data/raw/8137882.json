     "AB": "The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex possesses distinct recognition sites for glutamate, glycine and polyamines, which appear to be allosterically linked. We have investigated the effects of polyamines on the binding of the glycine site antagonist [3H](+/-)-4-(trans)-2-carboxy-5,7-dichloro-4-phenylaminocarbonylamino - 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline ([3H]L-689,560), using rat cortex/hippocampus P2 membranes. Spermine and spermidine partially inhibited [3H]L-689,560 binding under non-equilibrium conditions, with IC50 values of 25.9 and 106 microM, respectively. The putative polyamine site antagonists arcaine, 1,10-diaminodecane, diethylenetriamine and putrescine had no effect on [3H]L-689,560 binding per se at 1 mM. The inhibition of [3H]L-689,560 binding by spermine was antagonised by arcaine in a competitive manner, but not by 1,10-diaminodecane, diethylenetriamine or putrescine. Kinetic analysis revealed that spermine (100 microM) decreased the association and dissociation rates of [3H]L-689,560 binding. In saturation experiments 100 microM spermine increased the KD for [3H]L-689,560 binding from 1.99 nM to 4.03 nM, with no effect on the number of binding sites. Spermine increased the affinity of glycine site agonists in displacing [3H]L-689,560 binding, with no effect on inhibition by partial agonists or antagonists, suggesting that spermine promotes an 'agonist-preferring' state. Modulation of [3H]L-689,560 binding by agonists for the polyamine and glutamate sites on the NMDA receptor did not appear to be additive in nature.",
