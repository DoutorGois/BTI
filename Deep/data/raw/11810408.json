     "AB": "To reveal whether an extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb761) may affect streptozotocin (STZ)-induced impairments in brain glucose metabolism, autoradiographies of [3H]cytochalasin-B binding to the total population of glucose transporters, [125I]insulin binding to insulin receptors, [3H]glyburide binding to sulfonylurea receptors, and radioactive in situ hybridization for GLUT3 mRNA were carried out in hippocampal brain sections of adult rats that have additionally been divided into good performers (GP) and poor performers (PP) by behavioural tests before the experiments. The STZ-induced increases in hippocampal [3H]cytochalasin-B binding to (total) glucose transporters returned to almost normal values following EGb761 treatment, regardless of the experimental animal group (GP or PP) tested. Similarly, the STZ-mediated enhancements in hippocampal insulin receptor binding of GP rats were partially compensated by the treatment with EGb761. The data suggest beneficial effects of EGb671 on impaired brain glucose metabolism, at least under the experimental conditions used in the study presented.",
