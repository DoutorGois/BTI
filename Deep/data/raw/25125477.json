     "AB": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD) transgenic mice, activation of synaptogenic protein kinase C epsilon (PKCepsilon) was found to prevent synaptotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta)-oligomer elevation, PKCepsilon deficits, early synaptic loss, cognitive deficits, and amyloid plaque formation. In humans, to study the role of PKCepsilon in the pathophysiology of AD and to evaluate its possible use as an early AD-biomarker, we examined PKCepsilon and Abeta in the brains of autopsy-confirmed AD patients (n = 20) and age-matched controls (AC, n = 19), and in skin fibroblast samples from AD (n = 14), non-AD dementia patients (n = 14), and AC (n = 22). Intraneuronal Abeta levels were measured immunohistochemically (using an Abeta-specific antibody) in hippocampal pyramidal cells of human autopsy brains. PKCepsilon was significantly lower in the hippocampus and temporal pole areas of AD brains, whereas Abeta levels were significantly higher. The ratio of PKCepsilon to Abeta in individual CA1 pyramidal cells was markedly lower in the autopsy AD brains versus controls. PKCepsilon was inversely correlated with Abeta levels in controls, whereas in AD patients, PKCepsilon showed no significant correlation with Abeta. In autopsy brains, PKCepsilon decreased as the Braak score increased. Skin fibroblast samples from AD patients also demonstrated a deficit in PKCepsilon compared to controls and an AD-specific change in the Abeta-oligomer effects on PKCepsilon. Together, these data demonstrate that the relationship between Abeta levels and PKCepsilon is markedly altered in AD patients' brains and skin fibroblasts, reflecting a loss of protective effect of PKCepsilon against toxic Abeta accumulation. These changes of PKCepsilon levels in human skin fibroblasts may provide an accurate, non-invasive peripheral AD biomarker.",
