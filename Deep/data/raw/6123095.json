     "AB": "The indirect immunofluorescence technique was used to demonstrate the coexistence of somatostatin together with avian pancreatic polypeptide-like immunoreactivity within certain neurons of the rat forebrain. Numerous neurons containing these peptides were observed in the neocortex, hippocampus, olfactory tubercle, striatum, nucleus accumbens and lateral septum. In studies of serial sections stained alternately for these two peptides, and in restaining experiments, It could be determined that in many neurons in these areas these two peptides coexisted. In other brain areas such as the anterior periventricular hypothalamus, somatostatin cells were never found to contain avian pancreatic polypeptide-like immunoreactivity. Also, within the pancreas these two peptides were never found to coexist in the same cells. The findings represent a further example of the coexistence of more than one neuropeptide within a single neuron.",
