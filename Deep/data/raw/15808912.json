     "AB": "Storage of emotionally influenced memory is regulated by activation of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) as well as of gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPRs) in the dorsal hippocampus. In the present study, male Wistar rats were given a bilateral infusion of saline or the GRPR antagonist (D-Tpi6, Leu13 psi[CH2NH]-Leu14) bombesin (6-14) (RC-3095) (1.0 microg/side) into the dorsal hippocampus 10 min before training on an inhibitory avoidance task, followed by an immediate post-training i.p. injection of vehicle or the GR agonist dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg). A retention test trial, carried out 24 h after training, indicated that intrahippocampal infusion of RC-3095 impaired inhibitory avoidance retention. Post-training administration of dexamethasone induced an enhancement of retention regardless of whether the animals had received saline or RC-3095 into the hippocampus before training. The findings indicate that hippocampal GRPR blockade does not prevent memory enhancement induced by dexamethasone. Together with previous results, these findings suggest that endogenous activation of GRPRs in the hippocampus modulates the consolidation of emotional memory, but is not a critical receptor system mediating memory formation.",
