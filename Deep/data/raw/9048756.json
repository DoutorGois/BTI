     "AB": "Using iodinated human galanin and autoradiography, galanin binding sites were studied in cortical and hippocampal areas and in some brainstem nuclei in the brains of eight patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) and of nine matched control cases. The highest density of binding sites was found in the substantia nigra with a less intense labeling in the hippocampus and cortical regions. In the SDAT cases a significant increase in number of galanin binding sites was found in some hippocampal areas, a decrease in the caudate nucleus, and no significant changes in frontal and entorhinal cortices. These findings suggest that some central galanin systems may be deranged in SDAT.",
