     "AB": "The effects of unilateral intrahippocampal injections of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, on local cerebral glucose utilisation have been examined in conscious rats using [14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiography. The intrahippocampal injection of MK-801 (10 nmol) induced significant marked increases in glucose use in the ipsilateral hippocampus molecular layer and dentate gyrus (by 31 and 44%, respectively). Function-related glucose use in brain regions with known neuronal connections with the site of drug administration (e.g. entorhinal cortex, septal nucleus, mamillary body) was minimally altered after intrahippocampal MK-801 administration. Blockade of hippocampal NMDA receptors does not appear to modify activity, as reflected in local glucose utilisation, in hippocampal afferent and efferent circuits in conscious rats.",
