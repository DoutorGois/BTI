     "AB": "Cocaine HCl (0, 10, or 50 mg/kg) was injected into adult male ICR mice IP. Thirty minutes later, brains were removed and nine regions were isolated: olfactory bulbs (OB), olfactory tubercles (OT), prefrontal cortex (PC), septum (SP), striatum (ST), amygdala (AMY), hypothalamus (HT), hippocampus (HC), and thalamus (TH). Using high-performance liquid chromatography, concentrations of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and their major metabolites were determined. At 10 mg/kg cocaine, NE levels were increased in the AMY and its metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), was decreased in the PC, AMY, and HT. DA levels were also increased in the AMY, while its intracellular metabolite, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), was decreased in the ST and its extracellular metabolite, homovanillic acid (HVA), was decreased in the PC. 3-Methoxytyramine (3-MT) levels were not altered in any tissue. 5-HT levels were increased in the AMY, HT, and TH, while its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was decreased in the OB and ST. MHPG/NE ratios were decreased in the PC, AMY, and HT as were those for HVA/DA. DOPAC/DA ratios were decreased in the ST and AMY and increased in the SP while those for 3-MT/DA were decreased in the TH and increased in the PC. 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios were decreased in the AMY, HC and TH. At 50 mg/kg cocaine, there was an increase in DA in the TH. There was a decrease in DOPAC, HVA, and 3-MT, as well as the DOPAC/DA ratio in the ST. In the OT, there was a decrease in DOPAC, the DOPAC/DA ratio, 3-MT, and the 3-MT/DA ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
