     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a form of synaptic plasticity thought to be involved in learning and memory. Although extensively studied, mainly in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the mechanisms underlying the induction and expression of LTP are poorly elucidated. This is probably due to the fact that LTP is not a unique process and indeed recent studies have shown that several forms of LTP could be generated depending on the experimental conditions. Furthermore, LTP is generally associated with a long-lasting increase of the synaptic efficacy of AMPA receptors but an increasing number of data also suggested that NMDA receptors could be potentiated as well. NMDA receptor responses are modulated by a large number of extracellular and intracellular events, providing additional possibilities for the generation of LTP. The role of these different modulatory sites of the NMDA receptor and their relation with LTP are reviewed with a particular attention to the redox site which seems to be a selective target to distinguish between AMPA and NMDA-LTP.",
