     "AB": "The two structurally related nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) and silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors (SMRT) proteins have been found to differentially affect the transcriptional activity of numerous nuclear receptors, such as thyroid hormone, retinoic acid and steroid receptors. Because of the numerous effects mediated by nuclear receptors in brain, it is of interest to extend these in vitro data and to explore the cellular distribution of both corepressors in brain tissue. We therefore examined, using in situ hybridisation, whether the relative abundance of these two functionally distinct corepressors differed in rat brain and pituitary. We find that although both N-CoR and SMRT transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in brain, striking differences in their respective levels of expression could be observed in discrete areas of brain stem, thalamus, hypothalamus and hippocampus. Using dual-label immunofluorescence, we examined in selected glucocorticoid sensitive areas involved in the regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, the respective protein abundance of N-CoR and SMRT. Protein abundance was largely concurrent with the mRNA expression levels, with SMRT relatively more abundant in hypothalamus and brain stem areas. Colocalisation of N-CoR and SMRT was demonstrated by confocal microscopy in most areas studied. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the idea that the uneven neuroanatomical distribution of N-CoR and SMRT protein may contribute to the site-specific effects exerted by hormones, such as glucocorticoids, in the brain.",
