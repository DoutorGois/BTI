     "AB": "The electrophysiological effects of Ro 15-4513 and FG 7142 alone and in combination with ethanol were investigated. Intraperitoneal administration of Ro 15-4513 (3, 6 mg/kg) was found to significantly increase power in the 6-16 Hz frequency range, an effect which was antagonized by ethanol (1 g/kg). FG 7142 administration (2, 5 mg/kg IP) was found to enhance spectral power in the 6-8 Hz range, an effect which was also blocked by coadministration of ethanol. Both drugs also produced dose-related abnormal EEG activity in the form of episodic bursts of EEG spiking. These ictal episodes, which lasted 5-40 seconds, were associated with an arrest of behavior but no overt behavioral convulsions. Coadministration of ethanol caused an elimination or significant reduction in these episodes. These studies suggest that Ro 15-4513 and FG 7142 have potent electrophysiological actions of their own which are partially antagonized by ethanol.",
