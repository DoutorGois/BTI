     "AB": "AIM: To study the mRNA expression changes in the brain of rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion. METHODS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion was used to induce ischemia in rat brain. The mRNA expression of voltage-dependent potassium channel subtypes, including Kv1.4, Kv1.5, Kv2.1 and Kv4.2, were detected in rat hippocampus and cortex by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion induced a significant neurological injury in rats. After ischemia 2 h, the mRNA of Kv1.4, Kv2.1 and Kv4.2 in hippocampus increased by 50%, 67% and 90% , respectively. And the mRNA of Kv1.4 and Kv4.2 maintained at a high level in hippocampus after ischemia 24 h. In cortex, the mRNA level of all the four subtypes were not changed significantly after ischemia 2 h, but the mRNA of Kv2.1 and Kv4.2 increased by 70% and 62% after ischemia 24 h, respectively. CONCLUSION: The mRNA expression levels of voltage-dependent potassium channels were up-regulated in rat hippocampus and cortex after middle cerebral artery occlusion.",
