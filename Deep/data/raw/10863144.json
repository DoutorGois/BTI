     "AB": "This study was designed to establish a role for cAMP-responsive element (CRE) binding protein (CREB) in signal transduction cascade in the hippocampus associated with kindling. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were kindled from the left amygdala until they exhibited Racine's class 5 generalized seizures [Racine (1972). EMBO J. 11, 3337-3346] Nuclear proteins were extracted from dorsal hippocampi obtained from 0 to 24 h after final kindling stimulation. From these, we evaluated the temporal pattern of CRE DNA-binding activity by use of a gel mobility-shift assay with a 32P-labeled CREB oligonucleotide probe. CRE-binding activity in the hippocampus was enhanced significantly at 2 h and returned to baseline level within 4 h after the stimulation. Our results suggest that CREB may be involved in the hippocampal signal transduction pathway of rats activated in response to a kindling stimulation to the amygdala. However, the transient elevation of CRE-binding activity following a seizure in a kindled animal also suggests that persistent activation of CREB may not be required for maintenance of the kindling phenomenon.",
