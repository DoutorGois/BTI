     "AB": "Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a complex condition which is associated with high mortality and morbidity. However, few promising treatments for HIE exist. In the present study, the central objective was to identify the therapeutic effect of pilose antler polypeptides (PAP) on HIE in rats. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (14 days old) were used and divided into three groups, including control group, hypoxic-ischemia (HI) group and PAP group. After 21 days of treatment, locomotor activity was improved in PAP-treated rats, brain atrophy was decreased and cerebral edema was mitigated to some extent. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis indicated that PAP administration decreased the expressions of inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis genes in hippocampus compared with HI group. Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of genes related to neurotrophic factors were significantly increased in the hippocampus. In addition, the expressions of oxidative stress markers were all down-regulated after PAP administration. Moreover, PAP up-regulated both the mRNA and protein levels of SDF1 and CXCR4, which may activate the SDF1/CXCR4 axis to moderate brain injury. These results suggest that PAP may be potentially used in the treatment of HIE.",
