     "AB": "The effects of repeated treatment of rolipram, a cAMP specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor (0.1 mg/kg/day i.p., 14 days), on several neuronal cholinergic indices, especially on those in aged rats were examined. In young-adult rats, rolipram treatment increased choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity (V(max)value) in the striatum as well as in thalamus + midbrain, whereas it decreased choline esterase activity in the hippocampus. The ChAT activity (V(max)value) and the M1-R binding (B(max)value) in the aged control rats were significantly reduced in all the brain regions examined, compared with the young-adult rats, but consecutive rolipram treatment ameliorated the reductions of both indices in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus to approximately the young-adult control levels. Since high membrane binding site concentrations for rolipram itself were revealed in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus, where the rolipram treatment showed ameliorating effects on the ChAT activity and the M1-R binding, the present findings indicate that repeated rolipram administration easily affects these two brain regions. Thus, repeated rolipram administration could restore both the presynaptic ChAT activity and the postsynaptic muscarinic cholinergic M1-R binding which are decreased with aging.",
