     "AB": "The central nervous system of white mice inoculated with the production Vnukovo-32 strain of tissue culture rabies virus was studied histologically. Intracerebral inoculation resulted in parenchymatous-inflammatory lesions with predominantly severe involvement of the Ammon horn neurons. Subcutaneous inoculations also revealed a rather significant degree of neurovirulence of this strain, although there were definite differences in the pathomorphological pictures observed after inoculation by this and intracerebral route. In mouse experiments the Vnukovo-32 strain showed instability of the properties both with regard to the degree of neurovirulence and to the duration of the incubation period.",
