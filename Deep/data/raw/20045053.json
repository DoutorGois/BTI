     "AB": "Rett syndrome is a pediatric neurological condition caused by mutations of the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator MECP2. In this study, we examined cortical and hippocampal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in male and female MeCP2-deficient mice at symptomatic stages during different behavioral states. During acute sleep, MeCP2-deficient mice displayed normal delta-like activity in cortex and sharp-wave activity in hippocampus. However, when the mice were awake but immobile, abnormal spontaneous, rhythmic EEG discharges of 6-9 Hz were readily detected in the somatosensory cortex. During exploratory activity, MeCP2-deficient mice displayed clear theta rhythm activity in hippocampus, but its peak frequency was significantly attenuated compared to wild type. Collectively, these findings indicate that a deficiency in MeCP2 function in mice leads to alterations in EEG activity with similarities to what has been observed clinically in Rett syndrome patients.",
