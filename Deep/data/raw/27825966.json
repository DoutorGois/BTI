     "AB": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) provokes severe inflammation response in the central nervous system, which is a key risk factor for the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Anti-inflammation medications shed light on treating AD. In this study, we found hypericin is a potent anti-AD constituent through anti-inflammation. Pretreatment with hypericin (5 muM and 15 muM) significantly suppresses oligomeric Abeta42 (oAbeta42)-induced expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and production of NO in microglia without cytotoxicity. We further found that hypericin ameliorates inflammatory response by suppressing MKL1, which is the essential cofactor of p65 during the transcription process. In an Abeta injection AD mouse model, animals orally administrated hypericin (50 mg/kg) for seven days significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and NO production in hippocampus, meanwhile, hypericin improved oAbeta42-induced learning and memory impairment in mice in the Morris water maze test. Therefore, hypericin could be considered as a potential candidate for treating AD.",
