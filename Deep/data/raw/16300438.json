     "AB": "Pigeons (Columba livia) were trained with a spatial structural discrimination, which was based on the spatial relationship among the components of a pattern, and a feature-binding structural discrimination, which was based on how different visual features within a pattern were combined. Neither discrimination was impaired by damage to the hippocampus and area parahippocampalis. The lesions impaired performance on a spatial working memory and a spatial reference memory task in open field. The results indicate an intact hippocampus is not essential for the solution of structural discriminations in pigeons and the hippocampus is important for processing some types of spatial information--that used in navigation, but not other types--that used in spatial structural discriminations.",
