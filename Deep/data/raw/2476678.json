     "AB": "The effects of aging on in vivo DNA and RNA labeling and on RNA content in various brain regions of 4-, 12-, and 24-month-old rats were investigated. No difference in [methyl-14C]thymidine incorporation into DNA of cerebral cortex and cerebellum during aging was observed. The ratio of RNA/DNA content significantly decreased from 4 to 24 months of age in cerebral cortex, cerebellum and striatum. RNA labeling decreased by 15% in cerebral cortex of 24-month-old animals while in the other brain areas examined (cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, brainstem, striatum) did not change during aging. In the cerebral cortex, the ratio of the specific radioactivity of microsomal RNA to that of nuclear RNA, determined by in vivo experiments, was not affected by the aging process. A significant decrease of total, poly(A) RNA and poly(A) RNA content was observed in the same brain area of 24-month-old rats compared to 4-month-old ones. Moreover, densitometric and radioactivity patterns obtained by gel electrophoresis of labeled RNA after in vitro experiments (tissue slices of cerebral cortex) showed a different ribosomal RNA processing during aging. In vivo chronic treatment with CDP-choline was able to increase RNA labeling in corpus striatum of 24-month-old animals.",
