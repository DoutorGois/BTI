     "AB": "Extracellular field recordings were made in CA1 in the hippocampal explant cultures in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Schaffer collaterals were stimulated with 1-s trains of 60 Hz pulses every 10 min. Seizures were reliably elicited with progressive lengthening over 1-2 h. D-APV, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, stereoselectively blocked the development of seizures. Thus we have demonstrated that in vitro epileptogenesis occurs in hippocampal explant cultures through NMDA receptor mediated mechanisms.",
