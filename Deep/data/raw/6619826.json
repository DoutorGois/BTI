     "AB": "By using electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic recordings in anaesthetized and free-moving rats, two opioid peptides, known as selective agonists for mu and delta opiate receptors, respectively, were examined for their epileptogenic properties. The delta receptor peptide (DSTLE, 4.6-18.6 nmol, intraventricularly, ivt), a putative delta opiate agonist, produced a dose-related increase of myoclonic contractions (MC) with epileptic discharges in anaesthetized rats and severe wet dog shakes, with occasionally falling down, in free-moving animals. Morphiceptin, a specific mu opiate agonist, used in equimolar doses and under the same experimental conditions, had a significantly less pronounced effect on the number of MC and epileptiform EEG phenomena. Similarly, DSTLE (18.6 nmol) injected in the CA2 area of the hippocampus, a region with a nearly equal distribution of mu and delta opiate receptors, induced epileptic discharges in anaesthetized and free-moving rats, while an equimolar dose of morphiceptin had no significant effect. It is suggested that the epileptiform activity of opioid peptides is mainly due to an activation of delta opiate receptors in the central nervous system.",
