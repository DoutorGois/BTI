     "AB": "The dendrites of granule cells in hippocampal slices responded to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with a depolarization. The response was blocked by picrotoxin in a noncompetitive manner. Reductions in the extracellular chloride ion concentration changed the reversal potential of the response by an amount predicted from the Nernst equation for chloride ion. Chloride-dependent hyperpolarizing responses were sometimes also found in the cell body of the granule cells. Since the reversal potential followed that predicted from the Nernst equation for chloride, we conclude that the response was mediated by chloride ions alone with no contribution from other ions. This has not previously been shown for the depolarizing response to GABA in central neurons.",
