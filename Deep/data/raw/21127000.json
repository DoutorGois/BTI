     "AB": "We have previously reported that the reconsolidation and extinction of hippocampal-dependent contextual fear memory can be initiated by a single context conditioned stimulus (CS) presentation of either short or long duration, and that both processes require protein synthesis in this brain region. Furthermore, reconsolidation depends on Zif268 activity in this region. Here we show that by infusing a recombinant brain-derived neurotrophic factor (rBDNF) directly into the brain of rats, that high levels of mature BDNF in the hippocampus at retrieval constrain the extinction of the fear memory after prolonged memory recall. We also show after a short CS exposure that reconsolidation was impaired using antisense oligonucleotides targeting Zif268, and that, similarly, reductions in conditioned behavior were observed after prolonged CS presentation when extinction is constrained by high levels of BDNF. This is direct evidence that in the mammalian brain extinction proceeds exclusively after prolonged CS exposure. In addition, that BDNF activity in the hippocampus contributes to a molecular switch for the extinction of hippocampal-dependent memory.",
