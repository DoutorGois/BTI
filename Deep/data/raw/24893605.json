     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Dementia health literacy is low among the public and likely poses a significant barrier to Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptom recognition and treatment, particularly among minority populations already facing higher AD burden. We evaluated the pilot phase of a novel AD health education program, Old SCHOOL (Seniors Can Have Optimal Aging and Ongoing Longevity) Hip-Hop (OSHH), which is designed to enable children to be AD health educational conduits in the home (\"child-mediated health communication\"). METHOD: OSHH applied our stroke-validated model of engaging, dynamic, and age- and culturally appropriate curriculum delivered to elementary school-age children (fourth/fifth grades, ages 9-11 years). We assessed AD knowledge among the children at baseline, immediately following the intervention (1-hour program delivered daily over 3 consecutive days), and 3 months later. For key AD symptoms, we developed the FLOW mnemonic (forget, lose, overlook, write/wander); students were additionally taught action plans for recognized symptoms. RESULTS: Seventy-five students completed baseline assessments, and 68 completed posttesting. AD symptoms in FLOW were not well known at baseline (individually ranging from 16% to 71% correct) but were highly learned after 3 days (89% to 98% correct) and retained well after 3 months (80% to 95% correct, p </= .01 for all comparisons vs. baseline). AD localization, including its effect on memory and the hippocampus, was also highly learned and retained (p < .001). Eighteen students (24%) reported having a close friend/family member with AD. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests our hip-hop health education model may be an effective method to improve AD health literacy.",
