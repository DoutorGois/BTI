     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the spatio-temporal expression of p70S6k activation in hippocampus in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: Temporal lobe epilepsy model was established by stereotaxically unilateral and intrahippocampal injection of kainite acid (KA) in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Latent and chronic epileptogenesis were represented by mice 5 days after KA injection (n = 5) and mice 5 weeks after KA injection (n = 8), respectively. Control mice (n = 5) were injected with saline. Immunohistochemical assays were performed on brain sections of the mice. RESULTS: Hippocampus both ipsilateral and contralateral to the KA injection displayed significantly up-regulated pS6 immunoreactivity in dispersed granule cells in 5-day and 5-week model mice. CONCLUSION: The activation of p70S6k is mainly located in the dentate gyrus in KA-induced mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, indicating that the activation may be related with the disperse degree and hypertrophy of granule cells.",
