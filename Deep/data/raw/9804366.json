     "AB": "A replication defective adenoviral vector containing the E. coli lacZ gene (AdCMVnLacZ) was directly injected into right hippocampus and lateral ventricle immediately after 5 min of transient global ischemia in gerbils. The relations between the lacZ gene expression and DNA fragmentation or heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) immunoreactivity were examined up to 21 days post ischemia. The lacZ gene was transiently expressed at 1 day in the hippocampus except around the CA1 region, while a large number of the periventricular cells strongly expressed the lacZ gene from 8 h to 7 days. In CA1 layer, terminal deoxynucleotidyl dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells, which were present only adjacent to the needle track at 8 h to 1 day, became more extensive in the whole CA1 layer at 3 to 7 days. TUNEL-positive cells were also detected around the DG at 1 day, around the needle track at 8 h to 3 days, and in the choroid plexus cells at 7 days. HSP72 staining was detected in the subiculum at 1 to 3 days, the dentate granule cells at 8 h to 1 day, and in the CA3 or CA4 pyramidal cells at 1 to 3 days. Some lacZ expressing cells were double-positive with HSP72 in DG, while the majority of those were distinguished from the TUNEL-positive cells. Pyramidal neurons were almost completely lost in the CA1 sector at 7 days after the ischemia. The present study demonstrates the successful LacZ gene transfer into the hippocampus and ventricle of postischemic gerbil brain except in the vulnerable CA1 layer by adenoviral vector injection. However, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer may induce indirect apoptotic cell death in the DG and ventricle, in addition to direct traumatic injury around the needle track.",
