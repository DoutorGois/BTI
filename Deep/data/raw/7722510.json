     "AB": "The effects of chronic treatment with the specific, mechanism-based, irreversible inhibitors of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.19; GABA transaminase), ethanolamine O-sulphate (EOS), and 4-aminohexenoate [vigabatrin; gamma-vinyl-GABA (GVG)] on the extracellular concentrations of GABA in the hippocampus have been studied using in vivo microdialysis in conscious animals. Oral dosing [3 mg/ml of drinking water, giving doses of GVG of 194 +/- 38 mg/kg/day and of EOS of 303 +/- 42 mg/kg/day (mean +/- SD)] was followed by microdialysis at 2, 8, and 21 days. The basal outflow of GABA (in the range of approximately 1-2 pmol/30 microliters/30-min sample) after 2 and 8 days of treatment was not significantly different from that in control animals, but the 21-day treatment gave significant rises in the extracellular GABA concentration (up to approximately 6-8 pmol/30 microliters/30-min sample). Both inhibitors gave similar results. Depolarisation with 100 mM K+ gave large increases in GABA release in control (approximately 20-60 pmol/30 microliters/30-min sample) and treated animals. The 8- and 21-day-treated animals showed significant increases in the stimulated release compared with control animals (approximately 80-100 pmol/30 microliters/30-min sample). Excluding Ca2+ had no significant effect on either basal or stimulated release. The significant increases in K(+)-evoked release of GABA show that the increased intracellular pool of GABA is available for release, and this may be related to the anticonvulsant action of these compounds.",
