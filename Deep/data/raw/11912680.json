     "AB": "The effect of trichloroethylene (TCE) on long-term potentiation (LTP) was studied using both electrical and optical recording. The hippocampi from mice injected with 300 mg/kg or 1000 mg/kg TCE were sliced 24 h after administration. The field potential from the CAI was recorded. After the application of tetanus, population spikes (PS) were potentiated in all groups, but the post-per-pre ratio of PS was smaller in TCE groups than in the control. Optical recording was also carried out in 1000 mg/kg TCE-injected mice and a new analytical method using a high speed camera was employed. After the induction of tetanus, the optical signal was potentiated in both TCE and control groups. However, the post-per-pre ratio of the optical signals and response area were smaller in the TCE groups than in the control. It was suggested that the impairment of LTP is one of the mechanisms of the impairment of immediate memory after acute exposure to TCE in humans.",
