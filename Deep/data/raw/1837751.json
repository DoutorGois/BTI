     "AB": "Interaction of quinolone antimicrobials and fenbufen, anti-inflammatory agents, with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor was investigated in rat hippocampal neurons with the conventional patch-clamp technique. Simultaneous applications of quinolones and a metabolite of fenbufen had no effects on the glutamate- and NMDA-induced currents. The blocking effects of Mg2+ and MK-801 on NMDA responses were also unaffected. Therefore, the convulsive action induced by quinolones and fenbufen does not seem to involve the function change of NMDA receptor.",
