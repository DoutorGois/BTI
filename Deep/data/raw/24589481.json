     "AB": "BACKGROUND: A prolonged isoflurane exposure may lead to cognitive decline in rodents. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1)-ErbB4 signaling plays a key role in the modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity through regulating the neurotransmission. The authors hypothesized that hippocampal NRG1-ErbB4 signaling is involved in isoflurane-induced cognitive impairments in aged mice. METHODS: Fourteen-month-old C57BL/6 mice were randomized to receive 100% O2 exposure, vehicle injection after 100% O2 exposure, vehicle injection after exposure to isoflurane carried by 100% O2, NRG1-beta1 injection after exposure to isoflurane carried by 100% O2, and NRG1-beta1 and an ErbB4 inhibitor AG1478 injection after exposure to isoflurane carried by 100% O2. Fear conditioning test was used to assess the cognitive function of mice 48-h postexposure. The brain tissues were harvested 48-h postexposure to determine the levels of NRG1, ErbB4, p-ErbB4, parvalbumin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 in the hippocampus using Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The percentage of freezing time to context was decreased from 50.28 +/- 11.53% to 30.82 +/- 10.00%, and the hippocampal levels of NRG1, p-ErbB4/ErbB4, parvalbumin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 were decreased from 172.79 +/- 20.85 ng/g, 69.15 +/- 12.20%, 101.68 +/- 11.21%, and 104.71 +/- 6.85% to 112.92 +/- 16.65 ng/g, 42.26 +/- 9.71%, 75.89 +/- 10.26%, and 73.87 +/- 16.89%, respectively, after isoflurane exposure. NRG1-beta1 attenuated the isoflurane-induced hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairment and the declines in the hippocampal NRG1, p-ErbB4/ErbB4, parvalbumin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67. AG1478 inhibited the rescuing effects of NRG1-beta1. CONCLUSION: Disruption of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling in the parvalbumin-positive interneurons might, at least partially, contribute to the isoflurane-induced hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairment after exposure to isoflurane carried by 100% O2 in aged mice.",
