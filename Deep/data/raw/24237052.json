     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: Plant sterols are thought to treat hypercholesterolemia via inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of impaired ATP-binding cassette transporter G5/8 (ABCG5/8) expression by diabetes to the increased beta-sitosterol (BS) exposure and impact of increased BS on integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB). METHODS: Basal BS level in tissues of streptozotocin-inducted rats and ABCG5/8 protein levels in liver and intestine were investigated; pharmacokinetics of BS was studied following oral dose; and primarily cultured rat brain microvessel endothelial cells (rBMECs) were used to study BS transportation across BBB and effect of BS on BBB integrity. KEY FINDINGS: Diabetic rats showed greatly upgraded basal levels of BS in plasma, intestine, cerebral and hippocampus, accompanied by impairment of ABCG5/8 protein expression in liver and intestine. Pharmacokinetics studies demonstrated higher AUC0-48 and Cmax , and lower faecal recoveries of BS after oral administration, indicating enhancement of absorption or efflux impairment. In-vitro data showed increased ratio of BS/cholesterol in high levels BS-treated rBMECs was associated with increased BBB permeability of some biomarkers including BS itself. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired ABCG5/8 protein expression by diabetes led to increase in BS exposure, which may be harmful to BBB function.",
