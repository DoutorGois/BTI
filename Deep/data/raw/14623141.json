     "PG": "206-8",
     "AB": "We used the differential display-polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) protocol to identify genes related to antidepressant effects. Rats were subjected to different kinds of stress for 20 days, and then the antidepressants desipramine and fluoxetine were administered (10 mg/kg per day, i.p.) for 20 days. DD-PCR was performed and differentially expressed cDNAs were further confirmed by dot-blot hybridization. cDNA homology analysis revealed that desipramine up-regulated the expression of microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP-4) mRNA and fluoxetine up-regulated the expression of drebrin A mRNA in the rat hippocampus compared with the chronically stressed group. This result suggests that MAP-4 and drebrin may be involved in the antidepressant like effects of desipramine and fluoxetine.",
