     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Viral vectors provide powerful tools for transgene delivery to the mammalian brain to assess the effects of therapeutic proteins, antisense RNAs or small interfering RNAs. A key advantage of such approaches is that specific brain regions implicated in a particular disease can be independently targeted. METHODS: To optimize transgene expression in sub-regions of the mouse hippocampus and with a view towards devising gene therapy strategies for Alzheimer's disease, we designed lentivirus-based reporter vectors bearing various promoters, including constitutive and cell-specific promoters. Furthermore, we devised methods allowing a side-by-side comparison of transgene expression levels in neural cells both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Following stereotaxic injection into the adult mouse hippocampus, titer-adjusted lentiviral vectors bearing constitutive promoters resulted in robust and sub-region-specific transgene expression. Our results show that the human CMV-IE promoter resulted in efficient transgene expression in the entire hippocampus whereas transgene expression mediated by the hybrid hEF1alpha/HTLV promoter was limited mainly in the dentate gyrus and the CA2/3 region. Finally, the neuron-specific human synapsin I promoter was particularly effective in the dentate gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that subregion-specific transgene expression in the hippocampus can be achieved following lentivirus vector-mediated gene transfer.",
