     "AB": "Astrocytes and microglia are able to degrade potentially neurotoxic beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits typical for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Contrary to microglia, astrocytes degrade human Abeta from tissue sections in vitro without any additional stimulation, but it has remained unclear whether transplanted astrocytes are able to clear deposited human Abeta in vivo. We transplanted adult mouse astrocytes into the hippocampi of transgenic mice mimicking AD and observed their fate, effects on microglial responses, and Abeta clearance. After 2-months follow-up time, we discovered a significant reduction in Abeta burden compared with AD mice infused with PBS only. The remaining Abeta deposits were fragmented and most of the Abeta immunoreactivity was seen within the transplanted astrocytes. Concomitant to Abeta reduction, both CD68 and CD45 immunoreactivities were significantly upregulated but phagocytic microglia were often surrounding and engulfing Abeta burdened, TUNEL-positive astrocytes rather than co-localizing with Abeta alone. Astrocytes are known to degrade Abeta also by secreting proteases involved in Abeta catabolism. To study the contribution of neprilysin (NEP), angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1), and endothelin-converting enzyme-2 (ECE-2) in human Abeta clearance, we utilized an ex vivo assay to demonstrate that adult astrocytes respond to human Abeta by upregulating NEP expression. Further, incubation of adult astrocytes with known inhibitors of NEP, ACE-1, or ECE-2 significantly inhibited the removal of human Abeta from the tissue suggesting an important role for these proteases in Abeta clearance by adult astrocytes ex vivo.",
