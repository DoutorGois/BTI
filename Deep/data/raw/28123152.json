     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a most serious age-related neurodegenerative disorder accompanied with significant memory impairments in this world. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be invlolved in the pathophysiology of AD. Previous studies have shown that miRNA-206 (miR-206) is implicated in the pathogenesis of AD via suppressing the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain. Here, we examined the miR-206-3p and miR-206-5p expression in the hippocampus and cortex of Abeta precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice treated with donepezil, a drug approved for treating AD in clinic. We found that the expression of miR-206-3p was significantly up-regulated in the hippocampus and cortex of APP/PS1 mice, while donepezil administration significantly reversed this dysfunction. In addition, enhancing the miR-206-3p level by the usage of AgomiR-206-3p significantly attenuated the anti-dementia effects of donepezil in APP/PS1 mice. Together, these results suggested that miR-206-3p is involved in the anti-dementia effects of donepezil, and could be a novel pharmacological target for treating AD.",
