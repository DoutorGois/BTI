     "AB": "Disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis often leads to neuron death. Recently, the function of calcium-binding proteins as neuronal Ca2+ buffers has been debated. We tested whether calbindin D28k functions as an intracellular Ca2+ buffer by constructing bicistronic herpes simplex virus vectors to deliver rat calbindin cDNA to hippocampal neurons in vitro. Neurons were infected with vectors delivering calbindin or a negative control or were mock-infected. After 12 or 24 h of hypoglycemia, infected cells were made aglycemic during fura-2 calcium ratiometric imaging. In response to this challenge, neuronal overexpressing calbindin had less Ca2+ mobilized as compared with negative controls or mock-infected cells. Cells were assayed for survival after 12- or 24-h hypoglycemia or aglycemia. The calbindin vector decreased neuronal death due to hypoglycemia but not aglycemia. Here we demonstrate, in response to hypoglycemic challenge, both decreased Ca2+ mobilization and increased survival of cells infected with the calbindin vector.",
