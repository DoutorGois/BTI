     "AB": "The distribution of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive (ChAT-IR) neurons was studied in the brain of the common marmoset by using immunohistochemistry. ChAT-IR neurons were found in the medial septal nucleus, vertical and horizontal limb nuclei of the diagonal band, the nucleus basalis of Meynert, pedunculopontine nucleus and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and also in the striatum, habenula, and brainstem cranial nerve motor nuclei. The organization of ChAT-IR neurons in the basal forebrain, midbrain, and pons is consistent with the Ch1-Ch6 nomenclature introduced by Mesulam et al. ('83). The combination of the retrograde transport of HRP-WGA with ChAT immunohistochemistry revealed the distribution of neurons in the Ch4 cell group projecting to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The activity of ChAT was highest in limbic cortical structures, such as the hippocampus, and lowest in association areas of the neocortex. Lesions at various loci in the basal forebrain resulted in differential patterns of ChAT loss in the cortex, which suggests some degree of topographical organization of Ch4 projections to the cortical mantle.",
