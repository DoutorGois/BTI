     "AB": "Isoprenaline-induced changes in activity of an endogenous, specific inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (type I inhibitor) under conditions of experimental supersensitivity of beta-adrenoceptors were investigated in rat hippocampus and brain stem. Both subchronic administration of reserpine (2.5 mg kg-1, i.p., 4 days, once daily) and i.c.v injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (250 micrograms/ventricle, bilaterally, 48 h apart), which are known to increase beta-adrenoceptor sensitivity in the rat brain, markedly enhanced the response of the type I inhibitor activity to isoprenaline. To obtain a significant decrease of type I inhibitor activity in the examined brain structures of these animals, doses of isoprenaline 2-5 times lower than in control groups had to be used. It is suggested that the isoprenaline-induced decrease of type I inhibitor activity might be used as an index of central beta-adrenoceptor reactivity in-vivo.",
