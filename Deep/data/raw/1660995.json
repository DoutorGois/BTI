     "AB": "The neural circuitry in the visual cortex is characterized by two basic types of organization. One is a laminar organization determining the extrinsic and intrinsic neural connections of cortical cells according to their cortical depth, and the other is a columnar organization where cortical cells are arranged perpendicularly according to their response selectivities. It is known that the columnar organization comprises the postnatal structures dependent on the visual experience, while the laminar organization comprises the prenatal structures unmodified by visual experience. We have investigated the interplay between the pre- and postnatal mechanisms using various in vitro preparations, including visual cortical slices, and transplant and co-culture preparations. It was shown in lateral geniculate and visual cortex transplants and co-cultures including the visual cortex lateral geniculate nucleus that all laminar structures are expressed in these preparations according to the prenatal mechanisms. It was also shown in slice preparations that the details of these circuitries are plastic and modifiable by the visual input, although their basic framework is determined prenatally.",
