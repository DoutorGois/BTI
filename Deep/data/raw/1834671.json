     "AB": "We have cloned a novel human intronless gene encoding a G-protein-coupled receptor of the dopamine receptor family. Expression of this receptor in Cos-7 cells led to the high affinity binding of a number of dopamine D1 antagonists, with a binding profile similar to that of the previously described dopamine D1 receptor. In contrast, the agonist binding profile of this new receptor did not exactly match any previously defined dopamine D1 receptor and was notable for its unusually high affinity for dopamine. This new receptor caused a 13-fold increase in adenylylcyclase activity in transfected Cos-7 cells, following addition of dopamine. Messenger RNA encoding this new receptor appears to be widely distributed in the human brain, including cortical regions, choroid plexus, hippocampus, and brain stem. This new receptor appears to be identical to the recently described dopamine D5 receptor. A second closely related gene, GL39, was isolated and shown to represent a pseudogene, the first to be described in the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. This pseudogene exhibits 94% nucleotide sequence homology to the GL30 sequence and may have arisen from a gene duplication event followed by a mutation approximately 8 million years ago, prior to the emergence of man. This recently evolved pseudogene is transcribed in the human brain with a tissue distribution similar to that for its closely related functional gene.",
