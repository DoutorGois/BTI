     "AB": "The properties of retrograde amnesia after damage to the hippocampus have been explicated with some success using a rat model of human medial temporal lobe amnesia. We review the results of this experimental work with rats focusing on several areas of consensus in this growing literature. We evaluate the theoretically significant hypothesis that hippocampal retrograde amnesia normally exhibits a temporal gradient, affecting recent, but sparing remote memories. Surprisingly, the evidence does not provide much support for the idea that there is a lengthy process of systems consolidation following a learning episode. Instead, recent and remote memories tend to be equally affected. The extent of damage to the hippocampus is a significant factor in this work since it is likely that spared hippocampal tissue can support at least partial memory retrieval. With extensive hippocampal damage gradients are flat or, in the case of memory tasks with flavour/odour retrieval cues, the retrograde amnesia covers a period of about 1-3 days. There is consistent evidence that at the time of learning the hippocampus interferes with or overshadows memory acquisition by other systems. This contributes to the breadth and severity of retrograde amnesia relative to anterograde amnesia in the rat. The fact that multiple, distributed learning episodes can overcome this overshadowing is consistent with a parallel dual-store theory or a Distributed Reinstatement Theory in which each learning episode triggers a short period of memory replay that provides a brief hippocampal-dependent systems consolidation.",
