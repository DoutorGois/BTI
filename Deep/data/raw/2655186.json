     "AB": "We investigated the ability of postischemic insulin administration to modify the structural and neurobehavioral consequences of cerebral ischemia in rats. Forebrain ischemia was induced in fed rats by combining controlled systemic hypotension with bilateral carotid artery clamping for 10 1/2 minutes. Following clamp release, one group of six rats [corrected] was given insulin (2 IU/kg s.c. b.i.d.) for 1 week. An ischemic-control group of five rats [corrected] received no postischemic treatment. A sham-ischemia group of rats was used as a behavioral control. Throughout the recovery period until sacrifice, the drinking water of all rats was supplemented with 25% glucose. Rats were trained on two water maze place navigation tasks 1-2 months after ischemia. Escape latencies and swim patterns were recorded. Performance in the insulin-treated group was better than that in the ischemic-control group (p less than 0.05) on both tasks and did not differ significantly from that of the sham-ischemia group. Improvement in behavior correlated with a significant reduction in CA1 hippocampal necrosis in the insulin-treated group (p less than 0.05). Our findings demonstrate that postischemic treatment with insulin improves neurobehavioral performance in addition to lessening ischemic neuronal necrosis.",
