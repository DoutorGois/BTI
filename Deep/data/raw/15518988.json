     "AB": "Participants completed a category-learning task in which they needed to discover which of three stimulus dimensions (shape, color or size) was relevant. After meeting a learning criterion (nine of 10 consecutive correct responses), participants continued making categorization choices and response latencies associated with these trials were examined. In both Experiments 1 and 2, people responded reliably faster when correct responses matched the previous responses with respect to irrelevant dimension values. Thus, they demonstrated a form of incidental short-term memory analogous to that we previously reported in studies of rats. In Experiment 2, participants' explicit memory for irrelevant dimension values was assessed after category learning was complete. The results indicated that people were unaware of the irrelevant dimension values encountered on trials preceding surprise probe trials. This indicates that memory for the irrelevant dimension values was implicit (i.e. unconscious). The findings are discussed with respect to both human and non-human studies of hippocampus-independent memory and implicit memory.",
