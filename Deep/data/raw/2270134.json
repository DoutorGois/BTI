     "AB": "The brain of hibernating animals, controlling the physiological functions during the hibernation cycles, is itself subject to deep cooling during bouts of hibernation. This suggests its high tolerance to deep hypothermia. Effects of prolonged deep cooling were investigated in hippocampal and septal slices, taken from the brains of three groups of animals: hibernating ground squirrels, actively waking ground squirrels, and guinea-pigs. The slices were kept at a low temperature (2-4 degrees C) for various periods of time (from several hours up to six days) and periodically tested in warm (31 degrees C) incubation medium. The hippocampal field potentials (mainly of field CA1), as well as spontaneous activity of single neurons of hippocampus and medial septum were recorded. For comparative purposes mean amplitudes of population spikes and mean frequency of spontaneous neuronal discharge were used. Significant differences between the experimental groups were observed in recovery of functional activity of the slices after their dissection from the brain, as well as after deep cooling. In both cases re-establishment of neuronal activity in ground squirrels occurred more rapidly, than in guinea-pigs. The most dramatic was the difference in maximal time of survival of the slices under conditions of deep cooling. Independently of periodicity of the electrophysiological testing in warm medium, the slices taken from hibernating squirrels retained their activity for seven to nine days, the slices of waking ground squirrel hippocampus survived up to six to seven days, while those of guinea-pis did not recover their functional activity after cooling for more than one to two days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
