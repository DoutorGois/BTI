     "AB": "The plasticity of neural networks is a complex process determined by changes in physiological status, gene expression and phenotype of a cell. A detailed study of this process dynamics requires the simultaneous recording of electrical and genomic activities in networks of neurons. This sets up one of the tasks for modern neuroscience as development of integration of electrophysiology and molecular biology methods. In the paper we review the current approaches to such integration, as well as the choice of molecular markers for detection of genomic and synaptic plasticity of neurons by use of physiological micro-sensorial system based on neuronal cells cultured on the micro-electrode arrays.",
