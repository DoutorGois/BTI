     "PG": "27856-63",
     "AB": "L-Isoaspartyl (D-aspartyl) O-methyltransferase (PCMT1) is a protein repair enzyme that initiates the conversion of abnormal D-aspartyl and L-isoaspartyl residues to the normal L-aspartyl form. In the course of this reaction, PCMT1 converts the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). Due to the high level of activity of this enzyme, particularly in the brain, it seemed of interest to investigate whether the lack of PCMT1 activity might alter the concentrations of these small molecules. AdoMet and AdoHcy were measured in mice lacking PCMT1 (Pcmt1-/-), as well as in their heterozygous (Pcmt1+/-) and wild type (Pcmt1+/+) littermates. Higher levels of AdoMet and lower levels of AdoHcy were found in the brains of Pcmt1-/- mice, and to a lesser extent in Pcmt1+/- mice, when compared with Pcmt1+/+ mice. In addition, these levels appear to be most significantly altered in the hippocampus of the Pcmt1-/- mice. The changes in the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio could not be attributed to increases in the activities of methionine adenosyltransferase II or S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in the brain tissue of these mice. Because changes in the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio could potentially alter the overall excitatory state of the brain, this effect may play a role in the progressive epilepsy seen in the Pcmt1-/- mice.",
