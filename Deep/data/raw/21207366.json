     "AB": "Synaptic plasticity is the process by which the brain alters the strength of its synaptic connections, a fundamental function of the brain that enables individuals to learn from experience. The study of synaptic plasticity often involves the application of standard in vitro electrophysiological techniques to hippocampal slice preparations. This unit discusses many of the special considerations that are applicable for the optimal study of synaptic plasticity in this system. Most of these principles also apply to the study of synaptic plasticity in other brain slice preparations.",
