     "AB": "The report of a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme in mouse hippocampus (cyp7b) with close homology to cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase led us to determine the substrate specificity with respect to 27-hydroxycholesterol, known to be a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis. Transfection of 293/T-cells with PcDNA3.1(+)-mcyp7b was followed by metabolism of 2.5 microM 27-hydroxycholesterol to the 7 alpha-hydroxy intermediate, cholest-5-ene,3 beta,7 alpha,27-triol, with complete loss of down-regulation of cholesterol synthesis. Addition of 5 microM and 10 microM concentrations of the triol to HepG2 and CHO cells, respectively, also did not reduce cholesterol synthesis. The contrast between the biologic effect on cholesterol synthesis by these two C27 hydroxysterols and the wide tissue distribution of both cholesterol 27-hydroxylase and hydroxysterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase implies local regulatory effects prior to their further catabolism in the liver to chenodeoxycholic and cholic acids.",
