     "AB": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry was used to evaluate the accumulation of this enzyme in senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads using light and electron microscopy in Alzheimer's disease as well as non-demented aged brains. Under the electron microscope, a crystalline-like AChE precipitate was localized over paired helical filaments and straight filaments in both neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. AChE reaction product also decorated the amyloid fibrils in diffuse plaques as well as the halo and the heavy accumulation of amyloid which forms the core of classical plaques. In both diffuse plaques and the halo of classical plaques, we found AChE-positive structures resembling cell processes, which in some cases appeared to contain amyloid fibrils. The possible origin and significance of AChE localized over paired helical filaments, straight filaments and amyloid is discussed.",
