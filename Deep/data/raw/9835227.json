     "AB": "Changes of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) mRNA expression after transient brain ischemia and the effect of MK-801, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist, on the IP3R mRNA expression was studied in mongolian gerbil brain by in situ hybridization. Transient ischemia was induced by ligating left common carotid artery for 10 min, and the animals were allowed recovery from 15 min to 24 h. MK-801 was introduced intraperitoneally 30 min before ischemia. IP3R mRNA expression was decreased in dentate gyrus and hippocampus from 90 min until 24 h after ischemia. MK-801 pretreatment prevented the change of IP3R mRNA expression after ischemia. These results suggest that IP3R mRNA expression in ischemia may be related with NMDA receptor.",
