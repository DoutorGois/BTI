     "AB": "Subchronic treatment with MAP (4.6 mg/kg, i.p., once daily for 11 days) significantly decreased the Kd, but not Bmax, values of [3H]1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine ([3H]DPCPX) binding to adenosine A1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, but not striatum, of rat brain. However, subchronic treatment with PCP (10 mg/kg, i.p., once daily for 11 days) did not alter the Kd and Bmax values of [3H]DPCPX binding to adenosine A1 receptors in these three regions. Subchronic treatment with MAP or PCP did not alter the Bmax and Kd values of [3H]2-p-(2-carboxyehyl)phenethylamino-5'-N-ethylcarboxyamidoadenosine ([3H]CGS21680) binding to adenosine A2A receptors in the striatum. Furthermore, subchronic treatment with MAP or PCP significantly decreased the specific binding of [3H]CGS21680 to adenosine A2A receptors in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex. Thus, these results suggest that MAP and PCP may produce differential effects on the adenosine A2A receptors, but not adenosine A1 receptors in rat brain.",
