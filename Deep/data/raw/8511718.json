     "AB": "Physiological studies and inferences from invertebrate models implicate Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive adenylyl cyclase with memory processes. However, Ca2+/calmodulin-insensitive adenylyl cyclase also occurs in brain, and its neuronal functions are less clear. Two oligonucleotide probes, based on rat cDNAs for Types I and II adenylyl cyclase, which appear to correspond to these functional forms, were used to conduct in situ hybridization analysis of the relative abundance and localization of these two species in the rat brain as a first step in evaluating their neuronal role. Quite discrete patterns of expression were encountered; in some areas, both species were co-expressed, but in others, little overlap was observed. The differential expression of the two mRNAs suggests that discrete roles may be fulfilled by the two adenylyl cyclases in neural tissues.",
