     "AB": "(+)N-[11C]methyl-3-piperidyl benzilate, a relatively low affinity muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist was synthesized by N-[11C]methylation of (+)3-piperidyl benzilate using [11C]methyl iodide. The product was isolated by HPLC, and obtained with radiochemical yield of 60-70% from [11C]methyl iodide, and a specific activity of 500-1000 Ci mmol-1 (18.5-37 GBq mumol-1) at EOS and radiochemical purity of > 98%. In vitro autoradiographic studies showed selective binding for this radiotracer in the different regions of the rat brain: high in corpus striatum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and low in cerebellum, consistent with muscarinic cholinergic receptor distributions. This radiotracer thus had potential as radioligand for positron emission tomography.",
