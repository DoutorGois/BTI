     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the occurrence of neuron activation, neurodegeneraion and cell death, and the correlation among them in the hippocampus after status epilepticus. METHODS: CFV, Fluoro Jade B and c-Fos staining were done at multiple time points after pilocarpine induced status epilepticus. RESULTS: In the stratum granulosum of dentate gyrus, c-Fos positive neurons increased significantly at 1 h, 2 h and 1 d after status epilepticus (P<0.01 or 0.05). However, almost no Fluoro Jade B staining cell was found in the stratum granulosum in the experiment and control groups, and no obvious difference was shown on the numbers of CFV staining cells in this area among all groups. In the hilus of dentate gyrus of different groups, there were no c-Fos positive neurons in all groups. In the hilus, the number of Fluoro Jade B staining cells significantly increased at 2 h and 1 d after the status epilepticus (P<0.01), and the number of CFV staining neurons dramatically decreased 1 d after the status epilepticus (P<0.01) compared with the control. In the stratum pyramidale of CA1, the numbers of c-Fos positive neurons at 30 mim, 1 h, 2 h and 1 d, and Fluoro Jade B staining cells at 2 h and 1 d after the status epilepticus significantly increased(P<0.01 or 0.05), while no obvious difference in the number of CFV staining cells in the stratum pyramidale of CA1 among different groups was shown. CONCLUSION: There is no direct correlation among cell activation, neuron degeneration and cell death in the hippocampus of mice after pilocarpine induced status epilepticus.",
