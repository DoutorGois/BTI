     "AB": "The medial septum and diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) provide a major input to the hippocampus and are important for spatial learning and memory. Although electrolytic MSDB lesions have prominent memory impairing effects, selective lesions of either cholinergic or GABAergic MSDB neurons do not or only mildly impair spatial memory. MSDB neurons are targets of orexin-containing neurons from the hypothalamus. At present, the functional significance of orexin afferents to MSDB is unclear, and the present study investigated a possible involvement of orexin innervation of the MSDB in spatial memory. Orexin-saporin, a toxin that damages neurons containing the hypocretin-2 receptor, was administered into the MSDB of rats. Rats were subsequently tested on a water maze to assess spatial reference memory and a plus maze to assess spatial working memory. At 100 ng/microl, orexin-saporin destroyed primarily GABAergic septohippocampal neurons, sparing the majority of cholinergic neurons. At 200 ng/microl, orexin-saporin almost totally eliminated GABAergic septohippocampal neurons and destroyed many cholinergic neurons. Spatial reference memory was impaired at both concentrations of orexin-saporin with a dramatic impairment observed for 24-h retention. Short-term reference memory was also impaired at both concentrations. Rats treated with 200 ng/microl, but not 100 ng/microl, of orexin-saporin were also impaired on a spontaneous alternation task, showing a deficit in spatial working memory. Our results, together with previous studies, suggest that orexin innervation of the MSDB may modulate spatial memory by acting on both GABAergic and cholinergic septohippocampal neurons.",
