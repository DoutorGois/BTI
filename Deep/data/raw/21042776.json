     "AB": "Oxidative stress has been implicated in a number of neurological disorders, including cerebral ischemia and neuro-degenerative diseases. Comprehensive proteomic studies were carried out using an immortalized mouse hippocampal cell line, HT22, exhibiting oxidative stress-mediated cell death upon glutamate treatment. Two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE) of subcellular organelle fractions revealed that significant numbers of proteins showed quantitative changes during HT22 cell death, among which a total of 51 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The identified proteins indicate that HT22 cell death occurs through perturbations in mitochondrial function, changes in translational elongation machinery, and translocation of proteins across subcellular organelles. This list of proteins may shed light on oxidative stress-mediated neuronal cell death.",
