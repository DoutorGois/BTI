     "AB": "The effect of different temperatures of ACSF (18-42 degrees C) on carbachol (CCH)-induced field potentials were examined in the present study. Two hundred and thirty one experiments were performed on hippocampal formation slices maintained in a gas-liquid interface chamber. All slices were perfused with 50 microM CCH. A recording electrode was positioned in the region of CA3c pyramidal cells. The experiments gave two main findings. First, in a presence of continuous cholinergic stimulation the temperature of the bathing medium per se determined the rate of synchronization of the field potentials and pattern of EEG activity recorded. Second, within the temperature range from 33 degrees to 37 degrees C a window effect of temperature on CCH-induced theta-like activity (TLA) was noted: in this temperature range all slices tested responded only with one pattern of EEG activity-TLA. The results are discussed in light of temperature effects on hippocampal neuronal networks.",
