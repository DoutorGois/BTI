     "AB": "The neonatal hippocampus exhibits regularly recurring waves of synchronized neuronal activity in vitro. Because active sleep (AS), characterized by bursts of phasic motor activity in the form of myoclonic twitching, may provide conditions that are conducive to activity-dependent development of hippocampal circuits, we hypothesized that the waves of synchronous neuronal activity that have been observed in vitro would be associated with AS-related twitching. Using unanesthetized 1- to 12-d-old rats, we report here that the majority of neurons in CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG) are significantly more active during AS than during either quiet sleep or wakefulness. Neuronal activity typically occurs in phasic bursts, during which most neurons are significantly cross-correlated both within and across the CA1 and DG fields. All AS-active neurons increase their firing rates during periods of myoclonic twitching of the limbs, and a subset of these neurons exhibit a burst of activity immediately after limb twitches, suggesting that the twitches themselves provide sensory feedback to the infant hippocampus, as occurs in the infant spinal cord and neocortex. Finally, the synchronous bursts of neuronal activity are coupled to the emergence of the AS-related hippocampal gamma rhythm during the first postnatal week, as well as the emergence of the AS-related theta rhythm during the second postnatal week. We hypothesize that the phasic motor events of active sleep provide the developing hippocampus with discrete sensory stimulation that contributes to the development and refinement of hippocampal circuits as well as the development of synchronized interactions between hippocampus and neocortex.",
