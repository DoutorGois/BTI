     "AB": "The reduction in the secretion of ovarian hormones, principally estrogen, is a consequence of menopause. Estrogens act primarily as female sex hormones, but also exert effects on different physiological systems including the central nervous system. The treatment normally used to reduce the symptoms of menopause is the hormone therapy, which seems to be effective in treating symptoms, but it may be responsible for adverse effects. Based on this, there is an increasing demand for alternative therapies that minimize signs and symptoms of menopause. In the present study we investigated the effect of ovariectomy and/or physical exercise on the activities of energy metabolism enzymes, such as creatine kinase (cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions), pyruvate kinase, succinate dehydrogenase, complex II, cytochrome c oxidase, as well as on ATP levels in the hippocampus of adult rats. Adult female Wistar rats with 90 days of age were subjected to ovariectomy (an animal model widely used to mimic the postmenopausal changes). Thirty days after the procedure, the rats were submitted to the exercise protocol, which was performed three times a week for 30 days. Twelve hours after the last training session, the rats were decapitated for subsequent biochemical analyzes. Results showed that ovariectomy did not affect the activities of pyruvate kinase, succinate dehydrogenase and complex II, but decreased the activities of creatine kinase (cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions) and cytochrome c oxidase. ATP levels were also reduced. Exercise did not produce the expected results since it was only able to partially reverse the activity of creatine kinase cytosolic fraction. The results of this study suggest that estrogen deficiency, which occurs as a result of ovariectomy, affects generation systems and energy homeostasis, reducing ATP levels in hippocampus of adult female rats.",
