Clinically, the diagnosis of Parkinson's dementia is characterized by executive deficits, which can be identified by neuropsychological tests. In the individual case, differentiating this from other forms of dementia with extrapyramidal motor symptoms can be very difficult. With regard to therapy, there is evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors may be effective.",
