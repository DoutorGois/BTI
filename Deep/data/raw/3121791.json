     "AB": "Antisera against glycogen synthase from canine brain were prepared and used for investigation of the localization of the enzyme in the brain. Antisera cross-reacted only with the 88-kilodalton protein that is the subunit of brain glycogen synthase. Immunoreactivity of glycogen synthase was universally distributed in all regions of the brain, although hippocampus, cerebral cortex, caudatoputamen, and cerebellar cortex had relatively high immunoreactivity. Light microscopic examination revealed that the immunoreactivity was found in all cell types, such as neurons in several regions, astrocytes, ependymal cells surrounding the ventricle, oligodendrocytes, and epithelial cells of the choroid plexus in the ventricle. Immunoreactive intensity was more prominent in neurons than glial cells. Immunostaining may be a useful tool for investigation of the state of glycogen metabolism under normal and pathological conditions.",
