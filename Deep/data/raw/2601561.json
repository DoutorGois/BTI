     "AB": "Intracerebroventricular (ICV) Injection of aluminum tartrate (ALT 205.7 mcg) in the rat induces a progressive encephalopathy characterized by neurobehavioral derangements, by the slowing of the background rhythm of the quantitative electroencephalogram and by learning and memory deficits. The condition, lethal within about 35 days, is associated with a reduced ability of cerebral synaptosomes to incorporate radiolabeled 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) in vitro. The present study surveyed and compared the in vivo regional cerebral glucose uptake (rCGlu) capacity of rats injected with ALT 7 or 14 days previously either by the ICV or intraperitoneal (120 mg/Kg) routes. ICV injection produces transient rCGlu depression in caudate-putamen, geniculate bodies and periaquaeductal gray, resolving by day 14. Thalamic nuclei exhibit depressed rCGlu by the 7th day undergoing further depression by day 14. The rCGlu of occipitoparietal cortices, normal at day 7, was increased by day 14. In contrast, peripheral aluminum administration produced transient rCGlu depression in olfactory bulbs, frontal and occipitoparietal cortices, nucleus accumbens and cerebellum, and transiently increased rCGlu in the geniculate nuclei. These effects, present by day 7, had resolved by day 14 when rCGlu had increased in the previously normal pontine nuclei and decreased in the previously normal hippocampus. Neither treatment changed rCGlu in the septal nuclei, globus pallidus, amygdala, olfactory cortex, substantia nigra, superior or inferior colliculi or the medullary nuclei. The pattern of anomalies in cerebral 2DG incorporation most probably indexes the deranged glucoregulatory and metabolic demands of these brain areas in the aluminum intoxicated state.",
