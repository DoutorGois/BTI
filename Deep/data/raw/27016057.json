     "AB": "Baicalin has a significant neuroprotective effect in stroke. However, the mechanism remains unclear. This study was to reveal the mechanisms by which baicalin protected hippocampal neurons and improved learning and memory impairment after global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in gerbil. In the present study, the Morris water maze test showed that baicalin significantly improved learning and memory impairment after global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in gerbils. Laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscope examination showed that baicalin suppressed OGD-induced augmentation of intracellular calcium concentration. Western blotting analysis indicated that baicalin suppressed ischemia-caused elevated phosphorylation level of CaMKII in vivo, in hippocampal neurons in culture, and in SH-SY5Y cells in culture. Western blotting, TUNEL and RNA interference technology were applied to detect effects of baicalin on neuronal apoptosis. We found that baicalin, a CaMKII inhibitor and knocking down the CaMKII prevented OGD-induced apoptosis of hippocampal or SH-SY5Y cells in culture. Therefore, these results suggested that baicalin improves learning and memory impairment induced by global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in gerbils via attenuating the phosphorylation level of CaMKII and further preventing hippocampal neuronal apoptosis.",
