     "AB": "The information transfer from the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex (EC) to the hippocampus is regulated in a frequency dependent manner. Phencyclidine and related compounds such as MK-801 produce psychotic symptoms that closely resemble schizophrenia. We studied the effects of systemic administration of MK-801 on the signal transfer from the EC layer III to the hippocampal area CA1. High frequency (above 10 Hz) activation of the bi-synaptic entorhinal input in control animals results in a strong suppression of the field potentials in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the area CA1. In contrast, in MK-801 pretreated rats the field response was less reduced. The field potential responses evoked in these two groups of animals by high-frequency activation of the monosynaptic input were similar suggesting selective alterations in layer III of the medial EC. We suggest, that MK-801 causes disinhibition of layer III projection cells and, therefore, may cause strong, pathological activation of direct layer III-CA1 pathway.",
