     "AB": "The release of catecholamines, dopamine and noradrenaline has been suggested to play a role in mediating ischemic damage in susceptible brain regions, the hippocampus and striatum. We now provide evidence that suggests a role for adrenoceptors in the deficit of 2-deoxyglucose uptake and CA1 field potential induced in hippocampal slices by hypoxia/hypoglycemia (ischemia). Treatment with alpha 1- or beta-adrenoceptor agonists or cAMP potentiated an ischemia-induced decline of both 2-deoxyglucose uptake and CA1 field potential in hippocampal slices, whereas alpha 1- or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, or alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists produced a remarkable neuroprotective action against these deficits. The results indicate that stimulation of adrenoceptors may play a detrimental role in the development of ischemic damage, and suggest a neuroprotective action for adrenoceptor antagonists, which may lessen the functional deficits induced by ischemia.",
