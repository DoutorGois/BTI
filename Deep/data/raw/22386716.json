     "AB": "3-n-Butylphthalide (NBP) has been shown to have protective effects against ischemic stroke. In the present study, we investigated effects of l-3-n-butylphthalide (l-NBP) on the learning and memory impairment induced by chronic cerebral ischemia in rats. Male Wistar rats were administered 20 mg/kg l-NBP by gavage daily for 30 days after the bilateral common carotid artery clamping (two-vessel occlusion, 2-VO). Results showed that daily treatments of 20 mg/kg l-NBP significantly attenuated spatial learning deficits in Morris water maze (MWM) task. Results of long-term potentiation (LTP) indicated that treatment with 20 mg/kg l-NBP attenuated the inhibition of LTP in rat model of 2-VO. Moreover, l-NBP reduced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes induced by chronic cerebral ischemia. The present findings demonstrate the protective effect of l-NBP on chronic cerebral ischemia-induced hippocampus injury, which supports using l-NBP for therapy of cerebral ischemia in the future.",
