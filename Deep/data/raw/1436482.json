     "AB": "Slices were made from the hippocampus of gerbils following transient ischemia achieved by clamping the carotid arteries for 5 min, and changes in the electrophysiology of CA1 pyramidal neurons were studied by whole cell patch-clamp recording as well as conventional intracellular recording. The great majority of CA1 neurons in slices made 2.5-3 days after ischemia showed reduced resting potentials and were easily depolarized by prolonged low-frequency stimulation or by tetanic stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural input. This stimulus-induced depolarization was accelerated by intracellular injection of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, which depolarized membrane potentials towards 0 mV without synaptic input stimulation. Intracellular application of BAPTA, a Ca2+ chelator, effectively blocked the stimulus-induced depolarization. When recording from ischemic neurons with patch pipettes containing both D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and BAPTA, excitatory postsynaptic currents were transiently potentiated by stimulation, but the membrane potential did not show stimulus-induced depolarization and remained steady for long periods. These results lend support to the view that the intracellular Ca2+ regulation system is severely disturbed following ischemia, and that input fiber stimulation leads to abnormal Ca2+ accumulation in ischemic neurons resulted in neuronal death. The reduction of free Ca2+ inside the ischemic neuron by BAPTA apparently saves neurons which are otherwise destined to delayed neuronal death.",
