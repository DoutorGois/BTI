     "AB": "Cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor crucial for late phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) induction and maintenance. Upon multiple high frequency stimulation (MHFS), large Ca(2+) influx activates adenylyl cyclase. This, in turn, activates PKA, which by itself or through MAPK p42/p44 can activate (phosphorylate) CREB. Upon phosphorylation, P-CREB activates multiple genes essential for L-LTP generation. Calcium calmodulin kinase IV (CaMKIV) is also activated by calcium and can directly activate CREB. We have shown previously that hypothyroidism impairs L-LTP and reduces the basal protein levels of CREB, MAPK p42/p44, and CaMKIV in area CA1 of the hippocampus. In the present study, levels of these signaling molecules were determined in area CA1 during the induction and maintenance phases of L-LTP. Standard MHFS was used to evoke L-LTP in the CA1 area of hypothyroid, levothyroxin treated hypothyroid and sham control anesthetized adult rats. Chronic levothyroxin treatment reversed hypothyroidism-induced L-LTP impairment. Five minutes after MHFS, western blotting showed an increase in the levels of P-CREB, and P-MAPK p42/p44 in sham-operated control, and levothyroxin treated hypothyroid animals, but not in hypothyroid animals. The protein levels of total CREB, total MAPK p42/p44, BDNF and CaMKIV were not altered in all groups five minutes after MHFS. Four hours after MHFS, the levels of P-CREB, and P-MAPK p42/p44 remained unchanged in hypothyroid animals, while they were elevated in sham-operated control, and levothyroxin treated hypothyroid animals. We conclude that respective normalized phosphorylation of essential kinases such as P-CREB and P-MAPK p42/p44 is correlated with restoration of normal L-LTP induction and maintenance in the CA1 area of levothyroxin-treated hypothyroid animals.",
