     "AB": "Peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent bacterial endotoxin, can cause a variety of central effects, including production of cytokines and cyclooxygenases in the brain, as well as peripheral increases in corticosterone. These, in turn, may contribute to neuroimmune-induced neurocognitive deficits. We show here LPS causes deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning in the water maze but that treatment with ibuprofen, a broad-spectrum cyclooxygenase inhibitor, reverses the deficits induced in spatial learning by LPS. We also show that LPS causes an impairment in the induction of long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus in vivo, a major contemporary model of learning and memory. No differences were found in corticosterone levels in trunk blood but we find a decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in LPS group compared to saline controls. Paradoxically compared to the behavioral findings treatment with ibuprofen does not attenuate the LPS-induced impairment in LTP or BDNF concentration in tetanized tissue.",
