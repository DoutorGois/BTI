     "AB": "In response to chronic stress, oestrogen receptor (ER)alpha acts as an anxiogenic agent as opposed to ERbeta which predominantly acts as an anxiolytic agent. These properties of ER play an important role in mediating anxiety- and depression-like behaviour and physiological responses. However, the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear. In particular, not much is known about the expression of ERalpha and ERbeta in the stress-sensitive brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Using a rodent model of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), we report that two weeks of CUMS in young male mice (10+/-2weeks) induces noteworthy changes in the ratio of ERalpha/ERbeta in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. While we observed a significant (P<0.05) increase in ERalpha mRNA and protein expression levels, the expression of ERbeta in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala was significantly reduced. This increase in ERalpha expression with concomitant decrease in ERbeta expression was associated with increased anxiety- and depression-like behaviour as observed in elevated plus maze test, open field test, forced swim test and sucrose preference test. In addition to these behavioural changes, we report the decrease of dendritic complexity with concomitant increase in spine density in the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsohippocampal CA3 region and basolateral complex of amygdala (BLA). Taken together, these results suggest that the CUMS-induced increase in the ratio of ERalpha/ERbeta causes dendritic remodeling, which in turn might be responsible for increase in anxiety- and depression-like behaviour in young male mice.",
