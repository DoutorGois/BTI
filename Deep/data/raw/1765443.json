     "AB": "Gadolinium DTPA and DOTA are being used extensively for imaging blood-brain barrier lesions. This study was performed to determine clinically relevant blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and neural tissue concentrations of these agents, and to determine if they alter neural tissue glucose metabolism. Bolus injections of 0.2 mmol Gd-DTPA/kg were made in rabbits, and blood, CSF, and neural tissue Gd concentrations were measured using atomic emission. Rat hippocampus slices were incubated for 6 hours in solutions of Gd-DTPA and Gd-DOTA, and effects on the production of carbon-14-labeled CO2 from glucose determined. Plasma concentrations reached a peak of 2.46 mmol at 1 minute postinjection, and dropped to 50% of peak in 6 minutes. The highest CSF concentration observed was approximately 0.1 mmol, and the mean lumbar cord concentration was approximately 8.5 mumol/g. Gd-DTPA and Gd-DOTA concentrations greater than 1.0 mmol caused significant increases in CO2 production. In areas of blood-brain barrier lesions, Gd-DTPA and Gd-DOTA may cause changes in tissue metabolism; however, in other areas it is much less likely.",
