     "AB": "Nociceptin/orphanin FQ (NOP/OFQ) is the endogenous ligand for the NOP receptor and is processed from a precursor protein in the family of opioid peptides. Prepronociceptin (ppN/OFQ) mRNA has been shown to be upregulated by an increase in cAMP, a treatment that leads to differentiation of NS20Y neuroblastoma cells. Although a large increase in endogenous ppN/OFQ mRNA upon cAMP stimulation can be shown in cellular systems, a similar increase cannot be expressed in pGL3 luciferase vector containing 1.3 kb proximal promoter, suggesting that a larger portion of the sequence or a different chromatin structure is necessary for a fully functional promoter. The induction of ppN/OFQ mRNA by cAMP appears to be mediated by a cAMP-response element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays show that CREB is recruited to the promoter region upon treatment of NS20Y cells with dibutyryl cAMP. In addition, the production of ppN/OFQ mRNA is regulated by histone acetylation, also through CREB, as the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A increases both CREB binding to the promoter and ppN/OFQ mRNA expression. In rat progenitor and mouse neuroblastoma cell lines, agents that increase ppN/OFQ mRNA expression also induce neurite outgrowth, suggesting a close relationship between ppN/OFQ and cellular differentiation.",
