     "AB": "It is well established that astrocytes release gliotransmitters and moderate neuronal activity in the central nervous system via intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics. Astrocytic Ca(2+) oscillations are one type of spontaneous Ca(2+) mobilization that occurs in astrocytes. However, the modulation of spontaneous astrocytic Ca(2+) oscillations, especially in pathophysiological conditions, is not yet fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that activation of adenosine receptors induces a long-lasting increase in the frequency of astrocytic Ca(2+) oscillations in rat hippocampal slice cultures. The long-term facilitation of the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillations was mediated by endogenous adenosine generated via breakdown of extracellular ATP by ecto-ATPase. We also demonstrate that local tissue injury with ultraviolet irradiation can cause this long-term facilitation of Ca(2+) oscillations via endogenous adenosine. Our data suggest that endogenous adenosine is one of the modulators of spontaneous astrocytic Ca(2+) oscillations in the rat hippocampus, and may play a significant role in altered Ca(2+) dynamics in astrocytes observed during pathophysiological conditions.",
