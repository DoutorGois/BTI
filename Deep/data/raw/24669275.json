     "AB": "Neuronal Per-Arnt-Sim domain protein 4 (NPAS4) is important in regulating transcription and function in the limbic system and in brain development. Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a common complication following a stroke. Furthermore, organic damage as a result of a stroke affects the restoration of nerve function and indicates that hippocampal neural activity may be associated with PSD. A PSD rat model was established via a middle cerebral artery occlusion procedure, which was combined with isolation and chronic unexpected mild stress, and was used to investigate the expression of the NPAS4 gene in the hippocampus. The neurological deficit and behavior were evaluated and NPAS4 mRNA expression was measured by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; furthermore, the association with cognitive impairment was analyzed. The PSD rats displayed neuropsychopathic disorders and the NPAS4 mRNA expression levels in the hippocampus were significantly lower in the depression and PSD groups compared with the control group. Therefore, the present study identified that NPAS4 expression was decreased in the hippocampus of PSD rats.",
