     "AB": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes delayed neuronal deficits that in principle could be prevented by timely intervention with therapeutic genes. However, appropriate vectors for gene transfer to the brain with TBI remain to be developed. First-generation adenoviruses (fgAd) are usually associated with inflammatory and toxic effects when inoculated into brains, despite their high efficiency of gene transfer to these tissues. In this study the authors attempted to determine whether a less immunogenic gene-transfer protocol can be established in the traumatically injured rat brain using helper-dependent adenoviruses (hdAd), a novel adenoviral construct with full deletion of viral coding sequences. Their results show that transgene expression from intrahippocampally inoculated hdAd is maintained for at least 2 months after TBI, in contrast to the much shorter duration of fgAd-mediated gene expression. There was only minimal secretion of proinflammatory IL-1beta and TNF-alpha after inoculation of hdAd. Furthermore, the hdAd-mediated gene expression was associated with less microglial proliferation, astrocytic activation, and macrophage infiltration than observed in fgAd-inoculated brains. There was no additional tissue loss after hdAd inoculation compared with PBS injection. Although both anti-adenoviral and neutralizing antibodies were found in serum after brain inoculation of hdAd, they did not appear to affect transgene expression. The results suggest that hdAd are less immunogenic vectors than conventional adenoviral vectors, and offer improved vehicles for long-term therapeutic transgene transfer to traumatically injured brains.",
