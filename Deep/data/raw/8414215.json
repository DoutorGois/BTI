     "AB": "The effects of immobilization stress on the cerebral second messenger (adenylate cyclase and phosphoinositide) were investigated autoradiographically in mongolian gerbils. After 10 min (10-min stress group, n = 7), or after 6 h (6-h stress group, n = 7) of fixation on a flat board while supine, in vitro autoradiography was performed using [3H]forskolin (3H-FK) and [3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (3H-PDBu) as specific ligands to identify the distribution of adenylate cyclase and protein kinase C, respectively. In another group of 7 gerbils (control group), the same autoradiographic procedure was performed immediately after the animals were removed from the cage. In the 10-min stress group, FK binding was significantly decreased in the hypothalamus and amygdala, but significantly increased in the basal ganglia including the caudate-putamen and globus pallidus. FK binding in the 6-h stress group tended to increase throughout the brain, rising significantly in the basal ganglia. PDBu binding in either stress group did not change significantly compared to the control group in any region except the hippocampal CA3 region of the 6-h stress group. Under immobilization stress, the adenylate cyclase system may undergo time-dependent and regionally specific changes, while the phosphoinositide system remains relatively stable.",
