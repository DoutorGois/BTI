     "AB": "This study was designed to correlate histopathological changes in gerbil brain following unilateral primary and secondary ischemia to enzymatic-adenylate cyclase damage. At three hrs permanent occlusion of the right common carotid artery only minimal histological changes were evident in cerebrum, hippocampus, striatum and olfactory tubercle while the enzyme responses were unremarkable. Severe histological and enzymatic alterations were present at one hour of recirculation subsequent to 3 hrs of unilateral occlusion. Similar damage was evident at 6 and 24 hrs permanent occlusion. Principal enzyme damage was directed toward basal activity, as well as stimulation of the catalytic (forskolin-sensitive) sites on the enzyme complex. For the most part the transducer (GTP-sensitive) site was unaffected by ischemia until 24 hr ligation. These changes were observed in only those gerbils developing severe symptoms of stroke.",
