     "AB": "The midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key structure of the mesocorticolimbic system is anatomically connected with the hippocampal formation. In addition mesocortical dopamine was found to influence hippocampus-related memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, both being linked to the theta rhythm. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible role of the VTA in the regulation of the hippocampal theta activity. The study was performed on urethane-anesthetized male Wistar rats in which theta rhythm was evoked by tail pinch. It was found that unilateral, temporal inactivation of the VTA by means of direct procaine injection resulted in bilateral suppression of the hippocampal theta which manifested as a loss of synchronization of hippocampal EEG and respective reduction of the power and also the frequency of the 3-6 Hz theta band. Depression of the power of the 3-6 Hz component of the EEG signal was also seen in spontaneous hippocampal EEG after procaine. The permanent destruction of the VTA by means of unilateral electrocoagulation evoked a long-lasting, mainly ipsilateral depression of the power of the theta with some influence on its frequency. Simultaneously, there was a substantial increase of the power in higher frequency bands indicating decrease of a synchrony of the hippocampal EEG activity. On the basis of these results indicating impairment of synchronization of the hippocampal activity the VTA may be considered as another part of the brainstem theta synchroning system.",
