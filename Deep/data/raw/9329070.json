     "AB": "Animals from two substrains of AB mice, i.e., ABH/Md and ABG/Md, differ in the occurrence of aggressive behavior. After maturation, male ABH mice regularly exhibited abnormal aggressive behavior making group-housing impossible. In contrast, ABG animals never showed such behavioral patterns. To elucidate the role of opioid mechanisms, we tested the reaction of these animals to morphine in the hot plate test. Moreover, specific DAMGO binding was measured. It was shown that mice from control groups differed significantly in reaction to the thermal stimulus. ABH mice had significantly longer reaction times. With increasing doses of morphine this difference disappeared, suggesting different levels of basal activity in endogenous opioid systems. This is underlined by significantly lower DAMGO binding in aggressive ABH mice. The results suggest that differences in endogenous opioid systems may account for differences in aggressiveness.",
