     "AB": "We evolved muscarinic receptors in yeast to generate a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are activated solely by a pharmacologically inert drug-like and bioavailable compound (clozapine-N-oxide). Subsequent screening in human cell lines facilitated the creation of a family of muscarinic acetylcholine GPCRs suitable for in vitro and in situ studies. We subsequently created lines of telomerase-immortalized human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells stably expressing all five family members and found that each one faithfully recapitulated the signaling phenotype of the parent receptor. We also expressed a G(i)-coupled designer receptor in hippocampal neurons (hM(4)D) and demonstrated its ability to induce membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal silencing. We have thus devised a facile approach for designing families of GPCRs with engineered ligand specificities. Such reverse-engineered GPCRs will prove to be powerful tools for selectively modulating signal-transduction pathways in vitro and in vivo.",
