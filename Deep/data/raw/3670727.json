     "AB": "The loss and recovery of hippocampal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) molecular forms was studied following fornix lesions. Two weeks after lesioning, the G4 form, which constituted the majority (91%) of AChE activity in the unlesioned hippocampus, was significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) to levels 21% of those in the unlesioned hippocampus, suggesting that this form is probably presynaptic. Thirteen weeks after lesioning total hippocampal AChE activity had increased 3-fold relative to 2-week animals, with the majority of the recovery in total AChE activity being due to a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in the abundance of the G4 form to levels 340% of those at 2 weeks. The increase in the abundance of the G4 form, which appears to be a functionally important molecular form of AChE within the CNS, serves as a marker of the integrity of the newly formed hippocampal cholinergic synapses.",
