     "AB": "Spatial memory learning is related to the functioning of a neuronal circuit composed of cortical, hippocampal and diencephalic brain regions. The Morris water maze (MWM) is frequently used to assess spatial memory in rats. In this study, the neuronal functional activity of some brain limbic system regions after a memory task in adult male Wistar rats injected with scopolamine (1.0mg/kg, i.p.) was assessed using cytochrome oxidase (COx) histochemistry. The rats were trained following a working memory schedule in the MWM. A trained group injected with saline and an untreated control group were examined to compare changes in COx activity in the dorsal hippocampus, anterior thalamus, mammillary nuclei, prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area. The scopolamine-treated group showed an impairment of spatial learning. Also, a decrease in COx activity was found in this group as compared to the saline group in the anteroventral and anteromedial thalamic nuclei. Overall, these findings suggest that memory deficits induced by scopolamine may be due to impairment of the cholinergic function in the anterior thalamic nuclei.",
