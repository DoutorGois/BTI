MRS was used to study medial temporal and parietal regions in 60 cognitively healthy subjects older than 85 years. Subjects with small hippocampal volumes, a putative risk factor for dementia, had significantly lower NAA/mI in parietal and temporal lobes compared with other subjects. Neuropsychological tests and APOE genotype did not correlate with MRS ratios. MRS measures are candidate biomarkers for dementia risk.",
