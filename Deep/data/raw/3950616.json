     "AB": "The effects of intraperitoneally administered 4-(1-naphthylvinyl)pyridine (NVP; 200 mg/kg) on the concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh), choline (Ch), and acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) in rat striatum, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum were investigated. Twenty minutes after treatment, the content of ACh was significantly diminished, whereas that of Ch was increased. In response to stress (swimming for 20 min), these changes were enhanced. However, the AcCoA content did not change in any of the brain regions. It is thus very likely that the decrease of brain ACh concentration induced by NVP is due to the drug's effect on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and/or the reduction of the high-affinity Ch uptake, and not on the availability of AcCoA. Presumably, the pharmacologically diminished activity of ChAT may become the rate-limiting factor in the maintenance of ACh levels in cholinergic neurons.",
