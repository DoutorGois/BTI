     "AB": "Chronic stress is widely recognized as a risk factor for the development of major depression and anxiety disorders. Recently, we reported that yokukansan (YKS), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, alleviated emotional abnormality in stress-maladaptive mice. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of YKS on the expression of excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) 1-4 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in stress-maladaptive mice. Mice were chronically exposed to inadaptable stress, i.e. repeated restraint stress for 240 min/day for 14 days. After the final exposure to stress, brains of mice were rapidly removed and the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were dissected. Expressions of EAAT1-4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytes, in the brain tissues were analyzed by western blotting. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression level of EAAT2 was specifically decreased in the hippocampus of stress-maladaptive mice while there were no changes in the level of GFAP, and this change was inhibited by chronic treatment with YKS. In contrast, no changes were observed in the levels of EAAT1, EAAT3 or EAAT4 in stress-maladaptive mice. These results suggest that YKS may protect against the decrease in hippocampal EAAT2 expression induced by stress maladaptation, and this may contribute, at least in part, to the improvement of emotional abnormality.",
