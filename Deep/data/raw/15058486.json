     "PG": "87-98",
     "AB": "At 4 h during pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (DPISE) in rat, protein kinase C (PKC)beta1, PKCbeta2, and PKCgamma were induced at the border between the stratum oriens and alveus (O/A border) of CA1 in the hippocampus. Induced PKCgamma was colocalized with metabotropic glutamate receptor alpha (mGluR alpha). By intracerebroventricular injection of mGluR1alpha antagonists, (RS)-1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA), PKCbeta1, PKCbeta2, and PKCgamma immunoreactive products decreased dramatically; however, intracerebroventricular injection of saline did not change the expression of PKCbeta1, PKCbeta2, and PKCgamma, suggesting that these three PKC isoforms might be involved in mGluR1alpha-related excitoneurotoxicity. One day after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (APISE), PKCdelta was induced in microglial cells. At this time point, both PKCgamma and PKCepsilon immunopositive products decreased in the inner molecular layer of upper blade of the stratum granulosum. At 7-31 days APISE, induced PKCbeta1, PKCdelta, PKCeta, and PKCzeta positive astrocytes were demonstrated in all parts of hippocampus, suggesting that they may be involved in gliosis. By this time, both PKCgamma and PKCepsilon immunopositive products in the inner molecular layer had almost disappeared, suggesting that they may be involved in the inhibition of granule cells by controlling neurotransmitter release presynaptically in the dentate gyrus of normal rats.",
