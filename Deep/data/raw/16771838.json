     "AB": "Neurogenesis in the adult human brain occurs within two principle neurogenic regions, the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles. Recent reports demonstrated the isolation of human neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) from these regions, but due to limited tissue availability the knowledge of their phenotype and differentiation behavior is restricted. Here we characterize the phenotype and differentiation capacity of human adult hippocampal NPCs (hNPCs), derived from patients who underwent epilepsy surgery, on various feeder cells including fetal mixed cortical cultures, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and PA6 stromal cells. Isolated hNPCs were cultured in clonal density by transferring the cells to serum-free media supplemented with FGF-2 and EGF in 3% atmospheric oxygen. These hNPCs showed neurosphere formation, expressed high levels of early neuroectodermal markers, such as the proneural genes NeuroD1 and Olig2, the NSC markers Nestin and Musashi1, the proliferation marker Ki67 and significant activity of telomerase. The phenotype was CD15low/-, CD34-, CD45- and CD133-. After removal of mitogens and plating them on poly D-lysine, they spontaneously differentiated into a neuronal (MAP2ab+), astroglial (GFAP+), and oligodendroglial (GalC+) phenotype. Differentiated hNPCs showed functional properties of neurons, such as sodium channels, action potentials and production of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA. Co-culture of hNPCs with fetal cortical cultures, MEFs and PA6 cells increased neurogenesis of hNPCs in vitro, while only MEFs and PA6 cells also led to a morphological and functional neurogenic maturation. Together we provide a first detailed characterization of the phenotype and differentiation potential of human adult hNPCs in vitro. Our findings reinforce the emerging view that the differentiation capacity of adult hNPCs is critically influenced by non-neuronal mesodermal feeder cells.",
