     "AB": "In rat hippocampal tissue the basal as well as drug-stimulated adenylate cyclase (AC) activity was studied after sacrificing the animals at 9 different circadian times (01.00, 04.00, 07.00, 10.00, 13.00, 16.00, 19.00, 22.00, 01.00 h). The AC was stimulated in vitro either via the beta-adrenoceptor by isoprenaline (IPN, 0.01-100 mumol/l plus GTP 0.005-50 mumol/l, via the GTP-binding protein by Gpp(NH)p (0.03-100 mumol/l) or via the catalytic unit of the AC by forskolin (0.1-600 mumol/l). For each drug dose-response curves could be constituted in single hippocampal tissues at each of the time points of sacrifice. Whereas maximal stimulation by forskolin was not achieved with the highest dose used (600 mumol/l, EC50-, Emax-values and Hill-coefficients could be calculated for both IPN and Gpp(NH)p, respectively. Thus, the rank order of drug stimulated AC activity was forskolin > Gpp(NH)p > IPN. However, no circadian phase-dependency in basal as well as drug-stimulated AC activity was found.",
