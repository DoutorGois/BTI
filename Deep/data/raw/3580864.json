     "AB": "The frequency of multi-unit neuronal firing in response to tonal conditional stimuli increases, and the neuronal responses become discriminative in character, in the anterior and posterior subfields of the cingulate cortex (Brodmann's Area 24 and 29, respectively) during the course of discriminative avoidance conditioning in rabbits. Bilateral electrolytic lesions of the dorsal subicular complex eliminated the training-induced excitatory response in both cortical subfields, suggesting that subiculocortical projection fibers are essential for this effect. Yet, available data indicate that the subicular projection reaches only Area 29, not Area 24. Here we test the hypothesis that the subicular influence attains Area 24 via a synaptic relay in Area 29. The results showed in keeping with the hypothesis, that bilateral aspirative or electrolytic lesions in Area 29 eliminated the training-induced neuronal responses in Area 24. As in the case of subicular lesions, the Area 29 lesions increased the amplitude of the macropotentials in Area 24. These results are discussed in relation to a model of the interactions of the cingulate cortex, hippocampus and the limbic thalamic nuclei during learning.",
