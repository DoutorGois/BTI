     "AB": "Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)-inhibited carboxypeptidase from cat liver was purified 148-fold by chromatography on CM- and DEAE-cellulose with 27.3% yield. Molecular weight of the enzyme is 100-110 kD as determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150. The enzyme has maximum activity at pH 5.50-5.75; its activity is completely inhibited by PMSF or p-chloromercuribenzoate and partially inhibited by iodoacetamide. EDTA, 2-mercaptoethanol, N-ethylmaleimide, Co(2+) and Ca2+, basic carboxypeptidase inhibitor guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril do not influence its activity. The enzyme cleaves arginine from enkephalin-Leu5-Arg6 and dansyl-Phe-Leu-Arg to form enkephalin-Leu5 and dansyl-Phe-Leu, respectively, and very slowly cleaves leucine from carbobenzoxy-Gly-Leu. Further cleavage of either enkephalin-Leu5 or dansyl-Phe-Leu was not detected. The highest activity of this enzyme was found in adrenal glands and testicles; this activity was 30% lower in hypophysis, and still lower in liver and kidney. The PMSF-inhibited carboxypeptidase activity in brain was about 6-16 times lower than that in adrenal gland. In brain regions, the highest activity was detected in gray matter of cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum, and slightly lower activity was found in thalamus/hypothalamus, striatum, and hippocampus. The lowest activity was found in quadrigeminal bodies, medulla oblongata, and white matter of cerebral hemispheres. The enzyme exists mainly in soluble form; the activity of membrane-associated enzyme is 7-25% of soluble enzyme activity depending on tissue type. We consider here a possible involvement of PMSF-inhibited carboxypeptidase in the metabolism of biologically active peptides.",
