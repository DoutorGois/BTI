     "AB": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: We have earlier found that the linoleic acid derivative DCP-LA could ameliorate learning and memory impairment by targeting alpha7 ACh receptor. The present study aimed at understanding DCP-LA-regulated alpha7 ACh receptor trafficking. METHODS: We monitored currents through alpha7 ACh receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes and assayed the receptor mobilizations using fractions with a sucrose density gradient centrifugation, synaptosome preparation, and acutely dissociated neurons from rat hippocampal slices. RESULTS: DCP-LA persistently potentiated alpha7 ACh receptor currents, and the effect was inhibited by a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor or vesicular transport inhibitors. DCP-LA did not induce PKC phosphorylation of alpha7 ACh receptors. DCP-LA stimulated translocation of alpha7 ACh receptors from the cytosol toward the plasma membrane or from extra-synaptosomes into synaptosomes and accumulated the receptors at the presynaptic site in hippocampal neurons. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study demonstrate that DCP-LA increases surface localization of alpha7 ACh receptors in hippocampal neurons, specifically at presynaptic terminals, by stimulating vesicular transport of the receptors, resulting in potentiation of alpha7 ACh receptor responses, regardless of PKC phosphorylation of the receptors.",
