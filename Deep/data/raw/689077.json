     "AB": "The effects of unilateral injection of kainic acid into the rate hippocampus have been examined in terms of morphologic, neurochemical and behavioral sequelae. Infusion of 10 nmoles if kainate causes a rapid and complete degeneration of neuronal perikarya in the entire hippocampal formation followed by gliosis and atrophy of the region. This unilateral neuronal loss is accompanied by a 50% decrease in the specific activity of the biochemical markers for GABAergic neurons including glutamic acid decarboxylase, endogenous GABA and synaptosomal uptake of [3H]GABA. The extrinsic hippocampal cholinergic and noradrenergic afferents also exhibit significant alteration. Although the specific activity of choline acetyltransferase is unaffected and the specific activity of tyrosine hydroxylase is significantly increased in the injected hippocampus, the synaptosomal high affinity uptake process for [3H]choline and [3H]norepinephrine are significantly reduced at 10 days after injection. Whereas the level of endogenous acetylcholine is elevated in the lesioned hippocampus at 2 days after injection, the level of endogenous norepinephrine is reduced. For several hours after intrahippocampal injections of 5 nmoles or more of kainate, rats exhibit epileptiform behavior. Intrahippocampal injection of kainate may be a useful rodent model for temporal lobe seizure disorders.",
