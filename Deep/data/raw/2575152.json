     "AB": "Recently, it has been demonstrated that two distinct alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding sites showing high and low affinity for WB-4101 (2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxy)ethyl-aminomethyl-1,4-benzodioxane) and 5-methyl-urapidil can be distinguished. In the present study we examined the ability of several agonists and antagonists to discriminate between these alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding sites. [3H]Prazosin binding to membranes of rat liver, heart, cerebral cortex and hippocampus was inhibited monophasically by butanserine, I-BE 2254 (2-(3-(4-hydroxy-3-iodophenyl)ethylaminomethyl)tetralone-hydrochloride), prazosin, rauwolscine and verapamil. In contrast, competition curves of adrenaline, oxymetazoline, amidephrine and YM-12617 (5-[2-[[2-(o-ethoxy-phenoxy)ethyl]-amino]propyl]-2- methoxybenzenesulfonamide HCl) were best described by a model of two binding sites. Chloroethylclonidine (CEC), a compound shown to irreversibly eliminate binding sites with low affinity for WB-4101, increased the proportion of high affinity binding sites for oxymetazoline and amidephrine, whereas the binding data for prazosin and adrenaline remained unchanged. These results indicate that amidephrine, oxymetazoline and YM-12617, but not the other drugs tested discriminate between different alpha 1-adrenoceptor recognition sites labelled by [3H]prazosin.",
