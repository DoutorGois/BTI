     "AB": "Microdialysis for measurement of serotonin in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and the dorsal hippocampus was performed under both basal and stimulated conditions, known to elicit differential behavioral and neuroendocrine responses in rats with inborn high (HAB) or low (LAB) anxiety-related behavior. We studied the release of hypothalamic and hippocampal serotonin in response to elevated platform exposure and forced swim stress, a mild emotional and a combined emotional and physical stressor, respectively. The data suggest that serotonin release patterns may depend on the inborn level of anxiety, the brain area dialyzed, and the stressor the animals were exposed to. Under basal conditions, no differences in serotonin release in either the PVN or dorsal hippocampus were observed between HAB and LAB rats. While in the PVN open platform exposure failed to change the release of serotonin, forced swim stress induced an increase in both HAB (p = 0.0001) and LAB (p = 0.01) rats with a significantly greater effect in the former (p = 0.027). In the dorsal hippocampus, only LABs, but not HABs, responded to the elevated platform exposure by enhancing the release of serotonin (p = 0.01). Also, forced swim stress increased hippocampal serotonin only in LAB (p = 0.002), but not HAB, rats probably indicating an involvement of hippocampal serotonin in locomotion and active stress coping. It remains to be shown to what extent the differences in serotonin release contribute to neuroendocrine and behavioral differences between HAB and LAB rats.",
