     "AB": "Pain is a major risk factor of post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in aged population. We investigated the effects of thalidomide, an anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug, on POCD in aged rats, and also explored the underlying mechanisms. Laparotomy was performed under anesthesia in aged rats (24-25 months) to establish POCD models. Thalidomide (5-50mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered immediately after laparotomy. Within 12h after the operation, pain symptoms were assessed by rat grimace scale (RGS). Within postoperative day (POD) 3-14, spatial memory was evaluated using performance errors in a radial arm maze. Protein levels of inflammatory cytokines and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors were measured on POD 14. POCD rats treated with thalidomide showed decreased RGS and performance errors, compared with saline-treated POCD rats. Single administration of thalidomide significantly reduced production of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta) in serum but not in the brain, and attenuated upregulation of NMDA receptor (NR) 2A/B subunits in the hippocampus at POD 14. MK-801 abolished thalidomide-induced attenuation of spatial memory deficits. Our results support that thalidomide could disrupt the development of post-operative memory deficit in aged rats through its long-term regulation of NMDA receptors (NRs) in the hippocampus. Therefore, thalidomide might provide a new means to prevent the development of POCD.",
