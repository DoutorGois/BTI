     "AB": "The effects of phencyclidine (PCP), an NMDA antagonist, was assessed on a complex task that has been shown to be dependent on hippocampal function. This task required memory for the temporal order of spatial locations. Rats were given IP injections of saline or PCP (3-4 mg/kg) on a double alternation schedule. With PCP injections rats were severely impaired relative to saline injections. Furthermore, PCP was shown to have no effects on the ability of rats to discriminate three-dimensional objects (a task that is not dependent on hippocampal function). The present data, in conjunction with previous results, suggest that the involvement of NMDA receptors in the hippocampus might be a function of the complexity of the task.",
