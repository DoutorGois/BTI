     "PG": "26-35",
     "AB": "Apolipoprotein (apo) D is a member of the lipocalin family of proteins. Although its physiological function is unknown, apoD is thought to transport one or more small hydrophobic ligands. A second apolipoprotein, apoE is known to play an important role in lipid transport, and apoE genetic polymorphism has been shown to be associated with susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease. Both apoD and apoE are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and both proteins accumulate at sites of peripheral nerve injury due to increased local synthesis. The two proteins may have overlapping or complementary functions within nervous tissue. In order to define the role of apoD within the CNS, we have studied the regional distribution of apoD and apoE mRNA and protein within the normal rat brain and the changes in apoD and apoE expression in the hippocampus of rats after entorhinal cortex lesion (EC lesion). Within the brains of normal rats, apoD expression in the hippocampus was as high as 180-fold that of the liver. ApoD mRNA levels in other areas of the rat brain ranged from 40 to 120 times the hepatic levels. The distribution of apoE gene expression within the brain was similar to that of apoD, but was much lower than hepatic apoE expression. When rats were subjected to EC lesion, the apoD message increased by 54% at 4 days post lesion (DPL) in the ipsilateral region of hippocampus while apoE mRNA levels (ipsilateral and contralateral) decreased by 43%. At 6 to 8 DPL apoD mRNA in the ipsilateral hippocampus remained elevated (42% above controls) whereas the apoE mRNA levels increased to about 15% above those of controls. At 14 and 31 DPL, both apoD and apoE expression was similar to controls. The increase in immunoreactive apoD in hippocampal extracts was more dramatic. At 1 DPL, immunoreactive apoD levels were already 16-fold higher than those in extracts of non-lesioned animals and, at 31 DPL, levels were still 8-fold higher than those of control animals. Finally, we have demonstrated that the levels of apoD in the brains of apoE-deficient mice are 50-fold those of wildtype control mice. ApoD clearly has an important function within the CNS in both normal and pathological situations.",
