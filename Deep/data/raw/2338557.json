     "AB": "The amino acid glycine is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter of the mammalian spinal cord. Glycine has also been shown to facilitate the excitatory actions of glutamate at the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor subtype. In this article, glycine is shown to increase the Ca2(+)-dependent release of [3H]norepinephrine from preloaded slices of the rat hippocampus. This effect was inhibited noncompetitively by nanomolar concentrations of strychnine, which differentiates it from the glycine site associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Glycine also released [3H]acetylcholine, but was without effect on the efflux of [3H]serotonin or gamma-[3H]aminobutyric acid from the same tissue preparation. The release of [3H]norepinephrine was reversibly blocked by tetrodotoxin, indicating the effect is not initiated at the noradrenergic terminals, but requires propagation of an action potential. The results suggest that a glycine site that is pharmacologically similar to that found in the spinal cord exists in the rat hippocampus. We suggest that this site may participate in modulating the release of specific neurotransmitters in the brain.",
