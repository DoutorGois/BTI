     "AB": "This paper discusses the effects of gliadorphin-7 (GD-7) infusion in rats and contrasts them with those of beta-casomorphin-7 (betaC-7). Both induce FLI in a dose related fashion. Very strong expression in both geniculate nuclei (GN) and the alveus hippocampus follow GD-7 400 microgram and betaC-7 30 microgram/kg BW. GD-7 affects only these three regions while betaC-7affects 45. FLI is prevented by Naloxone 2mg/kg BW in all regions except the GN where it is diminished 60%. betaC-7 causes bizarre behavior beginning 60s after infusion is started. GD-7 causes no behavioral change. These findings suggest GD-7 gains access to brain cells by diffusion through circumventricular organs while betaC-7 passes the BBB by carrier facilitation.",
