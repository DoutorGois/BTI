     "AB": "Ex vivo (3H)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetraline ((3H)-DPAT) binding to the hippocampus has been utilized to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of buspirone after i.v. (30 mumol/kg) and oral (100 mumol/kg) administration of this drug to rats. Intravenous buspirone rapidly penetrated the brain as demonstrated by a maximum inhibition of (3H)-DPAT binding at 1 min. Elimination of drug from the brain was biphasic, with a first component half-life of 24.8 min and a second component half-life of 96 min. Oral buspirone at 3 times the i.v. dose produced less than one-third the maximum inhibition of (3H)-DPAT binding compared to that observed with i.v. buspirone. The pharmacokinetic parameters of buspirone observed in the present study are in agreement with those reported previously. Thus, the ex vivo binding assay could be utilized to determine the bioavailability of the drug to the brain, and its duration of action.",
