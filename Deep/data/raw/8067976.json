     "AB": "In the present investigation the functional activity of transport systems mediating the GABA and L-glutamate uptake into nerve terminals of the rat brain cortex and hippocampus in response to a single carbacholine administration to hippocampus was studied. It has been established that synaptosomes isolated from the brain cortex and hippocampus of rats used in the experiments 24 h after a single carbacholine injection possess an increased capability of GABA and L-glutamate accumulation, and 48 h later the GABA and L-glutamate uptake begins to return to its control level and was equal to it on seventh day after injection.",
