     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex multifactorial disease in which many genetic and environmental factors are involved. We performed an association study using 376 AD patients and 376 control subjects. We studied 35 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 35 genes that were significantly downregulated or upregulated only in the AD hippocampus compared with control and found that 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with AD. Our data indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms could highly reflect differences in gene expression. Furthermore, an intronic polymorphism (+9943T/C) in POU2F1 was most significantly associated with AD (p = 0.0007). Our results suggest that POU2F1 is a candidate gene for AD.",
