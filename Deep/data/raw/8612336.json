     "AB": "We demonstrate here using dissociated hippocampal neurons that glutamate-induced release of proteoglycans which have been shown to have neurite growth-promoting activity is regulated by serine/threonine kinases of the protein kinase C and calcium/calmodulin type II kinase families, and that the state of phosphorylation of hippocampal neurons is a determinant of the magnitude and duration of the release response. Nitric oxide is also involved in mediating glutamate-induced PG release.",
