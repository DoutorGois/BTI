     "AB": "The goal of this study was to compare the neuroprotective properties of the L-type Ca(2)(+) channel blockers, nimodipine and nifedipine, using nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12 neuronal cultures exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and trophic withdrawal-induced cell death. Nimodipine (1-100 muM) conferred 65+/-13% neuroprotection upon exposure to OGD and 35+/-6% neuroprotection towards different trophic withdrawal-induced cell death measured by lactate dehydrogenase and caspase 3 activities. The time window of nimodipine conferred neuroprotection was detected during the first 5h but not at longer OGD exposures. Nifedipine (1-100 muM), to a lower potency than nimodipine, conferred 30-55+/-8% neuroprotection towards OGD in PC12 cells and 29+/-5% in rat hypocampal slices, and 10+/-3% neuroprotection at 100 muM towards trophic withdrawal-induced PC12 cell death. The ability to demonstrate that nimodipine conferred neuroprotection in a narrow therapeutic time-window indicates that the OGD PC12 model mimics the in vivo models and therefore suitable for neuroprotective drug discovery and development.",
