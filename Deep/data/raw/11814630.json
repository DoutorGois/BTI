     "AB": "A retrograde facilitation has been demonstrated in the one trial step-down inhibitory avoidance of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), when it was infused into rat hippocampal formation. Considering the high density of specific binding sites for the MCH peptide on the hippocampus and the participation of this structure on learning and memory processes we have studied the effects of MCH on the hippocampal synaptic transmission. For this purpose, slices of rat hippocampus were perfused with different concentration of MCH. The main result of the present study was a long-lasting potentiation on the hippocampal evoked response on dentate gyrus induced by MCH (4-11 microM) at 30, 60 and 120 min with a maximum effect at 120 min. Previous perfusion of DL - 2- amino - 5 phosphonovaleric acid (APV, 20 microM) was unable to impair the increased hippocampal evoked response induced by MCH 4 microM. On the other hand, the channel blocker Dizocilpine (MK-801, 10 microM) completely impaired the increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity induced by MCH perfusion. We postulate the increased hippocampal synaptic efficacy induced by MCH as one of the mechanisms underlying the retrograde facilitation on the inhibitory avoidance paradigm, observed after MCH hippocampal microinjection. We cannot rule out other MCH neurochemical mechanism and other areas of the brain involved in the MCH effects.",
