     "AB": "Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small 76-residue protein, involved in intracellular protein degradation through a specific ATP-dependent system, which uses Ub as a tag to label proteins committed to be hydrolyzed by a specific 26 S protease. PGP-9.5 is another important component of the Ub system, i.e. a neuron-specific carboxyl-terminal hydrolase, which recycles Ub from Ub-polypeptide complexes. We have investigated the expression of Ub and PGP-9.5 in rat hippocampal neurons in an early phase of reperfusion in a model of transient global brain ischemia/hypoxia (bilateral occlusion of common carotid arteries for 10 min accompanied by mild hypoxia-15% O2-for 20 min), by means of immunohistochemical methods using light and electron microscopy. The intensity of Ub and PGP-9.5 immunoreactivity was evaluated by image analysis. We have detected a marked increase of Ub immunoreactivity (UIR) in neurons of CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4, and dentate gyrus subfields 1 hr after ischemia/hypoxia (but not after hypoxia only), statistically significant as confirmed by image analysis. Such increase in immunoreactivity in ischemic/hypoxic rats was localized essentially in the nuclei of hippocampal neurons. There were no changes in PGP-9.5 immunoreactivity. The data suggest that in the present model of rat brain ischemia/hypoxia Ub is involved in the neuronal stress response.",
