     "AB": "Intrahippocampal injections of adrenergic drugs, clonidine (an alpha 2-agonist), yohimbine (an alpha 2-antagonist), and salbutamol (a beta 2-agonist) were performed in the awake rat. The injection of a high dose of clonidine caused a depression in locomotion in the open-field. Yohimbine partially antagonized the clonidine-induced hypomotility. The intrahippocampal injection of salbutamol had no effect on ambulatory behavior of the rat. These results suggest that the role played by the anterodorsal hippocampus in modifying behavior in novel situations is dependent on the specific sub-population of adrenoceptors that is stimulated.",
