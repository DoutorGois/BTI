     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The present study was performed to identify antidepressant-like activity of icariin in prenatally stressed male rats. METHODS: The effects of icariin on PRS-induced depression were examined using sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swimming test (FST) in male offspring, and measuring protein and mRNA expressions of group I mGluRs receptors and EAAT2 via western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR assays. RESULTS: The results indicated that prenatal restraint stress (PRS) resulted in several behavioral anomalies. Treatment with icariin relieved the elevated protein and mRNA levels of group I mGluR receptors as well as the diminished protein and mRNA levels of EAAT2 in the PRS male offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Collectivity, the data support that icariin ameliorates PRS-induced depressive-like behavior via regulating expression of mGluR1, mGluR5 and EAAT2 in the hippocampus.",
