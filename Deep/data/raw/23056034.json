     "AB": "The aim of this study is to investigate the neuroprotective effects and relevant mechanism of GW0742, an agonist of PPAR-beta, after global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (GCIRI) in rats. The rats showed memory and cognitive impairment and cytomorphological change in the hippocampus neurons following GCIRI. These effects were significantly improved by pretreatment with GW0742 in the dose-dependent manner. The expressions of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were increased after GCIRI, while the increases in these proinflammatory cytokines by GCIRI were inhibited by GW0742 pretreatment. Similarly, GW0742 pretreatment also improved the GCIRI-induced decrease in the expression of IL-10, which can act as an inhibitory cytokine to reduce cerebral ischemic injury. For another, NF-kappaB p65 expression was significantly increased in hippocampal neurons with apparent nuclear translocation after global cerebral IRI, and these phenomena were also largely attenuated by GW0742 pretreatment. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expressions of PPAR-beta were significantly decreased in GCIRI + GW0742 groups when compared with those in GCIRI group. Our data suggests that the PPAR-beta agonist GW0742 can exert significant neuroprotective effect against GCIRI in rats via PPAR-beta activation and its anti-inflammation effect mediated by the inhibition of expression and activation of NF-kappaB in the hippocampus.",
