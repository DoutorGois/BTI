     "AB": "Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPAR) and inflammatory processes have been related to ischemia-induced damage, but there are few studies addressing their response in different brain areas. Here we compare AMPAR expression after ischemia in several brain areas (hippocampus, cerebral cortex and caudate-putamen) in an attempt to correlate it with their different vulnerabilities. We found outstanding decreases in GluR1 and GluR2 mRNA levels after global ischemia and 48 h reperfusion (I/R) in all the areas studied, however, protein levels maintained in some areas such as CA3, suggesting different post-transcriptional control in different areas of the brain. To characterize the inflammatory response in these areas, we measured the mRNA levels of CD11b/CD18 membrane integrin (a reactive microglia marker), which showed an important but similar up-regulation in all brain areas studied, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. We conclude that the down-regulation of AMPAR gene expression following I/R does not explain differences in the vulnerability of different areas. Additionally, our data indicate that the level of inflammation is independent of the vulnerability of the different brain areas and does not explain differences in the AMPAR expression observed in the brain areas studied.",
