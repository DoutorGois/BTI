     "AB": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a key neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Postsynaptic density protein 93 (PSD-93) is a key scaffolding protein enriched at postsynaptic sites. The aim of the present study was to examine whether PSD-93 overexpression could alleviate Abeta-induced cognitive dysfunction in APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice by reducing Abeta levels in the brain. The level of PSD-93 was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice compared with that in wild-type mice. Following lentivirus-mediated PSD-93 overexpression, cognitive function, synaptic function, and amyloid burden were investigated. The open field test, Morris water maze test, and fear condition test revealed that PSD-93 overexpression ameliorated spatial memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice. The facilitation of long-term potentiation induction was observed in APP/PS1 mice after PSD-93 overexpression. The expression of somatostatin receptor 4 (SSTR4) and neprilysin was increased, while the amyloid plaque load and Abeta levels were decreased in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, PSD-93 interacted with SSTR4 and affected the level of SSTR4 on cell membrane, which was associated with the ubiquitination. Together, these findings suggest that PSD-93 attenuates spatial memory deficits and decreases amyloid levels in APP/PS1 mice, which might be associated with Abeta catabolism, and overexpression of PSD-93 might be a potential therapy for AD.",
