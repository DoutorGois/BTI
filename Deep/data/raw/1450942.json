     "AB": "The effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus in vivo were investigated in fimbria-fornix (FF)-lesioned rats. Transection of FF resulted in decreased frequency of LTP generation. Intracerebroventricular injection of EGF (50 ng) and bFGF (50 ng) significantly facilitated LTP generation in the FF-lesioned rats. These results suggest that EGF and bFGF can promote the hippocampal LTP impaired by loss of subcortical afferents.",
