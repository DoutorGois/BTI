     "AB": "Our previous study suggests that \"the neuropeptidergic system\" might promote a diversity of the mechanisms that regulate signal transmission in the hippocampus. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is the mostly expressed neuropeptide gene in the hippocampus. Here, we investigated whether CCK regulates immediate-early genes (Egr1/zif268 and Fos), critical indicators of cortical neuronal activity. We showed that CCK increased Egr1/zif268 promoter activity in a neuronal cell line, which is transfected with CCK(B) receptor. Unexpectedly, in living hippocampal slices, CCK significantly suppressed cAMP-induced expression of Egr1/zif268 and Fos through CCK(B) receptor activation. This suppression was involved in activating GABA(B) and cannabinoid 1 receptors. In addition to transient CCK modulation of action potentials on hippocampal principal neurons, we suggest that release of endogenous CCK might indirectly produce the suppression of cAMP-dependent gene expression in the hippocampus.",
