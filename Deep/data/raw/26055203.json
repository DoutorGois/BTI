     "AB": "The present study investigated the possible alterations of hippocampal CREB phosphorylation in drug state-dependent memory retrieval. One-trial step-down passive avoidance task was used to assess memory retrieval in adult male NMRI mice. Pre-training administration of ethanol (1g/kg, i.p.) induced amnesia. Pre-test administration of ethanol (1g/kg, i.p) or nicotine (0.7 mg/kg, s.c.) reversed ethanol-induced amnesia, indicating ethanol- or ethanol-nicotine induced state-dependent learning (STD). Using Western blot analysis, it was found that the p-CREB/CREB ratio in the hippocampus increased in the mice that showed successful memory retrieval as compared with untrained mice. In contrast, pre-training administration of ethanol (1g/kg, i.p.) decreased the hippocampal p-CREB/CREB ratio in comparison with the control group. The hippocampal p-CREB/CREB ratio enhanced in ethanol- and ethanol-nicotine induced STD. Moreover, memory impairment induced by pre-training administration of WIN (1 mg/kg, i.p.) improved in the animals that received pre-test administration of WIN (1 mg/kg, i.p.), ethanol (0.5 g/kg, i.p.) or nicotine (0.7 mg/kg, s.c.), suggesting a cross STD between the drugs. The p-CREB/CREB ratio in the hippocampus decreased in the of WIN-induced amnesia and STD groups in comparison with the control group. In addition, cross state-dependent learning between WIN and ethanol or nicotine was associated with the increase of the hippocampal p-CREB/CREB ratio. It can be concluded that phosphorylation of CREB in the hippocampus is a critical event underlying the interaction of co-administration of drugs on memory retrieval in passive avoidance learning.",
