     "AB": "We previously reported that the total neurotrophic activity of hippocampal extracts was significantly (25-50%) reduced after 21-28 weeks of chronic ethanol treatment (CET) [23]. To test whether the level of a neurotrophic factor (i.e., ligand itself) is compromised, we measured nerve growth factor (NGF) protein and NGF mRNA contents using ELISA and Northern analysis. We reported that CET did not appear to reduce NGF protein, NGF mRNA or total neurotrophic activity when measured on sympathetic ganglia neurons [4]. We also observed that both NT-3 mRNA and bFGF mRNA levels were unaffected, but the BDNF mRNA levels was significantly reduced in CET rat hippocampus [18]. Neuronal degeneration and reduction of total neurotrophic activity after CET appear to be induced, at least partially, by compromised transcription of BDNF gene. CET may also induce functional changes in receptors for the neurotrophic factors. To investigate possible changes in neurotrophic factor-receptors, we examined Western blots (immunoblots) of rat cortex after 28 weeks of CET. After sonication and ultra-centrifugation, the supernatant of crude lysates of the cortex from individual animals was subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrotransfered to nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with anti-trk B antibody and secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, and reacted with chemiluminescent substrate. The membranes were then exposed to Kodak XAR film. Compared to controls (n = 6), CET rats (n = 6) appeared to have significantly higher band intensity (P < 0.01) of trk B-like protein at about 145 kDa, which suggests an up-regulation of trk B-like proteins to compensate the compromised level of certain subset (i.e., BDNF or NT-4/5, but not NGF) of neurotrophins in cortex.",
