     "AB": "The effects of aging in vivo (Wistar rats aged 3-26 months) and of an oxygen free-radical generating system in vitro (Fe(2+)/ascorbic acid) on high-affinity choline uptake in the hippocampus and on (3H)hemicholinium-3 binding sites in the cortex and hippocampus are compared. The high-affinity choline transport system was found to be more damaged than the low-affinity system during aging (Na(+)-dependent part of the uptake drops to 76%: Na(+)-independent part increases to 120%). The decrease in high-affinity choline uptake values is probably more influenced by the impairment of correct function of carriers (the fall in the turnover rate of each carrier) than by a decrease in the number of transport sites (no change of the density of the carriers in the hippocampus and cortex). The causes of the defect in high-affinity choline transport during aging are discussed.",
