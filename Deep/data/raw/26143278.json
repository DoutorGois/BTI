     "AB": "PURPOSE: Previously, we examined manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), and catalase (CAT) activities in rat brain irradiated with 2 or 3 Gy of gamma-rays. The results indicated that lower MnSOD activity and inducibility found in hippocampus might explain higher radiosensitivity of this brain region. Thus, in this study, we wanted to determine changes of MnSOD, CuZnSOD, and CAT activities after dose of 5 Gy and to find out if differences in MnSOD activity are caused by changes in its expression. METHODS: Heads of 4-day-old female rats were irradiated with gamma-rays, using (60)Co. Animals were sacrificed 1/24 h after exposure. Hippocampus and cortex tissues were prepared for enzyme activity measurements and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: One hour after exposure, gamma-rays significantly decreased MnSOD activity in both examined brain regions. Twenty-four hours later, MnSOD recovery showed dose and regional dependence. It was weaker at higher doses and in hippocampal region. MnSOD expression changed in the similar manner as MnSOD activity only at lower doses of gamma-rays. In both examined brain regions, gamma radiation significantly decreased CuZnSOD activity and did not change activity of CAT. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed that MnSOD plays an important role in different regional radiosensitivity but also showed that depending on dose, radiation affects MnSOD level by utterly different mechanisms. Postradiation changes of CuZnSOD and CAT are not regionally specific and therefore, cannot account for the different radiosensitivity of the hippocampus and cortex.",
