     "AB": "Deep brain stimulation, a technique whereby electrodes are implanted into specific brain regions to modulate their activity, has been mainly used to treat movement disorders. More recently this technique has been proposed for the treatment of drug addiction, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and dementia. The nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus, central nuclei within the limbic system, have been studied as potential targets for neuromodulation for the treatment of drug addiction, PTSD, and dementia, respectively. As the scope of neuromodulation grows to include disorders of mood and thought, new ethical and philosophic challenges that require multidisciplinary discussion and cooperation are emerging.",
