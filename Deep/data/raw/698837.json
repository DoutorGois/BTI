     "AB": "This report concerns variations in neuron number within the granule cell layer of the area dentata that occur among inbred strains of house mice. There is genetically associated variability in the total number of neurons present, with a very substantial range of estimated values. Systematic strain variations in the orientation of the granule cell layer are also present. When statistical corrections for variations in orientation are made, associations between the neuron numbers of subdivisions of the granule cell layer are consistent with the presence of common genetic determination of neuron number throughout the entire lamina.",
