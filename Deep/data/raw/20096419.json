     "AB": "Unipolar depression is moderately heritable. It is unclear whether structural brain changes associated with unipolar depression are present in healthy persons at risk of the disorder. Here we investigated whether a genetic predisposition to unipolar depression is associated with structural brain changes. A priori, hippocampal volume reductions were hypothesized. Using a high-risk study design, magnetic resonance imaging brain scans were obtained from 59 healthy high-risk subjects having a co-twin with unipolar depression, and 53 healthy low-risk subjects without a first-degree family history of major psychiatric disorder. High-risk twins had smaller hippocampal volumes than low-risk twins (p<0.04). The finding was most pronounced in DZ twins. Groups did not differ on global brain tissue volumes or regional tissue volumes assessed in exploratory voxel-wise whole cerebrum analyses. In conclusion, hippocampal volume reduction may index a predisposition to develop depression and thus may be predictive of future onset of the disorder. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of (shared) environmental and genetic factors.",
