     "AB": "NMDA receptors were immunopurified from adult mouse forebrain and screened by immunoblotting. NR1 was co-associated with NR2A, NR2B and NR2D but not NR2C, nor was NR2C detected in adult mouse hippocampal membranes. The anatomical distribution of NR1, 2A, 2B and 2D was mapped in the adult murine hippocampal formation. NR1-like immunoreactivity was localised to cell bodies of pyramidal neurons, granule cells and hilar cells of the dentate gyrus. Apical dendrites of the CA subfields and hilar cells were also immunopositive. NR2A- and NR2B-like immunoreactivity essentially co-localised with that of NR1 implying co-assembly of all three subunits in this brain structure. NR2D-like immunoreactivity was distinct, being totally excluded from pyramidal, granule and hilar cell bodies. Strong, punctate staining was restricted to the oriens layer of CA1 and the stratum lucidum of CA3 consistent with labelling of presynaptic receptors. Less intense staining was also observed in the internal third of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus.",
