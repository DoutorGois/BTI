     "AB": "Ubiquitin gene expression following transient forebrain ischemia in the rat was analyzed by three probes which were specific for UbC, UbB and UbS30 mRNA. According to the in situ hybridization studies, each type of ubiquitin gene expression decreased at 30 min of reperfusion following 20 min of forebrain ischemia, thereafter increased, and then reached a peak at 4-6 h, both in the cortex and hippocampus. These changes returned to the control level after 24-48 h of recirculation. Among the three ubiquitin transcripts, changes in UbC expression were more marked in the hippocampus, and persistent expression of UbC transcripts in the CA1 and CA3 regions was observed at 24 h of reperfusion. With dot-blot analysis, significant increases in the UbC transcripts were noted at 4 h of reperfusion in the hippocampus, and at 6 h in the cortex following 20 min of ischemia. These results suggest that changes in UbC expression might be a good indicator of ischemic stress.",
