     "AB": "Wistar rats were fed a fish oil-deficient diet through three generations. The young (five-week-old) male rats of the third generation were randomly divided into two groups. Over 10 weeks, one group was perorally administered docosahexaenoic acid dissolved in 5% gum Arabic solution at 300 mg/kg/day; the other group received a similar volume of vehicle alone. Five weeks after starting the administration, the rats were tested for learning ability related to two types of memory, reference memory and working memory, with the partially (four of eight) baited eight-arm radial maze. Reference memory is information that should be retained until the next trial. Working memory is information that disappears in a short time. Entries into unbaited arms and repeated entries into visited arms were defined as reference memory errors and working memory errors, respectively. Docosahexaenoic acid administration over 10 weeks significantly reduced the number of reference memory errors, without affecting the number of working memory errors, and significantly increased the docosahexaenoic acid content and the docosahexaenoic acid/arachidonic acid ratio in both the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. In addition, the ratio demonstrated a significantly negative correlation with the number of reference memory errors. These results suggest that chronic administration of docosahexaenoic acid is conducive to the improvement of reference memory-related learning ability, and that the docosahexaenoic acid/arachidonic acid ratio in the hippocampus or the cerebral cortex, or both, may be an indicator of learning ability.",
