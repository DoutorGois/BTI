     "AB": "A structure-activity analysis was used to identify selective 5-HT1A versus 5-HT1D receptor agents. An analysis of published data identified 13 drugs which display nanomolar affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor and that have been analyzed at 5-HT1D receptor binding sites. Four agents display greater than or equal to 100-fold selectivity for the 5-HT1A receptor. Two structural features were identified which hypothetically result in selectivity for 5-HT1A versus 5-HT1D binding sites. The linkage of an indole ring to a basic nitrogen atom via the 4 position on the indole ring or the absence of an indole ring are two features which lower the affinity for the 5-HT1D receptor, but do not necessarily lower the affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor. A series of 7 agents (5 indoles, 2 quinolines) was identified which met these hypothetical selectivity criteria. These compounds were then analyzed in radioligand binding studies. These 7 agents display affinities of 1.3-170 nM for the 5-HT1A receptor binding site, and 1,800-13,000 nM for the 5-HT1D receptor binding site. All 7 agents display greater than or equal to 47-fold selectivity for the 5-HT1A versus 5-HT1D site and 4 of the agents are greater than 100-fold selective. Compound No. 1 (N,N'-bis[3-(4-indolyloxy)-2-hydroxypropyl]-(Z)-1,8-diamino-p-meth ane) and compound No. 2 (N8-[3-(4-indolyloxy)-2-hydroxypropyl]-N1-(propioloyl)-(Z)-1 ,8-diamino-p-methane) are the most selective agents yet described for 5-HT1A versus 5-HT1D receptor binding sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
