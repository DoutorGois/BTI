     "AB": "The electrosensory system is used for both spatial navigation tasks and communication. An electric organ generates a sinusoidal electric field and cutaneous electroreceptors respond to this field. Objects such as prey or rocks cause a local low-frequency modulation of the electric field; this cue is used by electric fish for navigation and prey capture. The interference of the electric fields of conspecifics produces beats, often with high frequencies, that are also sensed by the electroreceptors; furthermore, these electric fish can transiently modulate their electric discharge as a communication signal. Thus these fish must therefore detect a variety of low-intensity signals that differ greatly in their spatial extent, frequency, and duration. Behavioral studies suggest that they are highly adapted to these tasks. Experimental and theoretical analyses of the neural circuitry for the electrosense has demonstrated many commonalities with the more common senses, e.g., topographic mapping and receptive fields with On or Off centers and surround inhibition. The integration of computational and experimental analyses has demonstrated novel mechanisms that appear to optimize weak signal detection in the electrosense including: noise shaping by correlations within single spike trains, induction of oscillations by delayed feedback inhibition, the requirement for maps with differing receptive field sizes tuned for different stimulus parameters, and the role of non-plastic feedback for adaptive cancellation of redundant signals. It is likely that these mechanisms will also be operative in other sensory systems.",
