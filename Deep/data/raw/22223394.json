     "AB": "alpha-Tocopherol (alpha-Toc) is involved in various physiologic processes, which present antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. High-fat diets have an important role in neurodegenerative diseases and neurological disturbances. This study aimed to investigate the effects of treatment with alpha-Toc and the consumption of high-fat diets on ectonucleotidase activities in synaptosomes of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum of rats. Animals were divided into four different groups, which received standard diet (control), high-fat saturated diet (HF), alpha-Toc and high-fat saturated diet plus alpha-Toc (alpha-Toc + HF). High-fat saturated diet was administered ad libitum and alpha-Toc by gavage using a dose of 50 mg.kg(-1). After 3 months of treatment, animals were submitted to euthanasia, and cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum were collected for biochemical assays. Results showed that adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) hydrolysis in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum were decreased in HF in comparison to the other groups (P < 0.05). When rats that received HF were treated with alpha-Toc, the activity of the ectonucleotidases was similar to the control. ATP, ADP and AMP hydrolysis in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum were increased in the alpha-Toc group when compared with the other groups (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrated that the HF alters the purinergic signaling in the nervous system and that the treatment with alpha-Toc was capable of modulating the adenine nucleotide hydrolysis in this experimental condition.",
