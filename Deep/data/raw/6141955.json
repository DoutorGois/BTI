     "AB": "In rabbits with indwelled gold electrodes, multiminute oscillations of infraslow activity were recorded within the range from 0 to 1 Hz. The temperature of cerebral structures was recorded from symmetrical areas with the aid of thermocouple. Changes of the functional state were induced by means of 1) unilateral microstimulation of frontal neocortex with 1.5-2.5 microA; 2) administration of neurotropic activators: aethimizole and its analogue: and 3) prolonged administration of ethanole. All these influences sharply increased the natural functional interhemisphere assymmetry inducting a rearrangement of intracentral interrelationships. Use of the neurotropic activators (aethimizole and IEM-476) temporarily restored the normal interaction between the cerebral hemispheres even if the functional interhemisphere asymmetry was still obvious.",
