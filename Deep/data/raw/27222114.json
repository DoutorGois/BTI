     "AB": "Sevoflurane is generally considered a pro-apoptotic agent in the neonatal brain. However, recent studies have suggested that low levels of sevoflurane anesthesia may be neuroprotective and have a memory enhancing effect. The present study aimed to investigate whether sevoflurane exerts a neuroprotective effect at subclinical concentrations, with regard to oxidative state. In the current study, postnatal day 7 (P7) SpragueDawley rats were continuously exposed to 0.3, 1.3, or 2.3% sevoflurane for 6 h. ELISA was used to quantify the levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase (GSHpx) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the plasma and the hippocampus. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining was used to observe hippocampal neuronal apoptosis. Altered object exploration tests for recognition memory were employed to investigate longterm behavioral effects at postnatal day 28. The results demonstrated that a single 6 h exposure to a subclinical concentration (1.3%) of sevoflurane at P7 reduces MDA and GPHpx production in rats. Sevoflurane induced hippocampal apoptosis in a dosedependent manner and altered recognition memory testing indicated no differences among the groups. Although early exposure to a subclinical concentration of sevoflurane reduced oxidative stress, it did not prevent the process of sevoflurane-induced hippocampal apoptosis. These changes did not affect subsequent recognition memory in juvenile rats.",
