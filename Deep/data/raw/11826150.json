     "AB": "There is a strong correlation between Hebbian, NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP), place-cell firing, and learning and memory. We made glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) null mutant mice that show enhanced non-Hebbian LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons and impaired performance in a spatial learning task. We concluded that in vivo hippocampal place cells of GluR2 mutant mice were functionally impaired because (1) only 22.6% of CA1 neurons showed place fields in GluR2 mutant mice, which was significantly lower than that (43.8%) in wild-type mice; (2) GluR2 mutant place fields were much less precise; and (3) GluR2 mutant place fields were extremely unstable. Our data suggest that place cells of GluR2 knock-out mice did not form robust place fields, and that enhanced non-Hebbian LTP might play a negative role in their formation.",
