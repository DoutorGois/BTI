     "AB": "The distribution of galanin-like immunoreactivity has been studied in complete coronal sections taken from 9 normal human brains (4 male, 5 female mean age 54, range 42-72 years). Galanin-immunoreactive cells were restricted largely to the basal nucleus of Meynert and to the supraoptic, ventromedial and posterior areas of the hypothalamus. Fibre staining was more widespread, seen throughout the hypothalamus and in the diagonal band, septum, amygdala, hippocampus and scattered throughout the cortex. This distribution may indicate a role for galanin in the modulation of hypothalamic and basal forebrain function in man.",
