     "AB": "It is well established that cAMP signaling within neurons plays a major role in the formation of long-term memories--signaling thought to proceed through protein kinase A (PKA). However, here we show that exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac) is able to enhance the formation of long-term memory in the hippocampus and appears to do so independent of PKA, thus demonstrating the importance of Epac-mediated signaling in memory consolidation.",
