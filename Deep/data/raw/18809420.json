     "AB": "Sensory gating can be assessed in rodents and humans using an auditory conditioning (C)-test (T) paradigm, with schizophrenic patients exhibiting a loss of gating. Dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system has been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We studied auditory gating and the effects of the cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-22 on gating in CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in male Lister hooded rats using in vivo electrophysiology. The effects of a single dose of WIN55,212-2 on the N2 local field potential (LFP) test/conditioning amplitude ratios (T/C ratio) and response latencies were examined. In rats that demonstrated gating of N2, mPFC showed higher T/C ratios and shorter conditioning response latencies compared to DG and CA3. WIN55,212-2 disrupted auditory gating in all three areas with a significant increase in test amplitudes in the gating rats. A group of non-gating rats demonstrated higher test amplitudes and higher T/C ratios compared to gating rats. WIN55,212-2 had no effect on T/C ratios in the non-gating rats. The cannabinoid receptor (CB1) antagonist SR141716A prevented WIN55,212-2 induced disruption of gating. This study demonstrates gated auditory-evoked responses in CA3, DG and mPFC. The mPFC showed an early phase of gating which may later be modulated by CA3 and DG activity. Furthermore, cannabinoid receptor activation disrupted auditory gating in CA3, DG and mPFC, an effect which was prevented by CB1 receptor antagonism. The results further demonstrate the presence of a non-gating rat population which responded differently to cannabinoid agonists.",
