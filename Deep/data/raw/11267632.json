     "AB": "We have investigated the effects of tyrosine on alternation behavior and hippocampal adrenergic and cholinergic tone in a model of self-induced weight loss caused by separation stress. Separation decreased body weight in mice (P < .001) and spontaneous alternations in the T-maze (P < .001). This impairment was associated with depletion of both norepinephrine (NE, P < .001) and dopamine (P < .01) while increasing MHPG (P < .05) and the ratio of MHPG/NE (P < .05). Increasing tyrosine availability restored performance to control levels (P < .001) and repleted dopamine (P < .05) and presumably also NE (indicated by increases in both MHPG, P < .001, and MHPG/NE, P < .05). Stress increased adrenergic alpha(2)-receptor density (P < .001) without changing its K(d) and the B(max) and K(d) of beta-receptors, suggesting that it decreased NE transmission through action on alpha(2)-receptors. The balance between beta- and alpha(2)-receptors appeared to be related to alternation behavior as shown by the decrease (P < .01) and increase (P < .05) in their ratios induced by stress and tyrosine, respectively. With regard to cholinergic tone, separation stress increased M1 receptor density (P < .05) and its mRNA signal (P < .001). Tyrosine further increased M1 receptor density of stressed mice (P < .05). Tyrosine might be a potential therapy for cognitive and mood problems associated with the maintenance of a reduced body weight in the treatment of obesity and in the extreme case of anorexia nervosa.",
