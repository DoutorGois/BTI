     "AB": "Intersectin-short (intersectin-s) is a multimodule scaffolding protein functioning in constitutive and regulated forms of endocytosis in non-neuronal cells and in synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling at the neuromuscular junction of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. In vertebrates, alternative splicing generates a second isoform, intersectin-long (intersectin-l), that contains additional modular domains providing a guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity for Cdc42. In mammals, intersectin-s is expressed in multiple tissues and cells, including glia, but excluded from neurons, whereas intersectin-l is a neuron-specific isoform. Thus, intersectin-I may regulate multiple forms of endocytosis in mammalian neurons, including SV endocytosis. We now report, however, that intersectin-l is localized to somatodendritic regions of cultured hippocampal neurons, with some juxtanuclear accumulation, but is excluded from synaptophysin-labeled axon terminals. Consistently, intersectin-l knockdown (KD) does not affect SV recycling. Instead intersectin-l co-localizes with clathrin heavy chain and adaptor protein 2 in the somatodendritic region of neurons, and its KD reduces the rate of transferrin endocytosis. The protein also co-localizes with F-actin at dendritic spines, and intersectin-l KD disrupts spine maturation during development. Our data indicate that intersectin-l is indeed an important regulator of constitutive endocytosis and neuronal development but that it is not a prominent player in the regulated endocytosis of SVs.",
