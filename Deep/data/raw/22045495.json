     "AB": "Chronic stress has been suggested to influence the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the mechanism underlying this influence remains unknown. In this study, we created a triple transgenic mouse model that overexpresses corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) and human amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP), to investigate whether increases in the expression of CRF can mimic the effects of stress on amyloid metabolism and the neurodegeneration. Tg2576 mice that overexpresses human AbetaPP gene were crossbreed with Tetop-CRF (CRF) mice and CaMKII-tTA (tTA) mice to create a novel triple transgenic mouse model that conditioned overexpresses CRF in forebrain and overexpresses human AbetaPP (called AbetaPP+/CRF+/tTA+, or TT mice). Then we evaluated serial neuro-anatomical and behavioral phenotypes on TT mice using histological, biochemical, and behavioral assays. TT mice showed a Cushingoid-like phenotype starting at 3 months of age. At 6 months of age, these mice demonstrated increases in tissue-soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) and Abeta plaques in the cortex and hippocampus, as compared to control mice. Moreover, TT mice characterized substantial decreases in dendritic branching and dendritic spine density in pyramidal neurons in layer 4 of the frontal cortex and CA1 of the hippocampus. Finally, TT mice showed significantly impaired working memory and contextual memory, with a modest increase in anxiety-like behavior. Our results suggested genetic increases in the brain of CRF expression mimicked chronic stress on the effects of amyloid deposition, neurodegeneration, and behavioral deficits. The novel transgenic mouse model will provide a unique tool to further investigate the mechanisms between stress and AD.",
