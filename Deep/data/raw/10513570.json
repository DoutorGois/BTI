     "AB": "We investigated the effects of 7-nitroindazole, a specific inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase, on NO concentration and on blood flow in rat hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia which was induced by 4-vessel occlusion for 10 min. NO concentration was measured directly by an NO-selective electrode method. Hippocampal blood flow was also estimated by laser Doppler flowmetry. 7-Nitroindazole [0 (vehicle), 12.5, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg] was administered intraperitoneally 20 min before ischemia. 7-Nitroindazole at any dose used did not affect basal NO levels before ischemia. 7-Nitroindazole (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) reduced the NO concentration significantly during post-ischemic early reperfusion. Before 10 min of ischemia and during post-ischemic early reperfusion, there were no significant differences in hippocampal basal blood flow and reactive hyperemia between vehicle- and 7-nitroindazole-treated groups. These results demonstrate that the neuronal NO synthase inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole, can effectively inhibit NO synthesis in rat hippocampus during post-ischemic early reperfusion.",
