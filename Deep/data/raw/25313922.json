     "AB": "A strategy for the synthesis of natural and non-natural 5-deoxy-6,7-dihydrocurcuminoids (diarylheptanoids) was developed for the preparation of 14 compounds with varying aromatic substituent patterns and a different functionality in the aliphatic seven-carbon chain. The in vitro protective activity against glutamate-induced neuronal cell death was examined in the murine hippocampal cell line HT-22 to find structural motifs responsible for neuroprotective effects in vitro. Among the tested compounds the ferulic acid-like unit, present in the structures of (E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)hept-1-en-3-one (5) and (E)-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)hept-1-en-3-one (7), appeared to be an important feature for protection against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Both compounds demonstrated significant neuroprotective activity in a concentration range between 1 and 25 muM without showing toxic effects in a cytotoxicity assay with HT-22 cells. Furthermore, (E)-1,7-bis(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)hept-1-en-3-one (9), exhibiting a caffeic acid-like structural motif, displayed a neuroprotective activity at a nontoxic concentration of 25 muM. In contrast, (1E,6E)-1,7-bis(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)hepta-1,6-diene-3,5-dione (4, di-O-demethylcurcumin) showed mainly cytotoxic effects. A corresponding single-ring analogue that contains the ferulic acid-like unit as an enone was not active.",
