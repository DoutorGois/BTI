     "AB": "NMDA receptors are composed of multiple subunits and are crucial in the induction of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. In this study, application of the group I mGlu receptor agonist, DHPG, caused LTD of NMDA-EPSCs (DHPG-LTDNMDA) of the Schaffer collateral, but not of NMDA-EPSCs of the temperoammonic pathway onto CA1 neurons of the hippocampus. DHPGLTDNMDA did not alter the sensitivity of NMDA-EPSC to the GluN2B-antagonist, Ro25-6981, indicating that the postsynaptic NMDA receptor subunit composition remained unchanged following DHPG-LTDNMDA. Furthermore, blockade of GluN2B receptors did not affect the induction of DHPG-LTDNMDA. These results demonstrate a difference in the plasticity of NMDA receptors between two synapses onto the same CA1 neuron, but indicate that the subunit composition of NMDA receptors does not account for this difference.",
