     "AB": "The hippocampus is considered pivotal to recall, allowing retrieval of information not available in the immediate environment. In contrast, neocortex is thought to signal familiarity, contributing to recall only when called upon by the hippocampus. However, this view is not compatible with representational accounts of memory, which reject the mapping of cognitive processes onto brain regions. According to representational accounts, the hippocampus is not engaged by recall per se, rather it is engaged whenever hippocampal representations are required. To test whether hippocampus is engaged by recall when hippocampal representations are not required, we used functional imaging and a non-associative recall task, with images (objects, scenes) studied in isolation, and image patches as cues. As predicted by a representational account, hippocampal activation was modulated by the content of the recalled memory, increasing during recall of scenes-which are known to be processed by hippocampus-but not during recall of objects. Object recall instead engaged neocortical regions known to be involved in object-processing. Further supporting the representational account, effective connectivity analyses revealed that changes in functional activation during recall were driven by increased information flow from neocortical sites, rather than by the spreading of recall-related activation from hippocampus back to neocortex.",
