     "AB": "It has been widely reported that structural and functional connectivities are disturbed in cortical networks in schizophrenia (SZ). However, much less is known about the structural and functional connectivities between cortical and subcortical regions in SZ. Here, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data was used to identify consistent cortico-subcortical structural connection patterns across SZ patients and controls, and thus 13 common cortical Regions of Interest (ROIs) were determined. DTI and resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) datasets were used to assess the structural and functional connectivities between the 13 cortical ROIs and 12 subcortical regions in 8 SZ patients and 10 normal controls. It was found that there are significantly increased functional connectivities for 7 cortico-subcortical connections between the 13 cortical ROIs and 12 subcortical regions. Among most of these connections, the functional connectivity strength was doubled in SZ in comparison to controls. The cortical ROIs with functional hyper-connectivities to subcortical regions are localized in frontal and parietal lobes. However, no significant difference in the structural connectivity between these cortical and subcortical regions was found between SZ and controls. Additional analysis results showed 4 significantly increased and 2 significantly decreased cortico-cortical connections. Our study results suggest the functional hyper-connectivity between cortical and subcortical regions, adding further evidence to literature findings that SZ is a disorder of connectivity between components of large-scale brain networks. The result of either increased or decreased functional connectivities among cortical ROIs exhibits the complex pattern of disturbance of brain networks in SZ.",
