     "AB": "The present study investigated whether the expression of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the rat brain is altered following an acute self-limited seizure induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). Male rats were injected intraperitoneally with a single convulsive dose (45 mg/kg) of PTZ, and the matched controls were given saline. For immunohistochemistry, animals were perfused with 4% parafomaldehyde at 24 h following PTZ seizures, and CREB immunoreactivity was examined in rat brain. For real-time RT-PCR, animals were sacrificed at 2 and 24 h and 1 week following PTZ seizures. Tissues from different rat brain regions were micropunched and subjected to real-time RT-PCR using Taqman probe. The CREB immunoreactive profiles were significantly decreased in CA3 and dentate gyrus of hippocampal formation, sensory cerebral cortex and thalamus at 24 h after PTZ seizures. Consistent with changes in CREB immunoreactivity, levels of CREB mRNA were significantly decreased in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, amygdala and thalamus at 24 h after PTZ seizures. No significant change was found for CREB mRNA expression in these regions at 2 h or 1 week following PTZ seizures. These results show that a brief seizure caused a decline in CREB expression up to 24 h later.",
