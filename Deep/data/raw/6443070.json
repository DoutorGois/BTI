     "AB": "Male rats consumed a liquid diet containing 10.7% ethanol as their only source of food and fluid for 6.5 months, beginning at 2 months of age. During withdrawal, there were no differences between the alcohol group and their pair-fed or free-fed controls on EEG, body temperature, irritability and tremor measures. In behavioral tests begun 4-5 weeks after withdrawal, the rats that had consumed alcohol acquired accurate spatial behavior in a cross maze task more slowly than controls, but were unimpaired in shuttle-avoidance learning. In concurrent studies with groups of rats that had sustained lesions of the dorsal hippocampus, the mamillary bodies (MMB), or the mediodorsal thalamus, the pattern of behavioral deficits after MMB lesions was found to be qualitatively similar to that observed after the cessation of long-term alcohol consumption. These findings provide renewed hope that a useful rodent model for studying the neuropsychology of cognitive deficits associated with human alcoholism can be developed.",
