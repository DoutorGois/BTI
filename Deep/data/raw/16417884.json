     "AB": "Research studies suggest that the left hemisphere is involved in the pathophysiology of dyslexia. Thus far, the exact location and nature of the purported lesion(s) remain a matter of contention. The present study describes the distribution of structural abnormalities as related to brain symmetry in the brains of dyslexic individuals. High-resolution three-dimensional magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were analyzed in 16 dyslexic men and 14 controls matched for sex, age, educational level, and handedness. A computerized image analysis system was used to assess the volumetric deformations required to match each brain with its left-right mirror image. The results showed significant abnormalities in five left hemisphere structures involving the extrapyramidal and limbic systems: amygdala, hippocampus proper, parahippocampal gyrus, putamen, and globus pallidus. The left hemisphere is thought to play a major role in the temporal analysis of information. This stream of temporal analysis is of importance in motor movements. Reading might have evolved as an exaptation to motor movements requiring the sequential analysis of information.",
