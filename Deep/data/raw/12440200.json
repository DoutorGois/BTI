     "AB": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The endogenous opioid system plays an important role in cognitive functions and may also contribute to the progression of some kind of dementia. Naloxone has been shown to exert beneficial effects on memory deficits in patients with senile dementia and reverse some of the effects induced by endogeneous opioids. We therefore investigated the effects of naloxone on cognitive function in rats with vascular dementia (VD). METHODS: Vascular dementia was established by permanent occlusion of the common carotid arteries. Rats were divided into three groups viz., sham-operated controls, naloxone treated VD rats (naloxone 0.8 mg/kg, i.p. daily for 7 days), and nontreated VD rats. The Morris water maze test was performed to study spatial learning and memory. The extracellular recording technique was used to record long-term potentiation (LTP) of the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse in the rat hippocampal slices. RESULTS: In the hidden platform trials, escape latencies of the naloxone treated VD rats were significantly shorter than that of the nontreated VD rats (P < 0.001). In the probe trials, the number of enteries in the target area of the naloxone treated VD rats (8.36 +/- 1.38 times/min) were more than that of the nontreated VD rats (4.64 +/- 1.73 times/min) (P < 0.01). The magnitudes of LTP recorded in the CA1 pyramidal neurons of the naloxone treated VD rats were significantly augmented when compared to the nontreated VD rats (P < 0.05). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Naloxone could facilitate spatial learning and memory and enhance LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampus in rats with VD. It is postulated that naloxone might exert beneficial effects on cognitive function in VD in rats by modulating the synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal neuronal network.",
