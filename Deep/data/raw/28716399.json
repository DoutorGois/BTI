     "AB": "At present, it is not clear whether alpha1-adrenoceptors in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) are involved in Parkinson's disease-related depression. Here we examined effects of PrL alpha1-adrenoceptors on depressive-like behaviors in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the medial forebrain bundle. The lesion induced depressive-like responses as measured by the sucrose preference and forced swim tests compared to sham-operated rats. Intra-PrL injection of alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine induced or increased the expression of depressive-like behaviors in sham-operated and the lesioned rats. Further, intra-PrL injection of alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist benoxathian produced antidepressant effects in two groups of rats. Intra-PrL injection of phenylephrine increased the mean firing rate of PrL pyramidal neurons in both sham-operated and the lesioned rats, while benoxathian decreased the mean firing rate of the neurons. Compared to sham-operated rats, the duration of phenylephrine and benoxathian action on the firing rate of the pyramidal neurons was shortened in the lesioned rats. Neurochemical results showed that intra-PrL injection of phenylephrine or benoxathian increased or decreased dopamine and noradrenaline and serotonin levels in the medial prefrontal cortex, ventral hippocampus and habenula in sham-operated and the lesioned rats, respectively. Altogether, these results suggest that activation and blockade of alpha1-adrenoceptors in the PrL change the firing activity of the pyramidal neurons, and then increase or decrease levels of three monoamines in the limbic and limbic-related brain regions, which are involved in the regulation of depressive-like behaviors. Additionally, the results also suggest that the dopaminergic lesion leads to hypofunctionality of alpha1-adrenoceptors on pyramidal neurons of the PrL.",
