     "AB": "The role of hippocampal cholinergic mechanisms in learning a bar-press response reinforced with food was investigated. Firstly, an interstrain comparison showed that mice having a low choline acetyltransferase activity in the dorsal hippocampus were quicker to associate the barpress with reinforcement. Secondly, when the activity of this enzyme was reduced by a subseizure electrical stimulation of the hippocampus learning was accelerated. It is suggested that acetylcholine availability at the hippocampal synapses slowed the apparition of these learned responses.",
