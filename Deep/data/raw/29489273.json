     "AB": "The hippocampus is the \"flash drive\" of the human brain and often associated with memory consolidation and decision making, but it is far more complex in structure and function than a flash drive. The hippocampus is a convex elevation of gray matter tissue within the para-hippocampal gyrus inside the inferior temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. It can be described more holistically as a curved and recurved sheet of the cortex that is folded into the temporal lobe's medial surface. The hippocampus has three distinct zones: the dentate gyrus, the hippocampus proper, and the subiculum. The dentate gyrus and hippocampus proper forms two C-shaped rings that interlock. The subiculum is thus a transition zone, linking the hippocampus proper with the dentate gyrus. The parahippocampal gyrus and cingulate sulci are located on the medial surface of the hemisphere, forming a C-shaped ring. The medial temporal lobe cortex includes major subdivisions such as the hippocampus an entorhinal cortex. This five centimeter-long hippocampus (from the anterior end at amygdala to posterior end near the splenium of the corpus callosum) is divided into a head, body, and tail. The head is expanded and bears two or three shallow grooves called pes hippocampi. The head of the hippocampus is part of the posterior half of the triangular uncus and is separated inferiorly from the parahippocampal gyrus by the uncal sulcus. The alveus, which is the surface of the hippocampus, is covered by the ependymal inside the ventricular cavity. The fornix which is the main outflow bundle out of the hippocampus wraps around the thalamus, where it is then separated by the choroidal fissure and the choroid plexus. The hippocampus contains parts like the fimbria, crus, body, and column. The fimbria is formed where alveus fibers converge along the medial portion of the lateral ventricle's inferior horn. The white matter of the fimbria separates to form a crux of the ipsilateral fornix at a point beyond the splenium of the corpus callosum. Cornus Ammonis (CA) is a seahorse-like or ram's horn-like structure which describes the different layers of the hippocampus. There are four hippocampal subfields CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4. CA3 and CA2 border the hilus of the dentate gyrus on either side. CA3 is the largest in the hippocampus and receives fibers from the dentate granule cells on their proximal dendrites. The pyramidal cell layer is about 10 cells thick.",
