     "AB": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), exemplified by complex partial seizures, is recognized in ~30% of epileptic patients. Seizures in TLE are associated with cognitive dysfunction and are resistant to antiepileptic drug therapy in ~35% of patients. Although surgical resection of the hippocampus bestows improved seizure regulation in most cases of intractable TLE, this choice can cause lasting cognitive deficiency and reliance on antiepileptic drugs. Thus, alternative therapies that are proficient in both containing the spontaneous recurrent seizures and reversing the cognitive dysfunction are needed. The cell transplantation approach is promising in serving as an adept alternate therapy for TLE, because this strategy has shown the capability to curtail epileptogenesis when used soon after an initial precipitating brain injury, and to restrain spontaneous recurrent seizures and improve cognitive function when utilized after the occurrence of TLE. Nonetheless, this treatment needs further advancement and rigorous evaluation in animal prototypes of chronic TLE before the conceivable clinical use. It is especially vital to gauge the efficacy of distinct donor cell types, such as the hippocampal precursor cells, gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic progenitors, and neural stem cells derived from diverse human sources (including the embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells) for longstanding seizure suppression using continuous electroencephalographic recordings for prolonged periods. Additionally, the identification of the mechanisms underlying the graft-mediated seizure suppression and improved cognitive function, and the development of apt grafting strategies that enhance the anti-seizure and pro-cognitive effects of grafts will be necessary. The goal of this review is to evaluate the progress made hitherto in this area and to discuss the prospect for cell-based therapy for TLE.",
