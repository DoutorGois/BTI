     "AB": "After 3 or 4 weeks of age, insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) gene expression in normal rats has been detected only in mesenchymal tissue associated with the central nervous system. In contrast, the IGF-II/mannose-6-phosphate receptor has been reported to be widely distributed in adult rat brain. This study was performed in order to clarify the cellular localization of IGF-II and IGF-II/mannose-6-phosphate receptor in rat brain by comparing an immunocytochemical map with the distribution of mRNAs by in situ hybridization. The highest levels of IGF-II mRNA were detected in the choroid plexus and meningeal membranes. In contrast, IGF-II receptor transcripts were mainly present in neuron-rich areas such as the hippocampus, with a lower signal present in the choroid plexus and meninges. Specific IGF-II receptor immunoreactivity was present in neurons throughout the forebrain, with the highest intensity in the pyramidal cell and polymorphic layers of the hippocampus and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. This distribution was similar to that obtained with the in situ hybridization technique. No glial staining was detected. Although the role of IGF-II in the adult rat brain, acting through its specific receptor, is not clear; in vitro and in vivo data suggest a possible neurotropic and/or neuromodulatory action.",
