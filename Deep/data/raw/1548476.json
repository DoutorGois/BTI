     "AB": "The extracellular amino acid concentrations in the left and right dorsal hippocampus of male rats were studied before and during application of vasopressin into the right hippocampus. The method of intracerebral microdialysis was used for both arginine vasopressin administration and monitoring of the composition of the extracellular fluid. The concentrations of 16 amino acids were measured by HPLC in the perfusate samples. The level of taurine declined 20% in the right hippocampus during perfusion with vasopressin, whereas o-phosphoethanolamine decreased in both sides, the left 20% and the right 24%. These alterations may be related to cerebral osmoregulation. Also, the levels of tyrosine and phenylalanine increased 15% and 35%, respectively, during administration of vasopressin. No changes of other amino acids were observed.",
