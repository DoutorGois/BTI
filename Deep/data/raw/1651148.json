     "AB": "The effects of habituation and inhibitory avoidance training on the rat brain regional levels of benzodiazepine (BZD)-like molecules and on central type BZD binding sites were examined. BZD-like immunoreactivity was decreased by 26-50% in the amygdala, cerebral cortex and septum of rats sacrificed immediately after stepping-down from the platform of an inhibitory avoidance apparatus (non-trained group) as compared to naive controls. Rats submitted to a second step-down session 20 h later (habituated group) have significantly lower BZD-like immunoreactivity in the septum (-60%) as compared to non-trained animals. Rats exposed to an inhibitory avoidance training, i.e. stepping-down and receiving a footshock (trained group), showed a significant reduction in the content of BZD-like molecules in cerebral cortex (-44%), amygdala (-68%), septum (-80%) and hippocampus (-82%) as compared to non-trained rats. In addition, the density of central type BZD binding sites was slightly increased in the hippocampus and septum of trained rats. No changes were observed in the apparent dissociation constant. No changes were observed in parallel measurements of [3H]-L-quinuclidinyl benzylate binding constants at cholinergic muscarinic binding sites. The immediate posttraining intrahippocampal bilateral injection of the central type BZD receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 nmol/hippocampus), enhanced the retention of habituation but not when injected in the amygdala or septum. In contrast, retention of the inhibitory avoidance task was significantly increased by flumazenil administered bilaterally into any of the 3 brain structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
