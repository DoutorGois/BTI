     "AB": "Present evidence suggests that medial temporal cortices subserve allocentric representation and memory, whereas egocentric representation and memory also depends on parietal association cortices and the striatum. Virtual reality environments have a major advantage for the assessment of spatial navigation and memory formation, as computer-simulated first-person environments can simulate navigation in a large-scale space. Twenty-nine patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) were compared with 29 healthy matched controls on two virtual reality tasks affording to learn a virtual park (allocentric memory) and a virtual maze (egocentric memory). Participants further received a neuropsychological investigation and MRI volumetry at the time of the assessment. Results indicate that aMCI patients had significantly reduced size of the hippocampus bilaterally and the right-sided precuneus and inferior parietal cortex. aMCI patients were severely impaired learning the virtual park and the virtual maze. Smaller volumes of the right-sided precuneus were related to worse performance on the virtual maze. Participants with striatal lacunar lesions committed more errors than participants without such lesions on the virtual maze but not on the virtual park. aMCI patients later converting to dementia (n=15) had significantly smaller hippocampal size when compared with non-converters (n=14). However, both groups did not differ on virtual reality task performance. Our study clearly demonstrates the feasibility of virtual reality technology to study spatial memory deficits of persons with aMCI. Future studies should try to design spatial virtual reality tasks being specific enough to predict conversion from MCI to dementia and conversion from normal to MCI.",
