     "AB": "Intracellular activity was recorded from CA1 neurons in the slice preparation, by using K-acetate-, Bapta- or EGTA-filled micropipettes. The calcium chelator, Bapta, clamps [Ca]i more rapidly than EGTA and is less associated with pH changes. Neurons recorded with Bapta-filled micropipettes were much less sensitive to 5-HT and baclafen than those recorded with the standard K-acetate- or EGTA-filled micropipetes. These results suggest that [Ca]i is important for the generation of the 5-HT-dependent potassium current.",
