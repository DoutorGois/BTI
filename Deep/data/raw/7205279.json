     "AB": "A gas chromatographic-mass fragmentographic (GC-MF) procedure is described for the simultaneous quantitation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (DHPG) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG) in brain tissue and plasma. DHPG and MHPG were assayed as their respective acetyl-trifluoroacyl esters, using [2H2]DHPG and [2H3]MHPG as internal standards. Assay sensitives of at least 1 ng per sample were attainable for the quantitation of free glycols, whereas for determination of total DHPG, assay sensitivity was 2.5 ng. Whole rat brain total (99.2 +/- 4.11 ng/g) and free (13.0 +/- 1.14 ng/g) DHPG concentrations were similar to respective total (86.0 +/- 3.70 ng/g) and free (12.3 +/- 0.41 ng/g) MHPG levels. Total DHPG concentrations exceeded total MHPG levels in hypothalamus (3.0:1), midbrain (1.4:1), pons plus medulla (1.3:1), and hippocampus (1.5:1), whereas in other brain regions the levels of these metabolites were similar. In plasma, however, total DHPG levels were only 20% as high as MHPG concentrations. In mouse brain, DHPG and MHPG occurred almost entirely in free form (greater than 90%), but total DHPG levels were only 50% as high as respective MHPG concentrations. These results emphasize the substantial formation of DHPG compared with MHPG in rat and mouse brain and suggest that DHPG formation and efflux may be of equal or greater importance than MHPG in the metabolic clearance of CNS norepinephrine in some species.",
