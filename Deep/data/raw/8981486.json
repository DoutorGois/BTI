     "AB": "Effects of conantokin-T, a 21 amino acid peptide toxin isolated from the fish-hunting cone snail Conus tulipa, on the high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channel currents were studied in acutely dissociated rat hippocampal CA1 neurons using whole-cell voltage clamp-recording technique with 5 mM Ba2+ as the charge carrier. Conantokin-T inhibited the whole-cell Ba2+ current (IBa) in a concentration-dependent manner. The nimodipine (20 microM) and omega-agatoxin-IVA (0.2 microM) block of IBa were abolished in the presence of conantokin-T (3 microM); however, conantokin-T (3 microM) did not affect the block of IBa induced by 3 microM omega-conotoxin-GVIA. These results indicate that conantokin-T is a potent but wide-spectrum Ca2+ channel antagonist.",
