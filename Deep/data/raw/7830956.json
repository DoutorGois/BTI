     "AB": "It has been shown that target-derived neurotrophins are not necessary for the survival of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons in adult rats. In this study, we have removed the hippocampus in early postnatal rats by unilateral excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartate lesions at postnatal days 5, 10 and 20. At postnatal day 70, numerous cholinergic neurons (60% of controls) were present in the medial septum on the lesioned side. This suggests that there is only a limited influence of target-derived neurotrophic factors to these cells also in development.",
