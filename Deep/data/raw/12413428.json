This article highlights some of the key methods for studying the expression levels of green fluorescent protein and neurotrophic factors after injections of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors into the brain. The data demonstrate greater spread and higher levels of expression using the cytomegalovirus/chicken beta-actin (CBA) promoter coupled with the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE), compared to earlier AAV serotype 2 vectors. Injections of either CBA-nerve growth factor (NGF)-WPRE or CBA-glial cell line-derived neutrotrophic factor-WPRE AAV vectors into the nucleus basalis of the basal forebrain led to clear and consistent elevation of the respective trophic factor as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with NGF vectors affecting the size and number of cholinergic neurons. AAV serotype may also be important for the spread of expression, since injecting an AAV-5 vector into the hippocampus led to higher-frequency transfection of dentate gyrus granule neurons, suggesting altered tropism relative to AAV-2.",
