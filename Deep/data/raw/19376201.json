     "AB": "The neural plasticity mechanisms that underlie learning and memory may also be engaged when drug addiction occurs. It was reported that long-lasting neuroadaptations induced by cocaine use and withdrawal require the participation of hippocampus. However, the role of corticotrophin-releasing factor receptors in this process remains unclear. In the present study, the effects of chronic cocaine treatment (a 14-day cocaine administration, 20 mg/kg i.p., daily) and short-term cocaine withdrawal (a 3-day cocaine extinction following a 14-day cocaine administration) on long-term potentiation (LTP), one prominent cellular mechanism for learning and memory, were assessed in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slices. We found that cocaine withdrawal, but not the chronic cocaine administration itself, significantly enhanced the magnitude of LTP in hippocampal slices, as compared with that in saline controls. Selective blockade of corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor subtype 1 (CRF(1)) with the specific antagonist NBI 27914 (100 nM in vitro) attenuated the magnitude of LTP in hippocampal slices from cocaine withdrawal rats, and intriguingly, also from saline control rats, while specific blockade of corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor subtype 2 (CRF(2)) with astressin2-B (100 nM in vitro) selectively attenuated the magnitude of LTP in hippocampal slices from cocaine withdrawal rats. Our data suggest that short-term cocaine withdrawal treatment may cause synaptic plasticity in hippocampus partially via changing the activity of CRF(2) in the hippocampus.",
