     "AB": "Previous work from our laboratory suggests that paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) decreases persistent sodium currents and hyperpolarization-activated cation currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and this leads to decreases in neuron excitability. Here, we further investigate the mechanisms of rhythmic theta-range activity in the hippocampus by examining the resonance characteristics of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Sleep deprivation (SD) interfered with the rhythmic activity of theta band in the hippocampus, which may be involved in the deficit of the spatial learning ability of rats. Additionally, SD changes the voltage dependence of resonance. The effect of SD on the ion currents may contribute to the alternation of the theta resonance of neurons and further influence the physiological function. These results suggest that changes in neuron resonance lead to changes in the generation of rhythmic theta activity, and may contribute to behavioral deficits associated with theta activity during learning and memory tasks. We suggest the resonant properties of hippocampal neurons are potential targets for preventing deleterious effects of sleep deprivation.",
