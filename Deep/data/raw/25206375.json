     "AB": "This study aimed to investigate changes in secretory pathway Ca(2+)-ATPase 2 expression following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, and to define the role of Ca(2+)-ATPases in oxidative stress. A rat model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury was established using the unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion method. Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-PCR assay results showed that compared with the control group, the expression of secretory pathway Ca(2+)-ATPase 2 protein and mRNA in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of male rats did not significantly change during the ischemic period. However, secretory pathway Ca(2+)-ATPase 2 protein and mRNA expression reduced gradually at 1, 3, and 24 hours during the reperfusion period. Our experimental findings indicate that levels of secretory pathway Ca(2+)-ATPase 2 protein and mRNA expression in brain tissue change in response to cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.",
