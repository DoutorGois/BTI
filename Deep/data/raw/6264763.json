     "AB": "The effect of low concentrations (1-5%) of ethanol on the histamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase system was examined in guinea pig gastric mucosa and hippocampus homogenate. Ethanol in these concentrations caused a dose-dependent increase of the adenylate cyclase activity, and this effect was not inhibited by histamine antagonists. Phosphodiesterase activities were not affected by these concentrations of alcohol. Our in vitro findings agree well with the results of BUNCE and PARSONS [10].",
