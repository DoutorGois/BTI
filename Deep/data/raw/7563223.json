     "AB": "The expression of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase-sigma (RPTP-sigma) mRNA during rat development was examined by Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses. Northern blot analysis revealed that the two transcripts (5.7 kb and 6.9 kb) had different spatial and temporal patterns of expression. The 6.9-kb transcript was more abundant during embryonic development, whereas the 5.7-kb transcript was more abundant during postnatal development and in the adult. In situ hybridization revealed that RPTP-sigma mRNA was widely expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system during embryonic development. Very high levels were seen in the ventricular zone, subventricular zone, cortex, dorsal root ganglia, cranial nerve ganglia, olfactory epithelium, and retina. During postnatal development the level of expression decreased in most brain regions. However, high levels continued to be seen in the hippocampus. Emulsion autoradiography revealed that the majority of RPTP-sigma mRNA is expressed in neurons. Northern analysis showed that cultured glial cells expressed the 6.9-kb transcript, but not the 5.7-kb. RPTP-sigma mRNA expression profiles were clearly distinct from those of leukocyte antigen-related protein (LAR), a closely related RPTP. The spatiotemporal pattern of RPTP-sigma mRNA expression indicates that RPTP-sigma may play a role in the development of the nervous system.",
