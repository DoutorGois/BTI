     "AB": "Neutrophil-activating peptide-1/interleukin-8 (NAP-1/IL-8) is a cytokine synthesized by various cell types. In the immune system NAP-1/IL-8 is part of an immune cascade initiated by IL-1 production. NAP-1/IL-8 affects hypothalamic function and its production is suppressed by steroids. Therefore, it might be expected that NAP-1/IL-8 would be produced in brain areas involved in the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA). NAP-1/IL-8 mRNA was localized by in situ hybridization in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and hippocampus. Those areas also express the genes encoding interleukin-1-alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-1 beta, IL-1 receptors, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). This suggests that an immune cascade, which is well characterized in the immune system, may exist in brain, in areas of relevance to the regulation of stress-related neuroendocrine function.",
