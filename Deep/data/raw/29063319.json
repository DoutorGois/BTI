     "AB": "The expression of Notch2, Numb, and Cas8 genes, whose protein products are involved in regulation of neurogenesis/neuroapoptosis processes, was studied in the relevant cerebral structures of male Wistar rats trained in a spatial habit. The formation of long-term spatial memory was found to be associated with the formation of a specific pattern of transcription activity of the studied genes in different brain structures. The maximum expression of Notch2 gene was found in the hippocampus and cerebellum, the maximum expression of Numb was detected in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, and the maximum expression of Cas8 was revealed in the prefrontal cortex of trained animals.",
