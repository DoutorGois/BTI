     "AB": "TRAP220 (thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein) is a recently cloned nuclear receptor coactivator, which interacts with several nuclear receptors in a ligand-dependent manner and stimulates transcription by recruiting the TRAP mediator complex to hormone responsive promoter regions. TRAP220 has been shown to interact with thyroid hormone receptors, vitamin D receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, retinoic acid receptors and oestrogen receptors. Thyroid hormone and retinoic acid play very important roles in brain development and they also influence adult brain. Using in situ hybridization we have examined expression of TRAP220 mRNA in the central nervous system during development and in adult rat and mouse brain. Expression of TRAP220 was seen already during early embryonic development in the epithelium of neural tube at E9 in mouse and at E12 in rat. At later stages of development the strongest signal was seen in different layers of cerebral neocortex, external germinal layer of cerebellum, differentiating fields of hippocampus and neuroepithelium, and a moderate signal was detected in basal ganglia, different areas of diencephalon and midbrain. In adult rat brain the signal was more restricted than during development. TRAP220 expression occurred mostly in the granular layer of cerebellar cortex, piriform cortex and hippocampal formation. The signal was found predominantly in neurons. Our work supports the assumption that TRAP220 plays an important role in growth and differentiation of central nervous system and may have a function in certain areas of adult brain.",
