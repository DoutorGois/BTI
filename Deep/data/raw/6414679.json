     "AB": "Perfusion of 50 microM norepinephrine (NE) produced a marked, reversible decrease (range 20-28%) of the extracellular population spike and excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) responses of the CA1 region evoked by stratum radiatum stimulation in the rat hippocampal slice preparation. The effects of NE were dramatically altered in slices obtained from animals which were previously treated with intracerebral or intraventricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to destroy forebrain catecholamine systems. In the latter preparations NE produced a reduction in the inhibition of the EPSP (50%), enhancement of the population spike amplitude, and multiple spike discharges characteristic of ongoing epileptiform activity. The reversal of NE-induced inhibition and the generation of seizurelike activity in 6-OHDA-treated animals suggests that NE may, in part, act upon interneurons to produce a disinhibition of CA1 pyramidal cells.",
