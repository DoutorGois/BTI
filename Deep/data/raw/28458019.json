     "AB": "The deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) has been involved in neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Besides Abeta plaques and neuronal loss, microglia activation is also common in AD patient brains, suggesting its important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Although activation of microglia by Abeta plaques has been demonstrated, the mechanism underlying it is still largely unclear. Here, we found that TRPC6 has a crucial role in microglia activation by Abeta. Abeta up-regulates the level of TRPC6 via NF-kappaB in BV-2 microglia and increases the expression of pro-inflammatory factors and oxidative enzyme, COX-2. Knock-down of TRPC6 reduces the Abeta-induced expression of pro-inflammatory factors and COX-2 and the damage of hippocampus neurons. Furthermore, inhibition of COX-2 also protects hippocampus neurons from Abeta-induced inflammatory damage. Collectively, our studies suggest that Abeta increase the expression of TRPC6 via NF-kappaB in BV-2 microglia and promotes the production of COX-2, which induces hippocampus neuron damage.",
