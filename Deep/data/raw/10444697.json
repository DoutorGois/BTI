     "AB": "Recent reports suggest that kainate acting at presynaptic receptors reduces the release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA from hippocampal neurons. In contrast, in the hypothalamus in the presence of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists [1-(4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466) and D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5)], kainate increased GABA release. In the presence of tetrodotoxin, the frequency, but not the amplitude, of GABA-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) was enhanced by kainate, consistent with a presynaptic site of action. Postsynaptic activation of kainate receptors on cell bodies/dendrites was also found. In contrast to the hippocampus where kainate increases excitability by reducing GABA release, in the hypothalamus where a much higher number of GABAergic cells exist, kainate-mediated activation of transmitter release from inhibitory neurons may reduce the level of neuronal activity in the postsynaptic cell.",
