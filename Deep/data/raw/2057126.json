     "AB": "'Per repeat is a rodent genomic DNA fragment which is homologous to the Gly-Thr repetitive amino acid sequence of the Drosophila clock gene period'. This study examined the temporal and spatial expression of the per repeat mRNA in rat brain. Northern blot analysis showed that the level of per repeat mRNA species fluctuates under light-dark cycle conditions in rat brain. Furthermore, the fluctuation of per repeat mRNA was clearly observed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, but not so in other regions including the hippocampus as shown by in situ hybridization. The above results suggest that the Gly-Thr repetitive sequence also plays an important role in the circadian rhythm of mammals.",
