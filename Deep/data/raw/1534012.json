     "AB": "The protein B-50 (F1, GAP-43) is a presynaptic-specific substrate of protein kinase C, functionally related to neurotransmitter release. An increase in phosphorylation of this protein has been proposed as a molecular mechanism underlying long-term potentiation (LTP). B-50 phosphorylation measured by quantitative immunoprecipitation in rat hippocampal slices incubated in the presence of radiolabeled inorganic phosphate was increased for at least 1 hr after the induction of LTP in the CA1 region. No significant changes in B-50 phosphorylation were observed in untetanized slices stimulated at low frequency. The direct demonstration of an increased phosphorylation of the protein B-50 during LTP is consistent with the hypothesis that presynaptic mechanisms contribute to maintenance of LTP.",
