     "AB": "Norepinephrine and dopamine were examined in 19 discrete brain areas from the telencephalon, diencephalon, and mesencephalon of nutritionally rehabilitated adult rats following postnatal undernutrition from birth through 21 days of age. Following rehabilitation, catecholamine levels were not significantly different from control values in any of the areas examined. Catecholamine concentrations in young, undernourished rats are generally elevated (either from stress or from nutritional insufficiency). Data presented here show that whichever case is true, the early effect of undernourishment is transient and that normal values are restored by nutritional rehabilitation.",
