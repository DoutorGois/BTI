     "AB": "Partial reduction of [Mg2+]o from 2 to 1 mM markedly enhanced neuronal responses evoked by Schaffer collateral-commissural fiber stimulation in the CA1-region of rat hippocampal slices. The amplitude of extracellular population potentials recorded in the CA1-pyramidal cell layer and maximum dV/dt of extracellular population EPSP's recorded in the CA1-pyramidal apical dendritic layer were both increased. However, unlike findings from slices where Mg2+ was completely removed from the bathing medium, there was no spontaneous or evoked epileptiform activity, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (2-APV) did not antagonize the enhancement of evoked responses. These results indicate that, in addition to the participation of NMDA receptors in the epileptiform activity observed when Mg2+ is completely removed from the bathing medium, there is also an NMDA receptor-independent excitatory action of partial reduction of [Mg2+]o in hippocampal slices.",
