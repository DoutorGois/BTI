     "AB": "The effect of conventional and rapid amygdala kindling on mossy fibre sprouting and on the development of secondary after-discharges in the hippocampus, i.e. recurring after-discharges after the end of primary after-discharges in the amygdala, was investigated. Rapid kindling, i.e. electric stimulation of the amygdala for 10 s every 30 min, induced prolonged secondary after-discharges in the hippocampus, which occurred after the first stimulation, and mossy fibre sprouting. Conventional kindling, i.e. electric stimulation of the amygdala for 1 s once daily, induced secondary after-discharges in the hippocampus only after prolonged motor seizures, but no mossy fibre sprouting. These results suggest that mossy fibre sprouting and the occurrence of secondary after-discharges in the hippocampus are not crucial for conventional amygdala kindling. Rapid kindling induces these epileptogenic changes in the hippocampus very early and may therefore follow a different route of epileptogenesis than conventional kindling.",
