     "AB": "Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, poor engraftment and limited survival rates are major obstacles for its clinical application. Resveratrol, an activator of silent information regulator 2, homolog 1 (SIRT1), regulates cell destiny and is beneficial for neurodegenerative disorders. The present study is designed to explore whether resveratrol regulates the fate of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) and whether hUC-MSCs combined with resveratrol would be efficacious in the treatment of neurodegeneration in a mouse model of AD through SIRT1 signaling. Herein, we report that resveratrol facilitates hUC-MSCs engraftment in the hippocampus of AD mice and resveratrol enhances the therapeutic effects of hUC-MSCs in this model as demonstrated by improved learning and memory in the Morris water maze, enhanced neurogenesis and alleviated neural apoptosis in the hippocampus of the AD mice. Moreover, hUC-MSCs and resveratrol jointly regulate expression of hippocampal SIRT1, PCNA, p53, ac-p53, p21, and p16. These data strongly suggests that hUC-MSCs transplantation combined with resveratrol may be an effective therapy for AD.",
