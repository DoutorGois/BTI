     "AB": "Synchronized neuronal activity (seizures) can appear in the presence or absence of synaptic transmission. Mechanisms of seizure initiation in each of these conditions have been studied, but relatively few studies have addressed seizure termination. In particular, how are seizures terminated in the absence of synaptic activity where there is no loss of excitatory drive or augmentation of inhibitory inputs? We have studied dynamic activity-dependent changes of intracellular pH in the absence of synaptic transmission using the fluorescent pH indicator carboxylseminaphthorhodafluo-1. During epileptiform activity we observed intracellular acidification, whereas between seizures the intracellular pH recovered. Experimental conditions that shortened the epileptiform discharge correlated with more rapid intracellular acidification. On the other hand, experimental manipulation of intracellular pH altered the duration of the seizure discharge, with acidification resulting in early termination of the epileptiform activity. These data show a direct relationship between the level of intracellular acidification and the duration of the seizures, suggesting that an intracellular pH-dependent process can terminate nonsynaptic neuronal synchronization.",
