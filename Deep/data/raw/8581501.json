     "AB": "We developed a method for measuring neuropeptides and monoamines in the same rat brain tissue and applied this method to study the effects of electroconvulsive stimuli (ECS) on these compounds. Rats were treated with repeated ECS or sham ECS. After sacrifice by focused microwave irradiation, brains were dissected and immediately frozen. The tissues were extracted in acetic acid. After lyophilization the samples were reconstituted in phosphate buffer and divided in three fractions: (1) was further purified on a cation-exchange column before catecholamines were measured on a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system, (2) for measuring serotonin on the HPLC system, (3) for measuring peptide concentrations by specific radioimmunoassays. Confirming our previous findings, ECS significantly increased neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (-LI) in hippocampus and frontal cortex and neurokinin A-LI in the hippocampus, while no changes in substance P- and neurotensin-LI were detected. New findings were a decrease in noradrenaline concentrations in the frontal and occipital cortex and hippocampus, an increase in dopamine concentrations in the frontal and occipital cortex and no serotonin change. In summary, we have developed methods to measure both peptides and monoamines in the same brain tissue specimens, and have shown that ECS leads to changes in both neuropeptides and classical neurotransmitters in distinct brain regions.",
