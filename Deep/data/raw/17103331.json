     "AB": "Periventricular white matter injury in premature infants is linked to chronic neurological dysfunction. Periventricular white matter injury is caused by many mechanisms including hypoxia-ischemia (HI). Animal models of HI in the neonatal rodent brain can replicate some important features of periventricular white matter injury. Most rodent studies have focused upon early cellular and tissue events following unilateral neonatal HI that is elicited by unilateral carotid artery ligation and followed by timed exposure to moderate hypoxia. Milder hypoxic-ischemic insults elicit preferential white matter injury. Little information is available about long-term cellular effects of unilateral HI. One month after unilateral neonatal hypoxia ischemia, we show that all the components for structural reorganization of the brain are present in moderately injured rats. These components in the injured side include extensive influx of neurites, axonal and dendritic growth cones, abundant immature synapses, and myelination of many small axons. Surprisingly, this neural recovery is often found in and adjacent to cysts that have the ultrastructural features of bone extracellular matrix. In contrast, brains with severe hypoxia ischemia one month after injury still undergo massive neuronal degeneration. While massive destruction of neurons and glia are striking events shortly after brain HI, neural cells re-express their intrinsic properties and attempt an anatomical recovery long after injury.",
