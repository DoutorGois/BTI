The presurgical evaluation aims to detect the epileptogenic brain area by use of different diagnostic techniques. In this review article the current diagnostic procedures applied for this purpose are described. The diagnostic armamentarium can be divided conceptually into three different groups: assessment of function/dysfunction, structural/morphologic imaging methods and functional neuroimaging techniques. Properties, diagnostic power and limits of all diagnostic tools used in the diagnostic evaluation are discussed. In addition, future perspectives and the diagnostic value of new technologies are mentioned. Some are increasingly gaining acceptance in the routine preoperative diagnostic procedure like MR volumetry or MR spectroscopy of the hippocampus in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Some, on the other hand, like MEG and 11C-flumazenil PET, still remain experimental diagnostic tools as they are technically demanding and cost intensive. Besides the refinement of established techniques, co-registration of different modalities like spike-triggered functional MRI will play an important role in the non-invasive detection of the epileptic seizure focus and may change the regimen of the preoperative diagnostic work up of epilepsy patients in the future.",
