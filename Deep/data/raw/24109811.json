     "AB": "Spatiotemporal pattern of neuronal network activity is a key component of brain information processing. Cultured rat hippocampal neurons on the multielectrodes array dish are suitable for analyzing and manipulating network dynamics and its developmental changes. We applied paired electrical inputs at various inter-stimulus intervals (ISi) and analyzed the spatio-temporal pattern of evoked responses. We found that the pattern of evoked electrical activity was affected by existence of a prior input in the case that ISi of paired stimuli was within 2 s. These results suggest that a semi-artificial neuronal network on a culture dish has a fundamental component of short-term memory, and the origin of this hysteresis is transition among the internal states of the network, undertaken by synaptic transmissions.",
