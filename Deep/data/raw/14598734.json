     "AB": "Xenon (Xe) is being more widely used in medicine owing to its unique physical-and-chemical properties of a noble gas. However, the knowledge about the physiological and patho-physiological changes occurring in the organism and in its separate structures during the interaction with Xe is still scanty. The aim of this survey was to briefly describe the presently known Xe biological-and-medical properties and certain mechanisms of Xe impact produced on cells and receptors as well as on the release of mediators and hormones. Besides, the Xe hemodynamic effects are also defined. The conclusion is that the Xe effect can be of a complex nature and can depend on the conditions of the body vital activity (optimal condition, activation, lesion), which predetermine, in their turn, the performance of the structural-and-functional units of various cellular systems.",
