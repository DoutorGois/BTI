     "AB": "Medical use of ionizing radiation (IR) has great benefits for treatment and diagnostic imaging, but procedures as computerized tomography (CT) may deliver a significant radiation dose to the patient. Recently, awareness has been raised about possible non-cancer consequences from low dose exposure to IR during critical phases of perinatal and/or neonatal brain development. In the present study neonatal NMRI mice were whole body irradiated with a single dose of gamma radiation (0; 350 and 500 mGy) on postnatal day 10 (PND 10). At 2 and 4 months of age, mice of both sexes were observed for spontaneous behaviour in a novel home environment. The neuroproteins CaMKII, GAP-43, synaptophysin and total tau in male mouse cerebral cortex and hippocampus were analysed 24h post-irradiation and in adults at 6 months of age exposed to 0 or 500 mGy on PND 10. A significantly dose-response related deranged spontaneous behaviour in 2- and 4-month-old mice was observed, where both males and females displayed a modified habituation, indicating reduced cognitive function. The dose of 350 mGy seems to be a tentative threshold. Six-month-old male mice showed a significantly increased level of total tau in cerebral cortex after irradiation to 500 mGy compared to controls. This demonstrates that a single moderate dose of IR, given during a defined critical period of brain development, is sufficient to cause persistently reduced cognitive function. Moreover, an elevation of tau protein was observed in male mice displaying reduced cognitive function.",
