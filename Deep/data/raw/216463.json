     "AB": "Habituation-like decrements in extracellular measures of synaptic activation (population EPSP) and cell discharge (population spike) were analyzed in the dentate gyrus of the rat following repetitive low-frequency stimulation of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex. Stimulation of either subdivision of the entorhinal projection system resulted in comparable habituation-like response decrements with similar stimulation regimens. However, habituating stimulation of one subdivision did not result in decreased responsiveness to stimulation of the other. Repetitive low-frequency stimulation or even a single pulse delivered to either subdivision did, however, result in a potentiation of granule cell discharge in response to stimulation of the other subdivision (a form of heterosynaptic potentiation). This heterosynaptic potentiation of granule cell discharge was not accompanied by any increase in the extracellular EPSP. Comparisons of the relationship between the population EPSP and population spike before and during habituating stimulation revealed changes in cell discharge in response to the habituating stimulus which could not be accounted for by changes in synaptic activation alone. The results suggest that repetitive activation of the temporodentate pathway alters granule cell output as a result of two processes, a habituation-like decrement in synaptic activation, and a potentiation of granule cell discharge as a consequence of prior activation.",
