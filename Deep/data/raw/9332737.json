     "AB": "Previous studies have suggested that the neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) are neuroprotective or neurotrophic for certain subpopulations of hippocampal neurons following various brain insults. In the present study, the expression of BDNF and NT-3 mRNAs in rat hippocampus was examined after traumatic brain injury. Following lateral fluid percussion (FP) brain injury of moderate severity (2.0-2.1 atm) or sham injury, the hippocampi from adult rats were processed for the in situ hybridization localization of BDNF and NT-3 mRNAs using 35S-labeled cRNA probes at post-injury survival times of 1, 3, 6, 24 and 72 h. Unilateral FP injury markedly increased hybridization for BDNF mRNA in the dentate gyrus bilaterally which peaked at 3 h and remained above control levels for up to 72 h post-injury. A moderate increase in BDNF mRNA expression was also observed bilaterally in the CA3 region of the hippocampus at 1, 3, and 6 h after FP injury, but expression declined to control levels by 24 h. Conversely, NT-3 mRNA was significantly decreased in the dentate gyrus following FP injury at the 6 and 24 h survival times. These results demonstrate that FP brain injury differentially modulates expression of BDNF and NT-3 mRNAs in the hippocampus, and suggest that neurotrophin plasticity is a functional response of hippocampal neurons to brain trauma.",
