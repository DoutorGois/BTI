     "AB": "Apomorphine and mCPP induced yawning associated with penile erections in rats, whereas physostigmine induced only yawns. Apomorphine-induced yawning and penile erections were antagonized by low doses of raclopride, whereas physostigmine-induced yawning and mCPP-induced effects were only partly inhibited at high doses of raclopride. Scopolamine as well as clozapine antagonized yawning and penile erections induced by apomorphine, mCPP and physostigmine. Similarly, the 5-HT1A agonists 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 inhibited yawning and penile erections induced by apomorphine, mCPP and physostigmine, and at similar doses induced lower lip retraction and hyperreactivity to handling. The beta/5-HT1A antagonist tertatolol reversed the inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 on drug-induced yawning and penile erections and increased apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced yawn frequency but not penile erection frequency. Like tertatolol, propranolol increased apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced yawn frequency, whereas ICI 118551 increased only physostigmine-induced yawning. 8-OH-DPAT- and S 14506-induced lower lip retraction and hyperreactivity to handling were also significantly antagonized by tertatolol. Finally, p-chlorophenylalanine pretreatment produced about 95% depletion in 5-HT in hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex and modified neither the responses of the inducing drugs nor the inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 on drug-induced yawning and penile erections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
