     "AB": "Embryonic mouse brain cells from the basal forebrain region were labeled in cell suspensions and transplanted into the denervated hippocampal formation of adult rats. Many labeled cells had the appearance of typical pyramidal neurons with dendrites that had both growth cones and neurites. Labeled neurons and glia were seen at several sites in the hippocampal formation. The neurons were located predominantly along the dentate granule cell layer and the pyramidal neurons had a preferred orientation of their apical dendrites toward the molecular layer. Since it was rare to see a surviving labeled neuron within the injection site, migration away from the injection site seemed important for survival of the cells. The methods used in these experiments should become an important adjunct to the methods for studying the migration, differentiation and growth of neurons and glia.",
