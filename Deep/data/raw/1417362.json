     "AB": "The effects of long-term lithium treatment on the 5-hydroxytryptamine-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in guinea-pig hippocampal membranes were examined. The stimulatory effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine on adenylate cyclase activity was guanine nucleotide-dependent and additive to those of dopamine, isoproterenol, norepinephrine, epinephrine and histamine. In contrast, the adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by 10 microM of 5-hydroxytryptamine plus 10 microM of 8-OH-DPAT was quite equal to that stimulated by 10 microM of 5-hydroxytryptamine alone. Oral administration of lithium for 3 weeks reduced, slightly but significantly, the concentration-response curve to 5-hydroxytryptamine but did not alter that to 8-OH-DPAT. Inhibition of the forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity by 5-hydroxytryptamine or 8-OH-DPAT was shown to be unaltered after lithium treatment. The implications of these results are discussed with reference to previously reported data using hippocampal membranes prepared from rats.",
