     "AB": "The influence of both acute and chronic electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) or antidepressant drug treatments on expression of mRNAs encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its receptors, GFRalpha-1, GFRalpha-2, and c-Ret proto-oncogene (RET) in the rat hippocampus was examined by in situ hybridization. Two hours after acute ECS, levels of GFRalpha-1 mRNA in the dentate gyrus were significantly increased. This increase peaked to nearly 3-fold at 6 h after acute ECS and returned to basal levels 24 h after treatment. Chronic (once daily for 10 days) ECS significantly increased the expression of GFRalpha-1 mRNA nearly 5-fold after the last treatment. Levels of GFRalpha-2 mRNA in the dentate gyrus were also significantly increased by acute and chronic ECS, although this effect was less than that observed for GFRalpha-1. Maximum induction of GFRalpha-2 was 30% and 70% compared to sham in response to acute or chronic ECS, respectively. Levels of GDNF and RET mRNAs were not significantly changed following either acute or chronic ECS treatment at the time points examined. Chronic (14 days) administration of different classes of antidepressant drugs, including tranylcypromine, desipramine, or fluoxetine, did not significantly affect the GDNF, GFRalpha-1, GFRalpha-2, or RET mRNA levels in CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus areas of hippocampus. The results demonstrate that acute ECS increases the expression of GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2 and that these effects are enhanced by chronic ECS. The results also imply that regulation of the binding components of GDNF receptor complex may mediate the adaptive responses of the GDNF system to acute and chronic stimulation.",
