     "AB": "Studies have revealed alterations in mitochondrial complexes in the brains of bipolar patients. However, few studies have examined changes in the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Several preclinical studies have suggested that histone deacetylase inhibitors may have antimanic effects. The present study aims to investigate the effects of lithium, valproate and sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, on the activity of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes in the brains of rats subjected to an animal model of mania induced by ouabain. Wistar rats received a single intracerebroventricular injection of ouabain or cerebrospinal fluid. Starting on the day following the intracerebroventricular injection, the rats were treated for 7days with intraperitoneal injections of saline, lithium, valproate or sodium butyrate. Risk-taking behavior, locomotor and exploratory activities were measured using the open-field test. Citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase were examined in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. All treatments reversed ouabain-related risk-taking behavior and hyperactivity in the open-field test. Ouabain inhibited tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes in the brain, and valproate and sodium butyrate but not lithium reversed this ouabain-induced dysfunction. Thus, protecting the tricarboxylic acid cycle may contribute to the therapeutic effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors.",
