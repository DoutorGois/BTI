     "PG": "147-50",
     "AB": "The increased levels of proenkephalin mRNA in the dentate gyrus following hippocampal stimulation have been assumed to be a consequence of the transient induction of c-fos. Injection of 50 microM NMDA in vivo onto the dendrites of a small number of granule cells causes a pronounced but highly localised elevation in proenkephalin mRNA levels 24 h later, whereas vehicle has no effect. In contrast, there is a widespread induction of c-fos mRNA throughout the dentate gyrus, 45 min after injection of either vehicle or NMDA, suggesting that induction of c-fos expression is unrelated to the subsequent, anatomically discrete, increase in proenkephalin mRNA levels.",
