     "AB": "The metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid, type B (GABA(B)) receptors mediate the slow component of GABAergic transmission in the brain. Functional GABA(B) receptors are heterodimers of the two subunits GABA(B1) and GABA(B2), of which GABA(B1) exists in two main isoforms, GABA(B1a) and GABA(B1b). The significance of the structural heterogeneity of GABA(B) receptors, the mechanism leading to their differential targeting in neurons as well as the regulation of cell surface numbers of GABA(B) receptors, is poorly understood. To gain insights into these processes, we searched for proteins interacting with the C-terminal domain of GABA(B2). Here, we showed that the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) directly interacts with GABA(B) receptors in a subtype-selective manner to regulate cell surface expression of GABA(B1a)/GABA(B2) receptors upon co-expression in HEK 293 cells. The interaction of CHOP with GABA(B1a)/GABA(B2) receptors resulted in their intracellular accumulation and in a reduced number of cell surface receptors. This regulation required the interaction of CHOP via two distinct domains with the heterodimeric receptor; its C-terminal leucine zipper associates with the leucine zipper present in the C-terminal domain of GABA(B2), and its N-terminal domain associates with an as yet unidentified site on GABA(B1a). In conclusion, the data indicated a subtype-selective regulation of cell surface receptors by interaction with the transcription factor CHOP.",
