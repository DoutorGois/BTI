     "AB": "Extracellular field potentials and the EEG were studied in the dentate gyrus of the rat after intrahippocampal injections of colchicine, which is a relatively selective neurotoxin for dentate granule cells. Injection of colchicine (0.5 microliters of a 5-mg/ml solution of colchicine in deionized water) resulted in granule cell hyperexcitability manifested by multispike field potentials in response to stimulation of the excitatory projections from the entorhinal cortex. In anesthetized rats, this state of granule cell hyperexcitability was occasionally accompanied by interictal epileptic spiking or brief electrographic seizures, but granule cell death was observed even in the absence of epileptic activity. Injection of colchicine into the CA1 area of the hippocampus also resulted in multispike field potentials in response to stimulation of the CA3 commissural pathway, but CA1 pyramidal cells were not destroyed by colchicine. Colchicine has been reported to act as a convulsant agent in the dentate gyrus, but it is a relatively selective neurotoxin for dentate granule cells even in the absence of epileptic activity.",
