     "AB": "In vivo microdialysis was used to investigate the regulation of noradrenaline release in rat hippocampus. Idazoxan, an alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist (1-10 mg/kg), increased noradrenaline release in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of noradrenaline uptake by desipramine (0.05-20 microM; via the probe) also increased the extracellular content of the transmitter. In the presence of this increased noradrenaline content (desipramine via the probe), the effect of a low dose of idazoxan (1 mg/kg) was potentiated. Local perfusion of idazoxan (1-500 microM) in the hippocampus also increased noradrenaline release but not to the same extent as following systemic administration. In the presence of desipramine, unlike the systemic injection of idazoxan, local perfusion did not potentiate noradrenaline release. The data are consistent with the regulation of extracellular noradrenaline content in the hippocampus by neuronal uptake and to a lesser extent by presynaptic autoreceptors.",
