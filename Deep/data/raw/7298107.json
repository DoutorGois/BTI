     "AB": "Effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection of [D-Ala2]-methionine-enkephalinamide (DAME) on blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity were studied in conscious cats. DAME was administered at doses between 5 and 100 nmoles. Blood pressure and heart rate increased dose dependently. The sensitivity of the baroreceptor reflex was attenuated for 15 to 60 minutes after DAME administration; this was independent of the BP changes. The effects of enkephalin on BP and baroreceptor reflex were abolished by i.c.v. naloxone. DAME caused pathological changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) characterized by sharp waves in the hippocampus recordings and a loss of theta activity in the electrocorticogram. Behavioral changes were characterized by decreased physical mobility and anxiousness. These behavioral and EEG changes lasted for a longer period of time than the cardiovascular changes; they were also counteracted by naloxone. It is concluded that DAME produces a centrally mediated vasopressor response and a baroreceptor reflex attenuation and that, with respect to the time course, the effects on the baroreceptor reflex are separated from those on BP behavior and EEG, but not on heart rate. The fact that all effects of enkephalin on the parameters tested in the present experiment were completely antagonized by naloxone suggests that they are mediated by naloxone-sensitive enkephalin brain receptors.",
