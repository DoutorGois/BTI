     "AB": "We compared the effects of acupuncture and electroacupuncture on cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation using specific markers, Ki67 and doublecortin (DCX), in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (SZDG) in 13-week old Wistar rats. Acupuncture and electroacupuncture were applied simultaneously in the acu-points, ST36 (Zusanli) and GV20 (Baihui), once a day for 3 weeks. Acupuncture and electroacupuncture at these acu-points significantly increased the number of Ki67-positive cells and DCX-immunoreactive neuroblasts compared to the control or sham acupuncture group. Electroacupuncture treatment significantly increased the number of well-developed (tertiary) dendrites in the SZDG compared to acupuncture treatment. These results suggest that both acupuncture and electroacupuncture increase neurogenesis in the normal, but that electroacupuncture has greater effects on neuroblast plasticity than acupuncture in the dentate gyrus.",
