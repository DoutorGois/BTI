     "AB": "We examined whether an immunosuppressant, FK506, inhibits delayed neuronal death in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 sector after 5-min forebrain ischemia. After reperfusion, gerbils were injected intravenously with FK506. Gerbils in the early injection group were injected with FK506 immediately after reperfusion, and gerbils in the delayed injection group were injected with FK506 1 or 2 h postischemia. The body temperature of the FK506-treated gerbils in the normothermic group was maintained at 37.5-38.0 degrees C for 2 h postischemia. In the chronic survival group, neuroprotection was assessed after recovery for 45 days. Seven or 45 days after reperfusion, neuronal density in the CA1 was assessed following perfusion fixation. FK506 ameliorated cell death in the CA1 in a dose-dependent manner in every group, although it showed a hypothermic effect. FK506 is neuroprotective against forebrain ischemia in gerbils.",
