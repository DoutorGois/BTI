     "AB": "Three learning and memory tasks were used to compare the effects of neurotoxic anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) and perirhinal cortex (PRC) lesions in rats. Rats with ATN lesions showed impaired spatial memory in a 12-arm radial maze, whereas rats with PRC lesions showed intact spatial memory, despite the use of minimal pretraining and extensive within-session delays (to 40 rain). PRC, but not ATN, lesions produced impairments on a configural learning task using complex visual-tactile cues in the radial maze. Neither ATN nor PRC lesions consistently affected spontaneous object recognition across extended sample-test delays (to 40 min). These findings confirm the differential involvement of the ATN and PRC in learning and memory.",
