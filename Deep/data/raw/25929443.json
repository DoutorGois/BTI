     "AB": "Menopause involves dramatic declines in estradiol production and levels. Importantly, estradiol and the class of stress hormones known as glucocorticoids exert countervailing effects throughout the body, with estradiol exerting positive effects on the brain and cognition, glucocorticoids exerting negative effects on the brain and cognition, and estradiol able to mitigate negative effects of glucocorticoids. Although the effects of these hormones in isolation have been extensively studied, the effects of estradiol on the stress response and the neuroprotection offered against glucocorticoid exposure in humans are less well known. Here we review evidence suggesting that estradiol-related protection against glucocorticoids mitigates stress-induced interference with cognitive processes. Animal and human research indicates that estradiol-related mitigation of glucocorticoid damage and interference is one benefit of estradiol supplementation during peri-menopause or soon after menopause. The evidence for estradiol-related protection against glucocorticoids suggests that maintaining estradiol levels in post-menopausal women could protect them from stress-induced declines in neural and cognitive integrity.",
