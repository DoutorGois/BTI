     "AB": "In this data article, the level of chemical neuroprotection against oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD)-related neurodegeneration in CA1 was analyzed using the measurements on CA1 stratum pyramidale (CA1sp) width. Adult rat hippocampal slices were incubated in OGD medium for 60 min to create a model for severe ischemic conditions. Alternatively, control slices were incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) for 60 min. A study of OGD induced neurodegeneration and partial prevention by pharmacological agents reported; baclofen, memantine and l-carnitine effects were included. Also, the use of hypothermia was reported (P. Oz, H. Saybasili, 2016) [1]. Here, the use CA1sp width measurements on Nissl-stained hippocampal slices is introduced as a valid and affordable method for detecting the level of neurodegeneration and neuroprotection on hippocampal slices. The protective effect of hypothermia was found to be more pronounced compared to other agents.",
