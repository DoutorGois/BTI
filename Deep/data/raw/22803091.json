     "AB": "A model of brain ischemia induced by staged ligation of the left and right common carotid arteries has been developed in experiments on rats. The use to this model led to reduction of animal mortality. On days 2-5 after the second ligature, the animals lost weight, the level of their CNS vulnerability increased, the volume of perceived information reduced, adaptation to environmental conditions and reproduction of conditioned reflexes were disordered. Focal and diffuse destructive changes in the nerve and glia cells were found in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamic nuclei. The severity of disorders in the blood supply to the brain depended on the interval between ligation of the carotid arteries. This recommends this model for evaluation of the efficiency of drugs of various pharmacological groups.",
