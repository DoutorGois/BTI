     "AB": "A cDNA encoding the human metabotropic glutamate receptor type 4 (hmGluR4) was isolated from human brain cDNA libraries by cross-hybridization with rat mGluR4 probes. The deduced amino acid sequence of human mGluR4 consists of 912 residues and shows a sequence identity of 96% to the amino acid sequence of rat mGluR4. Northern blot analyses indicate that hmGluR4 is strongly expressed in the cerebellum of the adult human brain but also at low levels in hippocampus, hypothalamus and thalamus. Stimulation of hmGluR4 with L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (L-AP4), L-serine-O-phosphate (L-SOP), L-glutamate or (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclo-pentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid ((1S,3R)-ACPD) in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells depressed forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation, whereas quisqualate (0.5 mM) was ineffective. The rank order of agonist potencies is: L-AP4 > L-SOP > L-glutamate > (1S,3R)-ACPD >> quisqualate. (R,S)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (1 mM), a reported antagonist at some mGluR subtypes, did not reduce the depression of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation by L-AP4.",
