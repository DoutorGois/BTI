     "AB": "The in-vivo binding of [3H]oxiracetam has been studied in brain areas of rats examined 30 min after i.c.v. injection. Soluble radioactivity accounted for more than 90% of total radioactivity in all the structures considered and was not affected by co-injection with a 1000-fold excess of unlabelled oxiracetam. Both total and bound radioactivity showed a marked regional distribution, with highest concentrations in the septum, followed by the hippocampus; the cerebral cortex, striatum and cerebellum had the lower concentrations of radioactivity. Computer-assisted quantitative autoradiography with [14C]oxiracetam confirms these findings. Analysis of [3H]oxiracetam bound to membranes indicated that, after co-injection with a 1000-fold excess of unlabelled oxiracetam, there was a significant reduction of binding only in the septum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex. These results suggest that in those cerebral structures oxiracetam binds to saturable sites.",
