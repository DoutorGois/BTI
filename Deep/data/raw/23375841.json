     "AB": "We have studied the effects of exercise in aged rats (18 months-old) on spatial learning and changes in neuronal metabolic activity associated with exercise program and the spatial learning process. The changes on neuronal oxidative metabolic activity was studied through cytochrome c oxidase histochemistry (COx) in brain regions related to spatial memory, reward, and motor activity after a forced exercise program on Rotarod. The spatial learning task was performed in the 4 arm-radial arm water maze (4-RAWM). Exercise program improved slightly the performance, with more percentage of entries into the correct arm along the days. Respect to COx activity, exercise increased the basal oxidative metabolism in frontal regions, such as motor, cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, and in central and basolateral amygdala. In the spatial memory task, the exercise group showed lower COx activity than the non-exercise group in prefrontal cortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, tegmental ventral area and supramammillary nucleus, but the neuronal activity increased in the motor cortex in exercised group. These results suggest that our exercise program produces a more accurate performance and it increased efficiency, because the exercise group had lower neuronal metabolic needs in the regions implicated in the spatial memory process. Also, the reduction of COx activity in brain regions traditionally related to stress and some behavioral parameters, such as the lower velocity or more time spent in the center of the maze, may indicate a possible reduction of anxiety in the exercise group during the spatial task.",
