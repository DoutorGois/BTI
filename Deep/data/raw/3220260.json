     "AB": "The effects of ageing and of 6 months of Hydergine treatment on lipofuscin deposition within the cytoplasma of pyramidal neurons of rat prefrontal cortex, hippocampus (fields CA1 and CA3) and of Purkinje neurons were assessed microfluorimetrically. No lipofuscin autofluorescence was detected in the nerve cell populations of 3-month-old rats, but lipopigment had accumulated in nerve cell bodies of 16-month-old animals and increased significantly thereafter in rats of 22 months of age. In 22-month-old rats, Hydergine administration (0.6 and 1 mg/kg p.o.) started at 16 months caused a significant dose-related decrease in lipofuscin accumulation within the cytoplasm of the various kinds of nerve cells examined.",
