     "AB": "In the present study, modulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptors by phosphatidylserine (PS) and synaptic plasticity were investigated in the hippocampus of young (4-month-old) and aged (18-month-old) apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice. Qualitative as well as quantitative analysis of brain sections in both young and aged apoE-deficient mice did not reveal any substantial changes of AMPA receptor binding in the various hippocampal regions, compared to age-matched controls. Nevertheless, enhancement of AMPA receptor binding elicited by PS treatment was found to be abolished in most hippocampal regions of young apoE-deficient mice, while modulation of AMPA receptors by this phospholipid was not significantly altered in the hippocampal formation of aged apoE-deficient animals. At the electrophysiological level, long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta burst stimulation was lower in area CA1 of the hippocampus of young, but not aged, apoE-deficient mice compared to age-matched controls. These results confirm that apoE is important for AMPA receptor regulation and LTP expression in the hippocampal formation. However, the presence of LTP in aged apoE-deficient animals, together with apparent recovery of the PS action on AMPA receptors, suggests that aged apoE-knockout mice possess compensatory mechanisms that reduce biochemical and electrophysiological alterations of glutamatergic neurons.",
