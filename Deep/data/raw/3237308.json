     "AB": "We compared the changes in monoamines and their metabolites in the El mouse brain induced by GABA-A and GABA-B receptor agonists. Muscimol was used as a GABA-A receptor agonist, and baclofen as a GABA-B receptor agonist. Muscimol (3 mg/kg) significantly increased the DOPAC level in all parts of the mouse brain and the HVA level in the cortex, striatum, and midbrain. No significant change was observed in the dopamine (DA) level. These findings suggest that muscimol may accelerate both the synthesis and catabolism of DA. Baclofen (20 mg/kg) increased the DA level in the hippocampus and midbrain, and the DOPAC level in the hippocampus. Muscimol increased 5-HIAA levels and decreased 5-HT levels. This result suggests that 5-HT metabolism is accelerated by muscimol. No change in 5-HT or 5-HIAA levels was induced by baclofen. The GABA-A receptor system seems to have a potent effect not only on DA neurons, but on 5-HT neurons. However, the GABA-B receptor system appears to have almost no effect on 5-HT neurons, though it appears to have some effect on DA neurons.",
