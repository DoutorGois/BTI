     "AB": "The need to achieve a clearer understanding of relations between hippocampal theta characteristics and cholinergic septohippocampal neuron activity, prompted us to re-examine, in the urethane-anaesthetised rat, the statistical relationships between the electrophysiological and neurochemical variables using a procedure which is believed to enhance significantly the degree of confidence with which parameters of theta recorded with classic macroelectrodes can be related to concomitant acetylcholine output measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Firstly, the theta rhythm and the acetylcholine content were derived from the same hippocampus. Secondly, the hippocampal electroencephalogram was quantified using spectral analysis which permits the more objective quantitative evaluation of selected electroencephalogram samples. Thirdly, a larger number of rats than in our previous study was used here, thus enhancing the validity of statistical results. This procedure yielded, in our time-course determination, two main findings. The first finding is that acetylcholine release was positively correlated with frequency at the peak power of the theta band which reflects the frequency of the theta signal. This finding had not been reported yet. The second finding is that hippocampal acetylcholine outflow also covaried with relative power of the theta band which reflects the amplitude of the theta signal. This finding is consistent with our previous study in which EEG was quantified by means of a traditional method. These findings suggest that the cholinergic component of the septohippocampal system, which is the main source of hippocampal acetylcholine, and neurophysiological mechanisms involved in the modulation of both the amplitude and the frequency of theta are functionally related. The possibility that, at least in the urethane-anaesthetised rat, hippocampal acetylcholine is involved in these modulator mechanisms is discussed.",
