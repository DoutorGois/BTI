     "AB": "The human brain contains several peptides with probable synaptic actions, some of which form complex neuronal networks in the limbic lobe (amygdala, hippocampus and temporal cortex). A limbic lobe abnormality has been postulated in schizophrenia on the basis of similarities between schizophrenic symptoms and symptoms in cases of known limbic pathology. Cholecystokinin (CCK), somatostatin (SRIF), neurotensin (NT), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and substance P (SP)-like immunoreactivities were measured by radioimmunoassay in 10 brain areas of 14 schizophrenics and 12 controls. In the schizophrenic group symptoms had been rated in life and the group was divided into Type I (n = 7) and Type II (n = 7) subgroups on the basis of the absence or presence of morbid negative symptoms. In control brains each peptide showed a characteristic distribution with high levels in cortex (CCK), limbic lobe (SOM, NT, VIP) or striatal areas (SP) and low levels of each of the peptides in thalamus. Significant (P less than 0.05) differences between groups were: reductions of CCK and SOM in hippocampus and CCK in amygdala in Type II schizophrenics, and CCK in the temporal cortex of the total schizophrenic group; and elevations of VIP in amygdala in Type I schizophrenics and of SP in the hippocampus in the total schizophrenic group. The findings could not be explained by variables such as age, delay between death and necropsy or to neuroleptic medication. These clinical-state related alterations in the peptide content of the limbic system in schizophrenia may illuminate the pathophysiological basis of the disease, particularly the distinction between Type I and II syndromes.",
