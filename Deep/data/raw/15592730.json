     "AB": "The age-related structural changes of the human hippocampus are not entirely understood. The goal of the present investigation was to understand better the nature of age-related hippocampal changes by a comparative MR-analysis of four complementary aspects of hippocampal integrity: total volume, metabolite concentration, neuron to glial cell ratio and amount of extracellular diffusion space for water. To that end, we applied MR-based methods of manual and computerized (voxel-based morphometry) volumetry, diffusion-weighted imaging and 1H MR spectroscopy to characterize specific age-related hippocampal effects in a group of 22 healthy old adults in comparison with a group of 13 healthy younger adults. Age-related reductions of the hippocampal N-acetyl aspartate to creatine/choline ratio together with only marginal age-related reductions in hippocampal volumes and increases in diffusion parameters suggest that the process of aging affects mainly the metabolic status of the hippocampus with little equivalent age-related changes in hippocampal cell density. The metabolic changes are unspecific as they are not restricted to the hippocampus but equally occur in measures obtained from extrahippocampal temporal lobe regions.",
