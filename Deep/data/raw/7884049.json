     "AB": "The mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors are the three main types of opioid receptors found in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery. These receptors and the peptides with which they interact are important in a number of physiological functions, including analgesia, respiration, and hormonal regulation. This study examines the expression of mu, delta, and kappa receptor mRNAs in the rat brain and spinal cord using in situ hybridization techniques. Tissue sections were hybridized with 35S-labeled cRNA probes to the rat mu (744-1,064 b), delta (304-1,287 b), and kappa (1,351-2,124 b) receptors. Each mRNA demonstrates a distinct anatomical distribution that corresponds well to known receptor binding distributions. Cells expressing mu receptor mRNA are localized in such regions as the olfactory bulb, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, lateral and medial septum, diagonal band of Broca, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, most thalamic nuclei, hippocampus, amygdala, medial preoptic area, superior and inferior colliculi, central gray, dorsal and median raphe, raphe magnus, locus coeruleus, parabrachial nucleus, pontine and medullary reticular nuclei, nucleus ambiguus, nucleus of the solitary tract, nucleus gracilis and cuneatus, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia. Cellular localization of delta receptor mRNA varied from mu or kappa, with expression in such regions as the olfactory bulb, allo- and neocortex, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, ventromedial hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, red nucleus, pontine nuclei, reticulotegmental nucleus, motor and spinal trigeminal, linear nucleus of the medulla, lateral reticular nucleus, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia. Cells expressing kappa receptor mRNA demonstrate a third pattern of expression, with cells localized in regions such as the claustrum, endopiriform nucleus, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, most hypothalamic nuclei, median eminence, infundibulum, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, raphe nuclei, paratrigeminal and spinal trigeminal, nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia. These findings are discussed in relation to the physiological functions associated with the opioid receptors.",
