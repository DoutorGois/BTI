We report, for the first time, stimulation and extracellular recording of spontaneous and evoked neuroelectrical activity in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures with ultramicroelectrode VACNF arrays. Because the electrodes are carbon-based, these arrays have potential advantages over metal electrodes and could enable a variety of future applications as precise, informative, and biocompatible neural interfaces.",
