     "AB": "Structural hippocampus and prefrontal cortex changes occur in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that appears correlated with cognitive dysfunction. In these brain regions, serotonin (5HT) plays a prominent role in symptom presentation and treatment of PTSD. However, 5HT is both anxiogenic and anxiolytic, and while 5HT reuptake inhibitors are effective in treatment, the role of 5HT in the development of PTSD remains uncertain. Using a model of repeated trauma in rats, we observed significant spatial memory impairment together with significantly increased 5HT(1A) receptor density (B(max)), decreased 5HT(1A) receptor affinity (K(d)), and significantly increased 5HT(2A) receptor affinity on day 7 poststress. The serotonergic agent fluoxetine (FLX; 10 mg/kg/d ip) administered 1 week before stress and continuing throughout the stress procedure, but not the 5HT depleter p-chloro-phenylalanine (PCPA; 300/100/50 mg/kg/d ip), prevented stress-induced cognitive dysfunction. PCPA, however, reversed stress-induced hippocampal 5HT(1A) receptor affinity changes, with FLX narrowly missing significance. Neither drug reversed stress effects on 5HT(2A) receptor affinity. Thus, 5HT plays an important part in the cognitive-behavioral changes evoked by repeated trauma. That raised 5HT activity may mediate hippocampal 5HT(1A) receptor changes evoked by stress suggests a bidirectional role for 5HT in the development of PTSD.",
