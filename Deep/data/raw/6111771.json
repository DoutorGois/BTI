     "AB": "Neurohumoral activation of adenylate cyclase was evaluated in microvessel fractions isolated from different regions of the rabbit brain. The greatest degree of enzyme by norepinephrine, dopamine and histamine was observed in microvessels from the brain stem, hippocampus and hypothalamus. The least degree of enzyme stimulation occurred in the thalamic preparation while the cerebellar microvessels were sensitive to norepinephrine alone.",
