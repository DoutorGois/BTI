     "AB": "Several lines of evidence support a role for nerve growth factor (NGF) in the sympathetic sprouting response that occurs following septal cholinergic denervation of the rat hippocampal formation. The present study was undertaken to compare the distribution of NGF-like immunoreactivity and the topography of sympathetic sprouting in rats receiving medial septal lesions. Comparisons were made using adjacent sections of the hippocampal formation stained either for NGF-like immunoreactivity or for NGF receptor-immunoreactivity (p75, to visualize sympathetic fibers). p75-immunoreactive sympathetic axons were localized within the same regions exhibiting NGF-like staining, i.e., the hilus of the dentate gyrus and stratum lucidum in the CA3 area. Furthermore, the sympathetic fibers that invaded the hippocampal formation exhibited NGF-like immunostaining. These results provide additional evidence in support of NGF's role in this collateral sprouting response in the mature rat CNS.",
