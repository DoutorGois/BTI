     "AB": "Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) regulates numerous neuronal processes, including metabolism, antioxidation and aging, through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1alpha), an upstream regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function. However, the role of SIRT1 in the oxidative stress induced by seizures has yet to be elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate whether SIRT1 was involved in the activation of the PGC-1alpha/mitochondrial antioxidant system following status epilepticus (SE) in rats. The data demonstrated that SIRT1 expression and activity were enhanced in the rat hippocampus following SE. SIRT1 inhibition effectively blocked the SE-associated increase in PGC-1alpha and mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). Additionally, it was also demonstrated that the activation of SIRT1 enhanced mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I activity and increased ATP content. In conclusion, the present results suggest that SIRT1 activation may alleviate mitochondrial oxidative stress induced by seizures partially via PGC-1alpha signaling.",
