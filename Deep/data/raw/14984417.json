     "AB": "We used the cDNA microarray technique to monitor simultaneously possible changes induced by hypergravity in the expression level of thousands of hippocampal genes. We tested the mRNA level of about 5000 genes in the hippocampus of mice subjected to 1.09 g (1g) or to 1.85 g (2g) for five repeated 1-h daily rotations in a centrifuge (g = 9.81 m/s2). Data were compared with those obtained for mice kept stationary (C). The ratios 1g/C and 2g/C identified genes affected by rotation and rotation + hypergravity, respectively, whereas 2g/1g ratio identified those affected by hypergravity. We found that about 200 genes were affected by rotation and/or rotation + hypergravity. Almost all the genes affected by rotation + hypergravity were up-regulated, only five being down-regulated. The modulated genes code for proteins involved in a wide range of cellular functions (DNA/RNA metabolism, protein processing, intermediate metabolism, cytoskeleton and motility, cell cycle and apoptosis, signal transduction, neuronal structure/function), suggesting that rotation + hypergravity may affect several aspects of the hippocampal function in order to compensate for environmental changes. Six genes directly or indirectly involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity (proSAAS, neuroblastoma ras oncogene, ESTs moderately similar to thymosin beta-10, syndet, inhibin beta E and Ngfi-A binding protein 2) were found to be significantly modulated by hypergravity and unaffected or only slightly affected by rotation. The modulation by hypergravity of these genes suggests that this stimulus might induce plastic remodelling of the hippocampal circuits, possibly both at structural and functional level.",
