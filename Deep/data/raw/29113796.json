     "AB": "Diabetes-induced oxidative damage is believed to play an important role in the development of cognitive dysfunction. In this study, the involvement of the Nox4-Nrf2 redox imbalance was investigated. STZ-induced diabetic rats exhibited obvious oxidative stress and apoptosis in the hippocampus assessed by augmentation of lipid peroxidation, positive TUNEL staining, elevated ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and increased caspase 3 activity. Furthermore, hyperglycemia markedly increased Nox4 activity and reduced the activation of Nrf2 by suppressing its up-stream regulatory Akt as well as down-stream target HO-1. Significant improvement of cognitive performance was observed after treatment with the BET/BRD inhibitor JQ1, accompanied by decreased oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and apoptosis in the hippocampus. JQ1 treatment also improved changes in the neuronal cell morphology as well as increased the expression of p-AKT, Nrf2 and HO-1. Our results provide evidence indicating that JQ1 treatment could modulate Nox4-Nrf2 redox imbalance in the hippocampus and may be a promising agent for diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction.",
