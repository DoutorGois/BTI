     "AB": "Despite the apparent homology in the protein kinase C (PKC) family, it has become clear that slight structural differences are sufficient to have unique signalling properties for each individual isoform. For PKCepsilon in depth investigation of these aspects revealed unique actions in the CNS and lead to development of specific modulators with clinical perspective. In this review, we describe to which extent PKCepsilon is distinct from other isoforms on the level of tissue expression and protein structure. As this kinase is highly expressed in the brain, we outline three main aspects of PKCepsilon signalling in the CNS. First, its ability to alter the permeability of N-type Ca2+ channels in dorsal root ganglia has been shown to enhance nociception. Secondly, PKCepsilon increases anxiety by diminishing GABA(A)R-induced inhibitory post-synaptic currents in the prefrontal cortex. Another important aspect of the latter inhibition is the reduced sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to ethanol, a mechanism potentially contributing to abuse. A third signalling cascade improves cognitive functions by facilitating cholinergic signalling in the hippocampus. Collectively, these findings point to a physical and behavioural sensitising role for this kinase.",
