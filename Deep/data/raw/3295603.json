     "AB": "MK-801 is a novel, potent and selective non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of excitatory amino acid receptors. Pretreatment of rats with MK-801 (1-10 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus and striatum caused by direct intracranial injections of NMDA (20-120 nmol), but did not protect against the loss of neurones induced by kainate (2.5 nmol) injected into the striatum. Thus, MK-801 is a selective antagonist of neuronal degeneration caused by excessive stimulation of NMDA receptors in vivo.",
