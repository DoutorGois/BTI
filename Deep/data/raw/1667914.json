     "AB": "The role of the glycine site associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) was investigated in the dentate gyrus of anesthetized rats. Administration of a glycine site antagonist, 7-chlorokynurenate (50 mmol i.c.v.), significantly blocked the induction of LTP without affecting baseline responses. LTP was induced normally when 7-chlorokynurenate and D-serine (100 nmol i.c.v.) were administered together. These results suggest clearly that endogenous glycine participates in the induction of LTP in vivo.",
