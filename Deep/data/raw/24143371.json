     "AB": "Blood immunological parameters (cytokine profile and interferon status) and the level of monoamines and their metabolites in various brain structures (amygdala, hippocampus, septum, and hypothalamus) were studied in rats kept under standard conditions or in overpopulated cages. Long-term overcrowding was associated with reduced expression of IL-4 gene, increased transcription of IL-17, and decreased production of IFN-gamma, which attested to impaired humoral and cell-mediated immunity and disturbances in IFN-gamma synthesis at the post-transcriptional level. Under these conditions, the levels of norepinephrine and dopamine decreased in the septum, but increased in the hypothalamus. The amount of dopamine metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid decreased in both these structures, and the index of dopamine metabolism (dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/dopamine ratio, DOPAC/dopamine) decreased only in the hypothalamus. Overcrowding was not followed by changes in the parameters of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in the amygdala and hippocampus and serotoninergic system in all study structures.",
