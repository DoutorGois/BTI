Several transcription factors are expressed in hippocampal neurons where they respond to environmental stimuli. In this study 12 adult male rats (n = 6 in each group) were exposed to enriched or isolated environment for 30 days. The expression of AP-2 mRNA, studied by in situ hybridization, was attenuated by environmental enrichment in the CA2 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. AP-2 may be involved in the environmental effect of glucocorticoid receptor gene expression in these neurons.",
