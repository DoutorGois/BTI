     "AB": "In the present work we investigated the effect of ovariectomy on Na+, K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in rat hippocampus. We also studied some parameters of oxidative stress, namely total radical-trapping antioxidant potential (TRAP), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS), as well as the antioxidant enzyme activities superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities. Our hypothesis is that ovariectomy might cause alterations in essential enzyme activities necessary to brain normal functioning and that these chances could be caused by oxidative stress. Female adult Wistar rats were divided into three groups: (1) naive (control); (2) sham-operated; and (3) ovariectomized. Thirty days after ovariectomy rats were sacrificed. Results showed that rats subjected to ovariectomy presented a significant increase in Na+, K+-ATPase, AChE and CAT activities, but did not change the oxidative stress parameters studied when compared to sham or naive rats. Since ovariectomy mimics postmenopausal changes, our findings showing alteration in the activities of brain Na+, K+-ATPase, AChE and CAT may be related to problems in postmenopausal women.",
