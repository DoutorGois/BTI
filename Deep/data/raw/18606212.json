     "AB": "Inactivation of the genes encoding the neuronal, synaptic vesicle-associated proteins synapsin I and II leads to severe reductions in the number of synaptic vesicles in the CNS. We here define the postnatal developmental period during which the synapsin I and/or II proteins modulate synaptic vesicle number and function in excitatory glutamatergic synapses in mouse brain. In wild-type mice, brain levels of both synapsin I and synapsin IIb showed developmental increases during synaptogenesis from postnatal days 5-20, while synapsin IIa showed a protracted increase during postnatal days 20-30. The vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT) 1 and VGLUT2 showed synapsin-independent development during postnatal days 5-10, following which significant reductions were seen when synapsin-deficient brains were compared with wild-type brains following postnatal day 20. A similar, synapsin-dependent developmental profile of vesicular glutamate uptake occurred during the same age periods. Physiological analysis of the development of excitatory glutamatergic synapses, performed in the CA1 stratum radiatum of the hippocampus from the two genotypes, showed that both the synapsin-dependent part of the frequency facilitation and the synapsin-dependent delayed response enhancement were restricted to the period after postnatal day 10. Our data demonstrate that while both synaptic vesicle number and presynaptic short-term plasticity are essentially independent of synapsin I and II prior to postnatal day 10, maturation and function of excitatory synapses appear to be strongly dependent on synapsin I and II from postnatal day 20.",
