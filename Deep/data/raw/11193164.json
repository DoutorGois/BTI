     "AB": "In AD certain brain structures contain a pathological density of A beta protein deposited into plaques. The effect of genetic mutations found in early onset AD patients was an overproduction of A beta 42, strongly suggesting that overproduction of A beta 42 is associated with AD. We hypothesized that an immunological response to A beta 42 might alter its turnover and metabolism. Young PDAPP transgenic mice were immunized with A beta 1-42, which essentially prevented amyloid deposition; astrocytosis was dramatically reduced and there was reduction in A beta-induced inflammatory response as well. A beta 1-42 immunization also appeared to arrest the progression of amyloidosis in older PDAPP mice. A beta immunization appears to increase clearance of amyloid plaques, and may therefore be a novel and effective approach for the treatment of AD.",
