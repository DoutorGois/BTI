     "AB": "Heptylene-linked bis-(9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine) (bis(7)-tacrine) is a potential palliative therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease (AD), on the basis of its superior acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition and memory-enhancing potency relative to tacrine. In this study we report that bis(7)-tacrine exhibits a potentially complementary central nervous system action, antagonism of GABA(A) receptor function. Bis(7)-tacrine displaced [3H]muscimol from rat brain membranes with an apparent Ki of 6.0 microM; tacrine and physostigmine were shown to be 18 and 170 times less potent, respectively. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, bis(7)-tacrine inhibited GABA-induced inward current with an IC50 of 5.6 microM, and shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the right in a parallel manner. These results suggest that bis(7)-tacrine is a competitive antagonist of the GABA(A) receptor.",
