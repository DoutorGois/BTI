     "AB": "A series of 5-(3-alkyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidines+ ++ (7a-h) was synthesized for biological evaluation as selective agonists for M1 receptors coupled to phosphoinositide (PI) metabolism in the central nervous system. Each ligand bound with high affinity to muscarinic receptors from rat brain as measured by inhibition of [3H]-(R)-quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]-(R)-QNB) binding. 5-(3-Methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine+ ++ trifluoroacetate (CDD-0098-J;7a) displayed high affinity (IC50 = 2.7 +/- 0.69 microM) and efficacy at muscarinic receptors coupled to PI metabolism in the rat cortex and hippocampus. Increasing the length of the alkyl substituent increased affinity for muscarinic receptors yet decreased activity in PI turnover assays. The hippocampal PI response of 7a was blocked by lower concentrations of pirenzepine (8) or by higher concentrations of either AF-DX 116 (9) or p-fluorohexahydrosiladifenidol (10), suggesting that at low concentrations 7a selectively stimulates PI turnover through M1 receptors.",
