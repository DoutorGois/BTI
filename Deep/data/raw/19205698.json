     "AB": "PURPOSE: [(11)C]Flumazenil shows promise as a clinical and research PET radiotracer to image changes in GABA(A) central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZR), but its widespread use has been limited by practical limitations of [(11)C]. This study evaluated the imaging characteristics of two fluorinated PET radiotracers in rats in vivo: [(18)F]fluoroflumazenil ([(18)F]FFMZ) and [(18)F]flumazenil ([(18)F]FMZ). METHODS: PET acquisitions were performed on a small-animal scanner following injection of [(18)F]FFMZ in nine rats and [(18)F]FMZ in eight rats. The following treatments were investigated: (1) injection of the tracer dose, (2) presaturation then injection of the tracer dose, and (3) injection of the tracer dose followed by a displacement injection. Unchanged tracer was measured in plasma and brain structures in four animals 10 and 30 min after injection, and ex-vivo autoradiography was also performed. RESULTS: For both [(18)F]FFMZ and [(18)F]FMZ maximal brain activity peaked rapidly, and was highest in the hippocampus (1.12+/-0.06 SUV, 1.24+/-0.10 SUV, respectively), and lowest in the pons (1.00+/-0.07 SUV, 1.03+/-0.09 SUV, respectively). By 50 min after injection, maximal uptake for [(18)F]FFMZ and [(18)F]FMZ had decreased in the hippocampus to 18+/-3% and 80+/-1% (p<0.01), respectively. The presaturation and displacement studies showed a higher nonspecific component for [(18)F]FFMZ than for [(18)F]FMZ. Metabolite studies showed that at 30 min only 10% of the signal was from [(18)F]FFMZ in the brain. This nonspecific binding was apparent on autoradiography. In contrast, [(18)F]FMZ accounted for >70% of the signal in the brain, which resulted in well-defined regional binding on autoradiography. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that [(18)F]FMZ is a superior radiotracer to [(18)F]FFMZ for in-vivo PET imaging of the GABA(A)/cBZR, having slower metabolism and leading to lower concentrations of metabolites in the brain that results in a substantially better signal-to-noise ratio.",
