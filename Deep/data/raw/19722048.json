     "AB": "The kindling phenomenon is classically investigated in epileptology research. The present study aims to provide further information about hippocampal kindling through computational processing data. Adult Wistar rats were implanted with dorsal hippocampal and frontal neocortical electrodes to perform the experiment. The processing data was obtained using the Spike2 and Matlab softwares. An inverse relationship between the number of 'wet dog shakes' and the Racine's motor stages development was found. Moreover it was observed a significant increase in the afterdischarge (AD) duration and its frequency content. The highest frequencies were, however, only reached at the beginning of behavioral seizures. During the primary AD, fast transients (ripples) were registered in both hippocampi superimposed to slower waves. This experiment highlights the usefulness of computational processing applied to animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy and supports a relevant role of the high frequency discharges in temporal epileptogenesis.",
