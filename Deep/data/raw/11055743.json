     "AB": "Metabotropic glutamate receptors have recently been envisaged as involved in both potentiation and prevention of ischemic and excitotoxic neuronal damage. The release of the inhibitory amino acid taurine is markedly enhanced in ischemia in both the immature and mature mouse hippocampus. The modulation of [3H]taurine release by metabotropic receptor agonists and antagonists was studied in hippocampal slices from developing (7-day-old) and adult (3-month-old) mice using a superfusion system. Agonists of group I, II and III metabotropic glutamate receptors generally reduced the ischemia-induced release in adult animals. In the immature hippocampus the group I agonists (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine and (1+/-)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylate, which mainly enhance neuronal excitation, potentiated initial taurine release in ischemia. Ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists also enhance the ischemia-induced taurine release in developing mice. This glutamate-activated taurine release may thus constitute an important protective mechanism against excitotoxicity in the immature hippocampus.",
