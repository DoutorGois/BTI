     "AB": "It has been shown that a decrease in HMGs transcription factors phosphorylation by protein kinase CK2 may be the cause of a gene expression decline in cognitive disorders. Passive avoidance amnesia in old rats (24 month) was accompanied by a decrease in synaptosomal protein synthesis and transcription in isolated nuclei of cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. A decrease in chromatin protein kinase CK2 activity and a significant decrease in HMG14 phosphorylation by CK2 was found in old rats. CK2 selective activators, a 4-carbamoyl-5-N-methylcarbamoyl-1-ethyl-imidazole and 4,5-dicaramoyl-1-ethyl-imidazole, produced the HMG14 phosphorylation and transcription activation in old rats. At the same time, synaptosomal protein synthesis activation and passive avoidance amnesia reduction were observed in old rats. Thus, activation of CK2-HMG14 was accompanied by synaptic plasticity optimisation. The data show a high therapeutic potential of activators of CK2-HMG14.",
