     "AB": "Mouse brain proteins were isolated from five regions (cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cervical spinal cord) at five ages from the 10th week to the 24th month, and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). 2-DE was carried out with an immobilized pH gradient bar in the first dimension, and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second dimension. Over one thousand protein spots were visualized by silver staining and quantified by image processing. In the analyses, 58 protein spots were distinguishable among the above five brain regions, and 17 proteins were shown to be varied in quantity in the course of aging. Partial amino-terminal sequences and/or internal sequences for a total of 301 protein spots were analyzed. One hundred and eighty proteins appeared to have blocked N-termini and 122 proteins were identified. Twenty-seven new proteins were identified by sequence homology search. A mouse brain proteome database was constructed, which consists of the 2-DE map images and the respective spot data files with 15 related references.",
