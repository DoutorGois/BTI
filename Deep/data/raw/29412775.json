     "AB": "The ketogenic diet (KD), a high-fat, carbohydrate-restricted diet, is used as an alternative treatment for drug-resistant epileptic patients. Evidence suggests that compromised glucose metabolism has a significant role in the anticonvulsant action of the KD, however, it is unclear what part of the glucose metabolism that is important. The present study investigates how selective alterations in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation influence epileptiform activity induced by blocking K(+) currents, GABAA and NMDA receptors in the hippocampal slice preparation. Blocking glycolysis with the glucose-derivative 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG, 10 mM) gave a fast reduction of the frequency of interictal discharge (IED) consistent with findings in other in vitro models. However, this was followed by the induction of seizure-like discharges (SLE) in area CA1 and CA3. Substituting glucose with sucrose (glucopenia) had similar effects as 2-DG, whereas substitution with L-lactate or pyruvate reduced the IED but had less proconvulsant effect. Blockade of KATP channels, glycine or adenosine 1 receptors, or depletion of the endogenous anticonvulsant compound, glutathione, did not prevent the actions of 2-DG. Baclofen (2 muM) reproduced the effect of 2-DG on IED activity. The proconvulsant effect of 2-DG could be reproduced by blocking the oxidative phosphorylation with the complex I toxin rotenone (4 muM). The data suggest that inhibition of IED, induced by 2-DG and glucopenia, is a direct consequence of impairment of glycolysis, and likely exerted via a decreased recurrent excitatory synaptic transmission in area CA3. The accompanying proconvulsant effect is caused by an excitatory mechanism, depending on impairment of oxidative phosphorylation.",
