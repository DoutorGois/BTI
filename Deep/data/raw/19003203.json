     "AB": "Recent findings concerning adult neurogenesis in two selected structures of the mammalian brain, the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, present the possibility that this mechanism of neurogenesis applies for all brain regions, including the cerebral neocortex. In this way, a small number of potential neural precursor cells may exist in the cerebral neocortex, but they do not normally differentiate into cortical neurons in vivo. It has, however, been reported recently that cycling cells isolated from non-neurogenic areas of adult rat cerebral cortex could generate neurons in vitro. In this study, we analyzed the lineage potential of cycling cells from the adult mouse neocortex. For the dissection of the cerebral cortex from the adult mouse, which is significantly smaller than that of the adult rat, we have modified the previous dissection protocol developed for the rat neocortex. As a result, cycling cells from adult mouse neocortex gave rise to neurons and oligodendrocytes, but not to astrocytes, whereas when the previous dissection method was used, cycling cells gave rise to neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. This discrepancy might stem from slight contamination of the dissected mouse neocortical tissue in the previous protocol used for the dissection of rat neocortex by cells from the surrounding subependymal zone, where typical adult neural stem cells exist. The results presented here will contribute to our understanding of the nature of cycling cells in the adult mammalian neocortex, and for which future stem cell research will provide new possibilities for cell replacement therapy to be used in the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions.",
