     "AB": "5-Hydroxytrytamine (serotonin) type 3A receptors (5-HT3ARs), as the only ligand-gated ion channels in the serotonin receptor family, are known to regulate neuronal excitation and release of GABA in hippocampal interneurons. However, their physiological role in glutamatergic synaptic plasticity remains unclear. Here, we show that deletion of the 5-HT3AR gene in transgenic mice abolished N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term depression (LTD) induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) in hippocampal CA1 synapses in slices, whereas the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent LTD did not change in the 5-HT3AR knockout mice. In addition, 5-HT3ARs disruption inhibited alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) internalization, without altering basal surface levels of AMPARs. However, the deletion of 5-HT3ARs did not lead to loss of synapses and structural alteration of dendritic spines. Furthermore, the concentrations of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the hippocampus were not affected by the deletion of 5-HT3ARs. These observations revealed an important role of 5-HT3ARs in NMDAR-dependent long-term depression, which is critical for learning behaviors.",
