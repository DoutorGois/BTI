     "AB": "Pups of Wistar and KM rats (with predisposition to audiogenic epilepsy) were daily injected with neuropeptide semax (50 mg/kg) or NO-synthase inhibitor L-NAME (50 mg/kg) on days 7-11 of life. Alterations of audiogenic seizures pattern were revealed in rats of both strains at the age of 1 month, while changes in seizure severity were genotype-dependent. Both agents enhance neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the delayed effect in the form of altered seizure pattern seems to be determined by this factor. Genotype-dependent alterations of seizure severity after administration of semax and L-NAME were differently directed. These effects are suggested to be underlined by physiological and biochemical mechanisms not related to the intensity of postnatal neurogenesis.",
