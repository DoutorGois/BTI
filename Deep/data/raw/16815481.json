     "AB": "AMPAR trafficking is crucial for the expression of certain forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, using surface biotinylation of hippocampal slices and subsequent synaptosome isolation we assessed AMPAR surface expression in synaptosomes following NMDA-evoked long-term depression (NMDA-LTD). Surface levels of GluR1, GluR2 and GluR3 in synaptosomes were markedly reduced 90 min after NMDA-LTD induction. Consistent with endocytosis and degradation, whole-cell surface and total expression levels of GluR2 and GluR3 were also reduced. In contrast, whole-cell surface levels of GluR1 were unaltered at 90 min suggesting that AMPARs with different subunit composition are redistributed to different non-synaptic compartments following LTD induction in acute hippocampal slices.",
