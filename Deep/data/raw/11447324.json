     "AB": "The sequence of events involved in the neurodegeneration caused by transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) is not yet known. Using a murine scrapie model in which neurodegeneration in the hippocampus is restricted to CA2, we show that pyramidal neuron damage and death by an apoptotic mechanism occur early in the incubation period, prior to the appearance of CA2 disease-specific accumulation of PrP and the onset of clinical disease. We suggest that the initial hippocampal pathological event in this model is dendritic dysfunction and activation of an apoptotic pathway rather than PrP accumulation.",
