     "AB": "The objective of this study was to examine the changes in the activity and expression of ectonucleotidase enzymes in the model of unilateral cortical stab injury (CSI) in rat. The activities of ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (NTPDase 1) and ecto 5'-nucleotidase were assessed by measuring the levels of ATP, ADP and AMP hydrolysis in the crude membrane preparations obtained from injured left cortex, right cortex, left and right caudate nucleus, whole hippocampus and cerebellum. Significant increase in NTPDase and ecto 5'-nucleotidase activities was observed in the injured cortex following CSI, whereas in other brain areas only an increase in ecto 5'-nucleotidase activity was seen. Immunohistochemical analysis performed using antibodies specific to NTPDase 1 and ecto 5'-nucleotidase demonstrated that CSI induced significant changes in enzyme expression around the injury site. Immunoreactivity patterns obtained for NTPDase 1 and ecto 5'-nucleotidase were compared with those obtained for glial fibrillary acidic protein, as a marker of astrocytes and complement receptor type 3 (OX42), as a marker of microglia. Results suggest that up-regulation of ectonucleotidase after CSI is catalyzed by cells that activate in response to injury, i.e. cells immunopositive for NTPDase 1 were predominantly microglial cells, whereas cells immunopositive for ecto 5'-nucleotidase were predominantly astrocytes.",
