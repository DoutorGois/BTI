     "AB": "One of the most widely utilized in vitro models of ischemia or oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) is the hippocampal organotypical culture (HOTC). The HOTC is used not only for the study of the mechanisms of cell death, but also has been the cornerstone of synaptic physiology. Although the intact nature of the HOTC is one of its primary advantages, some studies require a dissociated preparation in order to distinguish cell type specific responses. Typically, primary dissociated neuronal cultures are prepared from embryonic tissue. Since the HOTC is prepared from postnatal pups, we wanted to establish a primary culture of hippocampus from postnatal pups to parallel our studies in the HOTC preparation. Mixed cultures were prepared by enzymatic dissociation of hippocampus from 7-day-old mouse pups. These cultures responded to OGD with a time course of delayed cell death that was similar to that reported in HOTC. Dual label immunocytochemical staining revealed that neurons, but not astrocytes, were dying from apoptosis following OGD. To examine this vulnerability further, we also prepared neuronal enriched cultures by treating mixed cultures with cytosine-beta-d-arabinofuranoside (CBA). These neuronal cultures appear to be even more sensitive to OGD. In addition, we have established primary astrocyte-enriched cultures from the same age pups to examine the vulnerability of astrocytes to OGD. These three culture preparations are useful for comparison of the responses of the two major cell types in the same culture, and the enriched cultures will allow biochemical, electrophysiological and molecular studies of homogenous cell populations.",
