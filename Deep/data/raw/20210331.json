     "AB": "In order to offer an easier way to study interactions between multiple cellular populations, we have developed a novel method to precisely place cells in a variety of nonoverlapping patterns using surface tension in laterally open microchannels. Our design is fundamentally different from previous strategies such as compartmentalization, stamping, stenciling, or mechanical approaches. It relies on capillary action or the propensity for liquid to move more readily through narrow spaces as a result of surface tension. Until now, capillary based patterning has been limited to coating chemically isolated areas. Here, we demonstrate, through use of surface tension and controlled flooding, that it is possible to pattern multiple cells and proteins using laterally open channels in a variety of designs. We demonstrate the relevance of the concept by coculturing different mammalian cell types and evaluating the behavior of engineered quorum sensing circuits in E. coli. In the future, we believe the laterally open channel designs shown here can be useful for rapidly creating and studying cellular ecologies using simple pipetting.",
