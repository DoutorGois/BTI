     "AB": "Previously, we showed that NMDA antagonists enhance high-frequency oscillations (130-180 Hz) in the nucleus accumbens. However, whether NMDA antagonists can enhance high-frequency oscillations in other brain regions remains unclear. Here, we used monopolar, bipolar and inverse current source density techniques to examine oscillatory activity in the hippocampus, a region known to generate spontaneous ripples ( approximately 200 Hz), its surrounding tissue, and the dorsal striatum, neuroanatomically related to the nucleus accumbens. In monopolar recordings, ketamine-induced increases in the power of high-frequency oscillations were detected in all structures, although the power was always substantially larger in the nucleus accumbens. In bipolar recordings, considered to remove common-mode input, high-frequency oscillations associated with ketamine injection were not present in the regions we investigated outside the nucleus accumbens. In line with this, inverse current source density showed the greatest changes in current to occur in the vicinity of the nucleus accumbens and a monopolar structure of the generator. We found little spatial localisation of ketamine high-frequency oscillations in other areas. In contrast, sharp-wave ripples, which were well localized to the hippocampus, occurred less frequently after ketamine. Notably, we also found ketamine produced small, but significant, changes in the power of 30-90 Hz gamma oscillations (an increase in the hippocampus and a decrease in the nucleus accumbens).",
