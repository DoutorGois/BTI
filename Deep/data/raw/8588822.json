     "AB": "The effect of incubation with the protein kinase C activator, 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (beta-PDBu) on the electrophysiological responses to hypoxia and combined hypoxia and hypoglycemia was investigated in the rat hippocampal slice. Preincubation with beta-PDBu prevents adenosine-mediated inhibition of synaptic transmission under normoxic, normoglycemic conditions. beta-PDBu preincubation also reduces the adenosine-mediated hypoxia-induced depression of synaptic transmission revealing a substantial adenosine-independent hypoxia-induced depression of synaptic transmission. During combined hypoxia and hypoglycemia, slices preincubated in beta-PDBu display a significant shortening of the time of anoxic depolarization, an effect of beta-PDBu that is not mimicked by application of the adenosine antagonist cyclopentyltheophylline (8-CPT). It is concluded that the state of PKC activation may influence the electrophysiological responses to hypoxia and ischemia.",
