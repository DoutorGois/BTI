     "AB": "The effect of chronic nicotine treatment on the release of endogenous glutamate (GLU), aspartate (ASP) and GABA evoked in vitro by KCl, 4-aminopyridine (4AP) and nicotinic agonists in synaptosomes of rat hippocampus was investigated. Rats were chronically administered with nicotine bitartrate or saline vehicle each for 14 days using osmotic mini-pumps. Hippocampal synaptosomes were stimulated with KCl, 4AP, nicotine or with choline (Ch) and 5-iodo-A-85380 dihydrochloride (5IA85380). The GLU and ASP overflow evoked by Ch, nicotine, KCl and 4AP were increased in treated animals while the nicotine-evoked GABA overflow was reduced and that evoked by Ch, KCl and 4AP was unaffected. The 5IA85380-evoked overflow of the three aminoacids (AAs) was always reduced. The increase of ASP and GLU overflow evoked by KCl, 4AP or Ch was blocked by dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid (dl-TBOA), a carrier transporter inhibitor, and by inhibitors of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers 2-[[4-[(4-nitrophenyl)methoxy]phenyl]methyl]-4-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid ethyl ester (SN-6) and 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea mesylate (KB-R7943). In conclusion long-term nicotine treatment may selectively increase GLU and ASP overflow elicited by KCl, 4AP and Ch through the activation of a carrier-mediated release mechanism and completely abolished the stimulatory effects of alpha4beta2 nAChRs which modulate the release of all the three AA.",
