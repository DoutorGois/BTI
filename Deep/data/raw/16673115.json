     "AB": "An ultrastructural study was performed to investigate the type of cellular death that occurs in hippocampal CA1 field pyramidal neurons after 10 and 20 min of transient cerebral ischemia in the male adult Wistar rats, followed by 2, 4 and 10 days of reperfusion. The four-vessel occlusion method was used to induce ischemic insult for either 10 or 20 min, following which the animals were submitted to either 2, 4 or 10 days of reperfusion. The animals were then anaesthetised, and their brains removed, dehydrated, embedded, sectioned and examined under a transmission electron microscope. After ischemic insult, neurons from the CA1 field presented alterations, corresponding to the initial, intermediate and final stages of the degenerative process. The only difference observed between the 10 and 20 min ischemic groups was the degree of damage; the reaction was stronger in 20 min groups than in the 10 min groups. While neurons were found in the different stages of oncotic necrosis in all groups, differences were found between the groups in relation to prevalent stages. In both ischemic groups, after 2 days of reperfusion, the initial stage of oncotic necrosis was prevalent and large numbers of neurons appeared normal. In both groups, after 4 days of reperfusion, most of the neurons showed more advanced alterations, typical of an intermediate stage. In both groups, after 10 days of reperfusion, alterations corresponding to the intermediate and final stages of oncotic necrosis were also predominant. However, few intact neurons were identified and the neuropile appeared more organised, with numerous glial cells. In summary, the pyramidal neurons of the CA1 field displayed selective vulnerability and exhibited a morphological death pattern corresponding exclusively to an oncotic necrotic pathway.",
