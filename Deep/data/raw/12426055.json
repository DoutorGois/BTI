     "AB": "Increasing evidence suggests that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a progressive course characterized by worsening of symptoms and morphological alterations within the brain. This suggests that a neurodegenerative component may exist in schizophrenia. The role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in neurodevelopment, cell viability and synaptic plasticity led to the investigation of BDNF as a potential candidate molecule in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. BDNF mRNA was examined by in situ hybridization in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of animals with neonatal ibotenic acid lesions of the ventral hippocampus, a putative neurodevelopmental animal model of schizophrenia. Results demonstrate that animals with neonatal ibotenic acid lesions of the ventral hippocampus have reduced basal levels of BDNF mRNA. It is possible that alterations in this trophic factor render animals more susceptible to neurodegenerative insults.",
