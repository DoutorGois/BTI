     "AB": "A new modeling approach of hippocampal nonlinear dynamics is presented. It is based on Principal Dynamics Modes (PDMs) derived from the Volterra kernels quantifying the hippocampal transformations. The approach is illustrated using data obtained from acute hippocampal slice preparations and from behaving rats performs a memory task. The resulting PDM models are comparable in performance to the Volterra models and require significantly less representational and implementational overhead.",
