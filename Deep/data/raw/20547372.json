     "AB": "Previous studies have shown that dendrites are influenced by substrate stiffness when neurons are plated in either pure or mixed cultures. However, because substrate rigidity can also affect other aspects of culture development known to impact dendrite branching, such as overall cell number, it is unclear whether substrate stiffness exerts a direct or indirect effect on dendrite morphology. In this study, we determine whether substrate stiffness plays a critical role in regulating dendrite branching independent of cell number. We plated primary mixed hippocampal cultures on soft and stiff gels, with Young's moduli of 1 kPa and 7 kPa, respectively. We found that neurons plated on stiffer substrates showed increased branching relative to neurons grown on softer substrates at the same cell number. On the stiff gels, we also observed a cell number-dependent effect, in which increasing initial plating density decreased dendrite branching. This change correlates with an increase in extracellular glutamate. We concluded that both cell number and substrate stiffness play roles in determining dendrite branching, and that the two effects are independent of one another.",
