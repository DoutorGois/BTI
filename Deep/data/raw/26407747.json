     "AB": "Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRbeta) is expressed in the brain by vascular mural cells-brain capillary pericytes and arterial vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Recent evidence shows that blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and increased permeability, especially in the hippocampus, positively correlates with elevated levels of soluble PDGFRbeta (sPDGFRbeta) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with mild dementia. To determine which vascular cell type(s) contributes to increased sPDGFRbeta in CSF, we compared PDGFRbeta expression and sPDGFRbeta shedding in response to injury in early passage primary cultures of human brain pericytes, brain arterial VSMCs, and brain endothelial cells. PDGFRbeta protein was undetectable in endothelial cells, but was found both in pericytes and VSMCs. PDGFRbeta relative protein abundance was by 4.2-fold (p<0.05) higher in pericytes compared to VSMCs. Hypoxia (1% O2) or amyloid-beta peptide (25 muM) compared to normoxia (21% O2) both increased over 48 h shedding of sPDGFRbeta and its levels in the culture medium from pericytes cultures, but not from VSMCs cultures, by 4.3-fold and 4.6-fold, respectively, compared to the basal sPDGFRbeta levels in the medium (1.43+/-0.15 ng/ml). This was associated with the corresponding loss of cell-associated PDGFRbeta from pericytes and no change in cellular levels of PDGFRbeta in VSMCs. Thus, sPDGFRbeta is a biomarker of pericyte injury, and elevated sPDGFRbeta levels in biofluids in patients with dementia and/or other neurodegenerative disorders likely reflects pericyte injury, which supports the potential for sPDGFRbeta to be developed and validated as a biomarker of brain pericyte injury and BBB dysfunction.",
