The laminar structure of the hippocampus was deranged in the rats exposed to 0.6 Gy or more. Pyramidal cells in the CA-3 region were more susceptible than those in the CA-1 region. Aberrant mossy fiber terminals were observed in the stratum oriens of the CA-3 region (infrapyramidal mossy fibers) in rats exposed to 0.3 Gy or more.",
