     "AB": "Uptake of 59Fe from blood into brains of anaesthetized rats and mice has been studied by intravenous infusion of [59Fe]ferrous ascorbate or of 59Fe-transferrin, the results not being significantly different. Uptakes in the rat were linear with time, but increased at longer times in the mouse. Transfer constants, K(in) (in ml/g/h x 10(3)), for cerebral hemispheres were 5.2 in the adult rat and 5.6 in the mouse. These K(in) values corresponded to 59Fe influxes of 145 and 322 pmol/g/h, respectively. 59Fe uptake into the mouse brain occurred in the following order: cerebellum > brainstem > frontal cerebral cortex > parietal cortex > occipital cortex > hippocampus > caudate nucleus. In genetically hypotransferrinaemic mice, 59Fe uptake into brain was 80-95 times greater than in To strain mice. Pretreatment of young rats and mice with monoclonal antibodies to transferrin receptors, i.e., the anti-rat immunoglobulin G OX 26 and the anti-mouse immunoglobulin M RI7 208, inhibited 59Fe uptake into spleen by 94% and 98%, respectively, indicating saturation of receptors. The antibodies reduced 59Fe uptake into rat brain by 35-60% and that into mouse brain by 65-85%. Although a major portion of iron transport across the blood-brain barrier is normally transferrin-mediated, non-transferrin-bound iron readily crosses it at low serum transferrin levels.",
