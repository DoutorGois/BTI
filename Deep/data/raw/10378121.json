     "AB": "The effect of transient cerebral ischemia on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) synthesis was studied in rats by a modified pharmacohistochemical method. The procedure involved in vivo irreversible inhibition of AChE by administration of the inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP; 1.2 mg/kg b.w., i.m.) 1 h before 30 min forebrain ischemia (the four-vessel occlusion model). At the onset of ischemia, 70-75% of AChE was inhibited in the brain. Recirculation was followed by histochemical and biochemical investigations of newly synthesized AChE in the striatum, septum, cortex and hippocampus. Control sham-operated animals were treated with the same dose of DFP. For correlation, rats not treated with DFP were subjected to the same ischemic procedures and investigated simultaneously. In these rats, significant decrease in AChE activity was found in the striatum, septum and hippocampus during 24 h recirculation. In DFP treated rats, ischemia markedly depressed resynthesis of AChE; after 4 h recirculation, AChE activity was decreased by 45-60% in all investigated areas in comparison with controls and the AChE histochemistry showed only slightly stained neurons in the striatum and septum. Twenty-four hours after ischemia, these neurons were densely stained and the increase in AChE activity indicated a partial recovery of the enzyme synthesis. These results suggest that the depression of AChE synthesis after forebrain ischemia is probably transient, not accompanied by cholinergic neuron degeneration.",
