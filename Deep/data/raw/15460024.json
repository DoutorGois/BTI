     "AB": "Several approaches recently introduced to analyze release rates in central synapses advanced our understanding of synaptic neurotransmission, however, leaving many questions still unresolved. In this work we present evidence that a new method recently developed by Sakaba and Neher to study neurotransmission in calyx of Held, a giant glutamatergic synapse, could be also applied for estimating release rate functions and averaged quantal sizes in small central synapses. By means of different simulation approaches applied to reproduce GABAergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus we have shown that possible problems with a spatial voltage clamp which can occur in synaptic connections distributed over a large area of dendritic tree are not crucial for applicability of the method when synapses are compactly distributed or located proximally and when release rates are below 1 ms(-1). In another set of simulations we have also shown that at above mentioned release rates desensitization and/or saturation of postsynaptic GABAA receptors does not prevent accurate estimates of release rate and averaged quantal size. Thus, we conclude that the new approach based on analysis of fluctuations of postsynaptic currents under conditions of stationary release or moderately nonstationary conditions might be applicable to studies of small central synapses.",
