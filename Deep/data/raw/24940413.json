     "AB": "The aim of this study was to observe the expression of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and to explore whether cilostazol pretreatment exerts a protective effect on the brain through the PARP/AIF-mediated pathway in a rat model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Rats were randomly divided into three groups: Sham-surgery, ischemia-reperfusion and cilostazol (n=45 rats/group). Rat models of middle cerebral artery occlusion were prepared using a thread occlusion method. Rats in the cilostazol group were administered 30 mg/kg intragastric cilostazol 6 and 2 h before brain ischemia, respectively. Following reperfusion, samples were collected at different time-points (6, 24 and 72 h) and each group was further subdivided into three subgroups (n=15 rats/subgroup). Apoptosis was measured using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling method. The protein expression levels of AIF and PARP were detected using western blot analysis and the expression levels of AIF mRNA were determined using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. AIF nuclear translocation occurred following local cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Apoptosis, levels of AIF and PARP protein expression and levels of AIF mRNA expression were significantly increased in the ischemia-reperfusion group compared with the sham-surgery group (P<0.05). However, apoptosis and the expression levels of AIF protein, PARP protein and AIF mRNA at different time-points were significantly decreased in the cilostazol group compared with the ischemia-reperfusion group (P<0.05). In conclusion, cilostazol has a protective effect on rat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, and acts by inhibiting nerve cell apoptosis by preventing the excessive activation of PARP and AIF nuclear translocation.",
