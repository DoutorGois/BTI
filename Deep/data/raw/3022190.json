     "AB": "The effect of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) on long-term potentiation (LTP) was studied in the hippocampal slice preparation of the rat. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded and evoked in the stratum radiatum of the CA1. Both the low frequency EPSP and LTP of the EPSP were significantly increased by treatment with 4-AP. These effects were inhibited by increasing the magnesium concentration from 1 to 4 mM. Pretreatment with 20 microM DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate antagonized only the increase in LTP produced by 4-AP. It is suggested that 4-AP enhances Ca influx either pre- or postsynaptically and thereby increases LTP.",
