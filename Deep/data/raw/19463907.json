     "AB": "In the present study, we investigated the effect of imetit, a selective histamine H(3) agonist, on the improvement of NMDA receptor agonists in H(1) antagonist-induced working memory deficit and the decrease of hippocampal theta activity in rats. Pyrilamine (35 mg/kg, i.p.) impaired spatial memory and decreased hippocampal theta activity during the radial maze task. In addition, intrahippocampal injection of D-cycloserine (1 microg/side) and spermidine (10 microg/side) improved the pyrilamine-induced working memory deficit and the decrease of hippocampal theta activity. The improvement effects of D-cycloserine and spermidine were antagonized by intrahippocampal injection of imetit (10 microg/side). These results indicate that, the facilitation of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminals besides direct stimulation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors take part in the improvements of NMDA receptor agonists on pyrilamine-induced spatial memory deficit and the decrease of hippocampal theta activity.",
