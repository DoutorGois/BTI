     "AB": "Recent experiments have shown that hippocampal pyramidal cells can generate synchronized action potentials even when chemical synapses are blocked. The computer simulations reported here showed that communication between cells by extracellular currents could cause this synchrony, provided that (1) individual neurons were sufficiently excitable and that (2) the resistivity of the extracellular medium was sufficiently high. Synchronization was enhanced if electronic junctions were also present.",
