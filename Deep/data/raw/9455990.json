     "AB": "The study compared the efficacy of acute versus chronic metrifonate treatment to improve initial and reversal learning of the water maze spatial navigation task in medial septal-lesioned rats. Acute oral administration of 30 mg/kg metrifonate at 30 min, but not at 150 or 360 min, before training improved the initial acquisition of the water maze task. In contrast, improvement of initial learning performance of medial septal-lesioned rats pretreated for 21 days with metrifonate was observed irrespective of the timing of metrifonate treatment relative to behavioral testing. Reversal learning was assessed after a four-day wash-out period. No drug treatment was administered during this part of the study. All the medial septal-lesioned rats that had received only acute treatment with metrifonate during the initial learning stage were now as impaired as vehicle treated medial septal-lesioned rats. However, the group subchronically pretreated with metrifonate performed better than the vehicle-treated medial septal-lesioned controls. These results indicate that both acute and subchronic treatment with metrifonate can facilitate spatial learning in medial septal-lesioned rats and the transient nature of this beneficial effect after single acute administration is transformed into a long-lasting improvement by subchronic treatment.",
