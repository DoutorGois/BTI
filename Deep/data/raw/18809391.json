     "AB": "The abuse of anabolic androgenic steroids (AASs) at supratherapeutic doses is a problem not only in the world of sports, but also among non-athletes using AASs to improve physical appearance and to become more bold and courageous. Investigations of the possible neurochemical effects of AAS have focused partially on the monoaminergic systems, which are involved in aggressive behaviours and the development of drug dependence. In the present study, we administered nandrolone decanoate (3 or 15 mg/kg/day for 14 days) and measured mRNA expression of dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors, transporters and enzymes in the male rat brain using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Expression of the dopamine D1-receptor transcript was elevated in the amygdala and decreased in the hippocampus while the transcript level of the dopamine D4-receptor was increased in the nucleus accumbens. No changes in transcriptional levels were detected among the serotonin-related genes examined in this study. The altered mRNA expression of the dopamine receptors may contribute to some of the behavioural changes often reported in AAS abusers of increased impulsivity, aggression and drug-seeking.",
