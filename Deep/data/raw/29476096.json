     "AB": "Lead (Pb) is known to impair children's cognitive function. It has been previously shown that developmental Pb exposure alters dendritic spine formation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. However, the underlying mechanism has not yet been defined. In this study, a low-level gestational Pb exposure (GLE) rat model was employed to investigate the impact of Pb on the spine density of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons and its regulatory mechanism. Pb exposure resulted in impaired performance of the rats in the Morris water maze tasks, and in decreased EPSC amplitudes in hippocampal CA3-CA1 regions. With a 3D reconstruction by the Imaris software, the results from Golgi staining showed that the spine density in the CA1 region was reduced in the Pb-exposed rats in a dose-dependent manner. Decreased spine density was also observed in cultured hippocampal neurons following the Pb treatment. Furthermore, the expression level of NLGN1, a postsynaptic protein that mediates synaptogenesis, was significantly decreased following the Pb exposure both in vivo and in vitro. Up-regulation of NLGN1 in cultured primary neurons partially attenuated the impact of Pb on the spine density. Taken together, our resultssuggest that Pb exposure alters spine plasticity in the developing hippocampus by down-regulating NLGN1 protein levels.",
