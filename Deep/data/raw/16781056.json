     "AB": "Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is a phenomenon whereby an organ's adaptive transient resistance to a lethal ischemic insult occurs by preconditioning this organ with a sub-lethal/mild ischemic insult of short duration. Besides IPC, recent studies reported that a short sub-lethal ischemia and reperfusion in various organs can induce ischemic tolerance in another organ as well. This phenomenon is known as remote ischemic preconditioning (RPC). In the present study we tested the hypothesis that tolerance for ischemia can be induced in brain by RPC and IPC in a rat model of asphyxial cardiac arrest (ACA). RPC was induced by tightening the upper two-thirds of both hind limbs using a tourniquet for 15 or 30 min and IPC was induced by tightening bilateral carotid artery ligatures for 2 min. Eight minutes of ACA was induced 48 h after RPC or IPC. After 7 day of resuscitation, brains were extracted and examined for histopathological changes. In CA1 hippocampus, the number of normal neurons was 63% lower in cardiac-arrested rats as compared to the control group. The number of normal neurons in the 15 min RPC, 30 min RPC, and IPC groups was higher than the ACA group by 54, 70, and 67%, respectively. This study demonstrates that RPC and IPC are able to provide neuroprotection in a rat model of ACA. Besides direct application of RPC or IPC paradigms, the exploration of the mechanisms of observed neuroprotection by RPC and IPC may also lead to a possible therapy for CA patients.",
