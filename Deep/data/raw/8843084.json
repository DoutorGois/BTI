     "AB": "The effects of chronic alcohol consumption on memory performance and hippocampal acetylcholine release in vivo were investigated in rats. Rats were allowed to drink 25% (v/v) ethanol solution as the only source of fluid for nine consecutive months, whereas control rats received only tap water. Memory performance was tested by the acquisition of shuttle box active and passive avoidance. Chronic ethanol-consuming rats were not impaired in the acquisition of the active avoidance response task, whereas in the passive avoidance task, latency scores of treated rats were significantly lower than in controls. The basal release of acetylcholine in freely moving rats, assessed by the microdialysis technique, was significantly decreased in ethanol-treated rats. Impairment in memory performance, as assessed in the passive avoidance task, was significantly correlated with hippocampal acetylcholine release in vivo.",
