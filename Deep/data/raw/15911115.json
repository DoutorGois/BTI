     "AB": "The hippocampus is important in learning and memory functions but its ability to aid in these functions declines during aging. In this study, we examined hippocampal proteins whose expressions changed in the aging process. A comparison of synaptosome proteins of hippocampus prepared from young-adult (9-week-old) rats with those from aged (30-month-old) rats by two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis revealed 24 spots that were expressed differently among about 1000 spots detected in both young-adult and aged rat samples. Nineteen of these 24 spots were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. These proteins included chaperone proteins and proteins related to the cytoskeleton, neurotransmission, signal transduction and energy supply. The cytoskeleton-related proteins included actin and T-complex 1, which is thought to play a role in actin folding. Actin was up-regulated but T-complex 1 was down-regulated in aged rat synapses. These results suggest that age-dependent changes of actin filament formation are related to neuronal dysfunction associated with aging.",
