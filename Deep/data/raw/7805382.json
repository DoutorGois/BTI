     "AB": "Disagreement over the neuroanatomical substrate of associative visual agnosia encompasses such basic issues as: (1) the necessity for bilateral lesions; (2) the intrahemispheric locus of damage; and (3) the roles of disconnection versus cortical damage. We examined three patients whose associative visual agnosia encompassed objects and printed words but spared faces. CAT scans revealed unilateral dominant occipitotemporal strokes. CAT scans of four previously reported cases with this same profile of associative agnosia were obtained. Dominant parahippocampal, fusiform and lingual gyri were the most extensively damaged cortical regions surveyed and were involved in all cases. Of white matter tracts surveyed, only temporal white matter including inferior longitudinal fasciculus was severely and universally involved. Splenium of the corpus callosum was frequently but not always involved. We conclude there is a form of associative visual agnosia with agnosia for objects and printed words but sparing face recognition which has a characteristic unilateral neuropathology. Damage or disconnection of dominant parahippocampal, fusiform and lingual gyri is the necessary and sufficient lesion.",
