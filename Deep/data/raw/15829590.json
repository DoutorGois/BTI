     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) of C-fiber-evoked field potentials in spinal dorsal horn may be relevant to pathological pain. Our previous work has shown that the late phase of the spinal LTP is protein synthesis-dependent. Considerable evidence has accumulated that dopamine D1/D5 receptors are important for late-phase LTP in hippocampus. In this study, the role of D1/D5 receptors in LTP of C-fiber-evoked field potentials in spinal dorsal horn was evaluated in urethan-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. We found the following. 1) Spinal application of SKF 38393, a D1/D5 receptor agonist, induced a slowly developed LTP of C-fiber-evoked field potentials, lasting for >10 h, and the effect was blocked by the D1/D5 antagonist SCH 23390, whereas a D2 receptor agonist (quinpirole) induced depression of C-fiber responses, lasting for 2 h. 2) The potentiation produced by D1/D5 receptor agonist occluded the late phase but not the early phase of the spinal LTP produced by tetanic stimulation. 3) SCH 23390 selectively depressed the late-phase LTP, when applied 40 min before tetanic stimulation. 4) The D1/D5 agonist-induced potentiation is blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. 5) Activation of protein kinase A by spinal application of 8-Br-cAMP also induced spinal LTP, and the action occluded the potentiation induced by the D1/D5 receptor agonist. These results suggest that the spinal D1/D5 receptors participate in the protein synthesis-dependent late-phase LTP of C-fiber-evoked field potentials in spinal dorsal horn through the cAMP signaling pathway.",
