     "AB": "The effect of temperature changes on the activity of CA1 pyramidal cells has been investigated on completely submerged rat hippocampal slices. Fast and slow increase in the temperature from 24-28 to 37-38 degrees C decreased the amplitude of population spikes (PS), but increased the number of active pyramidal cells. The decrease in PS is more evident from 32 to 37 degrees C. After cooling to 24-28 degrees C, a long (more than 30 min) and considerable (up to 12%) increase of PS was observed. Increasing the temperature from 24-28 to 37-38 degrees C does not affect double facilitation, nor the maintenance of a long post-tetanic potentiation. It is suggested that the mechanism of temperature-induced long-term potentiation is similar to that of a long post-tetanic potentiation.",
