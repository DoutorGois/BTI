     "AB": "The purpose of this work was to study the development of specific projections from the postero-lateral cortex during the third trimester of gestation in the mouse. To do this, we labeled undifferentiated lateral cortex with the fluorescent carbocyanine dye, Dil, in the embryonic day (E) 16 mouse embryo using exo utero surgical techniques (Muneoka, Wanek, and Bryant, 1986). Embryos were allowed to develop to term (postnatal day 0, P0) at which time the fiber patterns emanating from the marked regions were studied. Dye placement in the undifferentiated postero-ventral cortex produced labeled fibers in the hippocampal formation. A robust projection of the angular bundle into the CA1 region of the hippocampus was heavily labeled. In addition, in some animals, cortical tracts, such as the anterior commissure, corpus callosum, and a corticotectal tract, were labeled. These tracts have been described previously as scaffolding pathways in the fetal cat (McConnell, Ghosh, and Shatz, 1989), and other vertebrates (Wilson, Ross, Parrett, and Easter, 1990). Dye placement in adjacent, more anterior or dorsal areas showed strong labeling in cortical structures but no labeling in the hippocampal formation. These data indicate that, by birth, the temporal cortex is subdivided along the rostro-caudal axis as entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex, and along the dorso-ventral axis, as entorhinal cortex and neocortex. Also, these earliest connections are similar to adult connections in their specificity of target area selection. Therefore, these early, yet specific, connections may play a role int he formation of future connections during postnatal development.",
