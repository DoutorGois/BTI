     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relations between neuroapoptosis and the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially the role of NF-kappaB in the regulation of neuroapoptosis. METHODS: Caspase-3 and NF-kappaB (p50) expressions in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in APPswe Tg2576 transgenic mice were studied from postnatal day 0-180, using Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR methods. RESULTS: Both neuronal apoptosis and NF-kappaB activity decreased gradually with the increase of age in wild type and Tg2576 mice. However, the number of caspase-3-positive or NF-kappaB-positive pyramidal cells in Tg2576 mice was greater than that in age-matched wild type mice, with significant differences after postnatal day 14 (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Linear regression analyses of caspase-3 and NF-kappaB expression demonstrated a correlation between neuroapoptosis and activity of NF-kappaB. CONCLUSION: The process of neuroapoptosis is consistent with the onset and development of AD. Furthermore, the observed correlation between neuroapoptosis and NF-kappaB activity suggests a role of NF-kappaB in hippocampal neuroapoptosis.",
