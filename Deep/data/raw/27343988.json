     "AB": "Memory consolidation and reconsolidation have been shown to require new gene expression. N-glycosylation, one of the major post-translational modifications, is known to play essential or regulatory roles in protein function. A previous study suggested that N-glycosylation is required for the maintenance of long-term potentiation in hippocampal CA1 neurons. However, the role of de novo N-glycosylation in learning and memory, such as memory consolidation and reconsolidation, still remains unclear. Here, we show critical roles for N-glycosylation in the consolidation and reconsolidation of contextual fear memory in mice. We examined the effects of pharmacological inhibition of N-glycosylation in the hippocampus on these memory processes using three different inhibitors (tunicamycin, 1-deoxynojirimycin, and swainsonine) that block the enzymatic activity required for N-glycosylation at different steps. Microinfusions of the N-glycosylation inhibitors into the dorsal hippocampus impaired long-term memory (LTM) formation without affecting short-term memory (STM). Similarly, this pharmacological blockade of N-glycosylation in the dorsal hippocampus also disrupted post-reactivation LTM after retrieval without affecting post-reactivation STM. Additionally, a microinfusion of swainsonine blocked c-fos induction in the hippocampus, which is observed when memory is consolidated. Our observations showed that N-glycosylation is required for the consolidation and reconsolidation of contextual fear memory and suggested that N-glycosylation contributes to the new gene expression necessary for these memory processes.",
