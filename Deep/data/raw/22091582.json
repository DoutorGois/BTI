     "AB": "Fear conditioning, extinction, and renewal were evaluated in adult (6-month-old) and aging (17-month-old) male C57Bl/6 mice. Mice were subjected to five tone-shock trials and later exposed to 150 tone-alone trials. Thereafter, all mice showed little fear in the extinction context. Adult mice demonstrated return of fear in a distinct context (renewal) but aging mice did not. Aging mice showed normal shock sensitivity, tone fear learning, and extinction. Aging mice thus exhibited a very selective deficit in the contextual gating of extinguished fear. This contextual gating deficit may reflect age-related pathology in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.",
