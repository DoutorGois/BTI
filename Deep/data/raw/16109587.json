     "AB": "Narp (neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin) is a secreted immediate early gene product functioning as a cluster factor for the AMPA receptor subtype of glutamate receptors. This study was designed to examine the effects of acute administration of methamphetamine (MAP) on the Narp gene in rat brain using reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Acute administration of MAP [4.6 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)] increased Narp mRNA in the prefrontal cortex, whereas the same treatment with MAP decreased Narp mRNA in the hippocampus. Therefore, Narp gene could be involved in the MAP-induced effects.",
