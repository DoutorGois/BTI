     "AB": "This study tested the hypothesis that the hippocampus modulates dopamine-dependent function of the nucleus accumbens using behavioural and neurochemical evidence. Rats with bilateral lesions of the hippocampus induced by colchicine and kainic acid exhibited equivalent levels of spontaneous locomotor activity but a potentiation of the hyperactivity produced, dose-dependently, by D-amphetamine measured in photo-cell activity cages. The same rats subsequently received unilateral implantations of a microdialysis probe aimed at the nucleus accumbens and showed elevated levels of extracellular dopamine in response to D-amphetamine but no significant difference in basal values in comparison with sham-operated controls. The results are discussed in terms of functional interactions between the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens involving the control of mesolimbic dopamine release.",
