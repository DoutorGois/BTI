     "AB": "We used quantitative in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiography to study changes in adenosine receptors following hypoxia-ischemia (H-I) in the neonatal rat brain. Seven-day-old rat pups were subjected to a unilateral ligation of the common carotid artery followed by a 2 h 15 min hypoxic period (7.7% O2 in N2). Adenosine A1 receptor mRNA in cortex and several parts of hippocampus, and A2a mRNA was decreased in the ligated hemisphere 0 h, 1 h and 2 h following hypoxia. The binding of the A1 receptor selective antagonist [3H]8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) in the presence or in the absence of GTP decreased immediately after the hypoxic period in both hemispheres and returned thereafter gradually towards control. These results show that there are rapid changes in A1 receptor number on both sides of the brain, and of adenosine A1 and A2a receptor mRNA in the hemisphere that would later develop infarction. Decreases in adenosine receptors may worsen H-I brain damage and have consequences for the use of adenosine directed therapy.",
