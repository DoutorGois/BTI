     "AB": "Delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region after transient forebrain ischemia may share its underlying mechanism with neurodegeneration and other modes of neuronal death. The precise mechanism, however, remains unknown. In the postischemic hippocampus, conjugated ubiquitin accumulates and free ubiquitin is depleted, suggesting impaired proteasome function. The authors measured regional proteasome activity after transient forebrain ischemia in male Mongolian gerbils. At 30 minutes after ischemia, proteasome activity was 40% of normal in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. After 2 hours of reperfusion, it had returned to normal levels in the frontal cortex, CA3 region, and dentate gyrus, but remained low for up to 48 hours in the CA1 region. Thus, the 26S proteasome was globally impaired in the forebrain during transient ischemia and failed to recover only in the CA1 region after reperfusion. The authors also measured 20S and 26S proteasome activities directly after decapitation ischemia (at 5 and 20 minutes) by fractionating the extracts with glycerol gradient centrifugation. Without adenosine triphosphate (ATP), only 20S proteasome activity was detected in extracts from both the hippocampus and frontal cortex. When the extracts were incubated with ATP in an ATP-regenerating system, 26S proteasome activity recovered almost fully in the frontal cortex but only partially in the hippocampus. Thus, after transient forebrain ischemia, ATP-dependent reassociation of the 20S catalytic and PA700 regulatory subunits to form the active 26S proteasome is severely and specifically impaired in the hippocampus. The irreversible loss of proteasome function underlies the delayed neuronal death induced by transient forebrain ischemia in the hippocampal CA1 region.",
