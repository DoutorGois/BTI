     "AB": "The epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), perhaps through effects on amyloid-beta (Abeta) metabolism. Detailed analyses of various Abeta parameters in aging APP(V717F+/-) transgenic mice expressing mouse apoE, no apoE, or human apoE2, apoE3, or apoE4 demonstrate that apoE facilitates, but is not required for, Abeta fibril formation in vivo. Human apoE isoforms markedly delayed Abeta deposition relative to mouse apoE, with apoE2 (and apoE3 to a lesser extent) having a prolonged ability to prevent Abeta from converting into fibrillar forms. Isoform-specific effects of human apoE on Abeta levels and neuritic plaque formation mimicked that observed in AD (E4 > E3 > E2). Importantly, observation of an apoE-dependent decrease in percent soluble Abeta and enrichment of Abeta in membrane microdomains prior to Abeta deposition indicates that apoE influences Abeta metabolism early in the amyloidogenic process and provides a possible novel mechanism by which apoE affects AD pathogenesis.",
