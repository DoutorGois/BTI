     "AB": "Taurine increases in brain extracellular space due to glutamate agonists were studied in vivo in the rat hippocampus using a dialysis technique, both in the absence and in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists. Extracellular taurine levels increased during perfusions of agonists, listed in descending order of potency: kainate (KA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and quisqualate (QA). While taurine increases due to KA or QA perfusions were inhibited by 6,7-dinitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), those induced by NMDA were abolished in the presence of 3-(carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP). These results indicate that increases in extracellular taurine levels evoked by NMDA, KA or QA in the rat hippocampus are caused by activation of their specific receptors. Field potentials, concomitantly recorded, were quickly abolished during NMDA or KA perfusions (0.1 mM), while QA (0.25 mM) induced the appearance of bicuculline-like evoked responses. Since taurine has been proposed as an osmoregulatory substance in the rat brain, and cell swelling is known to be an early component of glutamate agonists neurotoxicity, the increases in extracellular taurine reported here could be due to taurine released through an osmoregulatory process, counteracting the neurotoxic cellular oedema induced by glutamate agonists.",
