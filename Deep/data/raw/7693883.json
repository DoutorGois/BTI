     "AB": "1. Nitric oxide has been implicated in the production of long-term depression (LTD) in the cerebellum and in the production of long-term potentiation (LTP) and LTD in the hippocampus. We now provide evidence of its involvement in the induction of long-term synaptic potentiation in in vitro slices in the cerebral cortex of the rat. 2. Intracellular recordings were made from layer V neurons in the medial frontal cortex, and excitatory synaptic potentials (EPSPs) were evoked by electrical stimulation of layers II/III. Tetanic stimulation of this pathway may induce LTD or LTP or no change at these synapses. First we established experimental conditions under which a long lasting potentiation could be induced with a high incidence (> 60%), namely perfusion of slices with 1 microM bicuculline methiodide, second the use of increased shock duration in the tetanic conditioning stimuli, third and most important the addition of QX-314 to the microelectrode to reduce potassium conductances. Because the potentiation of the mean EPSP slope was significantly greater than the control at 40-min postconditioning, but was declining throughout this period, we refer to it for brevity as LTP, but strictly class it as an LTP-like phenomenon. 3. The nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor interfered with the production of LTP. In the control group of neurons (n = 13) the mean depolarizing slope of the EPSP at 30-min post-conditioning was 142.7 +/- 2% (mean +/- SE) of the prestimulation control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
