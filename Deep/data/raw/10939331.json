     "AB": "Time-lapse microscopy, retrospective immunohistochemistry, and cultured hippocampal neurons were used to determine the time frame of individual glutamatergic synapse assembly and the temporal order in which specific molecules accumulate at new synaptic junctions. New presynaptic boutons capable of activity-evoked vesicle recycling were observed to form within 30 min of initial axodendritic contact. Clusters of the presynaptic active zone protein Bassoon were present in all new boutons. Conversely, clusters of the postsynaptic molecule SAP90/PSD-95 and glutamate receptors were found on average only approximately 45 min after such boutons were first detected. AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors displayed similar clustering kinetics. These findings suggest that glutamatergic synapse assembly can occur within 1-2 hr after initial contact and that presynaptic differentiation may precede postsynaptic differentiation.",
