     "AB": "The FXYD family is a small single-span membrane protein family; recently, we have identified a novel member of this family from the cDNA library of the rat hippocampus and named phosphohippolin (Php) (Mol. Br. Res. vol. 86, 2001). The deduced amino acid sequence of this novel Php comprises 93 residues with a core motif of FXYD and a single transmembrane domain. This indicates that Php belongs to FXYD6 subfamily of the seven FXYD subfamilies (FXYD1-7). Php shows a 48.1% homology with rat phospholemman (FXYD1), a transmembrane family protein. In this study, polyclonal antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of rat Php were raised and purified. The spatial expression of the Php protein was in the neuronal fibers of the medial part of lateral habenula nucleus, thalamus, hypothalamus, stria terminalis, zona incerta, amygdaloid body and cingulum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, cerebral cortex and cerebellum. A unique Php distribution was identified in the cerebellum, with a predominant expression pattern in the granule layer of lobules VI-IX of the posterior lobe. Developmental studies demonstrated that the highest level of Php expression was seen in the postnatal (PN) 3-week-old rat brain, and a significant amount of Php still existed in the adult brain. These findings suggest that Php may play an important role in the excitability of neurons in the central nervous system during postnatal development, as well as those in the adult brain.",
