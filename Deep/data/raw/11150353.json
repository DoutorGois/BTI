     "AB": "If information is stored as distributed patterns of synaptic weights in the hippocampal formation, retention should be vulnerable to electrically induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal synapses after learning. This prediction was tested by training animals in a spatial water maze task and then delivering bursts of high-frequency (HF) or control stimulation to the perforant path in the angular bundle. High-frequency stimulation induced LTP in the dentate gyrus and probably also at other hippocampal termination sites. Retention in a later probe test was disrupted. When the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) was administered before the high-frequency stimulation, water maze retention was unimpaired. CPP administration blocked the induction of LTP. Thus, high-frequency stimulation of hippocampal afferents disrupts memory retention only when it induces a change in the spatial pattern of synaptic weights. The NMDA receptor dependency of this retrograde amnesia is consistent with the synaptic plasticity and memory hypothesis.",
