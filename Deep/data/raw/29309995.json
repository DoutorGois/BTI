     "AB": "Estrogens have been shown to rapidly (within 1h) affect learning and memory processes, including social recognition. Both systemic and hippocampal administration of 17beta-estradiol facilitate social recognition in female mice within 40min of administration. These effects were likely mediated by estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and the G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), as administration of the respective receptor agonists (PPT and G-1) also facilitated social recognition on a rapid time scale. The medial amygdala has been shown to be necessary for social recognition and long-term manipulations in rats have implicated medial amygdalar ERalpha. As such, our objective was to investigate whether estrogens and different ERs within the medial amygdala play a role in the rapid facilitation of social recognition in female mice. 17beta-estradiol, G-1, PPT, or ERbeta agonist DPN was infused directly into the medial amygdala of ovariectomized female mice. Mice were then tested in a social recognition paradigm, which was completed within 40min, thus allowing the assessment of rapid effects of treatments. 17beta-estradiol (10, 25, 50, 100nM), PPT (300nM), DPN (150nM), and G-1 (50nM) each rapidly facilitated social recognition. Therefore, estrogens in the medial amygdala rapidly facilitate social recognition in female mice, and the three main estrogen receptors: ERalpha, ERbeta, and the GPER all are involved in these effects. This research adds to a network of brain regions, including the medial amygdala and the dorsal hippocampus, that are involved in mediating the rapid estrogenic facilitation of social recognition in female mice.",
