     "AB": "The aim of the present study was to analyze a role of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in the regulation of excitation and inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus and the temporal cortex of Krushinsky-Molodkina rats during seizure development finalizing with ataxia. Analysis was done by Western bloting as well as by immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated significant up-regulation of ERK1/2 activity in the hippocampus in several seconds after sound stimulation. At the same time increased ERK1/2 activity was correlated with enhanced level of SNARE protein SNAP-25 and activation of synapsin I, the proteins which regulate exocytosis machinery. Decreased level of VGLUT2 associated with activation of ERK1/2 and exocytosis proteins supposed activation of glutamate release in the hippocampus, while in the temporal cortex diminished activity of ERK1/2 and synapsin I associated with VGLUT2 up-regulation assumed inhibition of glutamatergic transmission. Our data let us supposed that decreasing of glutamate release in th& temporal cortex could be a trigger for the inhibition of hippocampal glutamatergic system and the beginning of further ataxia stage. Our data demonstrated correlation between expression and activity of exocytosis proteins and ERK1/2 mainly in the glutamategic neurons of the hippocampus and the temporal cortex that let us proposed significant role of ERK1/2 kinases as a positive regulator of glutamate release and as a result initiation of seizure expression.",
