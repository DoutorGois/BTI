     "AB": "Although the function of the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway in long-term potentiation at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses has been well described, relatively little is known about the importance of the p38 MAP kinase pathway in synaptic plasticity. Here we show that the p38 MAP kinase pathway, a parallel signaling cascade activated by distinct upstream kinases, mediates the induction of metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression at CA3-CA1 synapses. Thus, two parallel MAP kinase pathways contribute to opposing forms of long-term plasticity at a central synapse.",
