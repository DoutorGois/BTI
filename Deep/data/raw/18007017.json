     "AB": "Comparative neuroanatomy suggests that the CA3 region of the mammalian hippocampus is directly homologous with the medio-dorsal pallium in birds and reptiles, with which it largely shares the basic organization of primitive cortex. Autoassociative memory models, which are generically applicable to cortical networks, then help assess how well CA3 may process information and what the crucial hurdles are that it may face. The analysis of such models points at spatial memories as posing a special challenge, both in terms of the attractor dynamics they can induce and how they may be established. Addressing such a challenge may have favored the evolution of elements of hippocampal organization observed only in mammals.",
