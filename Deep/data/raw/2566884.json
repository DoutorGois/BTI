     "AB": "The levels of preprosomatostatin (preproSS) mRNA, somatostatin-like immunoactivity (SS-LI) (also known as somatotropin-release inhibitory factor, or SRIF), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity and GAD mRNA were determined in several brain regions of amygdaloid-kindled rats. SS mRNA and SS increased in the cortex and striatum, while only SS increased in the hippocampus. No changes were detected in either GAD activity or GAD mRNA in any brain region. The data suggest that somatostatin may be one of the factors involved in the chain of events leading to kindled seizures.",
