     "AB": "Extracellular amino acid levels in CA3 and CA1 fields of rat hippocampus, an area highly sensitive to seizures, were determined by intracranial microdialysis during seizures induced by systemic administration of soman (o-1,2,2-trimethylpropyl methylphosphonofluoridate), a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. The glutamate uptake level was determined on another series of animals in hippocampus homogenates. An early and transient increase in the extracellular glutamate level occurred in CA3 within 30 min of seizures, with correlated brief elevations of taurine, glycine and glutamine levels. The glutamate level increased early in CA1, declined and then became more sustained (after 50 min of seizures). Apparent elevations of taurine, glycine and glutamine levels in CA1 accompanied changes in glutamate concentrations. Changes of glutamate level correlated with an increase in the glutamate uptake which rapidly declined after 40 min of seizures. The role of the transient release of glutamate in CA3 and of the sustained release in CA1 in prolonged soman-induced seizures is considered. The correlation between glutamate and other amino acid release is studied.",
