     "AB": "Membrane depolarization of neurons is thought to lead to changes in gene expression that modulate neuronal plasticity. We used representational difference analysis to identify a group of cDNAs that are induced by membrane depolarization or by forskolin, but not by neurotrophins or growth factors, in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. One of these genes, SIK (salt-inducible kinase), is a member of the sucrose-nonfermenting 1 protein kinase/AMP-activated protein kinase protein kinase family that was also recently identified from the adrenal gland of rats treated with high-salt diets. SIK mRNA is induced up to eightfold in specific regions of the hippocampus and cortex in rats, following systemic kainic acid administration and seizure induction.",
