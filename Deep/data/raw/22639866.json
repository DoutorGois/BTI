     "AB": "Ischemic tolerance is a phenomenon in which exposure to a mild preconditioning stress results in resistance to a subsequent lethal ischemic insult. Here we investigated the role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in the development of ischemic tolerance by using organotypic rat hippocampal slices exposed to 30 min oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), which leads to selective injury of the CA1 subregion 24 h later. We developed models of pharmacological preconditioning by exposing slices to subtoxic concentrations of either N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) and then, 24 h later, to 30 min OGD. Under these conditions, we observed a significant reduction in OGD-induced CA1 damage. Exposure of slices to the PARP-1 and -2 inhibitors TIQ-A, PJ-34 and UPF 1069 during preconditioning prevented the development of OGD tolerance in a concentration-dependent manner. NMDA and DHPG preconditioning increased the activity of PARP, as detected by immunoblots using antibodies against the poly(ADP-ribose) polymer product, but was not associated with consumption of cellular NAD(+) or ATP. Neuroprotection induced by preconditioning was also prevented by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. The modest but significant increase in caspase-3/7 induced by preconditioning, however, was not associated with PARP-1 cleavage, as occurred with staurosporine. Finally, TIQ-A prevented the activation of ERK1/2 and Akt induced by NMDA preconditioning, suggesting that the protective mechanism evoked by PARP requires activation of these prosurvival mediators. Our results suggest that preconditioning with appropriate pharmacological stimuli may promote neuroprotective mechanisms triggered by the sublethal activation of two otherwise deleterious executioners such as PARP and caspase-3/7.",
