     "AB": "To investigate the involvement of the extracellular matrix in central neuron neurite outgrowth, dissociated hippocampal neurons were cultured on basal lamina prepared from chick embryo retina. After 2 days in culture, the basal lamina was found to promote marked hippocampal neurite outgrowth. The average neurite length was over twice that on collagen plus laminin-treated coverslips. These results clearly indicate that central neurons as well as peripheral neurons respond to the components of basal lamina and thus extend their processes.",
