     "AB": "Specific binding sites for vasopressin (AVP) were located in subcellular particulate fractions of rat brain with tritiated vasopressin of high specific activity, 22.5 Ci/mmol. Rat brain tissue was dissected, placed in cold 0.32 M sucrose containing proteolytic inhibitors, homogenized and fractionated into a crude nuclear fraction (1K pellet), crude mitochondrial fractions (12K pellet), and plasma membranes and microsomes (100K pellet). Specific binding of vasopressin was found in the 12K and 100K pellets in the presence of a divalent metal ion with Ni greater than Co greater than Mg greater than Mn greater than no metal ion at pH 7.4 in 50 mM Tris-Maleate buffer. Maximum specific binding of 16 nM AVP was located in the 100K anterior cortex fraction which bound 350 fmoles/mg protein; striatum, midbrain/thalamus, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata and pons bound specifically about 200 fmoles/mg protein and frontal poles and parietal cortex about 100 fmoles/mg protein in the 100K pellet. In all of the brain regions studied, except hippocampus and septum, the 100K pellet bound specifically 2 to 4 times more 3H-AVP than the 12K pellet. In the hippocampus with 16 nM AVP, the 12K pellet bound specifically 150 fmoles/mg protein; the septum, 75 fmoles/mg protein. Little or no binding to the 100K pellet was present in these regions. Bound AVP could be dissociated rapidly from the membranes by the addition of EDTA. The 12K hippocampal pellet was further fractionated into myelin, mitochondria, and synaptosomes; purification was confirmed by marker enzyme assays.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
