     "AB": "In this communication we report the characterization of several transgenic rat lines expressing human AbetaPP carrying the Swedish and Indiana mutations (coded UKUR28), the human presenilin 1 transgene with the 'Finn' mutation (coded UKUR19) and double transgenic rats expressing both transgenes (coded UKUR25). In these Tg rats, the AbetaPP and PS1 transgene expression was largely restricted to the hippocampus and neocortex. The PS1 transgenic rats did not produce visible changes in Abeta immunoreactivity. The AbetaPP transgenic rats (both the single Tg UKUR28, and double Tg UKUR25) generated a phenotype of intra-neuronalbeta accumulation without plaque formation and with no increased immunoreactivity for AbetaPP amino and carboxyl-terminal epitopes. This phenotype was apparent as early as 6 months of age in the transgenic rat lines carrying the human AbetaPP transgene. No senile plaques of aggregated Abeta were observed in any of the transgenic lines generated, up to 24 months of age. The hAbetaPP single homozygous Tg line (UKUR28) showed an increase in ERK2, without changes in glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activity. A preliminary protein analysis of the hippocampus of the double transgenic rat (UKUR25) by mass spectrometry showed differences in the protein profile between this transgenic line and controls.",
