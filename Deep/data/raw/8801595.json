     "AB": "The repeated, intermittent administration of amphetamine produces a long-lasting sensitization to its behavioral activating effects. Excitatory amino acid receptors in the striatum have been implicated in the development of amphetamine sensitization, and one source of excitatory amino acid input to the striatum is the hippocampus. The purpose of this experiment, therefore, was to determine if an intact hippocampal system is necessary for either the development or expression of sensitization to the psychomotor activating effects of amphetamine. Rats received either fimbria-fornix lesions or sham lesions and approximately 2 weeks later received 10 injections of 3.0 mg/kg d-amphetamine or saline (IP) every other day. Rotational behavior was quantified as an index of amphetamine's psychomotor stimulant effects. Animals with a fimbria-fornix lesion were hyperresponsive to an acute injection of amphetamine, but animals with a fimbria-fornix lesion and control animals did not differ in the development of sensitization (i.e., the rate of sensitization). Furthermore, both groups expressed comparable sensitization (relative to their respective saline-pretreated control groups) when given a challenge injection of amphetamine. These results suggest an intact hippocampal system is not necessary for the development or expression of amphetamine sensitization.",
