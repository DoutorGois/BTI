     "AB": "Glucose transporters play a critical role in mammalian brain energy metabolism because glucose is the principal brain energy source and these transporters promote glucose movement into neural cells. When glucose is unavailable, fructose can serve as an alternative energy source. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction and actin as a reference mRNA, we investigated the impact of fructose feeding on rat brain and other tissue mRNA expression of glucose transporter 5 which has high affinity for fructose. Brain mRNA levels of glucose transporter 5 increased 1.5-fold in 35-day old rats after 7 days of fructose feeding compared with controls, whereas it increased 2.5-fold in jejunum. Semi-quantitative analysis of protein expression by immunofluorescence of glucose transporter 5 in rat hippocampi indicated a 2.4-fold increase. We demonstrated the specificity of fructose feeding on glucose transporter 5 expression by showing that the expression of the neuronal glucose transporter 3 and insulin-regulated glucose transporter 4 were unaffected. In addition, the expression of glucose transporter 5 increased in fructose fed older adult rats (8-months and 12-months old) when compared with controls. These results suggest that short-term fructose feeding increases the expression of glucose transporter 5 in both young and aging adult rats. Increased brain expression of glucose transporter 5 is likely to be important in the role of fructose as an alternative energy source.",
