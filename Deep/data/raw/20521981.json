     "AB": "The fruit of Zizyphus jujuba has been used as a traditional Chinese medicinal herb and considered for thousands of years to affect various physiological functions in the body. We obtained a Z. jujuba extract (ZJE) and observed the neuroprotective effects of ZJE against ischemic damage in gerbils that had received repeated oral administrations of ZJE for 10 days. In the ZJE-treated ischemia group, neuronal nuclei (a marker for neurons)-immunoreactive neurons were abundant (58.4% vs. sham group) in the hippocampal CA1 region 4 days after ischemia/reperfusion compared to those in the vehicle-treated ischemia group (11.3%). In addition, ZJE treatment significantly decreased the reactive gliosis of astrocytes and microglia in the CA1 region compared to that in the vehicle-treated group 4 days after ischemia/reperfusion. Immunoreactivities of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the ZJE-treated ischemia group were higher those in the vehicle-treated ischemia group 4 days after ischemia/reperfusion. In addition, in the ZJE-treated ischemia group, levels of hydroxynonenal, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were much lower than those in the vehicle-treated ischemia group after ischemia/reperfusion. These results suggest that the repeated supplements of ZJE can protect neurons from ischemic damage via up-regulation of SOD1 and reduction of lipid peroxidation in the ischemic hippocampal CA1 region.",
