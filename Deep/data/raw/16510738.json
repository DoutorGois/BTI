     "TI": "Why does fever trigger febrile seizures? GABAA receptor gamma2 subunit mutations associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsies have temperature-dependent trafficking deficiencies.",
     "PG": "2590-7",
     "AB": "With a worldwide incidence as high as 6.7% of children, febrile seizures are one of the most common reasons for seeking pediatric care, but the mechanisms underlying generation of febrile seizures are poorly understood. Febrile seizures have been suspected to have a genetic basis, and recently, mutations in GABAA receptor and sodium channel genes have been identified that are associated with febrile seizures and generalized seizures with febrile seizures plus pedigrees. Pentameric GABAA receptors mediate the majority of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain and are composed of combinations of alpha(1-6), beta(1-3), and gamma(1-3) subunits. In alphabetagamma2 GABAA receptors, the gamma2 subunit is critical for receptor trafficking, clustering, and synaptic maintenance, and mutations in the gamma2 subunit have been monogenically associated with autosomal dominant transmission of febrile seizures. Here, we report that whereas trafficking of wild-type alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors was slightly temperature dependent, trafficking of mutant alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors containing gamma2 subunit mutations [gamma2(R43Q), gamma2(K289M), and gamma2(Q351X)] associated with febrile seizures was highly temperature dependent. In contrast, trafficking of mutant alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors containing an alpha1 subunit mutation [alpha1(A322D)] not associated with febrile seizures was not highly temperature dependent. Brief increases in temperature from 37 to 40 degrees C rapidly (<10 min) impaired trafficking and/or accelerated endocytosis of heterozygous mutant alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors containing gamma2 subunit mutations associated with febrile seizures but not of wild-type alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors or heterozygous mutant alpha1(A322D)beta2gamma2 receptors, suggesting that febrile seizures may be produced by a temperature-induced dynamic reduction of susceptible mutant surface GABAA receptors in response to fever.",
