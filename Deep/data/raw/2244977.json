     "AB": "Rabbits were first given left cerebellar interpositus nucleus lesions followed by classical nictitating membrane (NM) conditioning using paired presentations of a tone conditioned stimulus and an air puff unconditioned stimulus. Multiple-unit hippocampal activity was monitored over the course of training. In rabbits with anterior interpositus lesions, the acquisition of learned responses and significant increases in training-related hippocampal activity were prevented when paired training was given to the left NM but not when training was switched to the right NM. Rabbits with lesions anterior to the interpositus or in surrounding cerebellar regions failed to show deficits in behavioral responding or hippocampal activity. These results indicate that acquisition of conditioning-related activity in the hippocampus depends on an intact interpositus nucleus of the cerebellum.",
