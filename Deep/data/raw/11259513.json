     "PG": "1949-54",
     "AB": "The selective NK(1) receptor antagonist, GR205,171 (2.5-40.0 mg/kg, i.p.), dose-dependently elevated dialysate levels of noradrenaline (NA), but not serotonin (5-HT), in the frontal cortex of freely moving rats. This action was exerted stereospecifically inasmuch as its less active isomer, GR226,206, was ineffective. In the dorsal hippocampus, GR205,171 (but not GR226,206) also significantly increased dialysate levels of NA, whereas levels of 5-HT were unaffected. Further, in anaesthetized rats, GR205,171 dose-dependently (1.0-4.0 mg/kg, i.v.) increased the firing rate of adrenergic perikarya in the locus coeruleus. In contrast, their activity was not modified by GR226,206. These findings indicate that selective blockade of NK(1) receptors enhances the activity of ascending adrenergic pathways in rats. Adrenergic mechanisms may, thus, be involved in the potential antidepressant and other functional properties of NK(1) receptor antagonists.",
