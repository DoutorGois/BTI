     "AB": "Action potential-independent spontaneous vesicular release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the CNS mediates miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) and exerts an important control on central excitability. Using dual-photon laser scan microscopy and hyperosmotic loading of the readily releasable vesicle pool with the fluorescent styryl dye FM1-43 in hippocampal slice, we demonstrate action potential-independent release of vesicles (fluorescence destaining) from proximal perisomatic, presumed GABAergic terminals and significant inhibition of this release by the specific GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol in the presence of tetrodotoxin and glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX and AP5. These data agree with reduction of mIPSCs by muscimol in whole-cell recordings from CA3 pyramidal neurons. In contrast, rate of vesicle release from distal, presumably glutamatergic terminals, was significantly lower and not changed by muscimol. The effect of muscimol on mIPSCs was not blocked but rather enhanced in the absence of external calcium. Our data directly demonstrate a potent disinhibitory reduction of GABA release by GABA(A) receptor activation. Those novel methods should be well suited to study pathophysiological changes in inhibition in resections obtained from neurosurgical treatment of epilepsy patients.",
