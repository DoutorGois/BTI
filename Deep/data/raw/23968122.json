     "AB": "PURPOSE: To detect the possible biochemical signs of inflammatory activation in the peripheral circulation in a rodent model of hippocampus irradiation, and to examine the effects of L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (GPC) in this experimental protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 40 Gy cobalt irradiation of both hemispheres of the hippocampus, with or without GPC treatment (50 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.), 5 min before the irradiation, n = 6, each). A third group (n = 6) served as saline-treated control. Blood samples were obtained 3 h after the end of irradiation in order to examine the changes in plasma histamine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1-beta, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 10 (IL-10); liver tissue samples were taken to determine adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations. RESULTS: The hepatic ATP levels were significantly declined, while plasma concentrations of circulating TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10 and histamine were significantly increased after hippocampus irradiation. GPC treatment significantly reduced the irradiation-induced release of cytokines and histamine, and the liver ATP level was maintained at the control value. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted brain irradiation produced measurable pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine changes in the systemic circulation. GPC supplementation provides significant protection against irradiation-induced peripheral pro-inflammatory activation and ATP depletion.",
