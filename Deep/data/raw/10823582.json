In the present study of these microencephalic rats (MAM rats) we used quantitative autoradiography to investigate [3H] paroxetine binding sites, which are a selective marker of serotonin (5-HT) transporters (5-HTT). The binding in the accumbens, cortex, hippocampus, and dorsolateral thalamus was significantly increased in MAM rats, compared to the control rats, while there was a significant decrease in the dorsal raphe nucleus of the MAM rats. The levels of 5-HTT mRNA in the dorsal raphe nuclei were analyzed by in situ hybridization, which revealed a significant decrease in 5-HTT mRNA-positive neurons in the MAM rats compared to the control rats. The results imply serotonergic hyperinnervation in the cerebral hemispheres of MAM rats, while a target-dependent secondary degeneration of 5-HT neurons might be induced in the dorsal raphe nuclei of MAM rats.",
