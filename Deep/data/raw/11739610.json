     "AB": "Attempts were made to label tachykinin NK2 binding sites in the adult rat brain using [125I]neurokinin A (NKA) as ligand in the presence of NK1 and NK3 agonist or antagonist to avoid labelling of NK1 and NK3 binding sites, respectively. A high-affinity, specifically NK2-sensitive, [125I]NKA-binding, temperature-dependent, reversible, sensitive to GTPgammaS and correspondence to a single population of binding sites (K(D) and B(max) values: 2.2 nM and 7.3 fmol/mg protein) was demonstrated on hippocampal membranes. Competition studies performed with tachykinins and tachykinin-related compounds indicated that the pharmacological properties of these NK2-sensitive [125I]NKA binding sites were identical to those identified in the rat urinary bladder and duodenum. NKA, neuropeptide K, and neuropeptide gamma, as well as the potent and selective NK2 antagonists SR 144190, SR 48968 and MEN 10627, presented a nanomolar affinity for these sites. The regional distribution of these NK2-sensitive [125I]NKA binding sites differs markedly from those of NK1 and NK3 binding sites, with the largest labeling being found in the hippocampus, the thalamus and the septum. Binding in other brain structures was low or negligible. A preliminary autoradiographic analysis confirmed [125I]NKA selective binding in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas, particularly, and in several thalamic nuclei.",
