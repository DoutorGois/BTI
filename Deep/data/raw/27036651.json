     "AB": "Exercise has benefit for perimenopause women in many ways, such as affective disorders. Our previous study has demonstrated that inflammation in hippocampus contributes to development of depression-like behavior in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Recently, oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been implicated to be involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior in rodents. We sought to investigate whether ovariectomy-induced depression-like behavior is associated with NLRP3 inflammasome activation in brain and the effect of exercise on NLRP3 inflammasome activation in this model. The results showed that ovariectomy resulted in depression-like behavior in mice and an increase in levels of IL-1beta and IL-18 in hippocampus. Exercise ameliorated the depression-like behavior and decreased levels of IL-1beta and IL-18 in hippocampus. The level of IL-1beta and IL-18 in hippocampus correlated to depression-like behavior in OVX mice. The levels of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1 P10 and CD11b in hippocampus were increased in OVX mice compared with control group. Exercise could reduce the levels of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1 P10 and CD11b in OVX mice. Our study suggests that NLRP3 inflammasome activation contribute to inflammation in hippocampus upon to deprivation of ovary. Exercise amelioration of depression-like behavior is associated with suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in hippocampus of this model.",
