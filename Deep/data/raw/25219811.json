     "AB": "The purpose of this critical review is to explore the controversy regarding the relationship between radiation dose to the neural progenitor cell (NPC) niches and patient outcomes, in terms of both toxicity and tumor control. NPCs in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampus are paradoxically associated with long-term neurocognitive sequelae of brain irradiation, as well as resistance to therapy and tumor recurrence. The reconciliation of these somewhat opposing functions is challenging. Current literature suggests that radiation and other treatments against the NPC in the hippocampus and the SVZ may influence patient outcome. As a result, both the SVZ and the hippocampus could have important implications on radiation treatment planning strategies, and future laboratory and clinical evaluations will be critical in designing studies to optimize treatment outcome, effectiveness, and safety.",
