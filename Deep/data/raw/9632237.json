     "AB": "The effects of denervation of central noradrenergic system on the interpartner relationships of adult cats were examined in a predatory test in the competitive situation for paired animals. Direct administration of the noradrenaline neurotoxin, N-2-chloroethyl-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4 12 microg) into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) of submissive cats changed previously established dominant-submissive relationship. Biochemical analysis demonstrated a significant reduction of noradrenaline (NA) concentration in the hypothalamus (AH), amygdala (AM), hippocampus (HC), and frontal cortex (CTX), and elevation of NA content in the midbrain central gray matter (CG) in MFB-lesioned cats. Simultaneously, DSP-4-induced lesions exerted significant decrease of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol (MHPG) content in AH, CG, HC and CTX, and increased GABA level in AH, CG, AM, and HC. These results suggest that a coincident decrease of NA metabolism and increase of GABA metabolism led to fear drive reduction.",
