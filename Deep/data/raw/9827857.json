     "AB": "Two-dimensional neuronal networks were formed using a dissociated culture of rat hippocampal neurons on glass plates. Neural activity in response to pulse stimuli applied to the neurons by whole-cell clamp electrodes was observed with a 128-channel optical recording apparatus using a voltage-sensitive dye, RH482. Dendrites emerging from the somata of single neurons were classified according to two signal-transmission properties, those with lower conduction velocities (0.12+/-0.034 m/s, n=24) and those with very fast conduction velocity (faster than 1.0 m/s), by evaluating the conduction velocities of pulse responses. The distinction between these two properties seemed to be related to the morphological differences in input connectivity with the axons of neighboring neurons.",
