     "AB": "Spectral analysis of activity in a number of brain structures (sensorimotor, visual and auditory cortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, medial central nucleus of the thalamus) was performed during the sleep-waking cycle in Krushinskii-Molodkina rats, which have an inherited predisposition to audiogenic convulsions; studies were performed on the background of the long-lasting, stable decrease in the level of convulsive readiness seen in these animals after multiple generalized audiogenic tonic-clonic convulsive seizures. The results showed that the decrease in the sensitivity of the rats to the convulsive action of sound correlates with a decrease in the intensity of the theta rhythm and an increase in alpha waves on the electroencephalogram in the state of calm waking. Possible rearrangements of the functioning of ascending brain systems in conditions of stable reductions in reactivity to sound after multiple convulsive seizures are discussed.",
