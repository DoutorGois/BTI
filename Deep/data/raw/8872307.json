     "AB": "The synaptotagmins together with other vesicle proteins are thought to be essential for the docking and/or fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane that occurs following depolarization and calcium influx in presynatic terminals. Syt4, the fourth identified member of the synaptotagmin family, is inducible in PC12 cells by depolarization and secretagogues, and in limbic regions of the adult rat brain by kainic acid-induced seizures. In the present study, we examined the time course of the seizure-induced changes in the expression of Syt4 and Syt1, both in adult animals and during the postnatal period. Syt4 was transiently induced in several structures of the adult rat brain following seizure activity with peak inductions between 4 and 8 h and overal return to control values by 30 h. No induction was observed following seizure activity in 7-day-old animals. The brain regions most sensitive to increased induction were, in decreasing order of sensitivity, hippocampal pyramidal cells dentate granule cells and piriform cortex pyramidal cells. The brain areas showing the greatest Syt4 stimulation in adults were also the areas in which Syt4 was induced by seizures earlier in development. In contrast, Syt1 mRNA was depressed in adult brains following seizure activity, particularly in the dentate granule cells. Our results suggest that the differential regulation of different synaptotagmin genes following excessive neuronal activity might participate in rapid adaptation of subsequent transmitter release.",
