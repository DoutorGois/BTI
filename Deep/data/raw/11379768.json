     "AB": "We examined the effects of paeoniflorin on adenosine A1 receptor-mediated memory disturbance in the mouse passive avoidance test and inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. The pretraining administration of the selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) significantly impaired the retention performance determined 24 h after the training test. The intraperitoneal injections of paeoniflorin and the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) significantly attenuated the deficit in retention performance caused by CPA. The in vitro studies revealed that adenosine (1 and 10 microM) dose dependently reduced both the population spike (PS) amplitudes and the tetanic stimulation-induced LTP in the hippocampus. DPCPX, at the concentration (0.1 microM) that had no effect on PS amplitudes or LTP induction, significantly reversed the suppressive effects of adenosine on both indices. Paeoniflorin also dose dependently reversed 10 microM adenosine-induced suppression of LTP but had no effect on PS reduced by adenosine. These results suggest that paeoniflorin ameliorates memory disruption mediated by adenosine A1 receptor and that modulation of adenosine-mediated inhibition of LTP in the hippocampus is implicated in its beneficial effect on learning and memory impairment in rodents.",
