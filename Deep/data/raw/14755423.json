     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Changes in the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytriptamine (5-HT) are related to psychiatric diseases such as depression and anxiety. In this study, 5-HT autofluorescence properties were investigated in solution and in biological tissues. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spectrofluorometric characterization was performed on ex vivo samples (tissue sections, homogenates) of the 5-HT-rich brain region hippocampus from rats untreated or treated to affect endogenous 5-HT levels; in vivo, with a 50 solidus in circle optic fiber probe positioned via stereotaxis. RESULTS: 5-HT exhibited minor excitation and emission bands at wavelengths longer than the well known excitation and emission bands in the UV region, 250-320 nm. Spectrofluorometric measurements under 366 nm excitation on homogenates supplied with 5-HT or belonging to treated rats revealed spectral alterations attributable to changes in the amount of 5-HT. Ex vivo and in vivo autofluorescence data were consistent with those obtained by conventional voltammetry. CONCLUSIONS: Autofluorescence spectroscopy potential is confirmed as a suitable technique for the direct measurement of neurotransmitters.",
