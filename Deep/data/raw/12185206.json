     "AB": "We examined the distribution of annexin 6 (ANX6) in rat brain with immunohistochemistry (IHC). Several neuronal cell populations were intensely labeled with the ANX6 monoclonal antibody (MAb), including layer 5 of neocortex, the lateral septum, the lateral hypothalamic area, the red nucleus, and the Purkinje cell layer in cerebellum. Neuronal immunolabeling was localized to the nucleus and the cytosol. Darkly stained ANX6-immunoreactive glia, with the morphology characteristic of astrocytes, were abundant in the hippocampus, substantia nigra reticulata, and cerebellum. Evidence suggests that ANX6 may function in neuronal and glial calcium-dependent processes.",
