     "AB": "Intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured by laser scanning confocal microscope, using Ca2+ indicator Fluo-3 in cultured hippocampal CA1 neurons isolated from newborn rat. The results showed that acute anoxia induced a rapid increase of [Ca2+]i in hippocampal CA1 neurons, and this increase could be attenuated by 100 mumol/L adenosine significantly. This effect of adenosine could be suppressed by adenosine A1 receptor antagonist CPT or potassium channel blockers, 4-AP and glipizide. These results suggest that adenosine activates 4-AP- or ATP-sensitive potassium channels through A1 receptors, and consequently inhibits the [Ca2+]i elevation in hippocampal neurons during anoxia.",
