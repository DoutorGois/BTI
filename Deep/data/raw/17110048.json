     "AB": "Neurotransmitter transporters play an important role in the control of synaptic transmission by ensuring the clearance of transmitters liberated in the synaptic cleft. In the case of monoaminergic neurotransmitters, this clearance is carried out by high-affinity reuptake transporters located in the plasma membrane of the presynaptic terminals. Recently plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT), a transporter from the SLC29 (equilibrative nucleoside transporter) family, was shown to transport in vitro monoaminergic neurotransmitters, in particular dopamine and serotonin, nearly as efficiently as the high-affinity transporters. This transporter, well expressed in CNS, represents an interesting candidate for the control and modulation of aminergic pathways. We performed an extensive study of the distribution of PMAT in the rat brain. Our results highlight PMAT expression in brain regions which play a pivotal role in significant CNS functions and human neuropathologies. Using in situ hybridization immunohistochemistry co-labeling, PMAT mRNA was found in various neuron subtypes, including glutamatergic neurons of the hippocampus, mitral cells of the olfactory bulbs and GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and hypothalamus. Paradoxically, rat PMAT mRNA was found in some but not all monoaminergic nuclei. It was on the contrary predominantly expressed in major cholinergic groups throughout the brain, including brainstem motor nuclei, components of the basal forebrain cholinergic system and cholinergic interneurons of the striatum. These systems, implicated in locomotion, associative and spatial memory and reward-related learning, are disrupted at early stages of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Taken together, our observations support a role for PMAT in monoamine uptake in cholinergic neurons.",
