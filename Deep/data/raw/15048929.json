     "AB": "Arc, activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated gene, is an immediate early gene, and its expression is regulated by a variety of stimuli, such as electric stimulation and methamphetamine. The function of Arc, however, is unknown. To explore this function, we carried out expression experiments by transfecting green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Arc constructs or by using a protein transduction system in hippocampal cultured neurons. We found that the overexpression of Arc as well as Arc induction by seizure in vivo decreased microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) staining in the dendrites by immunocytochemistry, although MAP2 content was not changed on Western blot. Furthermore, Arc interacted with newly polymerized microtubules and MAP2, leading to blocking of the epitope of MAP2. The data suggest that Arc increased by synaptic activities would trigger dendritic remodeling by interacting with cytoskeletal proteins.",
