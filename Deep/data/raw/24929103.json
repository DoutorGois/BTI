     "AB": "Oligomeric amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been found to be associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous studies have reported Abeta neurotoxicity, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully illuminated. In the present study, we investigated the Abeta-induced activation and regulation of P38MAPKs in rat hippocampus in vivo. The results showed that intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric Abeta25-35 increased the activation (phosphorylation) of P38MAPKs, and the level of cleaved caspase-3, but decreased the number of neurons in rat hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields. Downregulation of P38MAPK activity by SB239063 protected against the Abeta neurotoxicity. Pretreatment with NMDA and non-NMDA receptor antagonists respectively suppressed P38MAPK activation induced by Abeta25-35 oligomers and presented neuroprotective effect. Taken together, these data suggest that P38MAPK activation via NMDA and non-NMDA receptors is a key signal cascade in Abeta-induced neuronal death. Inhibition of P38MAPK cascades may be a promising treatment in AD.",
