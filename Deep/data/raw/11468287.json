     "AB": "In hippocampus endocannabinoids modulate synaptic function and plasticity and increase tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Autophosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-397 is generally a critical step for its activation, allowing the recruitment of Src family kinases, and phosphorylation of FAK and associated proteins. We have examined the mechanisms of the regulation of FAK by cannabinoids in rat and mouse hippocampal slices. Anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, two endocannabinoids, and Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK+6,7, a neuronal splice isoform of FAK, on several residues including Tyr-397. Cannabinoids increased phosphorylation of p130-Cas, a protein associated with FAK, but had no effect on PYK2, a tyrosine kinase related to FAK and enriched in hippocampus. Pharmacological experiments and the use of knockout mice demonstrated that the effects of cannabinoids were mediated through CB1 receptors. These effects were sensitive to manipulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, suggesting that they were mediated by inhibition of a cAMP pathway. PP2, an Src family kinase inhibitor, prevented the effects of cannabinoids on p130-Cas and on FAK+6,7 tyrosines 577 and 925, but not 397, indicating that FAK autophosphorylation was upstream of Src family kinases in response to CB1-R stimulation. Endocannabinoids increased the association of Fyn, but not Src, with FAK+6,7. In hippocampal slices from Fyn -/- mice, the levels of p130-Cas were increased, and the effects of endocannabinoids on tyrosine phosphorylation, including of Tyr-397, were completely abolished. These results demonstrate the specific functional association of Fyn with FAK+6,7 in a pathway regulated by endocannabinoids, in which Fyn may play roles dependent and independent of its catalytic activity.",
