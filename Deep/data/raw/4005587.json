     "AB": "Cell suspensions from the fetal septal region were injected stereotaxically into the hippocampus of fornix-fimbria-transected adult rats. The host rats were sacrificed up to 3 months after the operation and the hippocampus sliced into 350 microns transverse slices. Intracellular recording was made from CA1 neurons adjacent to the graft. Electrical stimulation of the graft produced a voltage-dependent depolarization in some recorded neurons. This was associated with an increase in spontaneous and anodal break action potential discharges. In addition, a slow after-hyperpolarization (AHP) which typically follows a burst discharge was blocked during the depolarization indicating that the stimulation may block a Ca2+-dependent K+ current. The effects of the stimulation were antagonized by atropine. A response to the stimulation was seen 2 weeks but not 1 week after grafting. Over time, cells that were located away from the graft became activated by the stimulation. This was correlated with the extent of proliferation of acetylcholinesterase-containing fibers around the graft. These results suggest that grafted septal neurons make viable cholinergic connections with a host hippocampus.",
