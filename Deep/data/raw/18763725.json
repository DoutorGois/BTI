     "AB": "The prevalent theory in learning and memory processes is that they are underlain by short and long-term changes in synaptic weight, which continuously modulates neural networks during acquisition and recall. This synaptic plasticity has been revealed by recording extracellular field potentials. The enhancement of synaptic transmission was primarily noted in the hippocampus and was named long-term potentiation (LTP). The opposite mechanism, long-term depression (LTD), a reduction of synaptic transmission, was first discovered in the cerebellum. Since then, the LTP-model has been studied mainly using in vitro and acute anesthetized in vivo preparations. This approach has led to remarkable progress in the comprehension of intracellular molecular processes during LTP and LTD. In this review, we focus mainly on what we can learn about molecular events using extracellular field potential recordings with a more ecological model, i.e., studies using the freely behaving animal, with animals that are genetically modified or not, in several behavioral paradigms aimed at gaining insight into some of the conflicting results obtained with in vitro and in vivo preparations.",
