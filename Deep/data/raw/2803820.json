     "AB": "We reported a case with bilateral necrosis of the basal ganglia after hypotensive shocks. The patient was a 69-year-old woman, who fell into a hypotensive shock (B.P. below 40 mmHg) of unknown origin during examination of her bladder cancer and was admitted into CCU. After admission, hypotensive shocks were repeated four times (B.P. below 50 mmHg each time). Neurological examination revealed a left spastic hemiplegia. Brain CT on 10th day showed bilaterally low density areas around the basal ganglia and a diagnosis of brain infarction was made. She gradually presented quadriplegia and symptomatic changes from pyramidal to extrapyramidal signs. Brain CT on 24th day showed bilateral hemorrhagic infarction of the basal ganglia with enhanced effect. On 79th day, she again fell into shock and died. Neuropathological examination of the brain was as follows. 1) laminar necrosis of the deep layers of the cerebral cortex, 2) bilateral necrosis of the hippocampal Sommer sector, 3) bilateral necrosis of the caudate nucleus, putamen and pallidum with neuronal loss and infiltration of fat granule cells, 4) sparing of the internal capsules, 5) bilateral necrosis of the reticular zone of the substantia nigra, 6) foci of fresh necrosis and loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. These lesions are consistent with those of selective vulnerability in hypoxia as described by Scholz et al. An extensive distribution of cerebral as well as basal ganglia necrosis in this case was caused by repeated shocks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
