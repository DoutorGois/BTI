     "AB": "The femtomolar-acting protective peptide NAP (NAPVSIPQ), derived from activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), is broadly neuroprotective in vivo and in vitro in cerebral cortical cultures and a variety of cell lines. In the present study, we have extended previous results and examined the protective potential of NAP in primary rat hippocampal cultures, using microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) as a measure for neuroprotection. Results showed that NAP, at femtomolar concentrations, completely protected against oxygen-glucose deprivation, and cyanide poisoning. Furthermore, NAP partially protected against kainic acid excitotoxicity. In summary, we have significantly expanded previous findings in demonstrating here direct neuroprotective effects for NAP on vital hippocampal neurons that are key participants in cognitive function in vivo.",
