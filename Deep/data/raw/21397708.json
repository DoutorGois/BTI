     "AB": "Post-extinction exposure of rats to a sub-conditioning procedure can evoke conditioned fear, which may correspond to fear return and/or fear learning potentiation. The aim of the present study was to clarify this issue and examine the effects of tetanic stimulation of the hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), two brain regions implicated in post-extinction modulation of conditioned fear. Rats were initially submitted to five tone-shock pairings with either a 0.7-mA or 0.1-mA shock. Tone-evoked freezing was observed only with the higher shock intensity, indicating that the 0.1-mA shock corresponded to a sub-conditioning procedure. All conditioned rats underwent fear extinction with 20 tone-alone trials. When retrained with the sub-conditioning procedure, they displayed again tone-evoked freezing, except when the initial tone was unpaired or a new tone was paired with the 0.1-mA shock, demonstrating fear return rather than fear learning potentiation. We also found that HPC and mPFC tetanic stimulations, applied 24h after the sub-conditioning procedure, similarly reduced this fear return. However, mPFC inactivation abolished temporary HPC tetanus effect, whereas HPC inactivation did not interfere with mPFC tetanus effect. These data confirm our previous findings and reveal the nature of HPC-mPFC interactions in post-extinction modulation of conditioned fear.",
