     "AB": "Aging is accompanied by the loss of memory and cognitive functions. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway has been shown to play an essential role in synaptic plasticity and memory. Although a reduction in basal ERK1/2 activity has been found in the cerebral cortex in aged rats, changes in ERK1/2 mRNA expression during aging have not been described. In this study, we investigated age differences in the mRNA expression of ERK2 in different brain regions of male Fisher 344 rats (three age-groups) using quantitative in situ hybridization. No age-dependent changes in ERK2 mRNA were detected in the cerebellum or cortical areas. However, in the hippocampus, a 20% decline in mRNA levels was observed in the CA3 region in the 12-month-old group as compared to the 3-month-old group. These results suggest that the impairment in ERK1/2 activity observed during aging is probably not regulated at the gene expression level.",
