     "AB": "Despite convergent evidence indicating a variety of regional abnormalities of hemispheric asymmetry in schizophrenia, patterns of wider neural network asymmetry remain to be determined. In this study, we investigated alterations in hemispheric white matter topology in schizophrenia and their association with clinical manifestations of the illness. Weighted hemispheric brain anatomical networks were constructed for each of 116 right-handed patients with schizophrenia and 66 matched healthy participants. Graph theoretical approaches were then employed to estimate the hemispheric topological properties. We found that although small-world properties were preserved in the hemispheric network, a significant hemispheric-independent deficit of global integration was found in schizophrenia. Furthermore, a significant group-by-hemisphere interaction was revealed in the characteristic path length and global efficiency, attributing to significantly reduced hemispheric asymmetry of global integration in patients compared with healthy controls. Specifically, we found reduced asymmetric nodal efficiency in several frontal regions and the hippocampus. Finally, the abnormal hemispheric asymmetry of brain anatomical network topology was associated with clinical features (duration of illness and psychotic psychopathology) in patients. Our findings provide new insights into lateralized nature of hemispheric dysconnectivity and highlight the potential for using brain network measures of hemispheric asymmetry as neural biomarkers for schizophrenia and its clinical features.",
