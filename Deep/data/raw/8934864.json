     "AB": "It is argued in this article that information-processing models enable us to link psychotic phenomena to their neural bases. The core abnormality is viewed as a disturbance in the integration of sensory input with stored material. The performance of schizophrenic subjects on tasks derived from both animal learning theory and human experimental psychology is consistent with the model. The way in which such a disturbance relates to schizophrenic symptoms is outlined. It may result from an abnormality at one or more points in the neural circuit responsible for generating predictions of subsequent sensory input; in particular the hippocampus and related brain structures are implicated. The potential relevance of the model for psychological intervention is discussed.",
