     "AB": "Studies on the neurobiology of nerve growth factor (NGF) reveal a diverse range of actions. Through alterations in gene expression, NGF is important in maintaining and regulating the phenotype of neurons that express the high-affinity receptor, trkA. Nerve growth factor also has a rapid action, revealed by its role in pain signaling in bladder and in skin. In the central nervous system (CNS), NGF has an intimate relationship with the cholinergic system. It promotes cholinergic neuron survival after experimental injury but also maintains and regulates the phenotype of uninjured cholinergic neurons. In addition to these effects mediated by gene expression, NGF has a rapid neurotransmitter-like action to regulate cholinergic neurotransmission and neuronal excitability. Consistent with its actions on the cholinergic system, NGF can enhance function in animals with cholinergic lesions and has been proposed to be useful in humans with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the problems of CNS delivery and of side effects (particularly pain) limit the clinical efficacy of NGF. Drug treatment strategies to enhance production of NGF in the CNS may be useful in the treatment of AD. Nicotine is one such agent, which, when administered directly to the hippocampus in rats, produces long-lasting elevation of NGF production.",
