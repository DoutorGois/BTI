     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: The present study was designed to investigate the effect of Essentiale L, a mixture of polyenylphospholipids from soybeans, on oxidative stress in various brain regions, on erythrocytes (RBC) and on RBC membrane composition in ethanol-administered rats. METHODS: Adult male albino rats of body weight 150-170 g were divided into four groups and administered either isocaloric glucose (5 g/kg body weight/day) or ethanol (6 g/kg body weight/day) through oral gavage. Essentiale L was administered to a set of ethanol-fed rats and the control rats at a dosage of 300 mg/kg body weight/day through oral gavage. The treatment protocol was carried out for 45 days. At the end of the experimental period, the animals were sacrificed, and the biochemical parameters related to the lipid profile, oxidative stress and thiol status were assayed in the brain regions, RBC and RBC membrane. RESULTS: Ethanol administration resulted in increased levels of lipid peroxidation products in RBC and different brain regions, such as the cortex, cerebellum, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus, and depletion of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants and alterations in oxidised glutathione/glutathione (GSSG/GSH) ratio and thiol groups (protein-bound and total), signifying oxidative stress. Ethanol-treated rats also showed significant alterations in protein content and lipid composition in RBC membranes. Significant differences in the relative proportions of hexose, hexosamine and sialic acid of the membranes were observed. Administration of Essentiale L prevented all the alterations induced by ethanol and returned their levels to near-normal. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Essentiale L, a therapeutic adjunct for liver diseases, also has bioprotective effects on nonhepatic tissues and cells.",
