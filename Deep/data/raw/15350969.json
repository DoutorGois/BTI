     "AB": "Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) upregulates Fas death receptor expression in the brain, and alterations in expression and activity of Fas signaling intermediates occur in neonatal brain injury. B6.MRL-Tnfrsf6(lpr) mice lacking functional Fas death receptors are protected from HI brain damage in cortex, striatum, and thalamus compared to wild-type mice. Expression of Fas death receptor and active caspases increase in the cortex after HI. In wild-type mice, the hippocampus is most severely injured, and the hippocampus is the only region not protected in the B6.MRL-Tnfrsf6(lpr) mice. The selective vulnerability of the hippocampus to injury correlates with (1) lower basal expression of [Fas-associated death-domain-like IL-1beta-converting enzyme]-inhibitory protein (FLIP), (2) increased degradation of spectrin to its 145 or 150 kDa breakdown product, and (3) a higher percentage of non-apoptotic cell death following neonatal HI. We conclude that Fas signaling via both extrinsic and intrinsic caspase cascades causes brain injury following neonatal HI in a region-dependent manner. Basal levels of endogenous decoy proteins may modulate the response to Fas death receptor signaling and provide a novel approach to understanding mechanisms of neonatal brain injury.",
