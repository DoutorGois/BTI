     "AB": "Atypical isoforms of protein kinase C (aPKCs; particularly protein kinase M zeta: PKMzeta) have been hypothesized to be necessary and sufficient for the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long term memory by maintaining postsynaptic AMPA receptors via the GluA2 subunit. A myristoylated PKMzeta pseudosubstrate peptide (ZIP) blocks PKMzeta activity. We examined the actions of ZIP in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus in associative recognition memory in rats during early memory formation and memory maintenance. ZIP infusion in either hippocampus or mPFC impaired memory maintenance. However, early memory formation was impaired by ZIP in mPFC but not hippocampus; and blocking GluA2-dependent removal of AMPA receptors did not affect this impairment caused by ZIP in the mPFC. The findings indicate: (i) a difference in the actions of ZIP in hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, and (ii) a GluA2-independent target of ZIP (possibly PKClambda) in the mPFC during early memory formation.",
