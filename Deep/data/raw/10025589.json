     "AB": "The presence of an inwardly-rectifying Cl- current was studied in hippocampal CA1 neurones using sharp intracellular microelectrodes. Following pharmacological block of the hyperpolarization-activated Ih current, a slow depolarizing sag of hyperpolarizing electrotonic potentials appeared when the microelectrode contained KCI or CsCl, but was absent with K acetate; the sag threshold was approximately 10 mV negative to rest. Under voltage clamp, slow inward current relaxations were observed on stepping to potentials between -80 and -130 mV; the activation time constant decreased with increasing hyperpolarization (>1 s at -130 mV). This conductance (termed G(Cl,slow)) was partially depressed by 100 microM Zn2+. We propose that G(Cl,slow) can contribute significantly to the resting conductance of adult hippocampal CA1 neurones only when they are loaded with Cl- via the recording electrode.",
