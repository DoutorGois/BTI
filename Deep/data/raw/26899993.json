     "AB": "We here explore the utility of a paradigm that allows the simultaneous assessment of memory for object (what) and object location (where) and their comparative predominance. Two identical objects are presented during a familiarity trial; during the test trial one of these is displaced, and a new object is presented in a familiar location. When tested 5 or 80min later, rats explored both the novel and the displaced objects more than two familiar stationary objects, indicating intact memory for both, object and place. When tested 24h later rats explored the novel object more than the displaced familiar one, suggesting that forgetting differently influenced object and place memory, with memory for object being more robust than memory for place. Animals that received post-trial administration of the neurokinin-3 receptor agonist senktide and were tested 24h later, now explored the novel and displaced objects equally, suggesting that the treatment prevented the selective decay of memory for location. Next, animals received NMDA lesions in either the perirhinal cortex or the hippocampus, which are hypothesized to be preferentially involved in memory for objects and memory for place, respectively. When tested 5 or 80min later, the perirhinal cortex lesion group explored the displaced object more, indicating relatively deficient object memory, while the hippocampal lesion led to the opposite pattern, demonstrating comparatively deficient place memory. These results suggest different preferential engagement of the perirhinal cortex and hippocampus in their processing of memory for object and place. This preference test lends itself to application in the comparison of selective lesions of neural sites and projection systems as well as to the assessment of possible preferential action of pharmacological agents on neurochemical processes that subserve object vs place learning.",
