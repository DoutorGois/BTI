     "AB": "The effect of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) on synapse formation was investigated using rat cultured hippocampal neurons. Treatment with FGF-2 (0.4-10 ng/mL) for 6 days enhanced synaptogenesis on these neurons by approximately 50%, as determined by counting puncta immunostained for presynaptic- or postsynaptic-specific proteins. This enhancement was statistically significant, and was abolished by a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The majority of neurons expressed FGF receptors (types 1-3) abundantly on the membrane of somata, dendrites, and growth cones, and in these regions phosphorylation of MAPK was enhanced after FGF-2 application. Furthermore, our experiments showed that the majority of synapses formed in cultures containing FGF-2 were positive both for presynaptic proteins and postsynaptic excitatory synapse-specific proteins, and that these synapses had a similar capacity to recycle the fluorescent styryl dye FM4-64 as those in the control culture. These results indicate that: (i) FGF-2 increases excitatory synapses on hippocampal neurons by activating MAPK activity through FGF receptors; and (ii) synapses formed in FGF-2-treated culture are capable of cycling vesicles.",
