     "AB": "The production and localization of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in the brain following focal brain injury were examined. Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect PAF in the rat brain with cold-induced local brain injury. After cold injury, immediate-early PAF staining was observed within the cold lesion followed later by immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral white matter. PAF immunoreactivity was also clearly seen both in cortical neurons adjacent to the cold lesion and in the ipsilateral hippocampus which showed delayed neuronal degeneration. The data suggest that PAF synthesis occurs in the neuronal cells in the perilesional area and hippocampus as well as within the cold lesion site during the early stages of cold-induced brain injury. PAF expression may contribute to the onset and progression of further brain damage, such as delayed axotomy and delayed neuronal loss.",
