     "AB": "We examined the protective effect of growth inhibitory factor (GIF) against zinc-induced neuronal death in rat hippocampal neurons. In an in vitro cell culture system, 300 microM Zn(2+) readily induced death of hippocampal neuronal cells, which was characterized by massive necrosis and a minor degree of apoptosis. Neither the addition of recombinant GIF nor Rab3A alone could rescue these cells from death. However, the combination of GIF with Rab3A could significantly enhance the survival of the hippocampal neurons. This result was supported by both Annexin -V FITC/propidium dual staining and chromosomal DNA analysis. These findings suggest that GIF may inhibit Zn(2+)-induced neuronal death via its interaction with Rab3A.",
