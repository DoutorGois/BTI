     "AB": "The importance of space-specific single-unit activity for hippocampal formation (HF)-mediated learning and memory in rodents has been extensively studied, yet little is known about how the unit findings in rodents generalize to other vertebrate species. We report a first assessment of the space-specific single-unit activity recorded from the HF of homing pigeons as they moved through a plus maze for food reward. Rate maps of pigeon HF single-unit activity typically revealed multiple regions (2-5 per cell) of increased activity (on average, 2.5 times higher than other regions of the maze) that in 27% of slow-firing cells was reliably space-specific over time. The qualitative appearance of rate maps and the degree of spatial-specificity observed for most all pigeon HF cells suggests more modest space-specific activity than typically reported for rat hippocampal cells. The nature of space-specific activity in the pigeon HF includes (1) often transiently reliable regions of increased activity for many cells, (2) multiple patches of activity that were sometimes observed in analogous maze areas, and (3) cells displaying substantial decreases in firing rate between baseline and maze-run conditions that could not be explained by a simple relationship between firing rate and a pigeon's speed. These observations suggest that pigeon HF cells may be coding for an unspecified behavioral/motivational/environmental factors in addition to a pigeon's momentary location. The data further suggest that the spatial ecology and evolutionary history of different species may be a critical feature shaping how HF neurons capture properties of space.",
