     "AB": "d-AP159 is a d-optical isomer, and in rats it has a high affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptors and potent anticonflict activity, equal to that of buspirone. The anticonflict effects of d-AP159 and buspirone were investigated in animals in which lesions of the serotonergic neurons were caused by intradorsal raphe (d-RA) injection of the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT). The anticonflict effect of buspirone, but not that of d-AP159, was attenuated in 5-HT neuron-lesioned rats. The anticonflict effect of d-AP159 injected into various brain sites was also studied. d-AP159 and buspirone microinjected into the d-RA caused significant anticonflict activity in rats. There was a significant anticonflict effect of d-AP159 injected into the amygdala centralis (ACE), but not the dorsal hippocampus (d-HC). The anticonflict effect of d-AP159 injected into the d-RA was antagonized by systemic administration of (-)propranolol but not Ro 15-1788. This effect of d-AP159 injected into the ACE was antagonized by systematic administration of Ro 15-1788 but not (-)propranolol. These results suggest that the d-RA and the ACE play important roles in the anticonflict effects of d-AP159 but that the mechanisms by which this drug acts at these sites are different.",
