     "AB": "CITED2 is implicated in the modulating the activity of HIF-1 which is a major transcription factor involved in ischemia-related gene expression. Following transient forebrain ischemia, we found that CITED2 was induced in a subset of brain regions including dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation and piriform cortex. Because CITED2 was not induced in cultured neurons exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation, we concluded that hypoxia is not sufficient to trigger its induction.",
