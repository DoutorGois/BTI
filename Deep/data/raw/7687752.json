     "AB": "Bath application of the muscarinic receptor agonist, muscarine, produced a concentration-dependent depression of synaptic activity in the dentate gyrus of hippocampal slices. A concentration of 10 microM muscarine produced a reversible depression that could be competitively antagonized by the muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine. However, other muscarinic receptor subtype (M1-M3) antagonists could also block the effects of muscarine. The rank order of antagonist potency was: 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methiodide (M3/M1 antagonist) > pirenzepine (M1) > AFDX-116 (M2). The depression produced by 10 microM muscarine was not affected by in vivo pretreatment with pertussis toxin, and therefore was not mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. In addition, high concentrations of muscarine did not affect either basal or isoproterenol-stimulated accumulation of cyclic AMP from slices of dentate gyrus. Muscarine also produced a concentration-dependent blockade of the induction of norepinephrine-induced long-lasting potentiation in the dentate gyrus. Norepinephrine-induced long-lasting potentiation is a form of long-lasting plasticity induced in medial perforant path synapses by beta-adrenergic agonists such as isoproterenol. The muscarinic blockade of norepinephrine-induced long-lasting potentiation was also prevented by pretreatment with pirenzepine. Based on these pharmacological data, we conclude that muscarinic depression of evoked responses, as well as blockade of norepinephrine-induced long-lasting potentiation, involves activation of either M3 or M1, but not M2, muscarinic receptors. These data also demonstrate that in addition to modulating normal synaptic transmission, muscarinic receptors may also play an important role in modulating synaptic plasticity.",
