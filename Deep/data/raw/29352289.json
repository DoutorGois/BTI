     "AB": "To investigate the molecular mechanisms of sub-acutely aging and demonstrate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) at the Guanyuan (CV 4), Zusanli (ST 36) and Baihui (DU 20) acupoint on the sub-acutely aging brain, cDNA microarrays and bioinformatics analyses were carried out. Thirty Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats were selected and randomly divided into three groups: the control group (C), the sub-acutely aging model group (M) and the electroacupuncture group (M+EA). Sub-acutely aging model rats were obtained by D-galactose s.c. injection continuously for 40 days. Total RNA was extracted from the hippocampus area of brains in three groups for cDNA microarrays. The data of different groups were compared and analyzed by differential expression analysis, Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and quantitative real-time PCR. According to the results, 4052 DE genes were identified in our study. Among them, there were 3079 differentially expressed (DE) genes between group M and group C, and these genes are associated with the aging of rats. Moreover, 983 genes were expressed differently in group M+EA compared with group M, revealing that points stimuli could regulate gene expression in brain with aging. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment and KEGG enrichment were performed to further classify the differential expression genes. Important GO terms and KEGG pathways connected with sub-acutely aging EA effects were identified. At last, 3 significant differentially expressed genes were selected for real-time quantitative PCR to clarify the cDNA microarray results. In conclusion, the cDNA microarray data first compared and analyzed the differences of gene expression profile in the hippocampus of rats in different groups, which contribute to our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of EA towards sub-acutely aging.",
