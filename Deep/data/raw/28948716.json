     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Emerging evidence shows that fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF22) plays a critical role in the etiology of depression. However, the molecular mechanisms of FGF22 are not fully comprehended. Here, the effect of FGF22 in depression and its relationship with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) were investigated in clinical, animal, and cell experiments. METHODS: Serum from depressive patients was collected, and the levels of FGF22 and IL-1beta were analyzed by ELISA. The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model was established, and primary hippocampal neuronal cells were cultured to examine changes in FGF22 and IL-1beta levels in rat hippocampus. RESULTS: The results revealed a negative correlation between serum FGF22 levels and serum IL-1beta levels. The expression of IL-1beta in the CUMS rat hippocampus decreased, and the apoptosis of hippocampal cells improved after the injection of lentiviral vector-mediated FGF22 (LV-FGF22). Further tests in primary hippocampal neuronal cells also showed a reduction in IL-1beta and the cell apoptosis rate after treatment with FGF22. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the results revealed that FGF22 plays a role in alleviating depression, which may be mediated by reduced expression of IL-1beta.",
