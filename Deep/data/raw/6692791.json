     "AB": "Male rats were exposed to lead from parturition through weaning. When subjected to electrical hippocampal kindling as adults, although there were no alterations in the kindling rates, lead-treated animals were found to differ from controls in several other respects. In contrast to controls, lead-treated animals did not show an increase in afterdischarge (AD) duration with kindling, and the power spectrum of the AD did not shift to a higher peak frequency. There was a clear dose-related effect of lead on the spectra of the kindled AD, which in lead-treated groups was characterized by greater power in the low-frequency bands. These data indicate that long-lasting dysfunction can occur following a brief neonatal lead exposure. Power spectral techniques may be useful for future studies in neurotoxicology and epilepsy.",
