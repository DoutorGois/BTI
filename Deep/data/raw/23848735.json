     "AB": "We study the stable phases of an attractor neural network model, with binary units, for hippocampal place cells encoding one-dimensional (1D) or 2D spatial maps or environments. Different maps correspond to random allocations (permutations) of the place fields. Based on replica calculations we show that, below critical levels for the noise in the neural response and for the number of environments, the network activity is spatially localized in one environment. For high noise and loads the network activity extends over space, either uniformly or with spatial heterogeneities due to the crosstalk between the maps, and memory of environments is lost. Remarkably the spatially localized regime is very robust against the neural noise until it reaches its critical level. Numerical simulations are in excellent quantitative agreement with our theoretical predictions.",
