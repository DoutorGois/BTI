     "AB": "The organization and distribution of the mRNA for the putative vesicular transporter for acetylcholine (VAChT) was studied in the rat brain by use of digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes and in situ hybridization technology. Signal was observed in all neural regions deduced to contain cholinergic somata on the basis of previous histochemical investigations employing choline acetyltransferase riboprobes and prior immunocytochemical studies with antibodies against choline acetyltransferase. It was absent in areas believed to contain no cholinergic neurons. Anti-sense riboprobes hybridized to the mRNA for the putative VAChT: (a) the projection neurons of the various nuclei of the basal nuclear complex, (b) the local circuit cells of the dorsal and ventral striata, (c) the projection neurons of the mesopontine complex, (d) perikarya in the ventral 2/3 of the medial habenula, (e) the somatic motor and autonomic cells of cranial nerves 3-7 and 9-12, as well as perikarya in the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei presumably giving rise to efferent fibers of cranial nerve 8, and (f) the alpha-motor and gamma-efferent motor neurons of the spinal cord. In addition, the mRNA for the VAChT was found in a few somata, probably ectopically located cells of the basal nuclear complex, in the internal capsule, central nucleus of the amygdala, entopeduncular nucleus, and zona incerta. It was also detected in some cell bodies in the reticular part of the substantia nigra, probably the rostral extension of the mesopontine complex, in the parabigeminal nucleus, and around the central canal in the spinal cord but not in cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar perikarya. It is concluded that, like choline acetyltransferase, the mRNA for the putative acetylcholine vesicular transporter is another specific marker for neurons utilizing acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. Further investigations of that transporter could have important implications for various diseases involving cholinergic systems, such as Alzheimer's disease.",
