     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of Xixin decoction (XXD) on O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAc glycosidase in O-GlcNAc glycosylation of tau proteins in the brain of rats with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD) and explore the possible mechanism. METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly divided into sham-operated group, model group, donepezil group, and low-, moderate-, and high-dose XXD groups. After treatment and behavioral test, the rats were sacrificed for detecting the expressions of OGT and O-GlcNAc glycosidase in the brain using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. RESULTS: XXD significantly enhanced the expressions of OGT in the hippocampus of SAD rats and lowered the expression of O-GlcNAc glycosidase (P<0.05 or 0.01). OGT and O-GlcNAc glycosidase expressions showed no significant differences between the model group and donepezil group (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: XXD can regulate the expression of OGT and O-GlcNAc glycosidase to enhance O-GlcNAc glycosylation of tau proteins in the hippocampus of SAD rats.",
