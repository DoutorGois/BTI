     "AB": "In this study chronic (39 days) tacrine (3 mg/kg i.p.) treatment significantly improved trimethyltin (8 mg/kg i.p.) induced deficits in spatial navigation. Tacrine also reduced trimethyltin induced hyperactivity and passive avoidance deficits but these effects did not reach statistical significance. The effect of trimethyltin on muscarinic (M1 and M2) receptor sites was determined by means of quantitative autoradiography using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate. A selective pattern of M1 and M2 receptor loss was observed mainly affecting the hippocampus and other limbic structures while leaving other brain regions intact. Tacrine successfully prevented the M1 and M2 receptor loss in the CA1 and CA4 hippocampal subfields. The improvement in trimethyltin behavioural toxicity following tacrine treatment may be related to the protective effect of this compound on muscarinic receptor density in the hippocampal formation and lends support to the hypothesis that cholinergic system dysfunction may be primarily responsible for trimethyltin induced deficits in cognitive function.",
