     "AB": "The effects of phenobarbital, phenytoin, and valproic acid on pharmacologically isolated NMDA-EPSP, AMPA-EPSP, and GABA-IPSPs were examined in rat hippocampal slices. Phenobarbital (0.05 mg/ml) had no effect on the NMDA-EPSP, but decreased the slope of the AMPA-EPSP by 13.4% and facilitated the GABA-IPSP slope by 77.12%. Phenytoin (0.02 mg/ml) had no effects on the NMDA-EPSP, AMPA-EPSP, or GABA-IPSP. Valproic acid (0.1 mg/ml) decreased the NMDA-EPSP slope by 14.3%, increased the GABA-IPSP slope by 54.34%, and had no effect on the AMPA-EPSP. These data suggest that the mechanisms of action of these anticonvulsant drugs may be via their actions on different neurotransmitter systems or ion channels.",
