     "AB": "The neurocognitive effects of cranial radiotherapy in patients with gliomas are well-recognised and may be related to the dose delivered to the hippocampi. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a radiotherapy technique that can be used to selectively spare the hippocampi without compromising the dose delivered to the tumour. This study aimed to evaluate if hippocampal-sparing IMRT is achievable in patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and III gliomas. A retrospective review of consecutive patients with WHO grade II and III gliomas treated with IMRT at our institution between January 2009 and August 2012 was performed. Hippocampal-sparing was defined as a mean dose to at least one hippocampus of less than 30 Gy. The dose delivered to the tumour was never compromised to achieve the hippocampal dose constraint. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictive factors for achieving hippocampal-sparing treatment. Eighteen patients were identified and hippocampal-sparing was achieved in 14 (78%). The median dose prescribed was 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions and 11 patients had WHO grade III gliomas. The mean dose to the contralateral hippocampus was 24.9 Gy. Planning target volumes less than 420.5 cm3 were more likely to enable hippocampal-sparing treatment to be given (hazard ratio 1.7, p=0.03) and there was a trend with oligodendrogliomas and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Hippocampal-sparing radiotherapy is feasible in patients with WHO grade II and III gliomas. Oncologic outcomes are yet to be assessed prospectively. The relationship between hippocampal dose and neurocognitive function in adults is currently under investigation.",
