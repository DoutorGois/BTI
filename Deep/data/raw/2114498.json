     "AB": "The disturbances in the central nervous system of rabbits induced by gramoxon poisoning were studied by examination of subcortical electroencephalograms (EEGs) and power spectral analysis of EEGs. The following results were obtained. Administration of the fatal gramoxon (2.0 ml/kg i.p.) resulted in increases of slow frequency discharges from the reticular formation (RF), and from the hippocampus (Hpc) and sensorimotor cortex (Cm) after about 5 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively, detected by power-spectrum array. After about 30 to 40 minutes, the discharges from the Cm changed to rapid frequency discharges. The discharges from the Hpc and Cm decreased after about 50 to 60 minutes, and increased again in the agonal stage, and then seizure discharges developed. Soon after administration of gramoxon solution, the heart rate and respiratory rate increased and the PCO2, base excess (BE) and [HCO3-] decreased transiently. These findings indicate a shift to acute respiratory alkalosis and thereafter a shift to metabolic acidosis. Subsequently, the blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, pH, BE and [HCO3-] decreased and the PCO2 increased. These findings indicate a shift to respiratory and metabolic acidosis. After about 70 minutes, the EEGs from all leads became almost flat, respiration ceased, and the blood pressure decreased to zero. After administration of gramoxon solution, the paraquat concentration in the blood increased rapidly. These results suggest that rapid increase in the paraquat concentration in the blood after gramoxon administration affects the central nervous system from an early stage.",
