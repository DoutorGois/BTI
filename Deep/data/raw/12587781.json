     "AB": "The aim of this work is a comparison of single and repeated peroral administration of cyclosporine (CsA) and the interaction of repeated administration of CsA and 7-methoxytacrine (MEOTA) on the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, septum, and basal ganglia in rats. Both single and repeated administration of CsA diminished the activity of AChE in the frontal cortex, septum and basal ganglia, while the enzyme activity in the hippocampus was diminished only in the case of repeated CsA, as well as repeated CsA + MEOTA administration. Repeated administration of CsA led to a further augmentation of anticholinesterase activity only in the frontal cortex and--in a lesser extent--in the basal ganglia. No augmentation of AChE activity was observed in the hippocampus and septum.",
