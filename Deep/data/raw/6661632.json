     "AB": "A host of proteins was seen when the chloroform-methanol insoluble protein (CMIP) fraction of bovine brain myelin was transferred from polyacrylamide gels to cellulose nitrate sheets. Inoculation of rabbits with the CMIP fraction generated a number of antibodies which were demonstrated by the immunoblot technique. These antisera against CMIP contained antibodies which induced demyelination and inhibited myelin formation in central nervous system cultures. The demyelinating factor was specific for centrally myelinated fibers, and did not demyelinate peripherally myelinated axons.",
