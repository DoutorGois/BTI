     "AB": "The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of lithium are largely unknown but may involve progressive adaptive alterations at the level of gene expression. Using differential display PCR, we identify a novel cDNA fragment, the expression of which was increased in the rat frontal cortex after 5 weeks of lithium administration. A full-length cDNA (2954-nt) was cloned by arrayed cDNA library screening, and sequencing of the clone revealed an open reading frame of 537-bp encoding a 179-residue protein. Amino acid sequence comparisons revealed that our clone is a member of the Nudix hydrolase family, with the highest percentage of homology (95%) being with a subtype of human diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase, hDIPP2. Northern blot analysis revealed that chronic lithium treatment significantly increased rDIPP2 mRNA levels in frontal cortex, but not in hippocampus, midbrain, and cerebellum. The effect of lithium on rDIPP2 mRNA expression was not shared by two other anticonvulsant mood stabilizers, carbamazepine and valproate. Time-course studies showed that 1-week of lithium had no effect on rDIPP2 mRNA abundance in the frontal cortex. Our results suggest that DIPP2 may represent a biologically relevant target of lithium therapy, further supporting the notion that abnormalities in inositol phosphate metabolism may be significant in the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of bipolar disorder.",
