     "AB": "The distribution of L-glutamic acid in single layers dissected from freeze-dried sections of the rabbit hippocampus was estimated by means of an enzymatic cycling procedure. Although the regional variation in glutamate content is less than that of other transmitter candidates, there were present significant differences in it between the projection fields of certain fiber connections. Glutamate concentration was highest in the termination areas of commissural fibers and Schaffer's collaterals.",
