     "AB": "We previously suggested that a deficit of anticonvulsant endogenous methionine enkephalin, in the cerebral cortex, septal area, hippocampus, and striatum of seizure-susceptible El mice plays a role in the pathogenesis of seizures. To determine whether a hypofunction of enkephalinergic neuron may be due to metabolic abnormalities of opioid peptides in the El mouse brain, we measured methionine enkephalin-like immunoreactivity (ME-LI) of 50 fractions eluted by high performance liquid chromatography obtained from those four regions of the brain of El and seizure-nonsusceptible ddY mice (the mother strain of El mice). We observed the same ME-LI patterns of 50 fractions in the cerebral cortex and septal area in El and ddY mice, whereas exhibited differing ME-LI patterns in the hippocampus and striatum in the two stains. Different ME-LI patterns may imply the difference in the metabolic profile of opioid peptides. Thus, an abnormal metabolism of opioid peptides in the hippocampus and striatum of the El mouse may be involved in the pathogenesis of seizures.",
