     "AB": "Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is accompanied by reduced ventilatory sensitivity to CO2 and O2, respiratory drive failure during sleep, impaired autonomic, fluid, and food absorption regulation, and affective and cognitive deficits, including memory deficiencies. The deficits likely derive from neural injury, reflected as structural damage and impaired functional brain responses to ventilatory and autonomic challenges. Brain structures playing essential memory roles, including the hippocampus and anterior thalamus, are damaged in CCHS. Other memory formation circuitry, the fornix and mammillary bodies, have not been evaluated. We collected two high-resolution T1-weighted image series from 14 CCHS and 31 control subjects, using a 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Image series were averaged and reoriented to a standard template; areas containing the mammillary bodies and fornices were over sampled, and body volumes and fornix cross-sectional areas were calculated and compared between groups. Both left and right mammillary body volumes and fornix cross-sectional areas were significantly reduced in CCHS over control subjects, controlling for age, gender, and intracranial volume. Damage to these structures may contribute to memory deficiencies found in CCHS. Hypoxic processes, together with diminished neuroprotection from micronutrient deficiencies secondary to fluid and dietary absorption issues, may contribute to the injury.",
