     "AB": "The purpose of the current study was to document the behavioral profile of ischemic rats in novel tasks including the elevated plus maze (EPM), the Vogel/conflict model of anxiety and novelty-induced feeding suppression paradigm as well as to further characterize using behavioral monitoring, the response of ischemic animals in existing paradigms such as the open field. Our findings revealed that ischemic animals spent significantly more time and made more entries in the open arm of the EPM as compared to sham animals, two behaviors indicative of decreased anxiety level. This anxiolytic effect appeared restricted to exploratory models of anxiety, as no differences in punished licking rate were observed between groups in the Vogel/conflict test. In the open field, behavioral monitoring revealed transient ischemia-induced hyperactivity, limited to the initial 15 min of a 30 min testing period. Increased activity in ischemic animals was primarily characterized by increased exploration and sniffing behavior with no significant alterations in rearing and grooming frequencies. Finally, using feeding behavior, our findings revealed a comparable rate of habituation to a novel environment in ischemic and sham rats. Taken together, these results suggest that ischemia-induced hyperactivity may involve a disinhibition to explore unfamiliar and/or mildly anxiogenic environments. However, the basis of such hyperactivity and the presence of habituation deficit following ischemia require further study and/or validation.",
