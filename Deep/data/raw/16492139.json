     "AB": "In response to different cellular stresses, a family of protein kinases phosphorylates eIF2alpha (alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2), contributing to regulation of both general and genespecific translation proposed to alleviate cellular injury or alternatively induce apoptosis. Recently, we reported eIF2alpha(P) (phosphorylated eIF2alpha) in the brain during SE (status epilepticus) induced by pilocarpine in mice, an animal model of TLE (temporal lobe epilepsy) [Carnevalli, Pereira, Longo, Jaqueta, Avedissian, Mello and Castilho (2004) Neurosci. Lett. 357, 191-194]. We show in the present study that one eIF2alpha kinase family member, PKR (double-stranded-RNA-dependent protein kinase), is activated in the cortex and hippocampus at 30 min of SE, reflecting the levels of eIF2alpha(P) in these areas. In PKR-deficient animals subjected to SE, eIF2alpha phosphorylation was clearly evident coincident with activation of a secondary eIF2alpha kinase, PEK/PERK (pancreatic eIF2alpha kinase/RNA-dependent-protein-kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase), denoting a compensatory mechanism between the two kinases. The extent of eIF2alpha phosphorylation correlated with the inhibition of protein synthesis in the brain, as determined from polysome profiles. We also found that C57BL/6 mice, which enter SE upon pilocarpine administration but are more resistant to seizure-induced neuronal degeneration, showed very low levels of eIF2alpha(P) and no inhibition of protein synthesis during SE. These results taken together suggest that PKR-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2alpha contributes to inhibition of protein synthesis in the brain during SE and that sustained high levels of eIF2alpha phosphorylation may facilitate ensuing cell death in the most affected areas of the brain in TLE.",
