     "AB": "Double-fluorescence staining was combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy to localize fetal liver kinase-1 (Flk-1) and fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1) in the neonatal rat brain. The results showed that Flk-1 and Flt-1 immunostaining was observed in the cells with neuron-specific enolase, a neuronal marker, and with factor VIII (F VIII), an endothelium marker, but not in cells with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a glial marker, of brain sections from rats on postnatal day 7 (P7). This indicates that both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors were distributed in the neurons and the vascular endothelium. A regional analysis showed that Flt-1 was distributed most densely in the hippocampus, followed by the retrosplenial agranular cortex and the striatum, and Flk-1 was evenly distributed throughout the brain. In a comparison of the density of immunopositive staining neurons, Flt-1 was much higher than Flk-1 in most of the brain regions. A time-course analysis showed that both Flt-1 and Flk-1 were highly expressed in the cerebral vessel of rats on P1, P7, and P14, and then declined in adults, consistent with the development of angiogenesis in neonates. In the neurons, Flt-1 was highest in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of P1-P14 rats, and then gradually decreased, whereas Flk-1 abruptly increased and reached its highest level in adults. The results suggest that Flt-1 and Flk-1 are expressed in the neurons with their individual time-dependent manners and regional distribution in the brain. However, the significance of the neuronal distribution of Flt-1 and Flk-1 remains to be determined.",
