     "AB": "Memory in the brain is organized into multiple memory systems that perform different memory functions and have different neurologic substrates. Declarative memory involves conscious memory for facts and events. The medial temporal lobe and structures in the diencephalon are essential in the establishment of new declarative memories, and these memory traces are finally stored in domain-specific regions of the cerebral cortex. The frontal lobe and basal ganglia are important in some forms of declarative memory that require reasoning about the contents of memory. Nondeclarative forms of memory (including skill learning, repetition priming, and classical conditioning) do not involve conscious recollection and are measured through changes in the way in which tasks are performed. These forms of memory rely upon the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.",
