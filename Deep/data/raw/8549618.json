     "AB": "The (RS)-alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolopropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptor-channel complex mediates fast components of excitatory synaptic currents in the central nervous system. Distinguishing between these components is a difficult pharmacological task. As was recently reported, gamma-D-glutamylaminomethylsulfonic acid (GAMS) may be a selective kainate receptor antagonist. We have tested this possibility in experiments which were carried out on acutely isolated rat hippocampal neurons. It appeared that 1 mM GAMS first blocked 83 +/- 1% of the fast desensitizing 128 microM AMPA-gated current, but only 38 +/- 6% of the non-desensitizing current component and reached, at higher GAMS concentrations, a plateau at about 50% of the control steady state current level. In contrast to the blocking action of GAMS on AMPA-gated currents, 4-fold higher concentrations of GAMS were needed to block currents elicited by 256 microM kainate application. It is suggested that several subunit compositions of the AMPA-gated receptor could coexist on a single hippocampal cell. Furthermore, GAMS has a certain preference for subunit assemblies which could mediate fast desensitizing and, a portion of, the non-desensitizing current component.",
