     "AB": "Amitraz is a formamidine insecticide/acaricide that alters different neurotransmitters levels, among other neurotoxic effects. Oral amitraz exposure (20, 50 and 80 mg/kg bw, 5 days) has been reported to increase serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) content and to decrease their metabolites and turnover rates in the male rat brain, particularly in the striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. However, the mechanisms by which these alterations are produced are not completely understood. One possibility is that amitraz monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition could mediate these effects. Alternatively, it alters serum concentrations of sex steroids that regulate the enzymes responsible for these neurotransmitters synthesis and metabolism. Thus, alterations in sex steroids in the brain could also mediate the observed effects. To test these hypothesis regarding possible mechanisms, we treated male rats with 20, 50 and 80 mg/kg bw for 5 days and then isolated tissue from striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. We then measured tissue levels of expression and/or activity of MAO, catechol-O-metyltransferase (COMT), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TRH) as well as estradiol levels in these regions. Our results show that amitraz did not inhibit MAO activity at these doses, but altered MAO, COMT, DBH, TH and TRH gene expression, as well as TH and TRH activity and estradiol levels. The alteration of these enzymes was partially mediated by dysregulation of estradiol levels. Our present results provide new understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the harmful effects of amitraz.",
