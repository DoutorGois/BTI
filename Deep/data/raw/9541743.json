     "AB": "The central natriuretic peptide system is composed of at least three structurally homologous and uniquely distributed peptides and receptors which are thought to be involved in the central regulation of cardiovascular and autonomic function and more recently been shown to affect cellular growth and proliferation, processes pertinent to mammalian development. As such, following our initial mapping of preproatrial natriuretic peptide (ppANP) mRNA in adult brain [M.C. Ryan, A.L. Gundlach, Anatomical localization of preproatrial natriuretic peptide mRNA in the rat brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry: in olfactory regions, J. Comp. Neurol., 356 (1995) 168-182], it was of interest to determine the ontogenic expression of natriuretic peptide mRNAs in the developing rat brain. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry of specific [35S]- or [33P]-labeled oligonucleotides, ppANP and preproC-type natriuretic peptide (ppCNP) mRNAs were detected in the developing rat brain from postnatal day 4 to day 60 (adult). PpANP mRNA was observed in many hindbrain, but only some forebrain, regions at postnatal day 4. Regional differences in the temporal expression of ppANP mRNA were apparent with ppANP mRNA detected in the medial preoptic area, mammillary nuclei and medial habenular nucleus at postnatal day 4 and in other areas including the arcuate and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei and in olfactory and limbic regions at postnatal day 10. A number of regions also exhibited transient expression of ppANP mRNA such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the medial cerebellar nucleus. In contrast, ppCNP mRNA was detected at relatively high levels in several regions on postnatal day 4 including olfactory nuclei, the hippocampus and particularly the pontine nucleus. The level of expression appeared to increase markedly in most regions including forebrain olfactory and hippocampal areas and in brainstem regions including the pontine nucleus, the parvocellular and lateral reticular and spinal trigeminal nuclei by postnatal days 10 and 13, but decreased from this peak to equivalent to adult levels by postnatal day 28. The differential and transient expression of the natriuretic peptides during postnatal development, together with previous reports of the ontogenic regulation of natriuretic peptide receptor expression and binding patterns, further suggests their involvement in developmental processes in the rat CNS and provides information relevant to the likely functional development of natriuretic peptide-utilizing pathways.",
