     "AB": "The behavioral and neurochemical effects of synthetic dipeptide fragment GSB-106 of BDNF, administered in a single dose of 0.1 mg/kg (i.p.), have been studied in comparison to amitriptyline (10 mg/kg, i.p.) on the Nomura depressive state model employing forced-rotating-wheel swim test (FST) in Wistar rats. Amitriptyline is known to increase both the number of wheel turns and the index of correlation between the number of turns in the first and last 5-min intervals of observation. It is established that GSB-6 produces a pronounced antidepressant effect comparable to that of amitriptyline, while not influencing the content of monoamines in brain structures of intact (non-depressive) rats. HPLC study showed that GSB-106 increased the complex parameters of dopamine metabolism (DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA) in nucleus accumbens and striatum of rats undergoing FST as compared to the same indices in intact animals. A decrease in the norepinephrine (NE) content by 50% was detected in striatum and hippocampus of rats with depression model. GSB-106 to significantly increased the number of wheel turnings and prevent the elevation of DA and its metabolite DOPAC levels in hypothalamus. A decrease in 5-HIAA (serotonin metabolite) content was also detected in frontal cortex and hypothalamus.",
