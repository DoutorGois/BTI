     "AB": "Activation of NMDA receptors produces large increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) that are taken up into mitochondria. We used recombinant aequorin targeted to mitochondria to report changes in matrix Ca(2+) in rat hippocampal neurons in culture. Upon binding Ca(2+), aequorin emits a photon in a one-shot reaction that consumes the indicator. Here we show that stimulation with NMDA produced a mitochondrial Ca(2+) response that rapidly inactivated. However, following a 30-min recovery period the response was restored, suggesting the presence of a pool of indicator that was not exposed to high Ca(2+) during the initial stimulus. We speculate that aequorin distant from the Ca(2+) source was protected from microdomains of high Ca(2+) near the plasmalemma and that this aequorin moved, either by movement of individual mitochondria or via the mitochondrial tubular network, to replenish consumed indicator during the recovery time. A large Ca(2+) increase in a subset of mitochondria could produce local changes in energy metabolism, regional Ca(2+) buffering, and foci that initiate neurotoxic processes.",
