     "AB": "In order to investigate the topography of the channel binding site in (+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) types of glutamate receptors, we have compared the blocking actions of mono- and dicationic derivatives of adamantane and phenylcyclohexyl. The potencies of dicationic derivatives to block AMPA receptor channels are about 1000 times higher than those of monocationic ones, whereas NMDA receptors are equally sensitive to both mono- and dicationic derivatives. The dependence of the activity of dicationic compounds on the length of the polymethylene chain between ammonium groups has a pronounced maximum for AMPA receptor channel block. For NMDA receptor channel dicationic compounds with various internitrogen distances produce similar blocking effects. The results show that hydrophobic and nucleophilic components of the binding site are located close to each other in the NMDA receptor channel but are separated by approximately 10 A in the AMPA receptor channel.",
