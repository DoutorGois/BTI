     "AB": "The subcellular distribution of 5'-nucleotidase and adenosine deaminase in rat brain hypothalamus and hippocampus was studied. In the hippocampus the 5'-nucleotidase activity was shown to be much higher than in the hypothalamus, while the adenosine deaminase activity, contrariwise, is nearly two times as high as that in the hypothalamus. During the analysis of subcellular distribution 5'-nucleotidase and adenosine deaminase were detected in all fractions under study, i. e., in nuclear, soluble, myelin fractions as well as in synaptic membranes, synaptosomes and \"pure\" mitochondria. The highest 5'-nucleotidase activity was found in the myelinic and synaptic fractions both in the hypothalamus and in the hippocampus. The highest adenosine deaminase activity was detected in the soluble fraction of the above structures. The enzyme activity in synaptic membranes and synaptosomes was nearly two times as low.",
