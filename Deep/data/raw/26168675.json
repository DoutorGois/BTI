     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of whole brain irradiation (WBI) on neurogenesis in hippocampus and its relationship with histone acetylation. METHODS: A signal dose of 30Gy 4MeV electron beam was offered to male Sprague-Dawley rats (150 - 200 g). At Days 7 and 30, immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to analyze the effects of WBI on neurogenesis and the expression of acetyl-H3 and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) in hippocampus. Finally trichostatin A (TSA), a HDAC1 inhibitor, was used to verify whether H3 acetylation was associated with neurogenesis impairment. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence showed that, at Day 7 post-irradiation, the number of BrdU + NeuN + cells reduced by 67% (P < 0. 01) and it approached zero at Day 30 (P < 0. 01). Meanwhile, a significant decrease of HDAC1-dependent H3 acetylation was observed. Western blot showed 30% (P <0. 05) and 61% (P < 0. 01) reductions in H3 acetylation at Days 7 and 30 post-irradiation respectively. These results were further confirmed by immunofluorescent staining. Also HDAC1 levels significantly increased in a time-dependent manner at Days 7 and 30 post-irradiation. And TSA rescued neurogenesis impairment after WBI. CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced HDAC1-dependent H3 acetylation decline is associated with long-term neurogenesis impairment in dentate gyrus.",
