     "AB": "The expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine-2B (5-HT2B) receptor mRNA has recently been shown in cultured astrocytes. Here the expression of functional 5-HT2B receptors has been studied in cultured astrocytes from rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and brain stem. Fluo-3- and fura-2-based microspectrofluorometry was used for measuring changes in intracellular free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i). The 5-HT2B agonist alpha-methyl 5-HT (40 nM) produced rapid transient increases in [Ca2+]i in astrocytes from all three brain regions studied, and these responses were blocked by the selective 5-HT2B antagonist rauwolscine (1 microM). The specificity of the responses to alpha-methyl 5-HT was further demonstrated by the failure of 4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)-1-(4-phenylbutyl)-piperidine oxalate (1 microM), a specific 5-HT2A/5-HT2C antagonist, to block these responses. The 5-HT2B-induced increases in [Ca2+]i persisted in Ca2+-free buffer, indicating that the increase in [Ca2+]i results from mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. The expression of 5-HT2B receptors on astroglial cells was further verified immunohistochemically and by Western blot analysis. These results provide evidence of the existence of 5-HT2B receptors on astrocytes in primary culture.",
