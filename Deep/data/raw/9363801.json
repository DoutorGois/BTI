     "AB": "To determine if amyloid-beta (A beta) induces tau-immunoreactivity (IR) and reactive astrocytosis in vivo, we injected A beta 25-35 (5.0 nmol) into the right amygdala of rats. At 8 days postinjection, the peptide induced tau-2 IR in neuronal cell bodies and processes ipsilaterally in the amygdala, cingulate cortex, and hippocampus. At 32 days postinjection, the intensity of tau-2 IR was greater than at 8 days in the amygdala and hippocampus, but not in the cingulate cortex. Induction of Alz-50 IR also was progressive but the morphology and distribution was different from tau-2 IR. Beaded fibers with occasional neuronal perikarya were visualized with Alz-50, and the IR was primarily observed in the ipsilateral amygdala. In addition, amygdaloid injections of A beta 25-35 induced reactive astrocytosis, particularly in the ipsilateral hippocampus at 32 days postoperatively. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that in vivo injections of A beta 25-35 induce progressive transsynaptic cytoskeletal and astrogliotic reactions, that gradually spread from the area of injection to brain regions that have prominent efferent connections with that area. These findings also suggest a direct association between plaque and tangle formation in Alzheimer's disease.",
