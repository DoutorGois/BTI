     "AB": "This paper investigates the influence of micropatterned polymers and chemical modification on neural progenitor cell growth and differentiation in co-culture systems with astrocytes. We sought to develop strategies to facilitate nerve regeneration using a synergistic combination of guidance cues, investigating the cellular mechanisms of nerve repair using adult rat hippocampal progenitor cells (AHPCs). Our studies have shown that this synergistic combination of physical, chemical, and biological cues can lead to oriented growth of astrocytes and progenitor cells, can control and accelerate neurite outgrowth and alignment in vitro, and may influence differentiation of progenitor cells.",
