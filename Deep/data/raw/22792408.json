     "AB": "Current thinking about LTP triggered in the area CA1 of hippocampal slices is ruled by two \"dogmas\": (1) A single train of high-frequency stimulation is sufficient to trigger short-lasting LTP (1-3 h), whereas multiple trains are required to induce long-lasting LTP (L-LTP, more than 4 h). (2) The development of the late phase of L-LTP requires the synthesis of new proteins. In this study, we found that a single high-frequency train could trigger an LTP lasting more than 8 h that was not affected by either anisomycin or cycloheximide (two inhibitors of protein synthesis). We ascertained that the induction of this L-LTP made use of the same mechanisms as those usually reported to be involved in LTP induction: it was dependent on NMDA receptors and on the activation of two \"core\" kinases, CaMKII and PI3K. These findings call into question the two \"dogmas\" about LTP.",
