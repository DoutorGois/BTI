     "AB": "Much is known about modular organization in the cerebral cortex, but this knowledge is skewed markedly toward primary sensory areas, and in fact, it has been difficult to demonstrate elsewhere. In this report, we test the hypothesis that a unique form of modules exists in the entorhinal area of the human cortex (Brodmann's area 28). We examined this issue using classic cyto- and myeloarchitectonic stains, immunolabeling for various neurochemicals, and histochemistry for certain enzymes. The findings reveal that the entorhinal cortex in the human is formed by a mosaic of cellular aggregates whose most conspicuous elements are the cell islands of layer II and myelinated fibers around the cell islands, the disposition of glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive neurons and processes, cytochrome oxidase staining, and the pattern of cholinergic afferent fibers. The neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease cases highlights the modules, but inversely so, by destroying their features. The findings are of interest because 1) anatomically defined modules are shown to be present in areas other than the sensory and motor cortices, 2) the modules are morphological entities likely to reflect functions of the entorhinal cortex, and 3) the destruction of entorhinal cortex modules may account disproportionately for the severity of memory impairments in Alzheimer's disease.",
