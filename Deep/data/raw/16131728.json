     "AB": "A study was undertaken to determine Al, Mg and P concentrations in 5 different brain regions of 3 control and 3 Alzheimer-diseased patients. One of the aims of this work was to evaluate the performance of applied analytical techniques. The digested samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry for Al, Mg and P. The dried samples were measured by instrumental neutron activation analysis for Al and Mg. The determination of human brain Al levels is complicated by the interfering reaction of P. We have previously worked out an analytical method which can eliminate this interference. The accuracy of the measured data was investigated by the analysis of biological standard reference materials. Our second goal was to study the possible elemental concentration changes in Alzheimer-diseased patients. Significantly higher Al and lower Mg and P values were found in some AD brain regions compared to the controls.",
