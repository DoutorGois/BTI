     "AB": "We have recorded from diseased hippocampal tissue which was surgically removed from epileptic patients for therapeutic purposes. When the perforant path was stimulated at a low frequency (1 Hz), the number of population spikes evoked in the dentate gyrus increased by a factor of as great as 8 during a 15 s train. This effect was transient. A similar epileptiform discharge could be generated in normal rat hippocampal brain slices by the same stimulus paradigm, but only in the presence of a low concentration (0.2 microM) of bicuculline. These results suggest that this frequency-dependent epileptiform discharge, evoked in the dentate gyrus of epileptic patients, may be due to a small reduction in GABAA-mediated inhibition and may involve factors that lead to the initiation of seizures.",
