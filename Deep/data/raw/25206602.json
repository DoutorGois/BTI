     "AB": "The Alzheimer's disease model in Wistar rats was established by injection of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta1-42) into the hippocampal CA1 region. Rats were treated with suspended moxibustion on Baihui (GV20) and Shenshu (BL23) acupoints. Prior to and post Abeta1-42 exposure. Results showed no evidence of apoptosis in hippocampal neurons, a significantly reduced apoptosis rate of neurons and improved learning and memory abilities were observed in the Alzheimer's disease model. In particular, moxibustion prior to Abeta1-42 exposure was more effective than moxibustion after Abeta1-42 exposure in protecting the neuronal structure and lowering the apoptosis rate. Our findings indicate that a combination of preventive and therapeutic moxibustion has a beneficial effect for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease development.",
