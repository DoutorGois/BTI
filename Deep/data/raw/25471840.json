     "AB": "CONTEXT: Several studies have demonstrated that essential oils and their major components have antioxidant activity. p-Cymene is a monoterpene and a major constituent of essential oils of various species of plants. OBJECTIVE: This paper evaluated the antioxidant potential of p-cymene in the hippocampus of mice by determining the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), nitrite content, and activity of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Swiss mice were intraperitoneally treated with 0.05% Tween 80 dissolved in 0.9% saline solution, ascorbic acid 250 mg/kg, and p-cymene at doses of 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg, respectively. After treatment, all groups were observed for 24 h, afterwards, the groups were euthanized for removal of the brain and dissection of the hippocampus. RESULTS: The results of treatment with p-cymene were a significant decrease in lipid peroxidation and nitrite content at a dose of CYM 50: 65.54%, CYM 100: 73.29%, CYM 150: 89.83%, and CYM 50: 71.21%; CYM 100: 68.61% and CYM 150:67%, respectively, when compared with the control group. The results showed that at all tested doses, p-cymene produces an increase in SOD and catalase activity significantly at a dose of CYM 50: 22.7%, CYM 100: 33.9%, CYM 150: 63.1%, and CYM 50: 119.25%, CYM 100: 151.83% and CYM 150: 182.70%, respectively, when compared with the vehicle-treated group. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The result of this study shows that p-cymene has an antioxidant potential in vivo and may act as a neuroprotective agent in the brain. This compound may present a new strategy in the development of treatment for many diseases in which oxidative stress plays an important pathophysiological role.",
