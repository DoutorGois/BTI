     "AB": "Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dBcAMP)-treatment of cultured rat astrocytes induced changes in astrocyte morphology followed by the potentiation of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha)-stimulated phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis. The potentiation was observed in astrocytes of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus. The dBcAMP-treatment induced agonists-specific changes in PI hydrolysis; e.g., the potentiation of norepinephrine-effect and the reduction of the carbachol-effect. Coincubations of carbachol or norepinephrine with PGF2 alpha produced additive responses.",
