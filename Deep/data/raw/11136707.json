     "AB": "A mouse model for congenital nephrotic syndrome (NPHS1) was generated by inactivating the nephrin gene (Nphs1) in embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination. The targeting construct contained the Escherichia coli lacZ gene as a reporter for the Nphs1 promoter. Mice homozygous for inactivated Nphs1 were born at an expected frequency of 25%. Although seemingly normal at birth, they immediately developed massive proteinuria and edema and died within 24 h. The kidneys of null mice exhibited enlarged Bowman's spaces, dilated tubuli, effacement of podocyte foot processes and absence of the slit diaphragm, essentially as found in human NPHS1 patients. In addition to expression in glomerular podocytes, the reporter gene was expressed in the brain and pancreas of (+/-) and (-/-) mice. In the brain, expression was localized to the ventricular zone of the fourth ventricle, the developing spinal cord, cerebellum, hippocampus and olfactory bulb. In the cerebellum, the expression was seen in radial glial cells. Neither anatomical nor morphological abnormalities were observed in the brains of null mice.",
