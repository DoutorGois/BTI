     "AB": "The effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on the electrophysiological properties of central neurones were investigated in rat hippocampal slices. No differences in membrane potential, input resistance or action potential parameters could be detected in pyramidal or granule cells. However, a slowing of conduction velocity in granule cells and an increase in excitability of fibre volleys in both the perforant pathway and granule cell mossy fibre projections was observed. The lack of effect on evoked fEPSPs in these pathways is also consistent with diabetes-dependent changes in the voltage-dependence of synaptic strength.",
