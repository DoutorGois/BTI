     "AB": "The enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) converts the inactive 11-dehydrocorticosterone into the active glucocorticoid corticosterone. There is accumulating evidence indicating widespread expression of 11beta-HSD1 in the brain. However, there is little information about regulation of 11beta-HSD1 expression in this tissue. Using in situ hybridization involving use of 35S-labeled cRNA probe, we have studied the distribution of cells expressing 11beta-HSD1 mRNA in the male mouse forebrain as well as the effects of adrenalectomy (ADX) and acute administration of corticosterone (3 and 24 h) on 11beta-HSD1 mRNA levels. Cells expressing 11beta-HSD1 mRNA were mostly detected in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and medial preoptic area, with the highest expression in the cerebral cortex (retrosplenial granular area) and hippocampus (CA3 and granular layer of the gyrus dentatus). Seven days following ADX, 11beta-HSD mRNA levels were increased by 50% in the gyrus dentatus, by 100% in the CA3 area, and 105% in the cerebral cortex. Administration of corticosterone to ADX mice induced a significant decrease in mRNA, in both the hippocampus and cerebral cortex so that, at the 24 h time interval, the levels were similar to those observed in intact mice. These results clearly indicate that circulating corticosterone is downregulating the expression of 11beta-HSD1 mRNA in the two forebrain areas studied. This downregulation might contribute to maintain low intracellular corticosterone levels in central regions and then prevent the deleterious effects induced by high glucocorticoid levels.",
