Here we review several of these proposed schemes, with the conclusion that though some processes may involve re-expression of embryonic phenotypes, there are many processes invoked during recovery from lesions that do not mirror developmental phenomena. The inability to fully revert to embryonic schemes because of adult phenotype may partially account for the decreased recovery observed in adults compared to that noted after lesions during development.",
