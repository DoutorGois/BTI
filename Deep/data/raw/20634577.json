     "AB": "Cerebrovascular angiopathy affects late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) brains by possibly increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A expression, thereby stimulating endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Indeed, VEGF-A gene upregulation, with increased VEGF-A protein content of reactive astrocytes and microglia, occurs in LOAD brains, and neovascularization was observed one week after injecting amyloid-beta (Abeta)(1-42) into rat hippocampus. We have now found, with cultured 'normoxic' normal adult human astrocytes (NAHAs), that fibrillar Abeta(25-35) (an active Abeta(1-42) fragment) or a cytokine mixture (the (CM)-trio (interleukin [IL]-1beta+interferon [IFN]-gamma+tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha), or pair (IFN-gamma+TNF-alpha) like those produced in LOAD brains) stimulates the nuclear translocation of stabilized hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha protein and its binding to VEGF-A hypoxia-response elements; the mRNA synthesis for three VEGF-A splice variants (121, 165, 189); and the secretion of VEGF-A165. The CM-trio was the most powerful stimulus, IFN-gamma+TNF-alpha was less potent, and other cytokine pairs or single cytokines or Abeta(35-25) were ineffective. While Abeta(25-35) did not change HIF-1beta protein levels, the CM-trio increased both HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta protein levels, thereby giving an earlier and stronger stimulus to VEGF-A secretion by NAHAs. Thus, increased VEGF-A secretion from astrocytes stimulated by Abeta(1-42) and by microglia-released cytokines might restore angiogenesis and Abeta(1-42) vascular clearance.",
