     "AB": "Animals exposed to kainic acid (KA) induced status epilepticus display a striking pattern of selective neuronal vulnerability in the hippocampus. Neurons in the hilus/CA3 and CA1 subfields appear particularly sensitive whereas dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells are resistant. The molecular basis for this differential susceptibility remains largely unknown. Recently, an involvement of nitric oxide, c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK) and interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE)-related proteases has been proposed in KA induced neuronal cell death. In the present study, we have determined the regional expression of transcripts for two modulating genes operating in these pathways, i.e., the endogenous protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (PIN), and a cytoplasmic inhibitor of the JNK signal transduction pathway, designated JNK interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) and of the gene for the apoptosis-executing protease Caspase-3 in KA-treated animals. The expression of PIN and JIP-1 was found significantly upregulated in granule cells of the resistant DG. In contrast, an induction of the ICE-related protease Caspase-3 was observed in vulnerable hippocampal regions, i.e. CA1, CA3 and hilus. These results point towards PIN and JIP-1 as antiapoptotic factors contributing to selective resistance of granule cells, whereas Caspase-3 may be involved in cell death of hippocampal CA1, CA3 and hilar neurons in the kainate epilepsy model.",
