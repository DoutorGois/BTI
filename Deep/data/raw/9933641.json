     "AB": "To isolate a cDNA encoding Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 5 (NHE5), we screened a human spleen library using exon sequences of the NHE5 gene. Clones spanning 2.9 kilobase pairs were isolated; however, they contained several introns and were missing coding sequences at both the 5' and 3' ends. The missing 5' sequences were obtained by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and by analysis of an NHE5 genomic clone, and the missing 3' sequences were obtained by 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of brain cDNA yielded products in which each of the introns had been correctly excised, whereas the introns were retained in products from spleen and testis, suggesting that the NHE5 transcripts expressed in these organs do not encode a functional transporter. The intron/exon organization of the NHE5 gene was analyzed and found to be very similar to that of the NHE3 gene. The NHE5 cDNA, which encodes an 896-amino acid protein that is most closely related to NHE3, was expressed in Na+/H+ exchanger-deficient fibroblasts and shown to mediate Na+/H+ exchange activity. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the mRNA encoding NHE5 is expressed in multiple regions of the brain, including hippocampus, consistent with the possibility that it regulates intracellular pH in hippocampal and other neurons.",
