     "AB": "We characterized the binding of [125I]epidepride to dopamine D2-like and D3-like receptors in tissue sections of human striatum. The competition for binding of [125I]epidepride by domperidone, quinpirole, and 7-hydroxy-N,N-di(1-propyl)-2-aminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT) was best fit by assuming one site in the caudate but two sites in nucleus accumbens. Guanosine 5'-[beta, gamma-imido]triphosphate showed a large modulatory influence in agonist inhibition of [125I]epidepride binding in caudate but not in nucleus accumbens. The binding of [125I]epidepride in the presence of 7-OH-DPAT (1000-fold selective for D3-like versus D2-like sites) and domperidone (20-fold selective for D2-like versus D3-like sites) was used to quantify the numbers of D2-like and D3-like receptors in areas of human brain. The distribution of D2-like and D3-like receptors was largely nonoverlapping. Binding of [125I]epidepride to D3-like receptors was negligible in the dorsal striatum but was concentrated in islands of dense binding in the nucleus accumbens and ventral putamen that aligned with acetylcholinesterase-poor striosomes. Binding to D3-like receptors was also enriched in the internal globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, septum, islands of Calleja, nucleus basalis, amygdalostriatal transition nucleus of the amygdala, central nucleus of the amygdala, and ventral tegmental area. Binding of [125I]epidepride to D2 but not D3 receptors was detected in cortex and hippocampus.",
