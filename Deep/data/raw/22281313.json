     "AB": "We demonstrated the rapid effects of 10nM bisphenol A (BPA) on the spinogenesis of adult rat hippocampal slices. The density of spines was analyzed by imaging Lucifer Yellow-injected CA1 neurons in slices. Not only the total spine density but also the head diameter distribution of spine was quantitatively analyzed. Spinogenesis was significantly enhanced by BPA within 2h. In particular, the density of middle-head spine (with head diameter of 0.4-0.5mum) was significantly increased. Hydroxytamoxifen, an antagonist of both estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma) and estrogen receptors (ERalpha/ERbeta), blocked the BPA-induced enhancement of the spine density. However, ICI 182,780, an antagonist of ERalpha/ERbeta, did not suppress the BPA effects. Therefore, ERRgamma is deduced to be a high affinity receptor of BPA, responsible for modulation of spinogenesis. The BPA-induced enhancement of spinogenesis was also suppressed by MAP kinase inhibitor, PD98059, and the blocker of NMDA receptors, MK-801. Washout of BPA for additional 2h after 2h BPA treatment abolished the BPA-induced enhancement of spinogenesis, suggesting that the BPA effect was reversible. ERRgamma was localized at synapses as well as cell bodies of principal neurons. ERRgamma at synapses may contribute to the observed rapid effect. The level of BPA in the hippocampal slices was determined by mass-spectrometric analysis.",
