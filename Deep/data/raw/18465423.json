     "AB": "This study characterized the ion channel activities in the hippocampus of diabetic rats by monitoring the levels of monoamines. Extracellular levels of serotonin and dopamine were measured in the hippocampus of awake, freely moving streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, spontaneously diabetic rats, and non-diabetic rats, using in vivo microdialysis. Sodium, calcium, and potassium ion channel blockers were used to assess the ion channel activities. The results suggest that there are no abnormalities in the ion channels of diabetic brain, but the reduced levels of monoamines could be due to any problems of reuptake, release, and rate of breakdown of these molecules.",
