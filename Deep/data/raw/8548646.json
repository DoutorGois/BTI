     "AB": "8 cases of dementia associated with cortical Lewy bodies are dealt with, that were diagnosed in 1993 in examinations for dementia, using the Nottingham's clinical criteria. They make up 15.4% of primary degenerative dementias diagnosed in this examination. All developed a predominantly cortical dementia with variable bradiphrenia and a parkinsonian syndrome which was predominantly of the rigid-bradikinetic type. The dementia established itself rapidly -between 1 and 3 weeks- in 3 cases (37.5%). 50% of patients (4 cases) showed marked psychiatric symptoms. In 2 cases stiffness was predominantly axial and another had supranuclear paralysis of vertical gaze. 3 patients had no tremor, and 2 of the 5 remaining patients showed postural tremor. CT and axial MR images of the encephalon were similar to those observed in dementia of the Alzheimer type. The coronal MR carried out on 3 patients revealed less atrophy of the hypocampus than is normally observed in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type who are at the same stage of development.",
