     "AB": "Based on previous results it was hypothesized that the neural substrate of the acquisition of place learning during inhibition of the nitric oxide synthesizing enzyme (NOS) by L-nitroarginine (L-N-ARG) differs from the neural substrate of normal task acquisition by a reduced or abolished participation of the hippocampus. This hypothesis was tested in two independent experiments. In Experiment 1 the behavioral consequences of bilateral transection of the fimbria-fornix--a lesion that abolishes normal hippocampal function--were investigated in animals that had acquired the task after either a vehicle control pretreatment or a 5-day pretreatment period during which near-total inhibition of NOS had been accomplished by L-N-ARG injections. While fimbria-fornix transections significantly impaired task performance in normal animals the rats which had acquired the task during NOS inhibition did not reveal a lesion-associated impairment. In Experiment 2 four groups of rats were studied: two groups initially received bilateral transection of the fimbria-fornix, while the two others were subjected to sham surgery. Subsequently, one of the fimbria-fornix-transected and one of the sham-operated groups received a 10-day period of L-N-ARG injections, while the two remaining groups received saline control injections. During the final 5 days of injections the four groups were subjected to training on the place-learning task. While NOS inhibition clearly impaired task acquisition in the sham-operated animals, L-N-ARG administration in fimbria-fornix-transected animals failed to impair place-learning acquisition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
