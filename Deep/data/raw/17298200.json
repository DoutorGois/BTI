     "AB": "The effect of ethanol on the structural development of the central nervous system was studied in offspring of Wistar rats, drinking 20 % ethanol during pregnancy and till the 28th day of their postnatal life. The structural changes in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus were analyzed at the age of 18, 35 and 90 days. A lower width of pyramidal and granular cell layers, cell extinction and fragmentation of numerous nuclei were found in all experimental animals compared to control animals. The extent of neural cell loss was similar in all monitored areas and in all age groups. At the age of 18 and 35 days, the degenerating cells were observed in the CA1 and CA3 area of the hippocampus and in the ventral and dorsal blade of the dentate gyrus. Numerous glial cells replaced the neuronal population of this region. Some degenerating cells with fragmented nuclei were observed at the age of 90 days. Our experiments confirmed the vulnerability of the developing central nervous system by ethanol intake during the perinatal period and revealed a long-lasting degeneration process in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus.",
