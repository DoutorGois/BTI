     "AB": "The epileptic chicken is a genetic model of generalized epilepsy in which epilepsy is combined with megalencephaly. We have performed a morphometric study of the brains of adult epileptic hens, using heterozygous carrier hens as controls. There is no obvious disorder of cell form or of architectural arrangement in the megalencephalic brains. We have found that the enlargement of the epileptic brain is not uniform: it is most marked in the telencephalon, and is present to a lesser degree in the cerebellum, but neither the optic tectum nor the diencephalic nucleus rotundus shows a significant increase in size. The enlarged regions are characterized by a decrease in the packing density of neurons. There is an increase in the total neuron population in some of the enlarged areas (archistriatum), despite the lower density per unit volume, but in other enlarged areas (hippocampus) there is no difference in total neuron numbers. The glial cells, by contrast, show no significant alteration in packing density. These findings suggest that the megalencephaly of the epileptic chicken is due to an increase in neuron size, with a contribution from increased numbers of neurons and glial cells. The epileptic chicken may provide a valuable model for further dynamic studies of aberrant neuronal development, and of structural-functional relationships in epilepsy.",
