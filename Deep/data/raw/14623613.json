     "AB": "A sensitive, selective and reproducible HPLC method for determination of tiazofurin in rat brain was developed and validated. The method allowed determination and quantification of nanomolar concentrations of tiazofurin in brain and its regions (hippocampus, cortex and striatum) of treated animals. Separation of tiazofurin from other peaks from brain tissue was achieved by isocratic elution on reverse phase chromatographic column. The mobile phase consisted of 0.05 M sodium acetate pH 4.6. Run time was 15 min.",
