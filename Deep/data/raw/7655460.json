     "AB": "Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common form of inherited neuromuscular disease in adults and is characterized by progressive muscle wasting and myotonia. The mutation responsible for DM has been identified as the amplification of a polymorphic (CTG)n repeat in the 3' untranslated region of a gene encoding a serine/threonine kinase (DMK). We have produced a polyclonal rabbit antibody preparation against a fusion protein encoding the C-terminal amino acids 471-629 of the human DMK gene. This antibody specifically detects products of both full length and truncated human DMK genes expressed in bacteria and in insect cells. On immunoblots, we observed protein species of approximately 74 and 82 kDa in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, ependyma and choroid plexus. By immunofluorescence, DMK was found to localize post-synaptically at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle, at intercalated discs of cardiac tissue and at the apical membrane of the ependyma and choroid plexus. We have also detected two to three species (approximately 45-50 kDa) in other regions of the brain. Synaptic localization of DMK in the cerebellum, hippocampus, midbrain and medulla was noted. These results suggest that DMK plays a specialized role in intercellular communication.",
