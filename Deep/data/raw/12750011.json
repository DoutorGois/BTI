     "AB": "Inward-rectifier potassium channels gated by the direct action of G proteins are activated or inhibited by numerous neurotransmitters and they modulate neuronal excitability. Using an olfactory associative task, the effect of Kir3.1 subunit knockdown was tested on learning and memory. Repeated intracerebroventricular injections of antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide to the Kir3.1 subunit significantly reduced hippocampal expression of its mRNA target determined by Western blotting. The antisense knockdown had no effect on locomotor and drinking activity or on attention processes. The reduction in Kir3.1 subunit impaired the learning of the odor associations and the procedural side of the task. This reduction correlated with the performance impairment. The results suggest that Kir3.1 channel activity is implicated in the memory processes.",
