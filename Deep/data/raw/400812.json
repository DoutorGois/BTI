     "AB": "Research on the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) is reviewed with respect to questions of its reliability, factor structure, construct validity, and utility. The relationship of Memory Quotient to Full Scale IQ is explored and the conditions under which disparity between the two scores may be clinically useful indicated. Despite its numerous limitations, the WMS has been a sensitive test of short-term verbal memory. As such, it may be helpful in identifying impairment of the dominant (left) temporal lobe and its medial hippocampal connections. The test is badly in need of re-standardization, however, and suggestions for improving the instrument are made.",
