     "AB": "Indirubins are natural occurring alkaloids extracted from indigo dye-containing plants. Indirubins could inhibit various kinases, and might be used to treat chronic myelocytic leukemia, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. 7-bromoindirubin-3-oxime (7Bio), an indirubin derivative derived from indirubin-3-oxime, possesses inhibitory effects against cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta), two pharmacological targets of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we have discovered that 2.3-23.3 mug/kg 7Bio effectively prevented beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomer-induced impairments of spatial cognition and recognition without affecting bodyweight and motor functions in mice. Moreover, 7Bio potently inhibited Abeta oligomer-induced expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Furthermore, 7Bio significantly prevented the decreased expression of synapsin-1 and PSD-95, biomarkers of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic proteins in Abeta oligomer-treated mice. The mean optical density (OD) with hyper-phosphorylated tau (pTau), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CD45 positive staining in the hippocampus of 7Bio-treated mice were significantly decreased compared to those of Abeta oligomer-treated mice. In addition, Western blotting analysis showed that 7Bio attenuated Abeta oligomer-decreased expression of pSer9-GSK3beta. Those results suggested that 7Bio could potently inhibit Abeta oligomer-induced neuroinflammation, synaptic impairments, tau hyper-phosphorylation, and activation of astrocytes and microglia, which may contribute to the neuroprotective effects of 7Bio. Based on these findings, we expected that 7Bio might be developed as a novel anti-AD lead compound.",
