     "AB": "Acetylcholine (Ach) was tested for its effect on calcium currents in primary cultures of embryonic rat hippocampal neurons. Ach reversibly depressed, in a dose-dependent way, the high voltage activated (HVA) Ca currents. The effect was antagonized by atropine. Our results suggest that a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive GTP binding protein (G-protein) is involved in the signal transduction mechanism between the Ach receptor and the HVA Ca channel. Activating rather than depressive effects of Ach were observed on the low voltage-activated component of Ca currents. This effect was also antagonized by atropine but is not mediated by a PTX-sensitive G-protein.",
