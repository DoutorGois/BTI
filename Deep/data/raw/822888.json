     "AB": "Identification of brain sites where physiologic activity was correlated with subjective emotional experiences in patients undergoing treatment was the starting point for our investigations of the neural basis for emotion and related clinically documented behavioral phenomena. By use of anatomic and physiologic techniques, the neural substrate has been shown to be notably different from that which continues to be described in textbooks, that is, the limbic system. Establishing the neurophysiologic basis for emotion has led to effective treatment for some neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Further, it has provided a basis for defining the origin of certain clinical disorders that are still obscure, the first step toward development of their specific treatment.",
