     "AB": "Using whole cell patch-clamp recordings from pyramidal cells acutely dissociated from rat hippocampal slices, Ro-15 1788 (flumazenil, FLU) was shown to enhance the GABAA-receptor mediated currents evoked by application of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and to antagonize the enhancing effect of the benzodiazepine agonist flurazepam (FZP) on the GABAA response. Both FLU and FZP increased the peak and the steady-state components of the responses and accelerated the current decay. This suggests that both agents act via a common mechanism on GABA transmission. It is concluded that FLU possesses high affinity for the binding site, but low efficacy on the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor. This suggests that FLU acts as a partial agonist on GABAA receptors.",
