     "AB": "Peter Venables proposed that an input dysfunction, which causes the brain to lose its ability to control the flood of sensory information into its higher level processing areas, might be an important pathophysiological mechanism in schizophrenia. The hypothesis was part of his general belief that even the most severe psychopathology arises from aberrations in normal brain psychophysiology. Neurobiological and genetic investigations based on his initial observations include the demonstration that diminished inhibition of the auditory-evoked response to repeated stimuli is a genetically determined deficit, linked to one of the chromosomal loci that is also responsible for the part of the genetically transmitted risk for schizophrenia. Increasing evidence that schizophrenia is a multigenetic illness prompts reconsideration of the nature of schizotypy. Individual genes that convey part of the risk for schizophrenia may be quite common in the general population and cause relatively subtle changes in psychophysiology. Thus, as predicted by Venables, the substrates of schizotypy and schizophrenia may arise from variants in normal brain function.",
