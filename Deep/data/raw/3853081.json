     "AB": "The mechanisms mediating selective attention are not currently known. Dysfunctional selective attention is a common and prominent finding in a variety of medical and psychiatric conditions. A hypothesis is developed that efferents from the hippocampal formation are the final common pathway of processes which determine the noteworthiness of both exteroceptive and interoceptive stimuli, and that dysfunction of these efferents is a common pathway for a variety of anatomical, electrophysiological, and neurochemical lesions. This hypothesis suggests that clinical syndromes of disordered attention may be caused by various lesions of efferent connections from hippocampal formation to nucleus accumbens. The hypothesis further addresses the possibility that the threshold of hippocampus to various classes of stimuli may change on a diurnal and phasic basis. Experimental evidence that bears on the hypothesis is reviewed and experimental implications of the hypothesis are explored.",
