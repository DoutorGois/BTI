     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The present study tested the hypothesis that inappropriate activation of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) contributes to the pathogenesis of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and cognitive impairment during development of salt-dependent hypertension. Effects of an angiotensin II (AngII) type-1 receptor blocker (ARB), at a dose that did not reduce blood pressure, were also examined. METHODS: Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) rats at 6 weeks of age were assigned to three groups: low-salt diet (DSS/L; 0.3% NaCl), high-salt diet (DSS/H; 8% NaCl), and high-salt diet treated with ARB, olmesartan at 1 mg/kg. RESULTS: DSS/H rats exhibited hypertension, leakage from brain microvessels in the hippocampus, and impaired cognitive functions, which were associated with increased brain AngII levels, as well as decreased mRNA levels of tight junctions (TJs) and collagen-IV in the hippocampus. In DSS/H rats, olmesartan treatment, at a dose that did not alter blood pressure, restored the cognitive decline, and ameliorated leakage from brain microvessels. Olmesartan also decreased brain AngII levels and restored mRNA expression of TJs and collagen-IV in DSS/H rats. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that during development of salt-dependent hypertension, activation of the brain RAS contributes to BBB disruption and cognitive impairment. Treatment with an ARB could elicit neuroprotective effects in cognitive disorders by preventing BBB permeability, which is independent of blood pressure changes.",
