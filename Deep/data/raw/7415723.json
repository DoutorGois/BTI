The architectonic structures of the monkey brain develop in the prenatal period, and by the time of the birth they have already been formed to a greater degree than the analogous structures in the human newborn. A substantial difference of the ontogenesis of the above cortical structures in man consists in development of limitrophe structures and appearance of new structural units. A specific feature of the development of the limbic and entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus of the human brain, as compared with that in rhesus macacas, is a longer duration of their postnatal ontogenesis. The main development of the cortical structures of the human brain proceeds after the birth.",
