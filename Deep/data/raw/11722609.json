     "AB": "Neuronal loss, gliosis and axonal sprouting in the hippocampal formation are characteristics of the syndrome of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). In the post-status epilepticus (SE) rat model of spontaneous seizures these features of the MTS syndrome can be reproduced. To get a global view of the changes in gene expression in the hippocampus we applied serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) during the early phase of epileptogenesis (latent period), prior to the onset of the first spontaneous seizure. A total of 10 000 SAGE tags were analyzed per experimental group, resulting in 5053 (SE) and 5918 (control group) unique tags (genes), each representing a specific mRNA transcript. Of these, 92 genes were differentially expressed in the hippocampus of post-SE rats in comparison to controls. These genes appeared to be mainly associated with ribosomal proteins, protein processing, axonal growth and glial proliferation proteins. Verification of two of the differentially expressed genes by in situ hybridization confirmed the changes found by SAGE. Histological analysis of hippocampal sections obtained 8 days after SE showed extensive cell loss, mossy fibre sprouting and gliosis in hippocampal sub regions. This study identifies new high-abundant genes that may play an important role in post-SE epileptogenesis.",
