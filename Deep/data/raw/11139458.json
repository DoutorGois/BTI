     "AB": "In this study the regulation of cardiac sympathetic outflow by presynaptic P(2X) receptor-gated ion channels was examined. ATP (30 microM - 1 mM) and other P2-receptor agonists elicited [(3)H]-noradrenaline ([(3)H]-NA) outflow from the isolated guinea-pig right atrium with the potency order of ATP>2-methyl-thioATP>alpha,beta-methylene-ATP=ADP, whereas ss, gamma-methylene-L-ATP was inactive. Ca(2+)-free conditions abolished both electrical field stimulation (EFS)- and ATP-evoked release of tritium. Unlike from EFS-induced outflow, ATP-induced [(3)H]-NA outflow was not reduced by omega-Conotoxin-GVIA (100 nM), Cd(2+) (100 microM) and tetrodotoxin (1 microM). The rapid extracellular decomposition of ATP was revealed by HPLC analysis. However, the effect of ATP to promote [(3)H]-NA release was not prevented by 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX, 250 nM), 3, 7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (DMPX, 250 nM), or by reactive blue 2 (RB2, 10 microM), antagonists of A(1)-, A(2)- and inhibitory P(2) receptors. Zn(2+) (50 microM), the P(2X)-receptor modulator potentiated, and P(2X) receptor antagonists, i.e. suramin (300 microM), pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS, 30 microM) and 2'-o-(trinitrophenyl)-adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP, 30 microM) antagonized the ATP (1 mM)-evoked response. RT - PCR study revealed the expression of P(2X2) and P(2X3) receptor mRNAs in guinea-pig superior cervical ganglion. PPADS (30 microM) significantly reduced the EFS-induced [(3)H]-NA outflow in the presence DPCPX (250 nM) and RB2 (10 microM). In summary a P(2X)-type purinoceptor regulates noradrenaline release from the isolated right atrium of the guinea-pig. The pharmacological profile of the receptor resemble to homo-oligomeric P(2X3) or hetero-oligomeric P(2X2)/P(2X3) complexes, and provide a new target to intervene on sympathetic neuroeffector transmission at the presynaptic site.",
