     "AB": "This study investigated the effects of chronically administered acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) on sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+), K(+)-ATPase), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), multiple unit activity (MUA) and lipid peroxidation (LP) and lipofuscin (LF) concentration in brain regions: cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus, of 24-month-old rats. The activity of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase and GST was enhanced; that of GPx was unaffected. The MUA was increased while the levels of LP and LF were decreased. These novel data provide new additional evidence concerning the antiaging attributes of ALC.",
