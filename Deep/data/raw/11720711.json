     "AB": "The cellular and synaptic distribution of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 was analyzed in the monkey primary visual cortex (area V1), by immunocytochemistry and postembedding immunogold methods. GluR2 immunoreactivity was widely distributed in all of the layers of area V1. A quantitative double labeling analysis in layers II and III revealed that the vast majority of GABAergic interneurons in this area also contained GluR2. Postembedding immunogold analysis revealed that GluR2 immunoreactivity was present at asymmetric synapses on both GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal cells. A quantitative study indicated that the number of GluR2 immunogold particles at asymmetric synapses on pyramidal cells was significantly higher than that on GABAergic interneurons. These results from the primate neocortex are in agreement with and extend our previous studies on the rat hippocampus and amygdala. In view of the dominant role of the GluR2 subunit in regulating calcium flux through AMPA receptors, the differential synaptic distribution of GluR2 on different neuronal types might provide a mechanism for cell-specific response properties to glutamate as well as clues to selective neuronal vulnerability and cell death mediated by calcium-dependent excitotoxic mechanisms.",
