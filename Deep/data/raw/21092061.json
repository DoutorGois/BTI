     "AB": "To investigate and compare the spatial and temporal expression of post-synaptic density-95 (PSD-95) in Fmr1 knockout mice (the animal model of fragile X syndrome, FXS) and wild-type mice brain, on postnatal day 7 (P7), P14, P21, P28 and P90, mice from each group were decapitated, and three principal brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum) were obtained and stored for later experiments. PSD-95 mRNA in the three brain areas was analyzed with quantitative RT-PCR. PSD-95 protein was measured by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot. In the three principal brain areas of Fmr1 knockout mice and wild-type mice, the expression of PSD-95 mRNA and protein were detected at the lowest levels on P7, and then significantly increased on P14, reaching the peak levels in adolescents or adults. Moreover, it was found that PSD-95 mRNA and protein in the hippocampus were significantly decreased in Fmr1 knockout mice during the developmental period (P7, P14, P21 and P28) as well as at adulthood (P90) (P < 0.05, and P < 0.01, respectively). However, there was no significant difference of expression of PSD-95 in the cortex and cerebellum between Fmr1 knockout and wild mice. The expression of PSD-95 in the hippocampus might be regulated by fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) during mice early developmental and adult periods. It is suggested that impairment of PSD-95 is possibly involved in hippocampal-dependent learning defects, which are common in people with FXS.",
