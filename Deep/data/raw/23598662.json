     "AB": "Songbirds perform some remarkable feats of memory, including forming memories for songs and for complex spatial features of their environments. Research into the neural and hormonal control of these behaviors reveals discrete circuits that can retain considerable plasticity in adulthood. The songbird brain is also a prominent site of estrogen synthesis and a target of estrogen action. Estrogens contribute to the plasticity of the adult songbird brain and contribute to the bird's capacity to form and retrieve some memories. We describe the brain, behavior and endocrinology of songbirds and discuss these findings within the context of the neurology of the aging brain.",
