     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative dementia characterized by pathological senile plaques composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Bone marrow-derived monocytes of patients with AD migrate across the blood-brain barrier into the brain, but are defective at clearing Abeta in the neuritic plaques. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, in patients with AD, we found that cathepsin D, a major lysosomal aspartic protease, was underexpressed in monocytes, resulting in the defective degradation of Abeta by monocytes/macrophages. Further, downregulation of cathepsin D in THP-1 cells significantly reduced the clearance of amyloid plaques in the brain sections of AbetaPP/PS1 mice. The clearance ability was recovered by the overexpression of cathepsin D in AD monocytes. These results suggest that decreased expression of cathepsin D in the peripheral monocytes is a potential signature of AD, and that this decreased expression is involved in Abeta degradation and AD pathogenesis.",
