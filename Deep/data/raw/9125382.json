This article describes the evolution of approaches beginning from herpes amplicon vectors with constitutive gene expression to herpes vectors with regulated gene expression and concludes with the development of a combined germline/somatic gene transfer method that allows for highly versatile spatial and temporal control of in vivo gene expression. Where possible examples of each approach are provided. In addition, the advantages and limitations of the approaches are discussed.",
