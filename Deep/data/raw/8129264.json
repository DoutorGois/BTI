     "AB": "The most prominent neuropathological and behavioral changes induced by trimethyltin (TMT) in different mammalian species were reviewed. From the analysis of the reported literature it becomes evident that the neuropathological effects are selectively present in the limbic system structures. In particular, the granular neurons of the fascia dentata and the pyramidal cells of the Ammon's horn are involved, with a different pattern of severity and extension according to the various species studied and to the dosage-schedule used. The neurological damage produced by TMT to several limbic structures is related to overt behavioral changes. TMT acute exposure in adult rats produces a remarkable behavioral syndrome, consisting in tremors, spontaneous seizures, tail mutilation, vocalization, hyper-reactivity and intra-specific aggression. Impairments in learning and memory processes are also induced following acute treatment. Specific behavioral changes in various species reflect the different sensitivity and vulnerability to the chemical compounds. In addition, prenatal and postnatal exposure induce long-term behavioral and neurological effects on developing central nervous system.",
