     "AB": "In the present study we evaluated the effect of acute homocysteine (Hcy) administration on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity, as well as on some parameters of oxidative stress such as total radical-trapping antioxidant potential (TRAP) and on activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in rat hippocampus. Results showed that Hcy significantly decreased TRAP, Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and CAT activities, without affecting the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. We also verified the effect of chronic pretreatment with vitamins E and C on the reduction of TRAP, Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and CAT activities caused by Hcy. Vitamins E and C per se did not alter these parameters, but prevented the reduction of TRAP, Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and CAT activities caused by Hcy. Our results indicate that oxidative stress is probably involved in the pathogenesis of homocystinuria and that reduction of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity may be related to the neuronal dysfunction found in homocystinuric patients.",
