It has been demonstrated that the hippocampal theta rhythm consists of a regular constituent and an irregular constituent of high dimension, the interrelationship of which varies within wide limits depending upon the state of the animal. Frequency components of the regular and irregular constituents were identified. The mechanisms of their formation are considered and some hypotheses regarding their biological nature are proposed.",
