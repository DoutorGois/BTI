     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Neuroadaptations of GABAergic and glutamatergic systems appear to play an important role in both the acute as well as chronic effects of ethanol. Chronic ethanol intake leads to the development of ethanol tolerance and dependence that is associated with a decrease in GABAergic and an increase in glutamatergic function. The present report assessed the involvement of GABA and glutamate transporters in the chronic ethanol-induced adaptations of these two neuronal systems. METHODS: Male and female rats were made ethanol dependent by 2-week administration of ethanol in a liquid diet. Levels of GABA (GAT-1, GAT-3) and glutamate (GLT-1, EAAC-1) transporters were assayed by immunoblotting. Transporter function was assessed by [3H]GABA and [3H]glutamate uptake assays. RESULTS: Ethanol dependence did not alter levels of GABA or glutamate transporters in cerebral cortex compared with pair-fed control values. There were increases in some, but not all, transporter levels in hippocampus and hypothalamus with the development of ethanol dependence. A decreased rate of uptake was observed for GABA in cerebral cortex. There was no change in maximal GABA uptake or in glutamate uptake (Vmax). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that alterations in GABA and glutamate transporters have only a limited role in neuroadaptations to chronic ethanol intake in rats. However, the observed alterations were region-specific, supporting the complex responses to chronic ethanol exposure and suggesting that neuroadaptations of GABAergic and glutamatergic systems vary across the brain.",
