     "AB": "Changes in the concentration of a newly discovered peptide, neuropeptide Y (NPY) have been determined in the developing rat brain using a recently developed radioimmunoassay and chromatographic analysis. NPY was present in the brain stem (14.8 +/- 5.6 pmol/g) and diencephalon (12.1 +/- 12.1 pmol/g) in the earliest embryos studied (14 days postconception), but appeared only on the 19th day postconception in the cerebral cortex. The concentrations of NPY showed a rapid postnatal rise in all regions examined. The finding of NPY early in the development of the embryonic rat brain and particularly in caudal regions has some similarities to the pattern of development of the catecholaminergic system.",
