     "AB": "Infection of newborn rats with Borna disease virus (BDV) leads to persistence in the absence of overt signs of inflammation. BDV persistence, however, causes cerebellar hypoplasia and hippocampal dentate gyrus neuronal cell loss, which are accompanied by diverse neurobehavioral abnormalities. Neurotrophins and their receptors play important roles in the differentiation and survival of hippocampal and cerebellar neurons. We have examined whether BDV can cause alterations in the neurotrophin network, thus promoting neuronal damage. We have used RNase protection assay to measure mRNA levels of the neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and their trkC and trkB receptors, as well as the growth factors insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), in the cerebellum and hippocampus of BDV-infected and control rats at different time points p.i. Reduced mRNA expression levels of NT-3, BDNF and NGF were found after day 14 p.i. in the hippocampus, but not in the cerebellum, of newborn infected rats. Three weeks after infection, trkC mRNA expression levels were reduced in both hippocampus and cerebellum of infected rats, whereas decreased trkB mRNA levels were only observed in the cerebellum. Reduced trkC mRNA expression was confined to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, as assessed by in situ hybridization. TUNEL assay revealed massive apoptotic cell death in the dentate gyrus of infected rats at days 27 and 33 p.i. Increased numbers of apoptotic cells were also detected in the cerebellar granular layer of infected rats after 8 days p.i. Moreover, a dramatic loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells was seen after day 27 p.i. Our results support the hypothesis, that BDV-induced alterations in neurotrophin systems might contribute to selective neuronal cell death.",
