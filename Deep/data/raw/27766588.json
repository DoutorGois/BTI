     "AB": "Alterations in grey matter structure and functional connectivity (FC) are pathological features of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the relationship between brain structural and functional impairments in MDD remains uncertain. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between alterations in grey matter volume (GMV) and resting-state global functional connectivity density (rs-gFCD) in MDD. Forty-five patients with MDD and 48 healthy controls underwent structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). GMV and rs-gFCD maps of each subject were created, and the intergroup differences in these neuroimaging metrics were evaluated. Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD displayed reduced GMV in the left insula, putamen, amygdala and hippocampus (mainly in the limbic system). In contrast, decreased rs-gFCD was observed in the left postcentral and precentral gyri, right fusiform gyrus and lingual gyrus (mainly in the sensory system). Furthermore, we found no significant correlations between GMV and rs-gFCD in these brain regions. Finally, overlap ratio analysis demonstrated that the spatial distribution patterns of intergroup differences on the GMV and rs-gFCD maps were distinct. Our findings suggest that the presence of distinct spatial distribution patterns of brain atrophy and global FC impairments might be pathological features of MDD.",
