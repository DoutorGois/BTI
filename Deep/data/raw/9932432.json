     "AB": "A variety of methods has been developed based on in vivo microdialysis which allow one to examine the NO/cGMP signal transduction system in action in behaving animals. The extracellular levels of cGMP, the NO oxidative products nitrate and nitrite, and NO itself can all be determined. Using these methods changes in NO and cGMP production in response to pharmacological manipulations can be examined in vivo. In addition, it has been discovered that the activity of this system varies with the behavioral state of the animal. NO and cGMP appear to act via distinct downstream effectors in different brain regions. This opens up the possibility of selectively manipulating NO and cGMP signaling in discrete neuronal populations.",
