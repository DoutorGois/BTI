     "AB": "Aging is associated with a deterioration of cognitive performance and with increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study we tested whether the specific phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil could ameliorate the age-dependent cognitive impairments shown by the senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8). Sildenafil administration (7.5 mg/kg for 4 weeks) to 5-month-old SAMP8 mice attenuated spatial learning and memory impairments shown by these mice in the Morris Water Maze. Tau hyperphosphorylation (AT8 but not PHF-1 epitope) shown by SAMP8 mice at this age was also decreased in the hippocampus of sildenafil-treated mice, an effect probably related to a decrease in cyclin-dependent kinase 5 protein expression and activity (p25/p35 ratio). Interestingly, sildenafil also phosphorylated Akt, which was associated with an increase of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta phosphorylation, providing a plausible explanation for the reductions in tau hyperphosphorylation (AT8 and PHF-1 epitopes) and attenuation of cognitive deficits shown by 9-month-old SAMP8 mice. Overall, sildenafil might be beneficial in age-related brain dysfunction and could be an emerging candidate for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases.",
