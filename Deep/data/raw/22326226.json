     "AB": "A unique custom-made tetrode microdrive for recording from large numbers of neurons in several areas of primate brain is described as a means for assessing simultaneous neural activity in cortical and subcortical structures in nonhuman primates (NHPs) performing behavioral tasks. The microdrive device utilizes tetrode technology with up to six ultra-thin microprobe guide tubes (0.1mm) that can be independently positioned, each containing reduced diameter tetrode and/or hexatrode microwires (0.02 mm) for recording and isolating single neuron activity. The microdrive device is mounted within the standard NHP cranial well and allows traversal of brain depths up to 40.0 mm. The advantages of this technology are demonstrated via simultaneously recorded large populations of neurons with tetrode type probes during task performance from a) primary motor cortex and deep brain structures (caudate-putamen and hippocampus) and b) multiple layers within the prefrontal cortex. The means to characterize interactions of well-isolated ensembles of neurons recorded simultaneously from different regions, as shown with this device, has not been previously available for application in primate brain. The device has extensive application to primate models for the detection and study of inoperative or maladaptive neural circuits related to human neurological disorders.",
