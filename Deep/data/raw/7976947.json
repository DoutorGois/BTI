     "AB": "PURPOSE: To determine the association of an MR abnormality and a positron emission tomography (PET) abnormality with a good outcome in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy after lobectomy, the association of combined PET and MR findings with good outcomes after lobectomy, and MR and PET pathologic correlation. METHODS: MR and PET were performed on 27 patients in a blinded study. Histologic studies were correlated with foci of increased T2 signal. RESULTS: Increased signal or decreased volume of the hippocampus was noted in 13 of 15 patients with mesial temporal sclerosis. Twelve of 15 had positive PET findings. MR identified 20 (83%) of the 24 patients with good outcomes. PET identified 71%. When MR and PET were combined, they detected 95% of the patients with good outcome. Region of interest measurements of the hippocampus in 11 study patients and 7 control subjects documented a significant increase in signal in the patients with seizures. Histologic correlative studies demonstrated that increased T2 signals related to astrocytosis in the hippocampus and adjacent white matter. CONCLUSIONS: MR (increased signal and decreased volume of the hippocampus) significantly improved the capability to identify those persons who would be helped by lobectomy. MR sensitivity exceeded that of PET.",
