     "AB": "Hippocampal cells were cultured in 24-well culture plates with enriched populations of neuron or glial cells. The [3H]adenosine uptake by 7-10-day cultures of these cells was dependent on temperature, but independent of extracellular Na+. The uptake of adenosine (10 microM) for 15 s was greatly blocked by addition of 100 microM dipyridamole, 50-200 microM propentofylline or 50 microM of 2-chloroadenosine or nitrobenzylthioinosine in both cells and by 100 microM pentoxifylline in neuron. Either caffeine or theophylline (50 microM each) had no effect on the uptake by these cells. Inhibition of the adenosine uptake by propentofylline was demonstrated to be competitive in both cells.",
