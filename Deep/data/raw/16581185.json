     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive and memory deterioration. Production and accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is central to the pathogenesis of AD. Recent studies have demonstrated that PKA/CREB-dependent signaling pathway and long-term potentiation are inhibited by sublethal concentrations of Abeta(1-42) in cultured hippocampus neurons. Here, we examined the effects of nobiletin on the Abeta-induced inhibition of CREB phosphorylation in cultured rat hippocampus neurons. A sublethal concentration of Abeta(1-42) or Abeta(1-40) decreased glutamate-induced CREB phosphorylation, whereas pretreatment with nobiletin reversed the Abeta-induced decrease in CREB phosphorylation. The effects of nobiletin on impairment of learning ability were also examined in chronically Abeta(1-40) infused AD model rats using the eight-arm radial maze. In the AD model rats, nobiletin showed protective effects on Abeta(1-40)-induced impairment of learning ability. These results suggest that nobiletin has the potential for becoming a novel lead compound for drug development for AD.",
