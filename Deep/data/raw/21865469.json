     "AB": "Telomere and telomerase alterations have been reported in mood disorders. However, the role of telomerase in depression remains unclear. Here we show that chronic mild stress (CMS) led to a significant decrease in telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) level and telomerase activity in the hippocampus. Treatment with antidepressant fluoxetine reversed the CMS-induced TERT and telomerase activity changes. Inhibiting telomerase by systemic administration (100 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1), i.p., for 14 d), intrahippocampal microinjection (0.7 mumol, 2 mul), or infusion (using an osmotic minipump, 0.134 mug/mul, 0.25 mul/h) of 3'-azido-deoxythymidine (AZT) resulted in depression-like behaviors and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. In contrast, overexpressing telomerase by intrahippocampal infusion of recombinant adenovirus vector expressing mouse TERT (Ad-mTERT-GFP) led to neurogenesis upregulation, produced antidepressant-like behaviors, and prevented the CMS-induced behavioral modifications. Disrupting neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus by X-irradiation (15 Gy) of a restricted region of mouse brain containing the hippocampus abolished the antidepressant-like effect of Ad-mTERT-GFP. Additionally, AZT had no effect on DNA polymerase activity and did not cause cell damage in vitro and in vivo. Microinjection of AZT into the subventricular zone of lateral ventricle (0.7 mumol, 2 mul) inhibited local neurogenesis but had no behavioral effect. These results suggest that hippocampal telomerase is involved in the modulation of depression-related behaviors, possibly by regulating adult neurogenesis.",
