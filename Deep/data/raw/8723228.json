     "AB": "Astrocytes actively maintain their intracellular pH (pHi) more alkaline than expected by passive distribution of H+. Acid extruding transporters such as the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) are necessary for pH regulation. Currently, four mammalian NHEs (NHE1-NHE4) have been cloned, with a fifth (NHE5) partially cloned. We attempted to determine which isoform(s) of NHE was present in cultured hippocampal astrocytes using amiloride sensitivity and immunospecificity as criteria. In the absence of HCO3-, amiloride blocked pHi recovery after an acid load with an IC50 of approximately 3.18 microM, similar to values reported for the amiloride-sensitive isoforms NHE1 and NHE2. Immunoblotting with a highly specific antibody for NHE1 identified a 100 kDa protein, indicating the presence of NHE1 in whole brain, hippocampus, and cultured hippocampal astrocytes. Further probing for an additional amiloride-sensitive NHE failed to detect evidence of the presence of NHE4. Surprisingly, application of the potent analog of amiloride, ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA), caused a reversible alkalinization of pHi, suggesting the presence of an additional acid/base transport mechanism that is EIPA-sensitive.",
