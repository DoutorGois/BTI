     "AB": "We examined the effects of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) C-terminal fragment 4-9, which facilitates learning and memory, on the extracellular acetylcholine (ACh) release in hippocampus of freely-moving rats using the microdialysis technique. Following administration of AVP4-9, p-Glu-Asn-Cys[Cys]-Pro-Arg-Gly-NH2, through the dialysis probe into the hippocampus, ACh levels in dialysates from the hippocampus increased markedly in dose and time dependent manner at 2-2.5 and 2.5-3 hr. AVP1-9, the parent peptide, has a similar enhancing effect on ACh release as AVP4-9. Stimulated ACh release by AVP4-9 was significantly inhibited by V1-selective receptor antagonist ([1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid), 2-(O-methyl)-tyrosine]AVP), but not by V2-selective antagonist ([1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid), 2-D-Ile, 4-Ile]AVP). From these observations, it is demonstrated that AVP4-9 stimulates the ACh release in rat hippocampus via mediating V1-like vasopressin receptors.",
