     "AB": "Pregnant Wistar rats were treated during the eighth day of gestation (GD8) with two IP injections, spaced by an interval of 4 h, of either ethanol (2.9 g/kg in saline solution) or saline. At 45 days of age, rats prenatally exposed to alcohol showed an improved hippocampal synaptic plasticity in granule cells layer of dentate gyrus. This was assessed measuring the threshold to generate long-term potentiation (LTP) on hippocampal slices. We propose that this result might account for the good performance in some learning tasks observed in animals prenatally exposed to alcohol during short periods.",
