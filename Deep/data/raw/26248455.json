     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the expression of corticotropin-releasing factor-1 receptor in hippocampus of rats model of salicylate induced tinnitus. METHOD: Twenty-four rats were randomly divided into three groups, eight for each group. For Group A and Group B, 10% salicylic sodium solution was intraperitoneal injected each day at the dose of 350 mg/kg for 21 days in Group A and 14 days in Group B. Group C received intraperitoneal injection with the same amount of saline solution each day for 14 days. ABR were tested 2 days before, and 2 hours after the first administration and after the last injection. Immunohistochemical test and Western Blot were utilized to detect the expression of CRF1R in hippocampus for each group. RESULT: ABR thresholds tested 2 days before the first administration of the 3 groups showed no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). At the time point of 2 hours after the first injection, the ABR thresholds of Group A and Group B rose by 25.90 dB SPL and 25.03 dB SPL compared with that before the administration, respectively (P < 0. 01). After the last administration, the ABR thresholds of Group A and Group B rose 34.91 dB SPL and 32.62 dB SPI. compared with that before the administration, respectively (P < 0.01). The ABR thresholds of Group C showed no significant statistical difference at all the tested time points (P > 0.05). Immunohistochemical test and Western Blot revealed that the expression level of CRF1R in the hippocampus was A > B > C (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The expression of CRF1R in the hippocampus of salicylate induced tinnitus rat increased with the injection time, illustrating that CRF1R may participate in the mechanism of tinnitus involving the limbic system.",
