     "AB": "Steroid hormones play an influential role in neural development. In addition to androgens and estrogens of fetal and neonatal origin, the developing brain may also be exposed to progesterone. In this regard, identifying forebrain nuclei that are sensitive to progesterone during neural development may elucidate the impact of progesterone on the developing brain. Using immunocytochemistry, the present study documented the distribution of progesterone receptor (PR) expression in the rat forebrain from embryonic day (E) 17 through postnatal day (P) 28. The results indicate that PR expression in the developing brain is extensive, present in numerous forebrain nuclei, but transient, in that PR expression was absent in most nuclei by P28. Regions displaying the highest levels of PR-immunoreactivity (PRir) were found in preoptic and hypothalamic nuclei including the medial preoptic, anteroventral periventricular, arcuate, and ventromedial nuclei. PRir was moderately abundant in the limbic region, particularly in subdivisions of the amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and hippocampus. The choroid plexus and neocortex were additional structures that demonstrated relatively abundant levels of PRir. The presence PR expression in the developing forebrain implicates the involvement of progesterone and PR in fundamental mechanisms of neural development.",
