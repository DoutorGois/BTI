     "AB": "Thresholds of induction of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and heat shock cognate protein (HSC) 70 mRNAs after transient global ischemia in gerbil brain were investigated by in situ hybridization using cloned cDNA probes selective for each mRNA species. In sham control brain, HSP70 mRNA was little present, while HSC70 mRNA was present in most cell populations. A 0.5-min occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries did not affect the amount of HSP70 and HSC70 mRNAs. The selective induction of HSC70 mRNA was observed in dentate granule cells at 1 h, and in most cells of hippocampus especially dentate gyrus at 3 h after 1 min of ischemia when induction of HSP70 mRNA was not evident in the identical brain. The selective induction diminished by 2 days. However, after 2 min of ischemia, HSP70 and HSC70 mRNAs were induced together in hippocampal cells from 1 h of the reperfusion, and the co-induction prolonged in CA1 cells until 2 days. Body temperatures monitored at rectum increased after the reperfusion with a peak at 30 min. The degree of increase of the body temperature was significantly higher in the case after 2-min ischemia than in the cases after 0.5- and 1-min ischemia. Although HSP70 and HSC70 mRNAs are generally co-induced in stressful conditions, our results suggest the different thresholds of the induction between HSP70 and HSC70 mRNAs after transient brain ischemia. The selective induction of HSC70 mRNA which is not accompanied by the induction of HSP70 mRNA may relate to the differences of the duration of ischemia and the degree of the increase of body temperature after ischemia.",
