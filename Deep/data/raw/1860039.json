     "AB": "The effect of hippocampal kindling on protein kinase C (PKC) activity and protein concentration was investigated in rat amygdala/pyriform cortex (AM/PC) and right (contralateral) and left (ipsilateral) hippocampus (HIPP). There was no difference in cytosolic PKC activity between control and kindled groups in any part of the brain. The membrane-associated PKC activity was altered as follows. One week after the last seizure, it was significantly increased in both right (by 26%, P less than 0.05) and left HIPP (by 30%, P less than 0.02). Four weeks after the last seizure, it was significantly increased in the AM/PC (by 14%, P less than 0.02), right HIPP (by 37%, P less than 0.01) and left HIPP (by 24%, P less than 0.05). The protein concentrations in the crude cytosolic extracts prior to elution of PKC through DE-52 columns were significantly increased in the AM/PC (by 11%, P less than 0.05) and right HIPP (by 18%, P less than 0.02) 4 weeks after the last seizure. In the membrane extracts, there was a significant increase by 23% (P less than 0.02) in the left HIPP 1 week after the last seizure. In the fraction co-eluted with PKC, a significant increase in protein concentration of the cytosolic preparation was confirmed in the AM/PC (by 12%, P less than 0.05) as well as in the left HIPP (by 15%, P less than 0.05) 4 and 1 weeks respectively after the last seizure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
