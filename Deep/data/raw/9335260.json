     "AB": "The effects of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope protein gp120 on the release of GABA elicited by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) from rat hippocampal neurons in primary culture has been investigated. NMDA (1-300 microM) increased in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 =37.9+/-12 microM) the release of [3H]-GABA. The effect of 100 microM NMDA was prevented by 30 microM of the GABA transport inhibitor N-(4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl)guvacine (SKF 100330A). Glycine (10 microM) or gp120 (0.01 microM) affected neither the basal nor the NMDA-evoked [3H]-GABA release. The NMDA (100 microM)-evoked release was prevented by 5,7-dichloro-kynurenic acid (5,7-DCKA), a selective antagonist at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 approximately 0.3 microM). Glycine (3-10 microM) or gp120 (0.003-0.01 microM) produced reversal of the 5,7-DCKA antagonism in a way that suggested competition at a same site; gp120 was at least 3 orders of magnitude more potent than glycine. It is suggested that gp120 may mimic glycine at NMDA receptors.",
