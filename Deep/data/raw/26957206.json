     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, and neurodegeneration. However, this pathology is preceded by increased soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) 1-42 oligomers that interfere with the glutamatergic synaptic plasticity required for learning and memory, includingN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). In particular, soluble Abeta(1-42) acutely inhibits LTP and chronically causes synapse loss. Many mechanisms have been proposed for Abeta-induced synaptic dysfunction, but we recently found that Abeta(1-42) inhibits the microtubule motor protein Eg5/kinesin-5. Here we compared the impacts of Abeta(1-42) and monastrol, a small-molecule Eg5 inhibitor, on LTP in hippocampal slices and synapse loss in neuronal cultures. Acute (20-minute) treatment with monastrol, like Abeta, completely inhibited LTP at doses >100 nM. In addition, 1 nM Abeta(1-42) or 50 nM monastrol inhibited LTP #x223c;50%, and when applied together caused complete LTP inhibition. At concentrations that impaired LTP, neither Abeta(1-42) nor monastrol inhibited NMDAR synaptic responses until #x223c;60 minutes, when only #x223c;25% inhibition was seen for monastrol, indicating that NMDAR inhibition was not responsible for LTP inhibition by either agent when applied for only 20 minutes. Finally, 48 hours of treatment with either 0.5-1.0muM Abeta(1-42) or 1-5muM monastrol reduced the dendritic spine/synapse density in hippocampal cultures up to a maximum of #x223c;40%, and when applied together at maximal concentrations, no additional spine loss resulted. Thus, monastrol can mimic and in some cases occlude the impact of Abetaon LTP and synapse loss, suggesting that Abetainduces acute and chronic synaptic dysfunction in part through inhibiting Eg5.",
