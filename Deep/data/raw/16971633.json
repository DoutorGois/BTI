     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy can be used to determine the side of seizure onset in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Some patients with abnormal MR spectroscopy findings also have contralateral abnormalities, which in some cases have been reported to normalize after temporal lobe resection. With the aim of better understanding the mechanisms underlying abnormal MR spectroscopy findings, the current study was performed to define patient features that would predict this postoperative normalization. METHODS: Fifteen patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were subjected to preoperative and postoperative 1H-MR spectroscopy investigations, and the preoperative and postoperative metabolite levels in the contralateral hippocampus and contralateral lateral temporal lobe (CLTL) were determined. RESULTS: In the CLTL, postoperative normalization was more pronounced for patients showing extensive preoperative ipsilateral and contralateral abnormalities on MR spectroscopy. A second factor that influenced the degree to which the metabolite levels changed postoperatively was the focus lateralization. Surgery tended to have a more pronounced effect on the contralateral metabolite levels in patients with a right temporal focus, whereas in patients with left temporal foci, postoperative metabolite levels were virtually unchanged. In the contralateral hippocampal region, neither preoperative abnormalities nor focus side was related to postoperative normalization. CONCLUSIONS: We have thus identified 2 different factors (widespread preoperative MR spectroscopy abnormalities and right-sided focus) that predict postoperative normalization of contralateral MR spectroscopy abnormalities. We suggest that both factors indicate a more generalized epileptic disease (ie, that the patients in whom the MR spectroscopy abnormalities normalize are recovering from a more severe impairment).",
