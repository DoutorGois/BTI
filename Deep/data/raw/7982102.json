     "AB": "The median raphe nucleus (MR) exerts a pronounced desynchronizing influence on the hippocampal EEG. MR stimulation disrupts theta, while MR lesions produce constant uninterrupted theta. The MR receives pronounced excitatory amino acid (EAA)-containing afferents that have been implicated in several MR-mediated behaviors. The present study examined the effects on the hippocampal EEG of MR injections of the following EAA antagonists in the urethane-anesthetized rat: 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate (AP-7), dizocilpine maleate (MK-801), and gamma-glutamyl-aminomethylsulfonic acid (GAMS). MR injections of the competitive (AP-7) and non-competitive (MK-801) N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonists produced theta at short latencies (2.86 min; 4.02 min, respectively) and for long durations (116.1 min; 66.8 min, respectively). It was further shown that the theta-eliciting effects of AP-7 injections could be reliably and temporarily reversed with MR injections of NMDA. MR injections of the kainate/quisqualate receptor antagonist (GAMS) also produced theta at relatively short latencies (6.5 min) and for long durations (60.5 min) indicating that EAA effects on the MR are not NMDA receptor specific. Injections of each of the foregoing EAA antagonists into regions of the brainstem adjacent to the MR including the dorsal raphe nucleus and the medullary or pontine reticular formation generated theta at very long latencies or were without effect. The present findings indicate EAA afferents to the MR normally exert an excitatory influence on the MR in its desynchronization of the hippocampal EEG, whereas the removal of EAA inputs to MR produces the opposite: a reduction of MR activity and hence the elicitation of theta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
