Ample amounts of both enzymes were demonstrated in the brains and there was little difference between the various parts of the brain. There were only small differences in the enzymic activities between the two groups indicating that deficiencies of these enzymes are not a very likely cause of brain degeneration in dementias of Alzheimer type.",
