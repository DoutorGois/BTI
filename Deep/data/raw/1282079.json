     "AB": "Our previous studies have revealed that the predegeneration facilitated the neurite outgrowth from hippocampus following the peripheral nerve grafts implantation. The aim of the present work is to find whether the stimulative power of peripheral nerve grafts depends on the time lapse after the transection. Autologous predegenerated distal stumps of the rat sciatic nerves were implanted into the hippocampus on the 7th, 14th, 28th, and 35th day following the transection. Six weeks later, horseradish peroxidase conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate was injected into the graft and frozen sections of brains were made. Fluorescence microscope examination has shown that FITC-HRP labeled cells were present among the hippocampal neurons in all the brains under examination, excluding these grafted with 14-day predegenerated peripheral nerves. The FITC-HRP labeled neurons were particularly numerous when the 7- and 35-day-old predegenerated stumps were used as grafts.",
