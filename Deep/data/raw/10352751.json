     "AB": "The long-term effects of post-ischaemic hypothermia are controversial. The purpose of this study was to examine the long-term effects of post-ischaemic hypothermia on neuronal survival in gerbils in terms of morphology and function. Hypothermia was induced at 32 degrees C for 4 h immediately after ischaemia. Examination was performed at 1 week and at 1 month after ischaemia. Post-ischaemic hypothermia prevented CA1 neuronal damage 1 week after ischaemia. At 1 month after ischaemic insult, however, the degree of the protective effect of post-ischaemic hypothermia was reduced in the lateral and medial CA1 areas. DNA fragmentation was also observed at 1 month. The errors in the 8-arm radial maze trial were increased at 1 month. These data may indicate that cells in the CA1 area are very vulnerable to ischaemia and die after post-ischaemic hypothermia, and that their death is associated with apoptosis.",
