     "AB": "Four putative central nervous system 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonists, methysergide, cyproheptadine, metergoline, and ketanserin and also lysergic acid diethylamide were applied by iontophoresis to firing CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells to test their action on the inhibition produced by 5-hydroxytryptamine. In contrast to a previous report, none of these peripherally active 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonists altered the inhibitory response to submaximal doses of 5-hydroxytryptamine, but they did block after-excitations that followed the inhibitions. All the antagonists and lysergic acid diethylamide produced a depression of firing. When picrotoxin was used to drive the cells, 5-hydroxytryptamine was still able to produce a normal inhibition. The results of this study suggest that CA1 hippocampus is another structure, innervated by serotonergic neurones, where all (peripherally active) serotonin antagonists tested to date are ineffective against 5-hydroxytryptamine induced inhibition.",
