     "AB": "The regions projecting to Gudden's tegmental nuclei were examined by retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase or wheat-germ-agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase. Gudden's tegmental nuclei in the rabbit can be divided into a pars principalis of the ventral tegmental nucleus (TVP), a pars ventralis of the dorsal tegmental nucleus (TDV), and a pars dorsalis of the dorsal tegmental nucleus (TDD). The TVP receives many fibers from the medial division of the ipsilateral medial mammillary nucleus and bilaterally from the lateral habenular nucleus, and additionally some fibers from the posterior nucleus of the interpeduncular complex. The TDV receives many fibers from the ipsilateral lateral mammillary nucleus, from the ipsilateral prepositus hypoglossi nucleus, bilaterally from the lateral habenular nucleus, from the central and paramedian nuclei of the interpeduncular complex, from the bilateral gray matter along the floor of the fourth ventricle, and from the contralateral supragenual nucleus. The TDD receives a projection from the lateral habenular nucleus of both sides and from the central and paramedian nuclei of the interpeduncular complex, and a minor projection from the ipsilateral lateral mammillary nucleus, the posterior nucleus of the interpeduncular complex, the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus, and the contralateral supragenual nucleus.",
