     "AB": "The capacity to initiate attack behavior against a passive standard opponent was measured in 140 male mice belonging to seven different inbred mouse strains. Large strain differences were found, which strongly correlated with the size of the hippocampal intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fibers terminal fields. These results, combined with those obtained from earlier experiments, point to a possible modulating role of the hippocampus in the regulation of attack behavior in male mice.",
