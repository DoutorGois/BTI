     "AB": "Fetuses and neonates are known to be high-risk groups for Methylmercury (MeHg) exposure. MeHg can be transferred to the fetus through the placenta and to newborn offspring through breast milk. The aim of the present study was to investigate the neurotoxic effects of low doses of MeHg (1 and 5mug/mL in drinking water) administration, from gestational day 1 to postnatal day (PND) 21, on the neurobehavioral development of rats. The results showed that the no-observed-effect level of MeHg is somewhere in the range of 1-4mug/mL. Neurobehavioral development analysis revealed a delayed appearance of cliff drop and negative geotaxis reflexes in the 5mug/mL MeHg exposure group. Developmental exposure to MeHg affected locomotor activity functions for the females, but not for the males, implying that the female pups were more vulnerable than the male pups. All pups exposed to 5mug/mL of MeHg showed a significant deficit in motor coordination in the rotarod test compared with controls, and the highest accumulated concentrations of Hg were found in the cerebellum, followed by the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, indicating that the cerebellum is a possible target for MeHg toxicity. We demonstrated adverse effects of developmental exposure to MeHg associated with tissue concentrations very close to the current human body burden of this persistent and bioaccumulative compound.",
