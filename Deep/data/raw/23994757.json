     "AB": "Growing evidence suggests neuroplasticity changes are pivotal in both the occurrence and treatment of affective disorders. Abnormal expression and/or phosphorylation of numerous plasticity-related proteins have been observed in depression, while prolonged antidepressant treatment has been associated with the attenuation of stress-mediated effects on dendritic remodeling and adult hippocampal neurogenesis in experimental animals. This study explores the neurobiological adaptations induced by chronic stress and/or long-term tianeptine treatment. Male and female rats were studied to determine the potential contributory role of sex differences on stress-induced pathology and antidepressant-mediated actions. Our results confirm chronic stress-induced HPA axis disturbance and neuroplasticity impairment in both sexes (i.e. reduced CREB phosphorylation and hippocampal BrdU labeling). Commonly ensuing neurobiological alterations were accompanied by unique sex-specific adaptations. When the antidepressant tianeptine was administered, HPA axis hyperactivity was attenuated and specific neuronal defects were ameliorated in both sexes. These findings provide novel insight into sex-related influences on the neurobiological substrates mediating chronic stress-induced actions on neuroplasticity and the mechanisms underlying tianeptine-mediated therapeutic effects.",
