     "AB": "In a previous work performed on cerebral cortex and hippocampus we reported that tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP), originally identified as a transactivator of osmoprotective genes involved in osmoadaptation of renal cells, was induced in neurons only, but to varying levels, following acute systemic hypertonicity. Whether or not this cellular specificity reflected a unique ability of neurons or a differential time course among brain cells for tonicity-induction of TonEBP was investigated throughout the brain in this study by subjecting the animals to prolonged systemic hypertonicity. In normal rats, TonEBP immunolabeling and TonEBP-mRNA in situ hybridization labeling showed a widespread, uneven and parallel distribution. TonEBP was expressed primarily in the cell nuclei of neurons, where it was heterogeneously distributed in a nucleoplasmic and a granular pool. In rats subjected to prolonged systemic hypertonicity, TonEBP labeling increased in the cell nuclei of neurons only. The tonicity-induced expression of TonEBP for a given cell group of neurons was rather uniform but varied greatly among neuronal cell groups and was positively correlated with the average size of the cell nuclei, as determined by quantitative analysis of digitized images. The detailed distribution of tonicity-induced expression of TonEBP is reported throughout the brain. In normal rats, a very minor proportion of non-neuronal cells, identified as a subset of astrocytes and possibly oligodendrocytes, showed faint nuclear immunolabeling, which however did not increase in hypertonic animals. Ependymocytes, capillary endothelial cells, and microglial cells showed no TonEBP labeling, even in hypertonic animals. Altogether our data indicate that neurons, albeit possibly to a varying extent, are the only brain cells able to use TonEBP-mediated processes for adaptation to a systemic hyperosmotic unbalance.",
