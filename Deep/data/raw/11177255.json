     "AB": "Experiments on rat hippocampal slices showed that high concentrations of nooglutil and mexidol, but not piracetam, suppressed the ortho- and antidromic population responses in the CA1 area evoked by paired stimulation, the orthodromic responses being more sensitive to the drugs. The effects of both drugs were blocked by AP7, a specific antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. It is suggested that N-activation of methyl-D-aspartate receptors by high concentrations of nooglutil and mexidol reduced CA1 pyramidal cell responsiveness.",
