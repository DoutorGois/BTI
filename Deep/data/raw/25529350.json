     "AB": "Diabetic encephalopathy has recently been recognized late complication of diabetes resulting in progressive cognitive deficits. Emerging evidence has indicated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic eye and kidney as well as non-diabetic neurodegeneration. However, there was little direct evidence for the involvement of ER stress in diabetic encephalopathy up to now. In the present work, we investigated the role of ER stress in the pathogenesis of diabetic encephalopathy. Our results have demonstrated the existence of ER stress in the hippocampus of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. STZ injection i.p. rapidly induced up-regulation of the ER stress marker, the prosurvival chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), as early as 6-24h and persisted at least for up to 72h in the hippocampus of mice, indicating the UPR activation soon after STZ administration. The increased expression of GRP78 in hippocampal cells is to relieve the ER stress. With the development of diabetes, the expression of GRP78 decreases while the expression of UPR-associated proapoptotic transcriptional regulator C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) increases significantly in the hippocampal neurons of diabetic mice from 1 week after STZ administration to 12 weeks/the end of the study. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells in the hippocampus of diabetic mice were largely colocalized with NeuN- and CHOP-positive cells, indicating that the up-regulation of CHOP in hippocampal neurons of diabetic mice may promote neuronal apoptosis and account for the damaged learning and memory ability of diabetic mice. Therefore, our study provides evidence that ER stress may play an important role in the pathogenesis of neuronal degeneration and may contribute to cognitive dysfunction of diabetic encephalopathy.",
