     "AB": "Using brain microdialysis and LC-ECD, the content of dopamine in rat brain was detected to investigate the effects of ligustrazine. A liquid chromatography-electrochemical detector method has been established and validated for the determination of dopamine in rat brain dialysate. The results indicate that ligustrazine administration by subcutaneous injection significantly increased dopamine release in rat medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus in a dose-related manner. The drug's effects on dopa release in rat brain could be directly detected by microdialysis combined with HPLC-ECD and this method has the preponderance over traditional neurology methods.",
