     "AB": "The effects of mu, delta and kappa opioid receptor agonists were examined on evoked field potentials in brain slices prepared from rat hippocampus. The effects of the mu-selective opioid peptide [D-Ala2, NMe-Phe4, Met(O)5ol]enkephalin (FK 33-824) and the delta-selective peptide [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE) were qualitatively and quantitatively similar. Both increased the amplitude of evoked population spike responses when perfused in low nanomolar concentrations in a fashion consistent with what has been previously reported for other opiate agonists such as morphine. The kappa-selective agonists bremazocine and U-50, 488H were without effect upon evoked responses at concentrations as high as 10 microM. Bremazocine, but not U-50, 488H, proved to be an extremely potent antagonist of responses to both mu- and delta- selective agonists. Moreover, bremazocine was considerably more potent in antagonizing responses to FK 33-824 than DPDPE, which supports the hypothesis that FK 33-824 and DPDPE act via different receptors. Thus, although bremazocine is an agonist at kappa receptors, it appears to act as an antagonist at other opioid receptor sites.",
