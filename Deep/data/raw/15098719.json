     "AB": "This study examines the activity of hippocampal CA, pyramidal neurons during conditioned fear stress (CFS)-induced freezing behavior in unanesthetized, unrestrained rats. The firing frequency of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons was significantly decreased when conditioned rats exhibited freezing behavior. Firing frequency returned to the baseline after freezing behavior disappeared. The selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A antagonists, N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxam ide (WAY-100635), and N-tert-butyl-3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine-1-yl]-2-phenylpropamide (WAY-100135) and 5-HT depletion with parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA) completely abolished the decrease in firing frequency during CFS-induced freezing behavior. These results suggested that endogenous 5-HT inhibited the firing activity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons during CFS-induced freezing behavior mainly through stimulating 5-HT1A receptors.",
