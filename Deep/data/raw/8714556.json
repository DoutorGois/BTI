     "AB": "1. Steady-state protein and mRNA levels of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger were studied in old (24-month) and young (3-month) brains of male Fischer 344 rats by Western and Northern analysis. 2. Northern analysis with a cDNA proble for the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger amplified from human brain RNA indicated the presence of two transcripts for the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (6 and 16 kb). Both transcripts were present in similar abundance in the cerebrum and hippocampus. In the cerebellum the 6-kb transcript predominated. The cerebellum had the highest overall level of expression. There were no significant age-related effects seen on the level of expression of either transcript in each of the brain areas tested. 3. Western analysis of plasma membrane vesicles purified from cerebral cortex identified a single protein of 116 kDa. Consistent with the Northern analysis, no age-related effect on protein levels was seen. 4. The mechanisms underlying altered Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity in aging rat brain (Michaelis, 1989) most likely do not involve changes in gene expression and are therefore more likely to represent posttranslation modifications of the protein.",
