     "AB": "Cocaine has been found to be a neurobehavioral teratogen in both animals and humans. In this study the effects of cocaine on the developing catecholamine systems were examined. Rats were treated gestationally with cocaine (40 mg/kg s.c.) or saline from gestational day 13 until parturition. On postnatal day 28, tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemistry was performed. Increases in catecholamine fiber densities were observed in the hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, and parietal cortex in cocaine-treated animals. These findings may explain some of the behavioral alterations seen following prenatal cocaine exposure.",
