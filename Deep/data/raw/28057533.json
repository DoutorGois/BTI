     "AB": "Previous studies have indicated that presynaptic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptors (AMPARs) contribute to the regulation of neurotransmitter release. In hippocampal synapses, the presynaptic surface expression of several AMPAR subunits, including GluA2, is regulated in a ligand-dependent manner. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the presynaptic trafficking of AMPARs are still unknown. Here, using bright-field immunocytochemistry, western blots, and quantitative immunogold electron microscopy of the hippocampal CA1 area from intact adult rat brain, we demonstrate the association of AMPA receptors with the presynaptic active zone and with small presynaptic vesicles, in Schaffer collateral synapses in CA1 of the hippocampus. Furthermore, we show that GluA2 and protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1) are colocalized at presynaptic vesicles. Similar to postsynaptic mechanisms, overexpression of either PICK1 or pep2m, which inhibit the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein (NSF)-GluA2 interaction, decreases the concentration of GluA2 in the presynaptic active zone membrane. These data suggest that the interacting proteins PICK1 and NSF act as regulators of presynaptic GluA2-containing AMPAR trafficking between the active zone and a vesicle pool that may provide the basis of presynaptic components of synaptic plasticity.",
