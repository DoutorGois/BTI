     "AB": "Synaptosomes were incubated at various time intervals following injection of 120 micrograms/kg SC of soman or sarin or with various concentrations (10(-8) to 10(-2) M) of soman or sarin in vitro. Total cholinesterase (ChE) activities in each brain region were also measured. Following soman injection, sodium-dependent, high affinity choline uptake (SDHACU) was decreased from 1 to 4 hr in the cortex and from 1 to 2 hr in the hippocampus, but increased from 2 to 24 hr in the striatum. Similarly, following sarin injection SDHACU was decreased at 0.5 hr in the cortex and from 1 to 4 hr in the hippocampus, but increased at 1 hr in the striatum. Injection of soman severely inhibited (83-99%) total ChE activity in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum from 1 to 24 hr. In contrast, sarin did not severely inhibit ChE activity in these regions and maximal inhibition (40-60%) did not occur until 24 hr after injection. With both compounds, by 168 hr ChE activity in all regions had partially recovered. Incubation of synaptosomes with soman or sarin in vitro at concentrations below 10(-4) M did not affect SDHACU in any of the brain regions. These data demonstrated that acute soman and sarin injection produced similar effects upon SDHACU in different brain regions, although the time-course of these effects was different for the two compounds. These effects were probably neither due to a direct action of these compounds on the uptake process nor dependent on ChE inhibition.",
