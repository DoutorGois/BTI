     "AB": "LiCl-induced (5 mEq/kg) regional differences in the cerebral phosphoinositide (PI) cycle were studied by measuring inositol-1-phosphate (Ins-1-P), an intermediate in the PI cycle, in male Sprague Dawley and Han/Wistar rats by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Control Ins-1-P levels were higher frontally than caudally in both rat strains. LiCl increased Ins-1-P levels 1.8 to 7.4 fold in different regions of brain of Sprague Dawley rats but only 1.2 to 1.8 fold in Han/Wistar rats. This strain difference offers a way to compare the effects of lithium on PI metabolism versus receptor-G protein-phospholipase C coupling mechanisms.",
