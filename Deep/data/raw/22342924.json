     "AB": "It was previously shown that the ictogenic potential of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) was reduced in the parahippocampal region of kainate treated chronic epileptic rats. In the actual study we investigated the potential of 4-aminopyridine (50 and 100muM) to induce seizure like events (SLEs) in combined entorhinal cortex hippocampal slices from Wistar rats following pilocarpine induced status epilepticus. The potential of 4-AP to induce SLEs in the entorhinal cortex was reduced in the latent period and in slices of chronic epileptic animals with a high seizure incidence in vivo (>2seizures/24h). 4-AP induced SLEs in slices from animals with a low incidence of seizures in vivo (<2seizures/24h) in a similar manner as compared to controls. The hippocampal formation displayed no SLEs, instead short recurrent epileptiform discharges (REDs) were evoked by application of 4-AP in areas CA3 and CA1. The incidence of REDs was largest in slices from control animals. This study shows that the reduced ictogenic potential of 4-AP is not restricted to kainate treated chronic epileptic animals as it can be found in the pilocarpine model as well. The underlying mechanisms may relate to altered expression and editing of voltage gated potassium channels.",
