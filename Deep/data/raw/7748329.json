     "AB": "The ubiquitous role of calcium in ethanol actions measured electrophysiologically in central neurons is discussed. Acute ethanol administration to rat hippocampal neurons in vitro causes a hyperpolarization, increased AHPs, increased EPSPs and IPSPs, decreased modelled electronic interneuronal coupling, decreased high threshold Ca2+ currents, increased Ik, and increased synaptic GABAA currents. Alcohol withdrawal reverses some of these actions. Ca2+ is implicated in all of the above ethanol mediated effects.",
