     "AB": "The present study examined kinetics of apoptosis and expression of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 in the CA3 hippocampus cells after diffuse brain injury (DBI) induced experimentally in rats. Percentage of apoptotic cells and expressions of above proteins were examined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Substantial neuronal apoptosis was documented in the CA3 hippocampus cells after DBI (22.26 +/- 2.97% at 72 h after DBI vs. 2.92 +/- 0.88% in sham-operated animals). Expression of Bc1-2 decreased, while expression of Bax and caspase-3 increased after DBI, with caspase-3 expression peaking after that of Bax (72 vs. 48 h, respectively). Further, the Bc1-2/Bax expression ratio decreased prior to increase of caspase-3 expression. In conclusion, cell apoptosis and altered expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 are present in the CA3 region of hippocampus after experimental DBI. Changes in the Bc1-2/Bax expression ratio may facilitate activation of caspase-3 and aggravate neuronal apoptosis after brain injury.",
