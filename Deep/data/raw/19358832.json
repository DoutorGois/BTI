     "AB": "Accumulated evidence indicates that astroglial cells actively participate in neuronal synaptic transmission and plasticity. However, it is still not clear whether astrocytes are able to undergo plasticity in response to synaptic inputs. Here we demonstrate that a long-term potentiation (LTP)-like response could be detected at perforant path-dentate astrocyte synapses following high-frequency stimulation (HFS) in hippocampal slices of GFAP-GFP transgenic mice. The potentiation was not dependent on the glutamate transporters nor the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. However, the induction of LTP requires activation of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). The presence of functional NMDAR was supported by isolating the NMDAR-gated current and by identifying mRNAs of NMDAR subunits in astrocytes. Our results suggest that astrocytes in the hippocampal dentate gyrus are able to undergo plasticity in response to presynaptic inputs.",
