     "AB": "Single-session anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can improve the learning-memory function of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). After-effects of tDCS can be more significant if the stimulation is repeated regularly in a period. Here the behavioral and the histologic effects of the repetitive anodal tDCS on a rat model of AD were investigated. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups, the sham group, the beta-amyloid (Abeta) group, the Abeta+20muA tDCS group, the Abeta+60muA tDCS group, the Abeta+100muA tDCS group and the Abeta+200muA tDCS group. Bilateral hippocampus of the rats in the Abeta group and the Abeta+tDCS groups were lesioned by Abeta1-40 to produce AD models. One day after drug injection, repetitive anodal tDCS (10 sessions in two weeks, 20min per session) was applied to the frontal cortex of the rats in the tDCS groups, while sham stimulation was applied to the Abeta group and the sham group. The spatial learning and memory capability of the rats were tested by Morris water maze. Bielschowsky's silver staining, Nissl's staining, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and glial-fibrillary-acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry of the hippocampus were conducted for histologic analysis. Results show in the Morris water maze task, rats in the Abeta+100muA and the Abeta+200muA tDCS groups had shorter escape latency and larger number of crossings on the platform. Significant histologic differences were observed in the Abeta+100muA and the Abeta+200muA tDCS groups compared to the Abeta group. The behavioral and the histological experiments indicate that the proposed repetitive anodal tDCS treatment can protect spatial learning and memory dysfunction of Abeta1-40-lesioned AD rats.",
