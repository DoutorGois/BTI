     "AB": "The contribution of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the modulation of ischemia-induced cell death in vivo remains unclear. We characterized the impact of pre-ischemic administration of CRH (0, 0.1, 1, 5 microg, i.c.v., 15 min prior to vessel occlusion) on neuronal damage following global ischemia in rats. The injection of 5 microg CRH led to a 37% increase in CA1 neuronal survival compared to vehicle-treated ischemic animals, while pre-treatment with alpha-helical CRH (9-41) abolished this neuronal protection. A second objective aimed to determine whether CRH protection is maintained over weeks when the peptide is administered at remote time intervals following ischemia. Compared to vehicle-treated ischemic animals, administration of CRH 8h following global ischemia led to a 61% increase in CA1 neuronal survival observed 30 days post-ischemia. Neuronal protection translated into significant improvement of ischemia-induced spatial memory deficits in the radial maze. Finally, our findings demonstrated that selective blockade of kappa- and delta-opioid receptors (using nor-binaltorphimine and naltrindole, respectively) prior to CRH administration significantly reduced CA1 neuronal protection. These findings represent the first demonstration of enhanced neuronal survival following in vivo CRH administration in a global model of ischemia in rats. They also support the idea that CRH-induced neuroprotection involves opioid receptors activation.",
