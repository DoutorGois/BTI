     "AB": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a complex and serious mental disorder that is commonly seen psychiatric practice. Although stress, especially early life stress, seems to be associated with the development of the disorder, there has been far less research on the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in BPD, compared to other psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Stress has been suggested to exert damaging effects on the brain, particularly the hippocampus; therefore, neuroimaging studies yield important insight into the neurobiology of BPD. This article reviews research on the HPA axis and neuroimaging studies in BPD and aims to integrate these findings.",
