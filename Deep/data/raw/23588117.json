     "AB": "Ginsenoside Rg1, one of the major active ingredients isolated from Panax Ginseng, has been shown notable neuroprotective effects in memory impairment animals. However, the role of ginsenoside Rg1 on cognition capacity damaged by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is still poorly understood, and the underlying mechanism remain to be fully elucidated. Okadaic acid (OKA), a potent phosphatase inhibitor, often apply to imitate Alzheimer's disease-like symptom damaged by neurofibrillary tangles, was used to investigate the effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on memory impairment and the related mechanisms in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The anti-dementic drug donepezil was used as a positive contrast. The results showed that OKA intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection induced memory impairment, including changes in the ability of orientation navigate, spatial probe and relearning memory in behavioral test of Morris water maze (MWM). However, treatment with Rg1 and donepezil remarkably alleviated these changes. Also OKA treated rats showed memory impairment including increasing of phospho-tau, decreasing of phospho-GSK3beta and the formation of beta-amyloid in special brain regions, which were reversed by Rg1 (20 mg/kg) and donepezil (1 mg/kg) administration. All these indicating that ginsenoside Rg1 protects rats against OKA-induced neurotoxicity. The possible neuroprotective mechanism may be that Rg1 decreases OKA-induced memory impairment through GSK3beta/tau signaling pathway and/or attenuating Abeta formation. Thus, these studies indicate that ginsenoside Rg1 might be a potential preventive drug for Alzheimer's disease.",
