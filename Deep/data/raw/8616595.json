     "AB": "Hippocampal slices were prepared immediately after withdrawal from chronic ethanol in vivo. The decreases in thresholds for production of single and multiple population spikes seen after the ethanol treatment were not evident when CGP39551 was included in the perfusion medium at 20 microM. The decrease in paired pulse potentiation seen during ethanol withdrawal, however, was not prevented by CGP39551. For comparison, the effects of CGP39551, at the same concentration, were examined on the changes in field potentials seen in control slices when the magnesium concentration in the bathing medium was lowered to 250 microM. The decreases in thresholds for multiple population spikes produced by the lowered magnesium were prevented, but not other changes including decreases in single spike thresholds. In addition, this 20 microM concentration of CGP39551 did not prevent epileptiform activity, measured by decreases in thresholds for production of single and multiple population spikes caused by addition of the GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, to control hippocampal slices.",
