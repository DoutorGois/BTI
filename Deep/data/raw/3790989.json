     "AB": "Extracellular (EC) concentrations of amino acids were determined in the rat dentate gyrus by means of non-linear regression analysis of 'in vivo' brain dialysis data, considering a simple model of diffusion through a dialysis membrane. The apparent diffusion constants (K) of several amino acids were also calculated in the 'in vivo' situation. While putative amino acid neurotransmitters (glutamate, aspartate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were present in the EC fluid at the low micromolar range (0.8-2.9 microM), glutamine was by far the most prominent (193.4 microM). The values of intra/extracellular concentration ratios formed 3 groups: high (greater than 2000) for putative neurotransmitters; low (less than 100) for serine, glutamine, arginine and alpha-alanine; and intermediate (about 400) for taurine. The 'in vivo' calculated K values proved useful for estimation of both basal and changing EC concentrations of amino acids in relatively brief perfusions. These data were evaluated in terms of the functional significance of absolute EC concentrations and tissue-EC fluid ratios. Present findings indicate the simultaneous existence of both an inhibitory and an excitatory tonus as well as the utility of high intra/extracellular concentration ratios in determination of the possible neurotransmitter role of specific amino acids.",
