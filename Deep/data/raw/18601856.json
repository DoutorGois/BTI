     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of ginseng total saponins (GTS) on expression of nerve growth factor in rat with polycystic ovaries. METHODS: A total of thirty rats were randomly divided into normal control group, untreated group and GTS group. Polycystic ovaries were induced by a single intramuscular injection of 4 mg estradiol valerate (EV) in rats of the untreated group and GTS group. The rats in the GTS group were administered 50 mg/kg GTS every other day by intraperitoneal injection for 30 days after the EV injection. The expressions of NGF in the ovaries, pituitary and hippocampus were observed by method of immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Comparison with the normal control group revealed that the expressions of NGF in ovaries, pituitary and hippocampus of rats in the untreated group were increased (P<0.05). The ovarian morphology of the GTS group was almost as normal as that of the normal control group. As compared with the untreated group, the expression of NGF in ovaries of the rats in GTS group was obviously decreased (P<0.05), while the expression of NGF in pituitary and hippocampus showed on difference. CONCLUSION: GTS can decrease the expression of NGF in ovary tissue in rats with polycystic ovaries induced by EV, which may be its mechanism in lessening the polycystic ovary.",
