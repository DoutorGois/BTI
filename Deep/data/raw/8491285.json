     "AB": "This study examined TGF-beta 1 mRNA levels and cellular localization in the F344 rat hippocampus following deafferentation or kainic acid (KA)-induced neurodegeneration. By RNA solution hybridization, TGF-beta 1 transcripts were at low prevalence in intact adult rat hippocampus (0.02 pg/microgram total RNA). Four days after unilateral entorhinal cortex lesioning (ECL), TGF-beta 1 mRNA increased threefold in the ipsilateral hippocampus. This increase was localized to the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, where gliosis, synapse loss, and synaptic reorganization occur. TGF-beta 1 mRNA also increased in the hippocampus after KA-induced limbic seizures, particularly in the areas of the hippocampus undergoing neurodegeneration. Microglia [OX-42 immunoreactive (IR) cells] responded to these two lesions with distinct morphological changes. Combined immunocytochemistry-in situ hybridization showed that TGF-beta 1 mRNA was localized to reactive microglia (OX-42-IR, with blunt processes), but not to resting ramified microglia (OX-42-IR, with numerous fine processes) or to astrocytes (GFAP-IR). After ECL, round macrophage-like cells (OX-42-IR with TGF-beta 1 mRNA) were seen at the wound site. Thus, brain macrophage/microglial cells produce TGF-beta 1 mRNA in the hippocampus in response to deafferentation and neurodegeneration.",
