     "AB": "Microinjection of tetanus toxin into the limbic system structures (hippocamp, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum) or chronic electric stimulation of these structures resulted in the formation of the generator of pathologically enhanced excitation (GPEE), followed by disturbances in the intraocular pressure regulation (IOPR). The most pronounced alterations in the IOPR were recorded in forming the GPEE in the dorsal hippocamp. In the first stage the hippocampal theta-rhythm was suppressed, and then the spike and spike-wave potentials appeared. Normalization of the electric activity in the GPEE zone was followed by normalization of the intraocular pressure. The electric stimulation of the same zone of the dorsal hippocamp after normalization of the IOPR led to the reappearance of the disturbances in the ophthalmotonus regulation.",
