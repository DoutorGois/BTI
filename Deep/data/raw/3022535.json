     "AB": "To clarify the structure of Hirano bodies, electron micrographs of Hirano bodies taken at various tilting angles have been studied by digital image analysis. On the electron micrographs, the beaded filaments of Hirano bodies were turned into a pattern of lattice-like arrays by changing the tilting angles. Based on computer-processed diffraction patterns and filtered images, it is proposed that the filaments of Hirano bodies are helical strands with a pitch of 185 A. A model for the helical strand drawn by microcomputer at various angles of rotation is in accordance with the filtered images of the tilted filaments. Computer simulation also reveals that the helical strands appear to be lattice-like when they are arranged in parallel.",
