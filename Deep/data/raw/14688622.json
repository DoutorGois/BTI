     "AB": "Several studies have suggested that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays a role in ischemic neuronal death. Genetic disruption of COX-2 has been shown to reduce susceptibility to focal ischemic injury and N-methyl-d-aspartate-mediated neurotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of COX-2 deficiency on neuronal vulnerability after transient forebrain ischemia. Marked upregulation of COX-2 immunostaining in neurons was observed at the early stage and prominent COX-2 staining persisted in the CA1 medial sector and CA2 sector over 3 days after ischemia. The immunohistologic pattern of COX-2 staining in these sectors gradually condensed to a perinuclear location. The degree of hippocampal neuronal injury produced by global ischemia in COX-2-deficient mice was less than that in wild-type mice, coincident with attenuation of DNA fragmentation in the hippocampus. Also, treatment with a selective COX-2 inhibitor, nimesulide, after ischemia decreased hippocampal neuronal damages. These results of genetic disruption and chemical inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 show that inhibition of COX-2 ameliorates selective neuronal death after transient forebrain ischemia in mice.",
