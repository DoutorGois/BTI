     "AB": "The muscarinic agonist pilocarpine has been shown to increase the duration and total number of episodes presenting theta rhythm-simultaneously in hippocampus and cortex-in rats during the waking states. Theta waves are suggested to be involved in the flow of information between hippocampus and cortex during memory processes. This work investigates this functional interdependence using the spectral and phase synchronization analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) theta band recorded in these brain structures of rats after pilocarpine treatment. Pilocarpine was used at doses devoid of epilepticus-like seizures effects in conscious freely moving rats. The results showed that pilocarpine administration significantly increased the relative theta power during the waking states in the cortex, but not in the hippocampus of rats. Additionally, the EEG coherence between the hippocampal EEG theta band and that arising at the frontal cortex increased after pilocarpine treatment but only during the waking states. This result reveals an increase of the linear correlation between the theta waves of these two brain structures after pilocarpine treatment during the waking states. Moreover, phase synchronization results showed an effective phase locking with non-zero phase difference between hippocampus and frontal cortex theta waves that remained after pilocarpine treatment. Therefore, pilocarpine seems to reinforce the neural transmission waves from the hippocampus toward the cortex during waking. In conclusion, the present EEG study could suggest an effect of the muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine on the hippocampal-cortical functional connectivity.",
