     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: Severe postnatal infection leads to a systemic inflammatory response with release of cytokines and glucocorticoids, representing a stressful event for the newborn child. The purpose of this study was to mimic this situation and to study the effects of early postnatal endotoxin exposure of female rat pups on metabolic, endocrine and anthropometric variables in adulthood. DESIGN: Female pups were given subcutaneous injections of lipopolysaccharides (LPS; Salmonella enteriditis, 0.05 mg/kg) or vehicle 3 and 5 days after birth. RESULTS: Six hours after injection, LPS-treated rats had higher corticosterone levels than controls. As adults, LPS-exposed female rats showed increased insulin sensitivity (P<0.05), measured with the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (5 mU/kg per min). They exhibited a higher locomotor activity (P<0.05) and increased skeletal muscle mass in comparison with controls (P<0.05). Basal ACTH and corticosterone levels in LPS-treated rats were elevated (P<0.05), as were corticosterone levels after exposure to a novel environment stress (P<0.05). The adrenals were morphologically changed and enlarged (P<0.05) in LPS-exposed rats at 11 weeks of age, and a higher density of hypothalamic but not hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor protein was found in the LPS-treated rats (P<0.05). Furthermore, circulating progesterone levels were lower (P<0.05) and testosterone tended to be higher. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that postnatal exposure to LPS leads to increased insulin sensitivity in the adult female rat. In addition, LPS-treated rats showed changes in the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes. This study suggests that postnatal exposure to an endotoxin such as LPS can induce specific programming of neuroendocrine regulation, with long-term consequences in adult life.",
