     "AB": "Hippocampal place cells take part in sequenced patterns of reactivation after behavioral experience, known as replay. Since replay was first reported, nearly 20 years ago, many new results have been found, necessitating revision of the original interpretations. We review some of these results with a focus on the phenomenology of replay.",
