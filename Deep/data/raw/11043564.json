     "AB": "To analyse GluR2 regulations in the rat hippocampal CA1 region following global and tolerance-inducing ischemia in situ hybridization (ISH) and quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) was applied. In addition, cDNA was synthesised from two different primer combinations in order to elucidate possible differences in the adenylation state of GluR2 mRNA. Following global ischemia, ISH and Q-PCR both showed reductions to half of control levels of GluR2 mRNA in consent with previously published results. Following tolerance induction, ISH showed no changes, whereas PCR analysis showed up-regulation to 228% of control value for the general cDNA synthesis, and no change for the specific cDNA synthesis. This indicates that tolerance-inducing ischemia does not increase the amount of GluR2 mRNA; instead polyadenylation of the existing GluR2 mRNA pool takes place.",
