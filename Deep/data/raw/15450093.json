     "AB": "High-frequency oscillations (140-200 Hz) were recorded in behaving rats from the CA1 area of the hippocampus. As generation of these synchronous patterns is assumed to depend on coordinated interneuronal inhibition, we studied the interference of benzodiazepines with the fine structure and occurrence of ripple oscillations. The nonselective GABAA receptor alpha-subunit agonist, diazepam, lowered the frequency of ripple oscillations and reduced their occurrence, amplitude and duration. Zolpidem, an alpha1-subunit selective benzodiazepine elevated ripple duration but acted similar to diazepam in other respects. The nonselective alpha-subunit benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, reduced ripple numbers, amplitude and duration. Wavelet based analysis of the dynamics of intraripple frequency revealed a dramatic decay within a ripple. Only diazepam (1 mg/kg) accelerated this intraripple frequency accommodation. The effects were not due to increased behavioural activity and alertness as evident from vigilance state control. The results suggest a differential role of GABAA receptor subtype specific inhibitory mechanisms in the mediation and fine-tuning of the network synchronization during approximately 200 Hz hippocampal oscillations.",
