     "AB": "The role of polyhydroxylated C60 (fullerenol), a novel free-radical trapper, in prevention of hydrogen peroxide- and cumene hydroperoxide-elicited damage was studied in hippocampal slices from the rat in-vitro. The interactions of polyhydroxylated C60, adenosine and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX) were also compared. Hydrogen peroxide (0.006-0.02%) and cumene hydroperoxide (0.5-1.0 mM) both reversibly reduced the amplitudes of CA1-evoked population spikes in the hippocampal slices. Deferoxamine (1 mM) had little effect on the population spikes. Deferoxamine (1 mM) significantly prevented the hydrogen peroxide (0.006%) elicited inhibition of the population spikes. Polyhydroxylated C60 (0.1 mM) significantly prevented hydrogen peroxide- or cumene hydroperoxide-elicited reduction of the population spikes and also prevented the effects of hydrogen peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide on paired-pulse facilitation in the hippocampal slice. Adenosine reduced the amplitude of population spikes and promoted paired-pulse facilitation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Polyhydroxylated C60 did not alter either of the effects of adenosine on the population spikes. DNQX reduced the amplitude of the population spikes in the CA1 region but did not affect the ratio of paired-pulse facilitation. Fullerenol did not alter either effect of DNQX on the population spikes. These results suggested that polyhydroxylated C60 prevented hydrogen peroxide- and cumene hydroperoxide-elicited damage in the hippocampuss slices. These effects might be associated with the free-radical scavenging activity of polyhydroxylated C60.",
