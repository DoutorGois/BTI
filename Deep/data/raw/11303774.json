     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region and in the dentate gyrus consists of different stages: early LTP lasting minutes or several hours, and late LTP lasting longer than 4 h. It has been suggested that the late phase of LTP is dependent on protein synthesis. However, the experimental results of the effects of protein synthesis inhibitors are still confusing. We applied optical recording techniques to rat hippocampal slices, and re-evaluated the effects of a protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin, on LTP. Using a voltage-sensitive oxonol dye, NK3630 (RH482), LTP in the CA1 region could be monitored optically for a long-term period (7-8 h). In the presence of anisomycin, the potentiation of the EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential) lasted about 2-3 h, followed by a gradual decline in the signal amplitude. Statistically, significant effects of anisomycin were observed 6 h after LTP induction for 100 Hz tetanus and 8 h after LTP induction for 400 Hz tetanus. These results suggest that the early phase of LTP is independent of protein synthesis, while the late phase of potentiation (> 3-5 h) depends on protein synthesis.",
