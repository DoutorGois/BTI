     "AB": "We examined the expression of the sleep-inducing cytokine interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) in the brains of audiogenic seizure-susceptible mice subsequent to the induction of sound-induced seizure. Animal models of epilepsy often require lesioning or trauma that may nonspecifically alter IL-1alpha expression. To avoid this, we employed the Frings mouse strain; a model of auditory-evoked reflex epilepsy. Frings mice were exposed to a high-intensity sound stimulus to induce a tonic extension seizure, and the expression of IL-1alpha transcripts in different brain regions was measured thereafter. Compared to control animals, IL-1alpha transcripts were elevated 6 to 8 h postseizure in the hypothalamus, but not hippocampus, by a dexamethasone-sensitive pathway. Similar results were obtained from the genetically distinct DBA/2J audiogenic seizure-susceptible mouse strain. These findings demonstrate that the expression of IL-1alpha is altered following generalized seizure activity, induced by noninvasive sensory stimulation, in a brain-region-specific manner.",
