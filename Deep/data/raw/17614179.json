     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Methylphenidate (MPH) is a widely prescribed psychostimulant for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Recently, some studies have addressed the genotoxic potential of the MPH, but the results have been contradictory. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the index of cerebral and peripheral DNA damage in young and adult rats after acute and chronic MPH exposure. METHODS: We used (1) single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet assay) to measure early DNA damage in hippocampus, striatum and total blood, and (2) micronucleus test in total blood samples. RESULTS: Our results showed that MPH increased the peripheral index of early DNA damage in young and adult rats, which was more pronounced with chronic treatment and in the striatum compared to the hippocampus. Neither acute nor chronic MPH treatment increased micronucleus frequency in young or in adult rats. Peripheral DNA damage was positively correlated with striatal DNA damage. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that MPH may induce central and peripheral early DNA damage, but this early damage may be repaired.",
