     "AB": "Superfusion of the dorsal surface of the septum with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 10(-10) M [Arg8]-vasopressin (VP) significantly increased the negative (N) wave in field potentials (FPs) elicited in the lateral septum (LS) of rats by stimulation of the fimbria-fornix. A similar increase in the FPs negativity was also observed following superfusion of the septum with [pGlu4, Cyt6] VP(4-9), [pGlu4, Cyt6] VP(4-8), [Cyt6] VP (5-9), desglycinamide9-VP and 1-deamino, 8-D-arginine-VP. However, for obtaining the effect with these peptides 10(3-4) times higher concentrations had to be used. Superfusion of the septum with 10(-8) M oxytocin (OX) elicited nearly the same N-wave increase as the 10(-8) M VP septal superfusion. The 10(-10) M concentration of OX as well as 10(-7) M [pGlu4, Cyt6] OX(4-9) and [pGlu4, Cyt6] OX(4-8) had little effect on the FPs negativity. The significance of these findings for the elucidation of the VP function in the LS is discussed.",
