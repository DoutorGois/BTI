     "AB": "Genetic and biochemical evidence has established that clathrin assembly protein AP180 is required for the proper assembly of synaptic vesicles via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The assembly protein CALM, the ubiquitously expressed homolog of AP180, also regulates the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. In this study we found high expression levels of AP180 and CALM in hippocampal tissues as early as embryonic day 18, before the expression of synaptophysin. We also used immunoelectron microscopy to establish the distribution of AP180 and CALM in the developing hippocampal synapses. We found AP180 and CALM in synapses at all developmental stages and in nonsynaptic growing processes. In addition to localization on the plasma membrane and clathrin-coated vesicles that originated from the plasma membrane, we also report the presence of AP180 and CALM on other types of membrane structures. Our observations link AP180 and CALM to multiple vesicular organelles and raise the possibility that these proteins may play additional roles in developing neurons.",
