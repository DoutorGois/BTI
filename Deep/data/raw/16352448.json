     "AB": "PURPOSE: To review the clinical, electrographic, radiological, and pathological findings of patients with coexistent idiopathic generalized and partial epilepsy syndromes. METHODS: We performed a medical record review and a phone interview with all patients hospitalized to the Cleveland Clinic epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) between 1992 and 2002 who fulfilled clinical and EEG criteria of coexistent partial and generalized epilepsy syndromes. RESULTS: Seven patients were identified. Two (29%) were men with a mean age of 26 years. Four had a history of febrile seizures. Family history was positive in five. Mean duration of the generalized epilepsy syndrome was 11 years, and of the focal epilepsy 18 years. An equal number of patients developed focal versus generalized epilepsy first. Interictal EEG activity was predominantly generalized. Four had video-EEG documentation of both types of seizures. In the rest, only focal seizures were recorded but interictal activity strongly suggested a coexistent generalized epilepsy. MRI showed hippocampal atrophy in all, and hippocampal dysplasia in three. Five patients had PET imaging, all with hypometabolism in areas corresponding to the ictal onset on EEG. Four patients underwent epilepsy surgery with good surgical outcome and pathological confirmation of hippocampal sclerosis in all. CONCLUSION: We found a 0.2% incidence of coexistent focal and primary generalized epilepsy. Febrile seizures and a positive family history were common. Good seizure control was achieved after temporal lobectomy, even when interictal generalized activity predominated.",
