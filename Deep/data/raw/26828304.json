     "AB": "Excessive K(+) efflux via activated voltage-gated K(+) channels can deplete intracellular K(+) and lead to long-lasting membrane depolarization which will promote neuronal apoptosis during ischemia/hypoxia injury. The Kv2.1 potassium channel was the major component of delayed rectifier potassium current (Ik) in pyramidal neurons in cortex and hippocampus. The neuronal protective effect of propofol has been proved. Delayed rectifier potassium current (Ik) has been shown to have close relationship with neuronal damage. The study was designed to test the inhibitory effect of propofol on Kv2.1 potassium channel in rat parietal cortical neurons. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings and Western blot analysis were used to investigate the electrophysiological function and protein expression of Kv2.1 in rat parietal cortical neurons after propofol treatment. We found that propofol concentration-dependently inhibited Ik in pyramidal neurons. Propofol also caused a downward shift of the I-V curve of Ik at 30muM concentration. Propofol significantly inhibited the expression of Kv2.1 protein level at 30muM, 50muM, 100muM concentration. In conclusion, our data showed that propofol could inhibit Ik, probably via depressing the expression of Kv2.1 protein in rat cerebral parietal cortical neurons.",
