     "AB": "Pretreatment with incremental increases in methamphetamine causes tolerance to serotonergic effects caused by challenging with multiple high doses of methamphetamine (11.5 mg/kg/dose). The brain concentration of methamphetamine following this challenge was reduced in tolerant rats, yet the plasma concentration was elevated. The tolerance was selective for methamphetamine and did not occur when cocaine was used in the pretreatment. The possibility that tolerance affects the distribution of methamphetamine in or out of the brain through an active transport system was examined by combining the transport-blocking drug, probenecid, with a low dose of methamphetamine. The presence of probenecid enhanced methamphetamine-induced serotonergic changes in the hippocampus. The brain concentration of methamphetamine increased in the presence of probenecid; however, a similar increase in the plasma methamphetamine concentration suggests that the effects of probenecid on methamphetamine distribution are not related to the redistribution of methamphetamine that occurs in tolerant animals.",
