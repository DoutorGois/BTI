     "AB": "Preclinical studies indicate that serotonin7 (5-HT7) receptors may regulate depressive-like behaviors. Depression is a common symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, its pathophysiology is unclear. Here we examined whether 5-HT7 receptors in the lateral habenular nucleus (LHb) involve in the regulation of PD-related depression. Unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the substantia nigra pars compacta in rats induced depressive-like responses as measured by the sucrose preference and forced swim tests when compared to sham-operated rats. Intra-LHb injection of 5-HT7 receptor agonist AS19 (1, 2 and 4mug/rat) induced or increased the expression of depressive-like behaviors in sham-operated and the lesioned rats. Further, intra-LHb injection of 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB269970 (1.5, 3 and 6mug/rat) produced antidepressant effects in the two groups of rats. However, the doses producing these effects in the lesioned rats were higher than those in sham-operated rats. Neurochemical results showed that intra-LHb injection of AS19 (4mug/rat) decreased dopamine and 5-HT levels in the medial prefrontal cortex, habenula and hippocampus in sham-operated and the lesioned rats; whereas SB269970 (6mug/rat) increased dopamine and 5-HT levels in these structures. In addition, noradrenaline levels in these structures were not changed after intra-LHb injection of AS19 or SB269970 in the two groups of rats. These findings suggest that activation or blockade of 5-HT7 receptors in the LHb may change the activity of LHb glutamate neurons, and then decreases or increases dopamine and 5-HT levels in the limbic and limbic-related brain regions, which are involved in the regulation of depressive-like behaviors.",
