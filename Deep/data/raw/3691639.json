     "AB": "Diazepam's impact on kainic acid seizure-induced local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was assessed by a quantitative [14C]2-deoxyglucose method. Male rats were injected i.p. with either kainic acid (12 mg/kg) or its vehicle, 3 or 48 h before LCGU determination. Diazepam (3.2 mg/kg) or its vehicle were injected i.m. 15 min before, 1 and 2.5 h after kainic acid. Diazepam blocked kainic acid-induced overt convulsions, attenuated LCGU increases at 3 h and prevented 48 h LCGU decreases in piriform cortex and amygdala. LCGU in (% of vehicle): CA3 (438%), CA4 (537%) and CA1-ventral (340%) of hippocampus, interpeduncular nucleus (200%) and lateral lemniscus (213%) were still significantly above vehicle levels in the 3 h diazepam-kainic acid group. These results suggest that diazepam suppresses the spread of kainic acid-induced seizure activity from the proposed CA3 epileptogenic focus. In addition, diazepam reduces, but does not abolish, hypermetabolic activity at the foci itself.",
