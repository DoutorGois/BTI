     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Magnesium ion (Mg2+) is involved in important processes as modulation of ion channels, receptors, neurotransmitter release, and cell excitability in the central nervous system. Although extracellular Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]o) can be altered during general anesthesia, there has been no evidence for [Mg2+]o-dependent modification of anesthetic actions on neural excitability in central nervous system preparations. The purpose of current study was to determine whether the effects of volatile anesthetics are [Mg2+]o-dependent in mammalian central nervous system. METHODS: Extracellular electrophysiologic recordings from CA1 neurons in rat hippocampal slices were used to investigate the effects of [Mg2+]o and anesthetics on population spike amplitude and excitatory postsynaptic potential slope. RESULTS: The depression of population spike amplitudes and excitatory postsynaptic potential slopes by volatile anesthetics were significantly dependent on [Mg2+]o. The effects were attenuated in the presence of a constant [Mg2+]o/extracellular Ca2+ concentration ratio. However, neither N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists nor a non-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist altered the [Mg2+]o-dependent anesthetic-induced depression of population spikes. Volatile anesthetics produced minimal effects on input-output (excitatory postsynaptic potential-population spike) relations or the threshold for population spike generation. The effects were not modified by changes in [Mg2+]o. In addition, the population spike amplitudes, elicited via antidromic (nonsynaptic) stimulation, were not influenced by [Mg2+]o in the presence of volatile anesthetics. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support that alteration of [Mg2+]o modifies the actions of volatile anesthetics on synaptic transmission and that the effects could be, at least in part, a result of presynaptic Ca2+ channel-related mechanisms.",
