     "AB": "In multiple sclerosis demyelination not only affects the white matter, but also the grey matter of the brain. We have previously reported that in the murine cuprizone model for demyelination lesions occur in addition to the corpus callosum also in the neocortex and hippocampus. In the current study, we provide a detailed characterization of hippocampal demyelination in the cuprizone model. Male C57BL/6 mice were challenged with 0.2% cuprizone for 6 weeks. Defined structures within the hippocampus were investigated at week 0 (control), 3, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, and 6. Demyelination affected all hippocampal structures analyzed and was complete after 6 weeks of cuprizone treatment. Between the distinct hippocampal structures the temporal pattern of demyelination varied considerably. Furthermore, infiltration of activated microglia as well as astrogliosis was detected. In summary, cuprizone feeding provides a useful model for studying demyelination processes in the mouse hippocampus.",
