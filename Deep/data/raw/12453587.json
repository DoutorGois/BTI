     "AB": "Alterations in normal NMDA receptor composition, densities and function have been implicated in the pathophysiology of certain neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Chorea, schizophrenia, alcoholism and stroke. In our first effort to provide PET ligands for the NMDA/glycine site, we reported the synthesis of a novel high affinity glycine site ligand, 3-[2-[(3-methoxyphenylamino)carbonyl]ethenyl]-4,6-dichloroindole-2-carboxylic acid ((3MPICA), Ki = 4.8 +/- 0.9 nM) and the corresponding carbon-11 labeled PET ligand, [11C]3MPICA. We report here the in vivo evaluation of [11C]3MPICA in rats. Biodistribution analysis revealed that [11C]3MPICA exhibited low degree of brain penetration and high blood concentration. The average uptake at two minutes was highest in the cerebellum (0.19 +/- 0.04 %ID/g) and thalamus (0.18 +/- 0.05 %ID/g) and lower in the hippocampus (0.13 +/- 0.03) and frontal cortex (0.11 +/- 0.04 %ID/g). The radioactivity cleared quickly from all brain regions examined. Administration of unlabeled 3MPICA (1 mg/kg, i.v.) revealed at 60 minutes a small general reduction in regional brain radioactivity concentrations in treated animals versus controls, however, the blood radioactivity concentration was also lowered, confounding the assessment of the degree of saturable binding. Warfarin co-administration (100 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly lowered blood activity at 5 minutes post-injection (-27%, P < 0.01) but failed to significantly increase the brain uptake of the radiotracer. In view of these results, and especially considering the low brain penetration of this tracer, [11C]3MPICA does not appear to be a promising PET radiotracer for in vivo use.",
