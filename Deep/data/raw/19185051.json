     "AB": "This study examined the hypothesis that apoptotic inhibition via mitochondrial pathway was involved in hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning (HBO-PC)-induced neuroprotection on ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat brain. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 approximately 280 g, n=144) were divided into control, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min, and HBO-PC plus MCAO groups. HBO-PC was conducted four times by giving 100% oxygen at 2.5 atm absolute (ATA), for 1 h at 12 h intervals for 2 days. At 24 h after the last HBO-PC, MCAO was performed and at 24 h after MCAO, neurological function, brain water content, infarct volume, and cell death were evaluated. Enzymatic activity of capase-3 and -9, and expression of cytochrome c, Bcl-2 and Bax proteins were performed in the samples from hippocampus, ischemic penumbra and core of the brain cortex, respectively. HBO-PC reduced brain edema, decreased infarction volume, and improved neurological recovery. HBO-PC reduced cytoplasm cytochrome c levels, decreased caspase enzyme activity, upregulated the ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax expression, and abated the apoptosis of ischemic tissue. HBO-PC protects brain tissues from ischemia-reperfusion injury by suppressing mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.",
