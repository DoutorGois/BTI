     "AB": "The distribution of cells containing CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZn SOD) was determined in hippocampi and associative cortex from normal and Alzheimer's individuals by using antisera against native and denatured CuZn SOD proteins. Immunostaining was intense in large pyramidal neurons, moderate in hippocampal granule cells and very weak in other cells. In the hippocampus of an Alzheimer's patient, successive immunostaining of the same tissue section by anti CuZn SOD and anti paired helical filaments antisera show that both normal and degenerating cells are labelled by the anti CuZn SOD antiserum. Thus, large pyramidal neurons which are potentially susceptible to degenerative processes in AD have the property to contain higher amounts of CuZn SOD than other brain cells.",
