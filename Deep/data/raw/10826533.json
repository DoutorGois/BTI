     "AB": "Thioredoxin is a small, multifunctional protein with a redox-active disulfide/dithiol in the active site. Thioredoxin plays several important biologic roles both in intracellular and extracellular compartments with its redox-regulating and reactive oxygen intermediates scavenging activities. We assayed the seizure response and the excitotoxic hippocampal injury in thioredoxin transgenic and wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Seizure score after kainic acid treatment was significantly lower in thioredoxin transgenic mice. Seven days after kainic acid administration, the damage in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions was significantly attenuated in thioredoxin transgenic mice. Thioredoxin and redox regulation play an important role in excitotoxic brain damage.",
