     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Socioeconomic position (SEP) is associated with cerebrovascular health and brain function, particularly in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and medial temporal lobe regions that exhibit plasticity across the lifecourse. However, it is unknown if SEP associates with resting cerebral blood flow (CBF), an indicator of baseline brain function, in these regions in midlife, and if the association is (1) Period-specific, with independent associations for childhood and adulthood SEP, or driven by lifecourse SEP; and (2) Explained by a persistent disparity, widening disparity, or the leveling of disparities with age. METHODS: To address these questions, we analyzed cerebral perfusion derived by MRI in a cross-sectional study of healthy adults (n = 443) who reported on childhood and adult SEP. Main effects were examined as an index of persistent disparity and age x SEP interactions as reflecting widening or leveling disparities. RESULTS: Stable high SEP across the lifespan was associated with higher global CBF and regional CBF (rCBF) in inferior frontal gyrus. However, childhood SEP associated with rCBF in middle frontal gyrus, as moderated by age (beta=0.04, p=0.035): rCBF inversely associated with age only for those whose parents had a high school education or below. No associations were observed for the hippocampus or amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: Lifecourse SEP associations with rCBF in PFC are suggestive of persistent disparities, while the Age x Childhood SEP interaction suggests that childhood disadvantage relates to a widening disparity, independent of global differences. These differential patterns in midlife may relate to disparities in later-life cerebrovascular and neurocognitive outcomes.",
