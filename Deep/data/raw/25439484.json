     "AB": "BACKGROUND: We assessed the postoperative neurocognitive function after temporal lobectomy in children with temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of the data of 20 patients with Engel's class I or II outcomes after anterior temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy between 2005 and 2008. Twenty children underwent resection of either dominant (n = 8) or nondominant (n = 12) temporal lobes, and their median age at surgery was 12.8 +/- 3.2 years. We serially assessed intelligence and memory function as measured by the Korean-Wechsler Scales of Intelligence and Rey-Kim Memory test both before and after surgery. RESULTS: Intelligence quotient (IQ) and memory quotient scores remained stable during a 3.6-year median follow-up in these children after the surgery. There was no decrease of IQ or memory quotient scores in either the dominant or non-dominant hemisphere groups. Later onset of epilepsy, a shorter epilepsy duration, a smaller number of antiepileptic drugs, and postoperative seizure-free outcomes were significant good predictors of the postoperative IQ. CONCLUSION: Temporal lobectomy in children did not provoke a significant decline in intelligence or memory function. Early surgical treatment in children with intractable seizures of temporal lobe origin may result in better neurocognitive outcomes.",
