     "AB": "The systemic administration of kainate (10 mg/ml) into adult Wistar rats produces seizures and neurodegeneration. We have studied the effect of kainate administration on cPLA2 and COX-2 immunoreactivities after 3 days and 1, 2, 4 and 11 weeks. The cPLA2 immunoreactivity was increased in hippocampal neurons at 1 and 3 days after kainate injection suggesting that PLA2 may be involved in neurodegeneration. Increased cPLA2 and COX-2 immunoreactivities in astrocytes at 1, 2, 4 and 11 weeks after kainate injection indicate an adaptive astrocytic response that may be associated with gliosis.",
