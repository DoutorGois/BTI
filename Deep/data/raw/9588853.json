     "AB": "The presence of lipid peroxidation product in amyloid deposits from seven patients with Alzheimer disease and nine with non-Alzheimer disease was examined immunohistochemically by means of an affinity purified anti-HNE antibody to hydroxynonenal (HNE), a marker of lipid peroxidation. A positive reaction was found in amyloid deposits in all the specimens examined: most of the perivascular areas (89%) where amyloid deposition was confirmed by Congo red staining, showed immunoreactivity with the antibody in the specimens of Alzheimer disease. Twenty-one percent of senile plaques which were also stained by Congo red staining reacted with this antibody. Several perivascular cells were also stained by anti-HNE antibody. In other neurons both in Alzheimer and non-Alzheimer disease patients, only a few percent reacted with this antibody and no statistical difference was observed between them. These results verify that lipid peroxidation via free radical injury occurs in amyloid deposits in Alzheimer amyloid. Since HNE has been identified as a cytotoxic metabolite of free radical injury, amyloid deposits in the tissue may exhibit a toxic effect during the generation process of HNE.",
