     "AB": "The effect of hippocampal dynorphin administration on learning and memory was examined in spatial and nonspatial tasks. Bilateral infusion of dynorphin A(1-8) (DYN; 10 or 20 micrograms in one microliters) into the dorsal hippocampus resulted in a dose-related impairment of spatial working memory in a radial maze win-stay task. Subsequent experiments found that acquisition of a reference memory task in the water maze was impaired by DYN injections (20 micrograms/microliters) in the dorsal hippocampus, but not in the ventral hippocampus, and that this impairment could be blocked by naloxone. In a nonspatial task, posttraining DYN injections in the dorsal hippocampus had no effect on retention of step-through passive avoidance. These results suggest that dynorphin specifically interferes with spatial learning and memory, and that this effect is mediated by opioid receptors in the dorsal hippocampus.",
