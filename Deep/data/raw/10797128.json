     "AB": "We have been studying the ontogeny of the blood-brain barrier function in ovine fetuses and lambs. During these studies, we have found that the duration of ventilation also influences blood-brain barrier permeability in premature lambs. Chronically instrumented hysterotomy-delivered surfactant-treated premature lambs were studied at 90% or 137 days of gestation (n = 9). Blood-brain barrier function was quantified with the blood-to-brain transfer constant K(i) to alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. Linear regression analysis was used to compare the K(i) values in the brain regions, as the dependent variable, to the duration of ventilation, as the independent variable. There were direct correlations (P < 0.05) between the K(i) values and the duration of ventilation [306 min (mean), 162-474 min (range)] in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, medulla, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, superior colliculus, inferior colliculus, thalamus, pons, cervical spinal cord, and choroid plexus, but not in the pituitary gland. Ventilatory pressures and rates were established before the onset of the permeability studies. Calculated mean airway pressures [14 cmH(2)O (mean), 7-20 cmH(2)O (range)] from similarly studied premature lambs did not correlate with the duration of positive-pressure ventilation. We conclude that increases in the duration of positive-pressure ventilation predispose premature lambs to increases in regional blood-brain barrier permeability. These alterations in barrier function occur over relatively short time intervals (minutes to hours). In our study, these changes in permeability are most likely not attributable to changes in mean airway pressure.",
