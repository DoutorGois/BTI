     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been evaluated in medication refractory epilepsy patients. The results have been inconclusive and protocols have varied between studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of two protocols of tDCS in adult patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS). METHODS: This is a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial, with 3 arms, 3 sessions, 5 sessions and placebo stimulation. Frequency of seizures (SZs), interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and adverse effects (AEs) were registered before and after treatment, and at 30 and 60 days follow-up. Descriptive statistics, k-related samples, Friedman's test, and relative risk (RR) estimation were used for analysis. RESULTS: We included twenty-eight subjects (3d n = 12, 5d n = 8, placebo n = 8), 16/28 (57%) men, age 37.8(+/-10.9) years old. There was a significant reduction of the frequency of SZs at one (p = 0.001) and two (p = 0.0001) months following cathodal tDCS compared to baseline in the 3 arms (p = 0.0001). The mean reduction of SZ frequency at two months in both active groups was significantly higher than placebo (-48% vs. -6.25%, p < 0.008). At 3 days (-43.4% vs. -6.25%, p < 0.007) and 5 days (-54.6% vs. -6.25%, p < 0.010) individual groups showed a greater reduction of SZs. A significant IED reduction effect was found between baseline and immediately after interventions (p = 0.041) in all groups. Side effects were minor. CONCLUSIONS: Cathodal tDCS technique of 3 and 5 sessions decreased the frequency of SZs and IEDs (between baseline and immediately post-tDCS) in adult patients with MTLE-HS compared to placebo tDCS.",
