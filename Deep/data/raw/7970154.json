     "AB": "The effect of Schaffer collateral/commissural fiber kindling on the expression levels of GABAA receptor beta 1, beta 2 and beta 3 subunit mRNA in the pyramidal and granular neurons of the rat dorsal hippocampus was studied, using semi-quantitative in situ hybridization. In pyramidal neurons of CA1 and CA3, only small changes (10-15%) were found. In dentate granule neurons, the expression level of GABAA R-beta 3 mRNA was significantly, enhanced, bilaterally, in animals that were partial or fully kindled. At long-term, 4 weeks after the last convulsion no significant changes were found in pyramidal or granular neurons.",
