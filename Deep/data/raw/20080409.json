     "AB": "The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to ischemia, which is accompanied by substantial alterations in gene expression. Recent studies show that microRNAs extensively mediate post-transcriptional gene expression. However, the regulatory mechanisms in the hippocampus that microRNAs participate in remain unclear. Here, we used microarray analysis to characterize the microRNA expression profile in rat hippocampus and to identify changes in expression after 20 minutes of global ischemia followed by either 30 minutes or 24 hours of reperfusion. In the normal hippocampus, we detected 286 microRNAs, of which the let-7 family accounted for 32%. After ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion, 23 microRNAs were upregulated and 32 were downregulated; after 24 hours of reperfusion 40 were upregulated and 31 were downregulated. These results suggest that several microRNAs may be involved in regulating the normal physiological activity of the hippocampus and its response to ischemia and reperfusion.",
