     "AB": "The localization of calbindin neurons was studied in different brain areas of rats rendered microencephalic by gestational methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) treatment. In layers VI and V of the cortex, the only recognizable layers in MAM-treated rats, a higher density of calbindin interneurons and an apparent increase in protein expression was observed. In the hippocampus, calbindin pattern was essentially preserved, despite the dramatic decrease in size. In other telencephalic regions, calbindin distribution was not changed except for the septum, where a large increase of calbindin neurons was observed. The present results suggest that the MAM model may be used to investigate the role of calbindin.",
