     "AB": "Objectives: The major objective of the present study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of berberine chloride on vascular dementia. Berberine, as an ancient medicine in China and India, is the main active component derived from the Berberis sp. Several studies have revealed the beneficial effects of berberine in various neurodegenerative disorders. Materials and Methods: To induce vascular dementia, chronic bilateral common carotid artery occlusion was performed on male Wistar rats. After surgery, the rats were treated daily by oral administration of berberine chloride (50 mg/kg) for two months. The cognition function of treated rats, were evaluated by Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. In addition, Nissl and TUNEL staining were chosen to assess neuronal damage within the hippocampal CA1 area. Results: It was obvious that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), caused cognitive impairment and neuronal damages within CA1 hippocampal subregion. Berberine chloride was able to prevent cognitive deficits, (P<0.05) and reversed CCH-induced hippocampal neuronal loss and apoptosis, (P<0.05). Conclusion: Berberine chloride may be considered as a potential treatment for cognitive deficits and neuronal injury caused by CCH in the hippocampal CA1 area.",
