     "AB": "It was shown by fluorescent and electron microscopy that the physiological state of ground squirrels subjected to ionizing radiation at different phases of the torpor-normothermia cycle plays a determining role in the alteration of the conditions of the protein-synthesizing system in neurons of hippocampus fields CA1 and CA3 and sensomotor area of the brain. In ground squirrels irradiated under normothermia, the neurons were less radioresistant and restored slower compared with torpor animal cells, the distinctions being most expressed in CA1 field neurons. The effect of irradiation was minimum during the entrance into torpor and maximum during arousal. It was supposed that the inhibition of protein synthesis in the latter case occurred at the elongation stage when heavy polyribosomes were formed in neuron cytoplasm.",
