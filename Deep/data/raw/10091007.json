     "AB": "A major effort in neuroscience is directed towards understanding the roles of Ca2+ signalling in the induction of synaptic plasticity. Here, we summarize the evidence concerning Ca2+ signalling, paying particular attention to CA1 excitatory synapses, and its relationship to the induction of long-term potentiation and long-term depression. We discuss the ways in which synaptic activation can elevate Ca2+ postsynaptically and how dendritic spines may act as a Ca2+ compartment which can both isolate and integrate Ca2+ signals.",
