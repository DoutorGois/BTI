     "AB": "The origins, distribution, and cellular targets of the septo-hippocampal projections are reviewed. It appears that the distribution of acetylcholinesterase-positive neurons in the medial septum and diagonal bands and those cells labelled after injections of horseradish peroxidase into the hippocampus coincide; however, the possibility of a non-acetylcholinesterase septal projection remains. Good agreement is found between the distribution of hippocampal acetylcholinesterase and the patterning of silver grains after injection of [3H]leucine into the medial septum. A major target of septal efferents to the hippocampus is the interneuron population; the possibility of septal mediation of intrahippocampal circuitry via this anatomical arrangement is discussed.",
