     "AB": "The present study aims to investigate the effects of paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) on the waking EEG and amino acid neurotransmitters in the hippocampus and cortex of rats. Animals were deprived of paradoxical sleep for 72h by using the multiple platform method. The EEG power spectral analysis was carried out to assess the brain's electrophysiological changes due to sleep deprivation. The concentrations of amino acid neurotransmitters were assessed in the hippocampus and cortex using HPLC. Control data showed slight differences from normal animals in the delta, theta and alpha waves while an increase in the beta wave was obtained. After 24h of PSD, delta relative power increased and the rest of EEG wave's power decreased with respect to control. After 48h and 72h the spectral power analysis showed non-significant changes to control. The amino acid neurotransmitter analysis revealed a significant increase in cortical glutamate, glycine and taurine levels while in the hippocampus, glutamate, aspartate, glutamine and glycine levels increased significantly. Both the waking EEG and neurotransmitter analyses suggest that PSD induced neurochemical and electrophysiological changes that may affect brain proper functionality.",
