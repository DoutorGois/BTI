     "AB": "The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of nizofenone administration on the chronic restraint stress-induced cognitive impairments in mice. Adult male mice were randomized into five groups: control group, nizofenone control group, chronic restraint stress group, and nizofenone treatment groups (3.0mg/kg and 9.0mg/kg). The changes of cognitive performances were examined by Morris water maze (MWM), open field and step-through tests. Our results showed that the cognitive performances in CRS group were markedly deteriorated, accompanied by noticeable alterations in oxidative parameters, acetylcholinesterase activity and catecholamines levels in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. These changes could be reversed by nizofenone treatment. Moreover, CRS group showed higher corticosterone levels and lower catecholamines levels in the serum, which were reversed in the nizofenone treatment groups. Collectively, the present results suggested the potential of nizofenone in attenuating the CRS-induced cognitive impairments.",
