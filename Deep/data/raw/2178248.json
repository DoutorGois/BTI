     "AB": "The fimbria fornix of male Wistar rats was transected unilaterally after they had been successfully trained in the Morris maze and the passive avoidance task. Sham-operated and lesioned animals were treated either with Org2766 or saline for two weeks. Subsequently, the performance of all groups was tested again starting two days after the last treatment. The lesioned animals showed a deficit in performance in both tasks, indicating interference of the lesion with retrieval of information. Org2766 improved the poor performance of the lesioned animals in the Morris maze, but not in the passive avoidance task.",
