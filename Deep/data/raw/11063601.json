     "TI": "(-)-Spiro[1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-3,5'-oxazolidin-2'-one], a conformationally restricted analogue of acetylcholine, is a highly selective full agonist at the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.",
     "PG": "4045-50",
     "AB": "Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are members of the ligand-gated ion channel receptor superfamily and may play important roles in modulating neurotransmission, cognition, sensory gating, and anxiety. Because of its distribution and abundance in the CNS, the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor is a strong candidate to be involved in some of these functions. In this paper we describe the synthesis and in vitro profile of AR-R17779, (-)-spiro[1-azabicyclo[2.2. 2]octane-3,5'-oxazolidin-2'-one] (4a), a potent full agonist at the rat alpha 7 nicotinic receptor, which is highly selective for the rat alpha 7 nicotinic receptor over the alpha 4 beta 2 subtype. Preliminary SAR of AR-R17779 presented here indicate that there is little scope for modification of this rigid molecule as even minor changes result in significant loss of the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor affinity.",
