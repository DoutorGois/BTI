     "AB": "Neurons of Golgi II type of the Ammon's horn of white rat enzymhistochemically can be studied most successfully in the hilus of area dentata near to the stratum granulosum (basket cells). Activity of SDH, MDH (NAD), CYO- and alfa-GPDH (NAD) in the pericaryon is low, of the LDH moderate and the activity of G6PDH, NADPH-diaphorese, acid phosphatase, TPP-ase and non-specific esterase expressed. Reaction of the alkalic phosphatase is negative. In addition to these reactions nucleic acids were also demonstrated using fluorescent technique. All these data were compared to those in other neurons of the Ammon's horn.",
