     "AB": "At various intervals after acquisition of a brightness discrimination in rats labeled leucine was intraventricularly applied. Hippocampus tissue was fractionated in soluble and solubilized insoluble protein fractions. Protein content and labeling of several electrophoretically resolved bands showed a biphasic time course: a first increase was observed 20 minutes after training including preferably soluble proteins, whereas a second increase (about eight hours after training) was mainly related to solubilized insoluble proteins.",
