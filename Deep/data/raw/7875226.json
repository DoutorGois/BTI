     "AB": "Adenosine and adenosine analogues have potent anticonvulsant effects on various seizure models, including kindling, an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy. It is now reported that binding of a specific ligand (cyclohexyladenosine) to adenosine A1 receptors is not changed in the cerebral cortex of kindled rats. However, the affinity of cyclohexyladenosine to adenosine receptors is significantly increased in the hippocampus. In addition, cyclohexyladenosine is slightly more potent to inhibit [3H]D-aspartate outflow from hippocampal synaptosomes taken from kindled than from control rats. Taken together, these data suggest that an increased affinity of adenosine to A1 receptors may play a role in the anticonvulsant effect of adenosine A1 analogues in the kindling model.",
