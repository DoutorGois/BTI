     "AB": "In human hippocampal epilepsy, there is a consistent pathology of cell loss and reactive synaptic reorganization of 'excitatory' mossy fibers (MF) into the inner molecular layer (IML) of the fascia dentata (FD). In this study, neo-Timm's histochemistry of MFs and immunocytochemistry of GluR1 were used to determine, in patients with or without hippocampal sclerosis (HS), if there was a correlation between aberrant supragranular (IML) mossy fiber sprouting and increased densities of AMPA GluR1 subunit proteins in the IML of the FD. Computerized quantified densitometric grey values of Timm and GluR1 densities were corrected for the densities of granule cell losses using cell counts. In the IML of the HS group, despite the losses of granule cells, mossy fiber sprouting was significantly greater (P<0.000001) and GluR1 protein densities were significantly higher (P<0.0005) than those of the non-HS group. Unlike supragranular mossy fiber sprouting, which was limited to the IML, the increased GluR1 stainings were distributed throughout the whole molecular layer. For all cases, MF synaptic reorganization in the supragranular ML was correlated with GluR1 subunit protein densities in the IML (R=0.784, P<0.0093). These data demonstrate that in the human epileptic fascia dentata, there are significantly increased AMPA GluR1 subunit proteins associated with aberrant MF synaptic reorganizations. This suggests that the hyperexcitability of sclerotic hippocampus occurs, at least in part, from the associated changes of both presynaptic mossy fiber glutamatergic neoinnervation and increased GluR1 subunit proteins in the dendritic domains of the FD.",
