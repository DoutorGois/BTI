     "AB": "Antagonistic interactions between cholecystokinin (CCK) and nanomolar concentrations of kainic acid (KA) have been reported in area CA3 of the rat hippocampal slice. This study tested the possibility that kainic acid inhibits the release of CCK. Elevated K+ was found to release CCK from hippocampal slices in a Ca2+-dependent manner. KA, at concentrations as low as 100 nM, inhibited this release by about one-third. Because CCK appears to exert a net inhibitory effect on the firing of CA3 pyramidal cells, the epileptogenic action of KA may be explained, in part, by the depression of CCK release.",
