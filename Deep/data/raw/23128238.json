     "AB": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Our goal was to find out whether a decrease in hippocampal volume in Alzheimer's disease measured via magnetic resonance imaging is accompanied by a similar volume decrease in the pons and cerebellum. We also tried to evaluate whether there are any accompanying hippocampal, pontine and cerebellar asymmetries between the left and right side. METHODS: We performed a manual volumetric magnetic resonance analysis of the pons, cerebellum and hippocampi in 29 healthy controls and 26 patients with Alzheimer's disease, divided into two groups according to the Mini-Mental State Examination score. RESULTS: We confirmed a known decrease in hippocampal volume in Alzheimer's disease patients but found that there is no similar volume decrease in the pons or cerebellum that could serve as a radiologic diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Also, there was no statistically significant right-left asymmetry in all three measured structures. CONCLUSION: Only hippocampal volume and not pontine and cerebellar volumes could serve as a magnetic resonance diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease.",
