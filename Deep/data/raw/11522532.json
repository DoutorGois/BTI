     "AB": "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is one of the most potent neurotrophic factors and promotes survival in many populations of cells. We examined the neuroprotective effect of an adenoviral vector encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (AxCAhGDNF) on the transient global ischemia [Brain Res. 885 (2000) 273-282]. Gerbils received AxCAhGDNF or an adenoviral vector encoding bacterial beta-galactosidase gene (AxCALacZ) through administration into the lateral ventricle. Two days later, occlusion of the common carotid arteries for 5 min bilaterally using aneurysm clips produced transient global forebrain ischemia. Animals showed intense immunolabeling for GDNF in ependymal cells on 2, 4 and 7 days after the operation. The exogenous gene transducted by the adenovirus in the same cells was detected by in situ hybridization. The treatment with AxCAhGDNF significantly prevented the loss of hippocampal CA-1 pyramidal neurons 2 to 7 days after the operation, as compared to AxCALacZ treatment. Also terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin in situ nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was markedly reduced in the case with AxCAhGDNF treatment at 7 days after the operation. In this paper, we describe in detail the techniques for the detection of the exogenous gene of hGDNF under the treatment with AxCAhGDNF.",
