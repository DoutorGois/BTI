     "AB": "Unilateral infusion of colchicine into the lateral ventricle produced relatively selective destruction of dentate granule cells in the ipsilateral dorsal hippocampal formation of the rat. Timms silver sulfide stain is markedly reduced in the mossy fiber layer on the colchicine treated side but is normal contralaterally. After colchicine treatment, an increase in acetylcholinesterase staining is apparent in the apical dendritic zone of CA3 pyramidal cells. This enhanced staining is localized in the proximal apical dendritic layer of CA3, a region normally occupied by the mossy fiber terminals of dentate granule cells. These results suggest that cholinergic fibers proliferate in CA3 after granule cell lesion and may participate in reinnervation of the denervated area.",
