     "AB": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of adult rodents is capable of undergoing neuronal remodeling and neuroimaging studies in humans have revealed that the structure of this region also appears affected in different psychiatric disorders. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying this plasticity are still unclear. The polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) may mediate these structural changes through its anti-adhesive properties. PSA-NCAM participates in neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis and changes in its expression occur parallel to neuronal remodeling in certain regions of the adult brain. PSA-NCAM is expressed in the hippocampus and temporal cortex of adult humans, but it has not been studied in the PFC. Employing immunohistochemistry on sections from the rostromedial superior frontal gyrus we have found that PSA-NCAM is expressed in the human PFC neuropil following a laminated pattern and in a subpopulation of mature neurons, which lack doublecortin expression. Most of these cells have been identified as interneurons expressing calbindin. The expression of PSA-NCAM in the human PFC is similar to that of rodents. Since this molecule has been linked to the neuronal remodeling found in experimental models of depression, it may also participate in the structural plasticity described in the PFC of depressed patients.",
