     "AB": "Neuronal cell death in the brain of macular mutant mouse, a model of copper metabolism abnormality, has features of both apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptotic cells were morphologically identified by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method and electron microscopy. Numerous TUNEL-positive cells were identified in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and thalamus of the hemizygotes after postnatal day 11. Ultramicroscopic studies confirmed that a number of cells had apoptotic features characterized by condensation and segregation of the nuclei. Furthermore, genomic DNA gel electrophoresis revealed a laddering pattern in the hemizygous brain. Starvation, which produced a low body weight in normal mice similar to that seen in the hemizygotes, did not result in an increase of TUNEL-positive cells. We also found that there was no increase of apoptotic cells in the brains of heterozygotes and copper-supplemented hemizygotes. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the distribution of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase-containing cells differed from that of TUNEL-positive cells. These findings suggest that copper deficiency is a key factor triggering apoptosis in the brain of macular mutant mouse through a mechanism different from suppression of antioxidant action of the dismutase. The improved survival period of the copper-supplemented hemizygotes may be attributed, in part, to inhibition of excessive neuronal apoptosis identified in the late stage of the disease.",
