     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that deteriorates cognitive functions and associated brain regions such as the hippocampus, being the primary cause of dementia. Serotonin (5-HT) is widely present in the hippocampus, being an important neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory. Although recent evidence suggests alterations in 5-HT neurotransmission in AD, it is not clear how hippocampal 5-HT innervation is modified. Here, we studied hippocampal 5-HT innervation by analysing: (i) the expression, density and distribution of 5-HT transporter (SERT)-immunoreactive fibres; (ii) the specific morphological characteristics of serotonergic fibres and their relation to amyloid plaques; and (iii) the total number of 5-HT neurons within the raphe nuclei in triple transgenic mouse model of AD. We used quantitative light microscopy immunohistochemistry comparing transgenic and non-transgenic animals of different ages (3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months). The transgenic animals showed a significant increase in SERT fibres in the hippocampus in a subfield-, strata- and age-specific manner. The increase in SERT fibres was specific to the CA1 stratum lacunosum-moleculare. An increase in SERT fibres in transgenic animals was observed at 3 months (by 61%) and at 18 months (by 74%). No changes, however, were found in the total number of raphe 5-HT neurons at any age. Our results indicate that triple transgenic mice display changes in the expression of SERT and increased SERT fibres sprouting, which may account for imbalanced serotonergic neurotransmission associated with (or linked to) AD cognitive impairment.",
