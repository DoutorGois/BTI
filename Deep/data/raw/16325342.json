     "AB": "Deprivation of socio-sensory interactions during early life impairs brain function in adulthood. In previous investigations we showed that early isolation severely affects neuron development in several structures of the hippocampal region, including the entorhinal cortex. In the present study we investigated the effects of early isolation on signal processing along the entorhinal cortex-dentate-CA3-CA1 system, a major memory circuit of the hippocampal region. Male and female guinea-pigs were assigned at 6-7 days of age to either a social or an isolated environment. At 90-100 days of age the animals were anesthetized and field potentials were recorded from the entorhinal cortex-dentate-CA3-CA1 circuit, driven by dorsal psalterium commissural volleys. Analysis of the input-output function in the different structures showed that in isolated males there was a small reduction in the input-output function of the population excitatory postsynaptic potential and population spike evoked in layer II of the entorhinal cortex. No changes occurred in isolated females. In isolated males and females there was a reduction in the input-output function of the population excitatory postsynaptic potential and population spike evoked in the dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1, but this effect was larger in males. In isolated males, but not in females, the population spike/population excitatory postsynaptic potential ratio was reduced in all investigated structures, indicating that in males the size of the discharged neuron population was reduced more than due to the decreased input. Results show that isolation reduces the synaptic function in the whole entorhinal cortex-dentate gyrus-CA3-CA1 system. While the entorhinal cortex was moderately impaired, the dentate-hippocampal system was more severely affected. The impairment in the signal transfer along the entorhinal cortex-dentate gyrus-CA3-CA1 system was heavier in males, confirming the larger susceptibility of this sex to early experience. This work provides evidence that malfunctioning of a major hippocampal network may underlie the learning deficits induced by impoverished surroundings during early life.",
