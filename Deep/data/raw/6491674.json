     "AB": "The effect of age on the binding of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine [( 3H]5-HT, serotonin) to postmortem human frontal cortex, hippocampus, and putamen from individuals between the ages of 19 and 100 years was studied. One high-affinity binding site was observed in adult brains, with a mean KD of 3.7 nM and 3.2 nM for frontal cortex and hippocampus, respectively, and 9.2 nM for putamen. Decreased binding capacities (Bmax) with age were detected in frontal cortex and hippocampus. In putamen a decrease in affinity was noted. Postmortem storage did not significantly contribute to the age-related changes. No significant sex differences were detected. [3H]5-HT binding was also studied in brains from human neonates. The specific binding was 1.5-3 times lower than in adult frontal cortex and putamen, and Scatchard analysis suggested more than one binding site. In infant hippocampus a single binding site was observed and except for a premature individual, the binding capacity approximated adult values.",
