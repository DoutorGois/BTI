     "AB": "The neural mechanisms mediating prepulse inhibition (PPI) appear to have relevance to neurological and psychiatric disorders. Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy exhibit psychotic symptoms and disrupted PPI, therefore the present experiments examined the consequences of seizures induced by kindling on PPI. Rats were chronically implanted with an electrode into the basolateral amygdala, perirhinal cortex, or ventral hippocampus and stimulated twice daily until 3 fully generalized, class 5 seizures were elicited. Kindling of basolateral amygdala, but not perirhinal cortex or ventral hippocampus, disrupted PPI when testing began 2min, but not 48h, following the elicitation of the third class 5 seizure. Startle amplitudes were unaffected by kindling. These results suggest that the anatomical origin of seizures is an important factor in determining their potentially disruptive effects on PPI.",
