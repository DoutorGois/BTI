     "AB": "Binding sites for [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in postmortem human frontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala were studied by displacement with 5-HT selective drugs. The results demonstrated the selective labelling of 5-HT1-like sites by [3H]5-HT in the cortex, with little or no labelling of 5-HT2 or 5-HT3 sites. Self-displacement of the binding of [3H]5-HT is consistent with the presence of a single population of sites, indicating that 5-HT is non-selective for the 5-HT1 subtypes. Around 40% of the 5-HT1 sites in the frontal cortex and amygdala were of the 5-HT1A subtype, in contrast to 60% in the hippocampus. The drug RU 24969 consistently displaced with, a high affinity, a greater proportion of [3H]5-HT sites than did 8-OH-DPAT in all three regions of the brain. The nature of these additional sites was not established. A small proportion (less than 10%) of [3H]5-HT sites in the frontal cortex appeared to be of the 5-HT1C subtype, as these sites were displaced with high affinity by mianserin.",
