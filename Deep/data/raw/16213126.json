     "AB": "Abnormalities of the P300 component of the event-related potential are a common finding in schizophrenia. It seems possible that the dysfunction in the dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPF) region that has been reported in schizophrenia contributes to this finding. To explore this possibility, we calculated the relationship between, on the one hand, P300 latency and amplitude and, on the other hand, the degree of DLPF atrophy (as measured by magnetic resonance imaging) and metabolic activity during an attentional task (as measured by positron emission tomography). Seventeen schizophrenia patients with a brief duration of illness and minimal exposition to treatment and 25 healthy controls were studied. Patients exhibited significantly lower metabolic activity in the DLPF region, but they did not show cortical atrophy. P300 amplitude was also significantly reduced in the schizophrenia patients compared with the controls. Right DLPF region metabolic activity correlated significantly with P300 amplitude. This pattern remained after partialling out the influence of activity in the hippocampus, superior temporal gyrus and parietal lobe. It is therefore suggested that the prefrontal cortex could be implicated in the P300 amplitude reduction in schizophrenia.",
