     "AB": "TVX Q 7821 is a putative non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic which has a high affinity to 5-HT1 receptors. In this study some of the binding characteristics of the radiolabeled drug using rat brain cryostat sections and the autoradiographic localization of binding sites using the LKB-Ultrofilm technique have been investigated. Parallel experiments have been performed using [3H]serotonin ( [3H]5-HT). Both [3H]TVX Q 7821 and [3H]5-HT bound specifically and in a saturable manner to tissue sections, the Kd values being 6.8 and 3.7 nmol/l, respectively. Quantitative autoradiography using computer-assisted image analysis revealed a mean inhibition by TVX Q 7821 of [3H]5-HT binding of 56% in many brain areas. The inhibition ranged from 80% in the hippocampus and entorhinal area to practically none in the substantia nigra and the dorsal subiculum. Color coded autoradiograms obtained either with [3H]5-HT or [3H]TVX Q 7821 showed a nearly identical pattern of labeling with high receptor densities in the hippocampus, the entorhinal area, the septum, the interpeduncular nucleus and the dorsal raphe. However, in some brain areas striking differences in the intensity of labeling were found. [3H]5-HT but not [3H]TVX Q 7821 bound strongly in the substantia nigra, the dorsal subiculum and the globus pallidus. It is proposed that TVX Q 7821 binds to a subtype of 5-HT1 receptor (the so-called 5-HT1A sites as recently proposed). Thus, the putative anxiolytic TVX Q 7821 may provide a means for the study of the functional role of 5-HT1 receptors.",
