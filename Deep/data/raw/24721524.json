     "AB": "Several studies show the role of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in drug-seeking, relapse and the brains emotional systems. Several lines of evidence indicate a functional interaction between opioid and endogenous cannabinoid systems. In the present study, we investigated the role of intra-BLA cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the potentiation, acquisition and expression of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). One-hundred and forty-two adult male Wistar rats weighing 230-280g were bilaterally implanted by two separate cannulae into the BLA. The CPP paradigm was done, and conditioning score and locomotor activity were recorded by Ethovision software. Results showed that intra-BLA administration of different doses of WIN55,212-2 (1, 2 and 4mmol/0.3microl DMSO) as a cannabinoid receptor agonist during the conditioning phase induced place preference in animals that received the ineffective (2mg/kg) dose of morphine compared to respective control group in saline-treated animals. On the other hand, intra-BLA injection of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (45 and 90micromol/0.3microl DMSO) during the 3-day conditioning phase reduced morphine-induced CPP. Furthermore, microinjection of both AM251 (15, 45 and 90micromol) and WIN55,212-2 (1-4mmol), into the BLA had no effect on the expression of morphine (5mg/kg)-induced CPP. Our findings suggest that cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the BLA are involved in the development of reward-related behaviors and they can potentiate the rewarding effects of morphine. It seems that the glutamatergic projection from the BLA to the nucleus accumbens and reward-related learning in the hippocampus may be involved in the acquisition and expression of opioid reward-related behaviors in rats.",
