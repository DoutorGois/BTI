     "AB": "The involvement of neurotrophins after radiation injury during brain development were studied in pregnant mice (C 57/B1) exposed on gestation day 15 to X-ray doses of 0.02-2 Gy. Nerve growth factor protein (NGF) and different cholinergic markers were investigated on postnatal day 1 (P1) and day 21 (P21); in situ hybridization with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and trkC (receptor serving to bind neurotrophin-3) probes was investigated on P21 in cortex, hippocampus, septum and cerebellum. The level of NGF protein was increased in irradiated forebrain on P1 in a dose-related manner. However, on P21 the NGF protein dropped down below the control levels in irradiated hippocampus and cerebellum. The response of acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity in cerebellum at P21 was correlated with the changes in the amount of NGF. The intensity of cell labelling with trkC probe decreased after irradiation in the region of the hippocampus at P21, especially in dentate gyrus. The expression of BDNF mRNA was increased at P21 by low doses of irradiation (0.02-1 Gy) but was decreased by a high dose (2 Gy) in the same area. Thus, the radiation induced an alteration of neurotrophins, and the changes varied depending on the dose or time after irradiation. Such alterations in the pattern of growth factor production may modulate the response of cells to radiation. Furthermore, NGF protein levels and the expression of BDNF and trkC mRNA were affected by radiation doses as low as 0.02 Gy, indicating that during development the neurotrophins and their receptors are very sensitive to radiation.",
