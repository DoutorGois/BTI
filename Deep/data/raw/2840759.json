     "AB": "The ability of the kappa-opioid receptor agonists U50488H and U62066E (spiradoline mesylate) compared with the non-kappa close structural analogue U54494A to affect postischemic necrosis of the selectively vulnerable hippocampal CA1 neurons was examined in male Mongolian gerbils. The gerbils were treated with either saline vehicle or 10 mg/kg i.p. of one of the test drugs 30 minutes before and again 2 hours after a 10-minute period of bilateral carotid artery occlusion or sham occlusion under light methoxyflurane anesthesia. Seven days after ischemia and reperfusion the brains were perfusion-fixed, and hippocampal CA1 cells were counted in a blind fashion. In ischemic gerbils that received only vehicle, there was a 78.9% loss of CA1 neurons compared with sham-occluded gerbils. In contrast, in U50488H-treated gerbils, mean cell loss was reduced to 33.9% (p less than 0.01 vs. vehicle-treated group). U62066E was even more effective in reducing postischemic CA1 degeneration to only 20.7% (p less than 0.0001 vs. vehicle-treated group). However, treatment with the non-kappa analogue U54494A did not cause any apparent protection; the gerbils in this group showed an 80.7% loss of CA1 neurons. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that kappa-receptor stimulation is associated with improved postischemic neuronal preservation.",
