     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate determining factors of the ictal scalp EEG pattern at seizure onset and its predictive value for postsurgical outcome in people with unilateral MTLE due to hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS). METHODS: Review of consecutive people with chronic MTLE-HS undergoing presurgical video-EEG telemetry. Exclusion criteria were additional epileptogenic lesions or seizure generators or compromised EEG traces at seizure-onset. Mixed linear or logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: Inclusion of 63 patients with 219 seizures with a favorable outcome (no seizures or auras only) in 43 patients at last follow-up. Rhythmic activity at seizure-onset (RA) had a frequency of 4.7+/-1.5/s (range 1-8/s), mostly localized in the anterior temporal region. Postsurgical seizure outcome was not associated with any clinical or electrophysiological feature. RA in the delta-band was more often observed with shorter epilepsy duration (p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: RA on scalp EEG gets faster with increasing epilepsy duration, possibly via time-dependent alterations of epileptogenic networks. Neither the frequency of RA nor other EEG-features appeared to predict postsurgical seizure outcome. SIGNIFICANCE: The results challenge the view that if patients with apparent MTLE display RA in the delta-band, seizure-onset in neocortical structures rather than in temporo-mesial tissue should be considered and further investigations should be prompted.",
