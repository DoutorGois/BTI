     "AB": "Dynamin-1 is a GTP-hydrolyzing protein and a key element in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of secretory granules and neurovesicles at the plasma membrane. The unique receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP-NP/Phogrin/IAR/IA-2, is associated with neuroendocrine secretory granules and is highly expressed in the brain. Here, we show by confocal microscopy and biochemical studies that PTP-NP rapidly associates with Dynamin-1 in a depolarization-dependent manner and regulates Dynamin-1 GTPase activity upon KCl depolarization of rat primary hippocampal neurons. Depolarization of primary neurons induced direct association of PTP-NP with Dynamin-1 within 30 s. This association resulted in significant inhibition of Dynamin-1 GTPase activity (approximately 75% inhibition). Mutation within the phosphatase domain of PTP-NP (PTP-NP(D947A)) abolished the direct interaction of PTP-NP with Dynamin-1 and failed to inhibit Dynamin-1 GTPase activity. To further confirm the endogenous interaction of Dynamin-1 with wild-type PTP-NP, Dynamin-1 was purified biochemically from rat brain and its interaction with purified PTP-NP was analyzed. Highly purified Dynamin-1 specifically associated with wild-type PTP-NP and not with mutated PTP-NP, resulting in significant inhibition (approximately 70%) of Dynamin-1 GTPase activity. This is the first report to suggest a novel function of this unique receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase as a potential regulator of Dynamin-1 GTPase activity upon neuronal depolarization.",
