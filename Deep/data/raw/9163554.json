     "AB": "Multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) are thought to be involved in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). In the present study, LTP was induced by theta burst stimulation in the Schaffer collateral area of the stratum radiatum in the hippocampal CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. LTP-induced and control hippocampal slices were studied by Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses using CaMK-I, -II and -IV antibodies. Increased amounts of all three CaMKs were found in LTP-induced hippocampal slices as indicated by Western blot as well as by the density of their immunoreactivity. Our data clearly shows that not only CaMK-II but also CaMK-I and -IV contribute to synaptic plasticity formed in LTP.",
