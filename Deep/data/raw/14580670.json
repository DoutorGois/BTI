     "AB": "Fifty-one consecutive adult patients with epilepsy and early development destructive brain lesions were divided into three main groups according to the topographic distribution of the lesion on magnetic resonance imaging: hemispheric (H) (n=9); main arterial territory (AT) (n=25) and arterial borderzone (Bdz) (n=17). Eight (89%) patients from group H presented status epilepticus in the first 5 years of life, five of them associated with fever. Seventeen of the 25 patients from group AT (76%) had an obvious hemiparesis observed early in life. In addition, major prenatal events were significantly more common in the group AT compared with the other two groups. Among patients from group Bdz, prenatal or postnatal events were not identified, except for one patient. Conversely, nine patients from group Bdz (60%) showed a history of perinatal complications. Hippocampal atrophy (HA) was determined by visual analysis in 74.5% of all patients and by volumetry in 92%. The frequency of HA was comparable among groups, but patients from group H presented the most severe atrophy and more frequent hyperintense T2 hippocampal signal. In conclusion, these three groups of patients with early destructive lesions and epilepsy (H, AT and Bdz), appear to have distinct pathogenic mechanisms. Our data show that there is a striking association of HA with different patterns of neocortical destructive lesions of early development. This association seems to be related to a common and synchronic pathogenic mechanism. The recognition of the pattern and degree of HA among these patients with intractable seizures may influence the surgical rationale.",
