     "AB": "To investigate the pattern of expression of the three calmodulin (CaM) genes by in situ hybridization, gene-specific [35S]-cRNA probes complementary to the multiple CaM mRNAs were hybridized in rat brain sections and subsequently detected by quantitative film or high-resolution nuclear emulsion autoradiography. A widespread and differential area-specific distribution of the CaM mRNAs was detected. The expression patterns corresponding to the three CaM genes differed most considerably in the olfactory bulb, the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, the diagonal band, the suprachiasmatic and medial habenular nuclei, and the hippocampus. Moreover, the significantly higher CaM I and CaM III mRNA copy numbers than that of CaM II in the molecular layers of certain brain areas revealed a differential dendritic targeting of these mRNAs. The results indicate a differential pattern of distribution of the multiple CaM mRNAs at two levels of cellular organization in the brain: (a) region-specific expression and (b) specific intracellular targeting. A precise and gene-specific regulation of synthesis and distribution of CaM mRNAs therefore exists under physiological conditions in the rat brain.",
