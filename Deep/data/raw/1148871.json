     "AB": "Spontaneous and hypothalamically induced theta activity was studied in rabbits lightly anaesthetized with urethane or urethane-chloralose. Well-developed theta activity was found over a large area of the dorsal part of the hippocampal formation, roughly corresponding to the CA1 field. Cross-correlation analysis between a stationary and a moving electrode showed that a large sheet of tissue oscillated in remarkable synchrony. This region was at least 8 mm along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus and 6 mm in a plane transverse to this axis, thus comprising the whole of the rostro-caudal extension of the CA1 region. For technical reasons the temporal half was not explored. Depth recordings showed two foci of theta activity, one in the basal part of CA1 (stratum oriens) and a second, separate region with considerably larger amplitudes in the dentate region, having its maximum in the molecular layer. Due to the folded nature of the dentate fascia, an electrode often recorded two maxima corresponding to its upper and lower blades. Wave form analysis showed that the dentrate and CA1 rhythmic activity was roughly 180 degrees out of phase. The dentate theta activity remained in conditions where the CA1 theta activity was absent, either spontaneously or due to experimental interference. Systematic micro-electrode tracking showed absence of theta activity in the CA3 region. Nor was convincing theta activity found in the subiculum, parasubiculum, presubiculum or entohinal areas.",
