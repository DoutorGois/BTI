     "AB": "A novel peptide, hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP), originally purified from young rat hippocampus, affects the development of specific cholinergic neurons of the central nervous system in vitro. In this study, HCNP-like-immunoreactive nerve processes and nerve cell bodies were identified by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry in the rat small intestine. Labeled nerve processes were numerous in the circular muscle layer and around the submucosal blood vessels. In the submucosal and myenteric plexuses, some HCNP-like-immunopositive nerve cell bodies and nerve fibers were present. The reaction product was deposited on the membranes of various subcellular organelles, including the rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi saccules, ovoid electron-lucent synaptic vesicles in axon terminals associated with submucosal and myenteric plexuses, and the outer membranes of a few mitochondria. The synaptic vesicles of HCNP-like positive terminals were 60-85 nm in diameter. The present data provide immunocytochemical evidence that HCNP-like-positive nerve cell bodies and nerve fibers are present in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses of the rat small intestine. An immunohistochemical light microscopic study using mirror-image sections revealed that in both the submucosal and myenteric ganglia, almost all choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunoreactive neurons were also immunoreactive for HCNP. These observations suggest (i) that HCNP proper and/or HCNP precursor protein is a membrane-associated protein with a widespread subcellular distribution, (ii) that HCNP precursor protein may be biosynthesized within neurons localized in the rat enteric nervous system, and (iii) that HCNP proper and/or HCNP precursor protein are probably stored in axon terminals.",
