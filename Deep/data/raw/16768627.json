     "AB": "The functional role of subiculum within the hippocampal formation circuit remains largely unexplored, and a theoretical and experimental consensus on its functions has yet to emerge. In the present issue, M. E. Andrzejewski, R. C. Spencer, and A. E. Kelley (2006) provided evidence using pharmacological methods of a possible dissociation of function between dorsal and ventral subiculum in instrumental learning. Their findings provide an important contribution toward testing an emerging framework for understanding the functions of this key and underinvestigated component of the hippocampal formation.",
