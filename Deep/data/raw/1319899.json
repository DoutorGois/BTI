     "AB": "Understanding the molecular basis of altered neuronal excitability in epilepsy is a major challenge in neuroscience research. The present study suggests an inverse correlation between changes in neuronal excitability in status epilepticus and the activity of type II multifunctional calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaM kinase II), a major Ca(2+)-signal transducing system in brain. 'Continuous' hippocampal stimulation (CHS), a new model of non-convulsive limbic status epilepticus (SE), mimics the progression of electrographic changes characteristic in human SE and allows for quantitation of post-stimulus seizure severity. In the present study, hippocampus and anterior neocortex from CHS-stimulated rats and paired surgical controls were assayed for CaM kinase II activity by incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate from [gamma-32P]ATP into the 50-kDa subunit of the kinase itself (autophosphorylation). In all instances, CHS induced sustained interictal bursting and/or electrographic seizures. Decreased CaM kinase II activity was seen in all preparations from electrically stimulated hippocampus. CaM kinase II activity in CHS animals was diminished by 37% relative to controls (P less than 0.01; Student's paired t-test). The progressive intensity of the EEG discharges correlated directly with the decrement of CaM kinase II activity (P less than 0.05; Spearman's rank correlation test, n = 5). This is the first report of a dynamic modulation of a biochemical system that has been implicated in neuronal excitability in coordination with the characterized developmental stages of SE.",
