     "AB": "Presynaptic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) occur at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. Whether and how they modulate orthodromic signaling to postsynaptic targets is poorly understood. We found that an endogenous neurosteroid that is selective for high-affinity delta subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs depolarized rat mossy fiber boutons, enhanced action potential-dependent Ca(2+) transients and facilitated glutamatergic transmission to pyramidal neurons. Conversely, blocking GABA(A)Rs hyperpolarized mossy fiber boutons, increased their input resistance, decreased spike width and attenuated action potential-dependent presynaptic Ca(2+) transients, indicating that a subset of presynaptic GABA receptors are tonically active. Blocking GABA(A)Rs also interfered with the induction of long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. Presynaptic GABA(A)Rs therefore facilitate information flow to the hippocampus both directly and by enhancing LTP.",
