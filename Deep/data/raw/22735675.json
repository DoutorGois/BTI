     "AB": "Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is considered a key protein in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of its neurotoxicity and capacity to form characteristic insoluble deposits known as senile plaques. Abeta derives from amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP), whose proteolytic processing generates several fragments including Abeta peptides of various lengths. The normal function of AbetaPP and its fragments remains poorly understood. While some fragments have been suggested to have a function in normal physiological cellular processes, Abeta has been widely considered as a \"garbage\" fragment that becomes toxic when it accumulates in the brain, resulting in impaired synaptic function and memory. Abeta is produced and released physiologically in the healthy brain during neuronal activity. In the last 10 years, we have been investigating whether Abeta plays a physiological role in the brain. We first demonstrated that picomolar concentrations of a human Abeta42 preparation enhanced synaptic plasticity and memory in mice. Next, we investigated the role of endogenous Abeta in healthy murine brains and found that treatment with a specific antirodent Abeta antibody and an siRNA against murine AbetaPP impaired synaptic plasticity and memory. The concurrent addition of human Abeta42 rescued these deficits, suggesting that in the healthy brain, physiological Abeta concentrations are necessary for normal synaptic plasticity and memory to occur. Furthermore, the effect of both exogenous and endogenous Abeta was seen to be mediated by modulation of neurotransmitter release and alpha7-nicotinic receptors. These findings need to be taken into consideration when designing novel therapeutic strategies for AD.",
