     "AB": "A monoclonal antibody against benzodiazepines (21-7F9) was used to study the distribution of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity in the rat brain. Immunodensitometry in combination with image analysis were used for quantification. The results showed a ubiquitous distribution of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity throughout the brain. Very high levels of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity were found in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, in the primary olfactory cortex, in the stratum pyramidale of the hippocampus and in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb. High densities of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity were found in the granule cell layer of the cerebellum, the pyramidal cell layer of the olfactory tubercle, the granule layer of the dentate gyrus, the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, the mammillary bodies, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal and superficial grey layer of superior colliculus. The substantia nigra pars compacta, the islands of Calleja and layers II, III, V and VI of the cerebral cortex had moderate levels of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity. Lower densities were found in the internal granular layer and the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb, in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, in layers I and IV of the cerebral cortex, in the nucleus caudate-putamen and most of the thalamic nuclei. The lowest density of immunoreactivity was found in the globus pallidus, and the strata radiatum, oriens and lacunosum-moleculare of the hippocampus. The distribution of endogenous benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity was compared with the distribution of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor by using both immunocytochemistry and receptor autoradiography. Our studies have shown a clear mismatch between the localization of the benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity and the GABA/benzodiazepine receptors.",
