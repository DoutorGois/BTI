     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to test the capability of contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in assessing lesion formation in rat brain after systemic (i.v.) administration of kainate. MRI was performed with T1 -weighted spin echo sequence before and after the administration of kainate and contrast media. Contrast media used were based on paramagnetic gadolinium (III) ion: Gd-DTPA (gadoliniumdiethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid) and prototype agents for blood-pool enhancement Gadomer-17 and polylysine-Gd-DTPA. Enhancement of lesion rims and other brain tissue abnormalities due to kainate with Gd-DTPA, Gadomer-17 and polylysine-Gd-DTPA were observed mainly in the region of hippocampus and in the areas not protected by the blood-brain-barrier (BBB).",
