     "AB": "The traditional Chinese medicine Jiaweisinisan has antidepressant effects, and can inhibit hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland axis hyperactivity in stress-induced depression. In this study, rat hippocampal neural precursor cells were cultured in serum-free medium in vitro and a stress damage model was established with 120 muM corticosterone. Cells were treated with 10% (v/v) Jiaweisinisan drug-containing serum and the corticosterone antagonist RU38486. Results of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide assay showed that both Jiaweisinisan drug-containing serum and RU38486 promoted the proliferation of neural precursor cells after corticosterone exposure. Immunofluorescence detection showed that after Jiaweisinisan drug-containing serum and RU38486 treatment, the 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling ratio in hippocampal neural precursor cells significantly increased, and the apoptotic rates of glial cells reduced, and neuron-like cell differentiation from neural precursor cells significantly increased. Our experimental findings indicate that Jiaweisinisan promotes hippocampal neurogenesis after stress damage.",
