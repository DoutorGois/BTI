     "AB": "The objective of this investigation was to use semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry to determine the distribution and expression levels of AQP2 and AQP3 proteins in normal human Tissue MicroArrays. Expression of the vasopressin regulated AQP2 was observed in a limited number of tissues. AQP2 was prominent in the apical and subapical plasma membranes of cortical and medullary renal collecting ducts. Surprisingly, weak AQP2 immunoreactivity was also noted in pancreatic islets, fallopian tubes and peripheral nerves. AQP2 was also localized to selected parts of the central nervous system (ependymal cell layer, subcortical white matter, hippocampus, spinal cord) and selected cells in the gastrointestinal system (antral and oxyntic gastric mucosa, small intestine and colon). These findings corroborate the restricted tissue distribution of AQP2. AQP3 was strongly expressed in many of the human tissues examined particularly in basolateral membranes of the distal nephron (medullary collecting ducts), distal colon, upper airway epithelia, transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder, tracheal, bronchial and nasopharyngeal epithelium, stratified squamous epithelial cells of the esophagus, and anus. AQP3 was moderately expressed in basolateral membranes of prostatic tubuloalveolar epithelium, pancreatic ducts, uterine endometrium, choroid plexus, articular chondrocytes, subchondral osteoblasts and synovium. Low AQP3 levels were also detected in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, gastric pits, seminiferous tubules, lymphoid vessels, salivary and endocrine glands, amniotic membranes, placenta and ovary. The abundance of basolateral AQP3 in epithelial tissues and its expression in many non-epithelial cells suggests that this aquaglyceroporin is a major participant in barrier hydration and water and osmolyte homeostasis in the human body.",
