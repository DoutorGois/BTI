     "AB": "Regional differences in Na,K-ATPase activity, and development of Na,K-ATPase activity were examined in rabbit hippocampus using a histochemical marker of enzyme activity. Stratum lucidum of CA3/CA2, corresponding to the mossy fiber terminal field, showed high Na,K-ATPase activity compared to stratum radiatum of CA1. A significant increase in Na,K-ATPase activity was found between 8 and 15 days postnatal. Tissues with limited Na,K-ATPase activity (immature hippocampus, the mature CA1 region) appear particularly prone to seizure-like abnormalities, perhaps reflecting an inability to regulate extracellular potassium.",
