The encephalopathy was the consequence of preexisting hypertensive alterations, acidosis, hypoxia, ischemia, bacteremia and varicella-zoster meningoencephalitis. The vasculitic alterations associated with meningoencephalitis had a major influence on the development and the extent of the leukoencephalopathy.",
