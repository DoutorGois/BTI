     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Suyu capsule on behavior, injury of hippocampal neurons and Ca2+ ion in hippocampal synaptic in the depression model mice. METHOD: Sixty male Kunming mice were randomly divided into 5 groups, the control group, the model group and three Suyu capsule groups (the doses were 22.8, 11.4, 5.7 g x kg(-1) respectively). The model was established by separation and chronic unpredictable mild stimulation. The increased weight and crossing score, rearing score were measured by open-field and sweet water consumption of mice. Cone cell and configuration of neuron in CA1, CA3 region of hippocampus were observed by Nissl. The concentration of hippocampal synaptic Ca2+ ion was detected by fluorimetry. RESULT: Comparing with the mice of control, the increased weight was slowered ( P < 0.01), the scores of rearing and crossing were decreased (P < 0.01), sweet water consumption were decreased too (P < 0.01), numbers of cone cell in CA3 region of hippocampus were decreased obviously (P < 0.01), and Ca2+ ion in hippocampal synaptic was increased obviously. Comparing with the mice of model, Suyu capsule (22.8 g kg(-1)) could increase the increased weight on the 14th and 21 st day obviously (P < 0.05); Suyu capsule (22.8 g x kg(-1)) could increase the scores of crossing obviously (P < 0.05), Suyu capsule (22.8, 11.4 g x kg(-1)) could increase the scores of rearing obviously (P < 0.01, P < 0.05); Suyu capsule (22.8, 11.4, 5.8 g x kg(-1)) could increase sweet water consumption obviously (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, P < 0.05; Suyu capsule (22.8, 11.4, 5.8 g x kg(-1)) could increase numbers of cone cell in CA3 region of hippocampus obviously (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, P < 0.05); Suyu capsule (22.8, 11.4, 5.8 g x kg(-1)) decreased Ca2+ ion in hippocampal synaptic with dose-effect relationship (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Suyu capsule can improve all the symptoms of the depression model mice and protect injury of hippocampal neurons in the depression model mice. The possible mechanism of action is to restrict Ca2+ ion overfreight.",
