     "AB": "Reported here is the case of a 65-year-old man who suffered a burst of severe, repetitive generalized seizures (status epilepticus). On recovery of consciousness he was left with a profound impairment of memory, which remained unchanged for the subsequent 30 months of his life. During this period the cognitive defect was fully documented. Careful neuropathologic examination disclosed the presence of remarkably discrete lesions, confined to the hippocampus on each side. Because of the rarity of well-documented instances of this type and their importance in the study of memory function, we are reporting our case in some detail.",
