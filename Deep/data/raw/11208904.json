     "AB": "Lecticans, a family of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, represent the largest group of proteoglycans expressed in the nervous system. We previously showed that the C-type lectin domains of lecticans bind two classes of sulfated cell surface glycolipids, sulfatides and HNK-1-reactive sulfoglucuronylglycolipids (SGGLs). In this paper, we demonstrate that the interaction between the lectin domain of brevican, a nervous system-specific lectican, and cell surface SGGLs acts as a novel cell recognition system that promotes neuronal adhesion and neurite outgrowth. The Ig chimera of the brevican lectin domain bind to the surface of SGGL-expressing rat hippocampal neurons. The substrate of the brevican chimera promotes adhesion and neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons. The authentic, full-length brevican also promotes neuronal cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth. These activities of brevican substrates are neutralized by preincubation of cells with HNK-1 monoclonal antibodies and by pretreatment of the brevican substrates with purified SGGLs. Brevican and HNK-1 carbohydrates are coexpressed in specific layers of the developing hippocampus where axons from entorhinal neurons elongate. Our observations suggest that cell surface SGGLs and extracellular lecticans comprise a novel cell-substrate recognition system operating in the developing nervous system.",
