     "AB": "Chemokine and receptor systems play important roles in different animal models of status epileptics and epileptogenesis. Here, we identified protein and gene expression of chemokine receptor 6 in the hippocampus of Swiss mice with immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR respectively. Immunohistochemical study showed that CCR6 immunopositive product was localized in different subtypes of hippocampal interneurons, in apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons of CA1 area and other laminas of the hippocampus. Strongly stained CCR6 immunopositive product was found in calbindin, calretinin, parvalbumin immunopositive interneurons in the stratum oriens of CA1 area. During pilocarpine induced status epilepticus, a transient down-regulation of neuronal CCR6 in the stratum oriens of CA1 was demonstrated at 2h during status epilepticus. The present study provides evidence that CCR6 may be involved in normal neuronal activity in the hippocampus and play an important role in maintenance of the status epilepticus.",
