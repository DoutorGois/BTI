     "AB": "We previously showed that Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) is down-regulated in a kainate (KA)-induced rat epileptic seizure model. The underlying mechanism had remained largely unknown, but we here report for the first time that denitrosylation and ubiquitination are involved. Our results show that the S-nitrosylation levels of Bcl-2 are down-regulated after KA injection and that the GluR6 (glutamate receptor 6) antagonist NS102 can inhibit the denitrosylation of Bcl-2. Moreover, the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Bcl-2 was found to be promoted after KA treatment, which could be suppressed by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the NO donors, sodium nitroprusside and S-nitrosoglutathione. In addition, experiments based on siRNA transfections were performed in the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line to verify that the stability of Bcl-2 is causal to neuronal survival. At the same time, it was found that the exogenous NO donor GSNO could protect neurons when Bcl-2 is targeted. Subsequently, these mechanisms were morphologically validated by immunohistochemistry, cresyl violet staining, and in situ TUNEL staining to analyze the expression of Bcl-2 as well as the survival of CA1 and CA3/DG pyramidal neurons. NS102, GSNO, sodium nitroprusside, and MG132 contribute to the survival of CA1 and CA3/DG pyramidal neurons by attenuating Bcl-2 denitrosylation. Taken together, our data reveal that Bcl-2 ubiquitin-dependent degradation is induced by Bcl-2 denitrosylation during neuronal apoptosis after KA treatment.",
