     "AB": "SC1 is an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein related to SPARC which exhibits anti-adhesive properties. ECM molecules are thought to play important roles in influencing cell shape, proliferation and migration during neurogenesis. Following localized injury to the adult rat forebrain, a biphasic induction of SC1 mRNA was apparent, namely a rapid, transient induction at 1 day post-lesion in cortical neurons which border the lesion site followed by a more prolonged induction in astrocytes which are proximal to the wound site. A similar SC1 induction pattern was observed in the hippocampus in response to the injury. SPARC mRNA exhibits a divergent pattern of induction because it is induced in mature blood vessels close to the lesion and in blood vessels which develop following the trauma. Thus mRNAs encoding the related ECM glycoproteins SC1 and SPARC are induced in different cell populations in the adult forebrain during the neural response to localized injury.",
