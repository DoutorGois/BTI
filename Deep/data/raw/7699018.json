     "AB": "Using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization histochemistry, we have investigated in embryonic and postnatal rat nervous tissue the localization and cellular sites of synthesis of glypican, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Glypican immunoreactivity is present in the marginal layer (prospective white matter) and in the dorsal root entry zone of E13-16 spinal cord, as well as in the optic nerve and retina at this stage, but does not appear at significant levels in brain until approximately E19. The proteoglycan shows a wide distribution in grey matter and axonal projections of postnatal brain, including the hippocampal formation, the parallel fibers of cerebellar granule cells, and in the medulla and brainstem. Northern analysis demonstrated high levels of glypican mRNA in brain and skeletal muscle, and in rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. In situ hybridization histochemistry showed that glypican mRNA was especially prominent in cerebellar granule cells, large motor neurons in the brainstem, and CA3 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. Our immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization results indicate that glypican is predominantly a neuronal membrane proteoglycan in the late embryonic and postnatal rat central nervous system.",
