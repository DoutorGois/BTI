     "AB": "To determine whether memory is processed in a localized or distributed manner by the hippocampus, we inactivated small regions of the structure in pretrained rats before a retention test. Ibotenic acid-induced lesions removing 40% of the hippocampal tissue disrupted retrieval of spatial memory in a water maze but failed to affect new learning or retrieval of a task that was acquired postoperatively. Partial inactivation of the hippocampus by local intrahippocampal 5-aminomethyl-3-hydroxyisoxazole muscimol infusion also impaired retrieval but not new learning. This impairment was temporary; infusions had no effect on retrieval of predrug performance when the test was conducted 48 hr after the infusion. Systematic variation of the volume of dorsal and ventral hippocampal lesions showed that successful retrieval required the integrity of the entire dorsal 70% of the hippocampus. Our data suggest that although spatial tasks can be acquired with local ensembles of hippocampal neurons when other parts of the hippocampus are inactivated, spatial memory is normally both encoded and retrieved by a widely distributed hippocampal network.",
