     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of chronic lead exposure on expression of autophagy-associated proteins in rat hippocampus. METHODS: SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group was given distilled water, lead-exposed groups were given 0.5 g/L (low-dose) or 2.0 g/L(high-dose) lead acetate solution in drinking water. The rat pups started to drink the lead content water until 60 d maturity. The lead contents in blood and brain samples were analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The expressions of Beclin 1, LC3, LAMP2 and cathepsin B proteins were detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with control group, the contents of lead were significantly higher in blood and hippocampus samples in chronic lead-exposed rats (P<0.01). Western blot showed that the expression of Beclin 1 and LC3-II/LC3-I increased significantly in high dose lead-exposed group compared with control group (P<0.05 or P<0.001). The confocal laser immunostaining results demonstrated that increased immunofluorescence staining of cathepsin B in hippocampal neurons compared with control animals. CONCLUSION: The disturbance of autophagy-lysosome signaling molecules might be partially contribute to neurotoxicity of chronic lead exposure.",
