     "AB": "1. Epileptiform activities were elicited from the in vitro guinea pig hippocampus by the addition of picrotoxin. Modification of the picrotoxin-induced activities by agents active at metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) was examined using intracellular and extracellular recordings. 2. Picrotoxin typically elicited synchronized discharges (epileptiform bursts) in CA3 neurons. These spontaneously occurred at regular intervals. In the presence of (+)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG; 700-1,000 microM), an antagonist at multiple mGluR subtypes, the frequency of spontaneous epileptiform bursts decreased. In contrast, when the mGluR agonists (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD; 5 microM) or (2S,3S,4S)-alpha-(carboxycyclopropyl)-glycine (L-CCG-I; 10 microM) were added to the incubating medium, the frequency of epileptiform bursts increased. No consistent change in membrane potential, burst duration, nor burst afterhyperpolarization was associated with the changes in burst frequency. 3. When spontaneous burst frequency was reduced in MCPG, stimulation at a higher frequency entrained bursts without failure. Bursts evoked in MCPG were similar in waveform and amplitude to those evoked in the control state. 4. (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine (S-4CPG) and (R,S)-4-carboxy-3-hydroxyphenylglycine (RS-4C3HPG) are antagonists at mGluR subtypes 1 and 5 but agonists at mGluRs 2 and 3. Addition of either of these agents increased the frequency of epileptiform bursts. 5. These results suggest that sufficient glutamate is released during epileptiform activities to activate mGluRs. The overall effect is to increase the frequency of synchronized discharges. This modulatory action on burst frequency is probably mediated via the mGluR 2 and 3 receptor subclass.",
