     "AB": "1. The effects of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake blocker tiagabine on inhibitory synaptic potentials (IPSPs) were examined with microelectrode and whole-cell recording from CA3 pyramidal cells in rat hippocampal slice cultures. 2. Tiagabine (10-25 microM) greatly prolonged the duration of monosynaptic IPSPs elicited in the presence of excitatory amino acid antagonists but had no effect on their amplitude. Part of the prolonged time course resulted from a GABAB receptor-mediated component that was not detectable under control conditions. 3. The mean decay time constant of the underlying GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic current was increased from 16 to 250 ms. Spontaneous miniature IPSPs recorded with whole-cell clamp were unaffected by tiagabine. Pentobarbital sodium, in contrast, increased the decay time constant of both evoked and spontaneous GABAA-mediated currents. 4. Tiagabine (25 microM) inhibited spontaneous and evoked epileptiform bursting induced by increasing the extracellular potassium concentration to 8 mM. 5. We conclude that GABA uptake plays a significant role in determining the time course of evoked IPSPs and also limits the likelihood that GABAB receptors are activated.",
