     "AB": "The present study aimed to elucidate the distribution of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the hippocampus after intracerebroventricular injections of kainate. Very little or no staining of HO-1 was observed in the normal CA1, whilst moderate staining of dentate hilar neurons was observed in the dentate gyrus, in the normal hippocampus. At postinjection day 1, a slight increase in immunoreactivity in the neuropil of the lesioned CA fields and a marked increase in HO-1 immunoreactivity in glial cells of the stratum lacunosum moleculare of CA fields and the stratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus was observed. Electron microscopy showed that the glial cells had features of viable astrocytes. At postinjection day 3, glial cells in the dentate gyrus continued to express HO-1, whilst pyramidal neurons in the degenerating CA fields started to express intense HO-1 immunoreactivity in their cell bodies. At postinjection weeks 1-3, HO-1 was observed in glial cells in the center of the lesion, but also in neurons at the perifocal region of the glial scar. The glial cells were found to have features of viable astrocytes and microglia, whilst the neurons contained discontinuous cell membranes and nuclear outlines, and had features of degenerating neurons. Intense immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasm of the degenerating neurons. The density of staining was greater than that observed in astrocytes or microglia. Recent in vitro results on fibroblasts transfected with HO-1 cDNA showed that, despite cytoprotection with low (less than fivefold compared with untransfected cells) HO-1 activity, high levels of HO-1 expression (more than 15-fold) were associated with significant oxygen toxicity. These and the present observations suggest a destructive effect of increased expression of HO-1 in neurons, and possible novel therapeutic approaches involving overexpression of HO-1 must therefore be approached with caution.",
