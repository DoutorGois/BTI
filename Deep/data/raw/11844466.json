     "AB": "The effect of Trimetazidine (TMZ) as a potential neuroprotectant against stroke was studied in the gerbil model of transient forebrain global ischemia. Animals were subjected to a 5-min period of ischemia and assessed 4 and 21 days later. Gerbils were divided into two groups: in group one, gerbils were treated with TMZ at a dose of 25 mg/kg given by intraperitoneal injection prior to ischemia. In group two, gerbils were treated with TMZ at a dose of 25 mg/kg given intraperitoneally after ischemia. Saline-injected gerbils served as controls. Histological evaluation of neuronal damage was carried out using the silver staining technique in gerbils 4 and 21 days after the start of the experimental protocol. Behavioral functions were assessed in gerbils from the 14th to the 21st day after the start of the experimental protocol using the Morris water maze test. Results obtained from this study showed no significant difference between saline treated TMZ-treated gerbils when TMZ was administered after ischemia. When TMZ was administered prior to ischemia, there was a reduction in neuronal damage although it did not reach statistical significance and a statistically significant improvement in behavior. We conclude that TMZ shows signs of promise as a neuroprotective agent, and further studies should look at pre-treatment with different doses and different times.",
