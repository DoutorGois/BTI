     "AB": "The present study was undertaken to determine the importance of adenosine in the cerebrovascular response to hypoxia. The mass spectrometry method was used to investigate local blood flow, tissue pO2 and pCO2 in 3 cerebral structures: caudate nucleus (n = 8), thalamus (n = 5) and hippocampus (n = 5) in unanesthetized, spontaneously breathing rabbits. After having tested the reproducibility of the hypoxic response each animal was exposed twice to moderate hypoxia. I.v. theophylline (10 mg/kg) was administered between the first and second exposures to hypoxia. The principal finding is that in each cerebral region, the vasodilatation induced by hypoxia was significantly decreased by pretreatment with theophylline despite the low theophylline dose used. It is concluded that adenosine is partly responsible for the cerebral vasodilatation observed during hypoxia. Several other mechanisms possibly involved in this cerebrovascular response are discussed.",
