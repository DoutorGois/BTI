     "AB": "Increasing evidence supports an association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes. In this context, anti-diabetic agents such as rosiglitazone and glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 have been reported to reduce pathologies associated with AD, including tau hyperphosphorylation, suggesting that such agents might be used to treat AD. One such anti-diabetic agent is sitagliptin, which acts through inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV to increase GLP-1 levels. Given this action, sitagliptin would be predicted to reduce AD pathology. Accordingly, we investigated whether sitagliptin is effective in attenuating AD pathologies, focusing on tau phosphorylation in the OLETF type 2 diabetic rat model. Unexpectedly, we found that sitagliptin was not effective against pathological tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus of OLETF type 2 diabetes rats, and instead aggravated it. This paradoxically increased tau phosphorylation was attributed to activation of the tau kinase, GSK3beta (glycogen synthase kinase 3beta). Sitagliptin also increased ser-616 phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, suggesting increased insulin resistance in the brain. These phenomena were recapitulated in primary rat cortical neurons treated with sitagliptin, further confirming sitagliptin's effects on AD-related pathologies in neurons. These results highlight the need for caution in considering the use of sitagliptin in AD therapy.",
