     "AB": "An incubation medium was adapted for the microphotometric determination (kinetic and end-point measurements) of the activities of mitochondrial alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) in the rat hippocampus. For comparison, the activities of the cytoplasmic NAD-linked alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase were also measured. The study showed that in the demonstration of both enzymes the use of an exogenous electron carrier is necessary. Both enzymes react to phenazine methosulfate (PMS) which transfers reduction equivalents to the electron acceptor nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (NBT), thus causing a coreaction of GPDH in the demonstration of NAD-GPDH. Therefore, only the NAD-independent GPDH which is stimulated by menadione, can be selectively demonstrated in the histochemical procedure applied. The final incubation medium of GPDH consisted of 15 mM L-glycerol 3-phosphate, 5 mM NBT, 0.4 mM menadione, 7.5% polyvinyl alcohol in 0.5 M Hepes buffer, pH 8; the final pH of the incubation medium was 7.5. A linear response of the reaction lasted about 5 min. There was a linear relationship between section thickness and the formation of reaction product up to a section thickness of 14 microns. The apparent Km value at 25 degrees C was 0.6 mM. It is concluded that using menadione histochemical methods are suited to determine the mitochondrial GPDH activities in brain sections whereas using PMS a coreaction of GPDH takes place in the demonstration of NAD-GPDH, so that a histochemical quantification of NAD-GPDH cannot be recommended.",
