     "AB": "1. CCK receptors have been characterized and localized in various mammalian species and significant species-specific differences in their distribution have been identified. In the present study, we report the first autoradiographic localization of CCK binding sites in the canine brain. 2. High densities of [125I]BH-CCK-8 binding sites were found in the cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, olfactory bulb and nucleus accumbens. Moderate densities were present in the putamen, amygdala, and substantia gelatinosa. Low binding densities were observed in the globus pallidus, inferior colliculus, hypothalamus and thalamus. 3. Although the distribution profile of CCK binding sites in canine brain is similar to those previously reported in the rodent, primate and human brain, notable differences were observed in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum.",
