     "AB": "The autofluorescence properties of serotonin (5-HT) were investigated by light spectrofluorometry in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo experiments. Ex vivo samples were prepared from rat brain regions containing serotonin (5-HT) i.e. cortex, striatum, hippocampus. Rats were untreated (controls) or previously submitted to chronic behavioural or pharmacological treatments known to affect endogenous 5-HT levels. Autofluorescence analysis (excitation: 366 nm) on hippocampus homogenates supplied with exogenous 5-HT revealed spectral alterations attributable to changes of endogenous 5-HT levels. In vivo, real time fluorescence studies were performed via a 50 microm diameter optic fiber probe stereotaxically implanted into selected brain areas of anaesthetised rats treated with fluoxetine or 5-OH-tryptophan. All autofluorescence data were consistent with those obtained in parallel experiments performed with ex vivo or in vivo voltammetry, confirming that auto-fluorescence spectroscopy is a suitable technique for the direct assessment of fluorescent neurotransmitters. This is a reliable evidence of the in vivo application of spectroscopy together with optic fiber probe for in vivo, in situ and real time measurement of 5-HT in discrete brain areas.",
