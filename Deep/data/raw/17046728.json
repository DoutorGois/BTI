     "AB": "Immunohistochemical study was performed to determine distribution of ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase1 (NPP1) in adult rat forebrain. The study revealed widespread distribution of NPP1 in rat forebrain, yet with regional differences in the expression pattern and abundance. Strong NPP1 immunoreaction was detected in pyramidal cell layer of cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and in the midline regions of hypothalamus and thalamus. In many immunopositive forebrain areas, NPP1 was mainly localized at neuronal cell bodies. However, prominent immunoreaction was also detected at ependymal cells, tanycytes, endothelial cells of the capillaries and cells of the choroid plexus, suggesting that NPP1 could be involved in some highly specialized transport process.",
