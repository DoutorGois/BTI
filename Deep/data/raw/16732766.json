     "AB": "We observed the learning ability in Clock mutant mice with Jcl/ICR background (Clockj), a mice model of evening-type individuals, in the early part of dark phase. In order to estimate the learning ability, Morris water maze (WM) and passive avoidance (PA) test were performed. Release of acetylcholine, 5 hydroxytryptophan (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in hippocampus was measured by in vivo microdialysis method. Clockj showed the impaired learning ability in the WM, but not in PA test. Hippocampal acetylcholine release was significantly attenuated in the Clockj in comparison to the wild-type mice. Neither 5-HT nor DA in the hippocampus was affected by the Clock mutation. Clock, an essential gene controlling circadian rhythm, may have an important role on the spatial learning and hippocampal cholinergic function, at least, at the beginning of the dark phase.",
