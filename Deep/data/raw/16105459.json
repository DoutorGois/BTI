     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of aluminum chloride on motor and species-typical behaviors in mice. METHODS: Male ICR mice were administered with drinking double distilled water only containing AlCl(3) (10, 50, 300 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)), and control group with drinking double distilled water only for 100 days. Spontaneous activity test, grip strength, beam traversal, tightrope task, food hoarding, and nest construction were used to study the effect of chloride aluminum on motor and species-typical behaviors in mice. RESULTS: The frequencies of spontaneous activity in low dose group, medium dose group and high dose group [(81.53 +/- 8.97), (71.67 +/- 8.37), (66.73 +/- 6.96) times respectively] were lower than that in control [(106.46 +/- 8.21) times] (P < 0.01), and were negatively correlated with doses (r(s) = -0.42, P < 0.01). Grip strength scores in medium dose group (19.19 +/- 1.48) and high dose group (13.36 +/- 1.46) respectively were lower than that in control (24.31 +/- 1.43) (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Food hoarding was greater in high dose group [96.10 (90.20-99.00) g] than that in control group [84.00 (78.00-90.00) g (P < 0.05)]. The rest of parameters were of no statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Subchronic exposure to AlCl(3) in mice may diminish motor activity and grip strength, but motor coordination was not impaired; alteration in food hoarding suggests damage to hippocampus cell.",
