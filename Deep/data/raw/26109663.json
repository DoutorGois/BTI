     "AB": "In brain, specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) associate with localized mRNAs and function as regulators of protein synthesis at synapses exerting an indirect control on neuronal activity. Thus, the Fragile X Mental Retardation protein (FMRP) regulates expression of the scaffolding postsynaptic density protein PSD95, but the mode of control appears to be different from other FMRP target mRNAs. Here, we show that the fragile X mental retardation-related protein 2 (FXR2P) cooperates with FMRP in binding to the 3'-UTR of mouse PSD95/Dlg4 mRNA. Absence of FXR2P leads to decreased translation of PSD95/Dlg4 mRNA in the hippocampus, implying a role for FXR2P as translation activator. Remarkably, mGluR-dependent increase of PSD95 synthesis is abolished in neurons lacking Fxr2. Together, these findings show a coordinated regulation of PSD95/Dlg4 mRNA by FMRP and FXR2P that ultimately affects its fine-tuning during synaptic activity.",
