     "AB": "The effect of hippocampal aspiration lesions on latent inhibition of eyeblink conditioning in the restrained rat preparation was examined. Rats received either sham, cortical control, or hippocampal aspiration lesions. Control animals, but not animals with hippocampal lesions, showed slower conditioning after being preexposed to the conditioned stimulus (latent inhibition). Together with previous results regarding the effect of hippocampal lesions in acquisition and extinction of delay conditioning, the present study suggests that the restrained rat preparation may serve as a reliable way of investigating hippocampal participation in different classical conditioning paradigms.",
