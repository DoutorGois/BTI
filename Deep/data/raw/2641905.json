     "AB": "A combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has been used to follow the time course of changes resulting from forebrain ischemia in the rat. The 31P MRS demonstrates that the level of high energy metabolites decreases significantly during the 10 min ischemic period but returns to normal after 1 h of reperfusion. MRI shows no change after 1 h of reperfusion but significant changes in the striatum after 24 h and in the hippocampus after 48 h. These changes correlate well with histopathology. Diabetic rats have shown the effect of hyperglycemia in accentuation of ischemic and post ischemic pH changes. Conversely, diabetic rats maintained severely hypoglycemic with insulin showed little variation in pH during or following the ischemic insult. The results emphasize the importance of both MRS and MRI in following the temporal profile and distribution of ischemic neuronal injury.",
