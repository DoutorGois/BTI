     "AB": "Adult cynomolgus monkeys were administered trimethyltin (TMT) iv in dosages ranging from 0.75 to 4.0 mg TMT/kg and observed for behavioral changes. Animals were subsequently killed for light and electron microscopic examination. TMT showed a dose-related toxicity, with high dose animals (4.0 and 3.0 mg/kg) dying within 24 hr, and low dose animals (0.75 mg/kg) surviving without morphological effects. Animals given 1.10 mg TMT/kg displayed a reproducible clinical course, characterized by tremor, hyperactivity, and ataxia which progressed to stupor and finally unconsciousness. By light microscopy, neuropathology was most pronounced in the CA-3 and CA-4 regions of Ammon's horn. Degenerating pyramidal neurons, micro- and astrogliosis, and neuronophagia were commonly observed. Mild degenerative changes were identified in amygdala, medulla, spinal cord, and Purkinje cells. The fascia dentata remained intact. Ultrastructurally, injured neurons contained accumulations of lysosomes and lysosome-like structures within perikarya and neurites. Demyelination or vascular damage was not observed. Data indicate the monkey to be highly sensitive to TMT, with morphological injury most severe in limbic structures.",
