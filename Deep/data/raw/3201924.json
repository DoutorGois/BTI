In addition to a carbohydrate-rich matrix, we also consistently found local cell-derived vesicles within plaque and dyshoric amyloid. The most likely source for these vesicles appeared to be degenerate neurites. Amyloid fibrils were intimately associated with plasmalemmata, particularly those of degenerate neurites, which supported a neuronal origin for the amyloid fibril of Alzheimer's disease.",
