     "AB": "Adult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain is now a widely accepted phenomenon, typically occurring in two forebrain structures: the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). Until recently, the majority of studies have focused on laboratory rodents, and it is under debate whether the process of adult neurogenesis occurs outside of the SGZ and the SVZ in other mammalian species. In the present study, we investigated potential adult neurogenetic sites in the brains of two elephant shrews/sengis, a golden mole and a rock hyrax, all members of the superorder Afrotheria. Doublecortin (DCX) immunoreactivity was used as a proxy to visualise adult neurogenesis, which is expressed in neuronal precursor cells and immature neurons. In all four species, densely packed DCX-positive cells were present in the SVZ, from where cells appear to migrate along the rostral migratory stream towards the olfactory bulb (OB). DCX-immunopositive cells were present in the granular cell layer and the glomerular layer of the OB. In the hippocampus, DCX-immunopositive cells were observed in the SGZ and in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus, with DCX-immunopositive processes extending into the molecular layer. In addition to these well-established adult neurogenic regions, DCX-immunopositive cells were also observed in layer II of the neocortex and the piriform cortex. While the present study reveals a similar pattern of adult neurogenesis to that reported previously in other mammals, further studies are needed to clarify if the cortical DCX-immunopositive cells are newly generated neurons or cells undergoing cortical remodelling.",
