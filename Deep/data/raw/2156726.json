     "AB": "We examined the anticonvulsant effects of DN-1417 an analog of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in seizure-prone El mice. Changes in both immunoreactive TRH (IR-TRH) and TRH receptor binding activity in discrete brain regions of El mice were also measured before and after sensitization and during the postictal period, and they were compared with those in the ddY mice. Intraperitoneal injection of DN-1417 with 150 and 450 mg/kg significantly increased the El mouse seizure threshold in a dose-dependent manner. IR-TRH in the hippocampus of El mice, which was significantly lower than in ddY mice, significantly increased after sensitization. During the postictal period, however, it slowly decreased again and then gradually recovered to the preconvulsive level without any change in TRH receptor binding. In the striatum of El mice, although TRH receptor binding was significantly higher than in ddY mice, it was not affected by sensitization. These findings indicate that the hippocampal TRH system may play an inhibitory role in El mouse seizures whereas the striatal TRH system may be important for its seizure susceptibility.",
