     "AB": "Dual-process models of recognition memory in animals propose that recognition memory is supported by two independent processes that reflect the operation of distinct brain structures: a familiarity process that operates independently of the hippocampus and a context-dependent (episodic) memory process that is dependent on the hippocampus. A novel variant of an object recognition procedure was used to examine this proposal. Healthy rats showed a preference for exploring a novel object rather than a familiar object: a familiarity-dependent recognition effect. They also showed a preference for exploring a familiar object that was presented in a different spatiotemporal context rather than a familiar object that was presented either in a different spatial or temporal context: a context-dependent form of recognition that is sensitive to \"what\" object has been presented \"where\" and \"when.\" Rats with excitotoxic hippocampal lesions showed the familiarity-dependent but not the context-dependent form of recognition. The results provide support for dual-process theories of recognition memory.",
