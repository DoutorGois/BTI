     "AB": "We compared the anticonvulsant actions of dynorphin A (1-13), galanin, neuropeptide Y and somatostatin in a model of self-sustaining status epilepticus (SSSE). SSSE was induced in adult Wistar rats by 30 min intermittent perforant path stimulation. Peptides or saline were injected into the hilus of the dentate gyrus 10 min after the end of perforant path stimulation. EEG was analyzed using Harmonie software (Stellate systems). While all neuropeptides showed significant seizure protecting effects, their anticonvulsant profiles followed different patterns: somatostatin and NPY induced strong, but transient suppression of spikes and seizures, while seizure suppression by dynorphin and galanin was more profound and irreversible.",
