     "AB": "Accumulating evidence indicates that cerebral ischemia enhances neurogenesis in the adult brain. The mechanisms responsible for stem-cell development are poorly understood. Recent in vitro studies indicate the involvement of metalloproteinase (MMPs) in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. To elucidate if MMPs participate in neurogenesis-associated processes after ischemic insult, we aimed to establish spatial and temporal relationships between neural stem-cell development and the activity of MMPs in the adult brain hippocampus. Our results show that post ischemic acceleration in the proliferation of progenitors in the dentate gyrus is accompanied by increased activity of MMPs. On the contrary, in the damaged CA1 pyramidal layer the neurogenesis seems to be rather elusive. Simultaneously, the activity of MMPs fell below the control level. In conclusion, our results show that the activation of MMPs may, at least in part, contribute to ischemia-induced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the adult brain.",
