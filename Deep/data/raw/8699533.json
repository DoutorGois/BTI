     "AB": "Activated calpain I immunoreactivity (76 kDa band) was detected in membranes prepared from rat brain hippocampal slices using a polyclonal antiserum raised against an N-terminus peptide of the cleaved subunit of calpain I. While basal levels of activated calpain I were stable over incubation times, 1 nM dopamine (DA) produced an initial 32% increase (5 min) in the 76 kDa protein followed by a 53% decrease in this band at 20 min of incubation. The DA-induced changes in activated calpain I immunoreactivity were blocked by the calpain inhibitor peptide, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal(100 microM) or by EGTA. Basal levels of the 76 kDa band were not affected by the calpain inhibitor. These changes in activated calpain I, elicited by DA, are in accord with the DA-induced decreases in the levels of the calpain substrate, gamma PKC (Yurko-Mauro and Friedman; J Cell Biochem [Abstr] 180:80, 1994; J Neurochem 65: 1622-1630, 1995) and suggest that DA activates this Ca(++)-dependent protease in its regulation of neuronal signal transduction.",
