     "AB": "The developmental profile of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) response to nerve growth factor (NGF) in the rat was determined. NGF induced HPAA activity as assayed by increased serum corticosterone levels in pups that were > or = 15 days of age. Since the development of an HPAA response to NGF is parallel to synaptogenesis in the hippocampus and to the regulation of HPAA function by the hippocampus, these findings support the hypothesis that serum NGF activates the HPAA by acting within the CNS.",
