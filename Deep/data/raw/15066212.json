     "AB": "AIM: To study the pathological characteristics of the mice with estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) disruption in brain. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry method was applied in the study. RESULTS: beta-Amyloid peptide(A beta (42)) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) immunoreactive substances were accumulated notably in cortex and limbic structures such as the hippocampus and amygdala in brain, resembling the pathological changes of human Alzheimer disease(AD). A beta formed cloudy-like deposits in parenchyma of brain, while apoE also deposited along or surrounding the blood vessels. CONCLUSIONS: ER beta is crucial to the development of neural degenerative disease, so modulation of A beta metabolism via ER beta signal pathway might be beneficial for AD prevention or therapy.",
