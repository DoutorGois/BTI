     "AB": "The distribution of delta sleep inducing peptide (DSIP) in the rabbit brain has been studied with immunohistochemical techniques. DSIP-like immunoreactivity was predominantly detected in the basal forebrain, hypothalamus and hypophysis. Even in colchicine-pretreated animals, immunolabeled cell bodies were relatively few. They were mostly scattered through the ventrolateral septum, the diagonal band of Broca and preoptic areas. Clusters of positive cell bodies were also found in the arcuate nucleus and adjacent lateral hypothalamic areas. Large populations of varicose fibers and terminal-like structures were observed in the juxtaventricular zone of the ventrolateral septum, in the preoptic areas and lamina terminalis especially around the preoptic recess of the third ventricle and more caudally, in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. Dense networks of immunolabeled fibers were visualized in the median eminence and pituitary stalk where many fibers could be seen in close apposition to the capillaries. Many DSIP-immunoreactive fibers were observed in the subfornical organ. Other extra-hypothalamic regions displaying a low-to-moderate density of immunoreactive fibers were the indusium griseum, the hippocampus, the fimbria of the fornix, the subcommissural organ, the medial habenula and, occasionally, the medial periaqueductal gray. Most cells of the pars intermedia and a few cells of the pars distalis of the anterior pituitary were DSIP-immunoreactive. Taken together these results in the rabbit brain emphasize the predominant localization of DSIP-like immunoreactivity in areas related to the hypothalamic neurosecretory systems.",
