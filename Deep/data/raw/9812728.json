     "AB": "AIM: To study the toxic effects of norfloxacin (Nor) on EEG and ultrastructure of the brain. METHODS: EEG was recorded in the sensorimotor area of rat cortex after Nor 150 and 300 micrograms.kg-1 were injected into the right ventricle of the brain. RESULTS: Spike waves occurred, first at the ipsilateral side and then bilaterally. The seizure spike appeared at 168 +/- 129, 51 +/- 35 s, and 276 +/- 138, 118 +/- 65 s in the right and left cerebral cortices in 150 and 300 micrograms.kg-1 groups, respectively. The wave forms were variable, the wave amplitude and frequency increased gradually, accompanied with limb twitching. Neuron degeneration was seen in both cerebral hemispheres, hippocampus, and cerebellum 120 min after the i.c.v. of Nor 300 micrograms.kg-1: myeloid degeneration of Golgi complex, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and neuropils; swelling of cytoplasm; dissolution of nuclears and chromatin; necrosis of gliocytes and the appearance of changes in both the light and dark neurons, especially the dark ones. CONCLUSION: Rat brain was widely damaged after the kindling by Nor.",
