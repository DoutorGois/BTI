     "AB": "The c-fos protein is a gene regulatory third messenger involved in long-term responses of cells to various stimuli. It can be used as a marker of neuronal activity. In the present immunohistochemical study the presence of c-fos protein (FP) in the rat brain from 1 h to 14 days after 10 min of cerebral ischemia was compared with that 3 h after an intraventricular injection of kainic acid. The kainic acid injection resulted in staining of dentate hilar cells, granule cells and hippocampal interneurones. The postischemic changes at Day 1 were sporadic CA1 pyramidal cells expressing the FP. At Day 2 FP was expressed with variable intensity in many pyramidal cells in the CA1. At Day 3 many necrotic CA1 pyramidal cells were seen. They did not express the FP, and the expression was less intense and found in fewer cells than at Day 2. At Days 3, 7 and 14 there was increasing gliosis without c-fos expression in the CA1. The study demonstrates a delayed postischemic synthesis of the gene regulatory protein c-fos preceding the necrosis in the selectively vulnerable CA1 region.",
