     "AB": "We generated a transgenic rat strain with a missense mutation in V286L (V286L-TG), in the gene encoding the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor beta2 subunit (CHRNB2) found in patients with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). To confirm that V286L-TG rats exhibit seizures similar to those observed in humans, gene expression patterns and behavioral phenotypes were analyzed. In situ hybridization using a V286L Chrnb2-selective probe indicated that the transgene was expressed at higher levels in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of V286L-TG than wild-type littermates (non-TG). Spontaneous epileptic seizures with ictal discharges in electroencephalograms were detected in 45% of V286L-TG rats and the frequency of seizures was 0.73 times a week. This seizure type is similar to \"paroxysmal arousals\" that are observed in human ADNFLE. V286L-TG rats displayed nicotine-induced abnormal motor activity including seizures in comparison to non-TGs. Response time following nicotine administration occurred faster in V286L-TG than in non-TG rats. V286L-TG rats demonstrated spontaneous epileptic seizures, which are similar to human ADNFLE, and also showed a higher sensitivity to nicotine administration. Thus, the V286L-TG rat model could be a valuable tool for developing novel mechanism-driven treatment strategies for epilepsy and provide a better understanding of ADNFLE.",
