     "AB": "Calcium ion alone or in the presence of added calmodulin stimulated in vitro transfer of 32P from [gamma 32P]ATP into several proteins of mitochondrial and synaptosomal particulate fractions from rat brain. Strontium ion was capable of substituting for calcium ion in this stimulation, but barium ion lacked this capacity. These results bring into question the hypothesis that calcium-dependent protein phosphorylation of synaptic proteins is intrinsic to neurotransmitter release during neurotransmission, but they do not rule out that possibility.",
