     "AB": "Brain ascorbate levels in young adult female rat are lower than those in males. Loss of ascorbate during ischemia is also less in females, suggesting lower oxidative stress. After ovariectomy, however, ischemia-induced loss equals that in males. In the present study, we determined ascorbate levels in maturing male and female rat brain to establish when the gender difference in content arises. We further investigated whether 17beta-estradiol and/or progesterone treatment modulate levels and ischemia-induced loss in ovariectomized females and compared these data with those from normal females in proestrus and estrus. Gender differences in brain ascorbate content were absent before puberty and persisted only in cortex in aging rats. Chronic estradiol treatment, whether alone or in combination with progesterone, prevented an ovariectomy-induced ascorbate increase in hippocampus and caused levels in cortex and cerebellum to fall below those of randomly sampled normal females. These same low levels were found during proestrus and estrus. Estradiol replacement after ovariectomy prevented enhanced ischemia-induced ascorbate loss in hippocampus, but not in cortex or cerebellum. Ischemia-induced losses in proestrus and estrus were similar to those in normal controls. Progesterone had little effect in any region. These data indicate that ascorbate content and redox balance in female brain are influenced postpubertally by estrogens in a region-selective manner.",
