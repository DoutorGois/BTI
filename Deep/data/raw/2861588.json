     "AB": "There seems to be ample evidence supporting the view that glutamate plays a significant role in the mammalian brain as a neurotransmitter. It is considered to be a likely transmitter candidate in one or more hippocampal pathways. Recently it has been visualized in excitatory, possibly glutamatergic, neurons in the hippocampus. Glutamate has been proposed to mediate memory formation. We wanted to see if blocking glutamate action by a specific glutamate antagonist could result in reduction of learning ability. 2-Amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (APB) is an analogue of glutamic acid and has been used as a glutamate antagonist in electrophysiological studies on invertebrate neuromuscular junction, retina and hippocampus. We tested the influence of APB on the acquisition of two way avoidance learning in the shuttle box and on learning in the water maze. Our results show that intraperitoneal injection of APB led to a reduction in avoidance learning, whereas learning in the water maze was unaffected.",
