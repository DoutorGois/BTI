     "AB": "Porcine pancreatic secretory phospholipase A2 (ppsPLA2) has been shown to modulate agonist and antagonist binding to alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors and to effect neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS). To further elucidate the mechanism of action of ppsPLA2 in the CNS, the binding profile of 125I-labelled ppsPLA2 to rat whole-brain membranes was assessed. Two classes of calcium-dependent binding sites were detected using unlabelled ppsPLA2 as a displacer with IC50 values of 3 and 217 nM. Similar values were obtained for [125I]ppsPLA2 binding to membranes prepared from isolated cortical and hippocampal rat brain regions. [125I]ppsPLA2 binding displayed bell-shaped concentration-dependence curves to Ca2+, Zn2 + and pH. Binding was not inhibited by AMPA, the false substrate, oleoyloxyethyl phosphocholine (OOPC), or by BSA-galactose or wheat germ agglutinin. [125I]ppsPLA2 binding was reduced by treatment of the rat brain membranes with mercaptoethanol and proteinase K treatment or by their pre-incubation at 95 degrees C. These results show a different binding profile to the previously characterised snake venom sPLA2 N-type receptors and suggest the existence of novel class of sPLA2 N-type binding sites.",
