     "AB": "A single injection of hypertonic saline produced brain lesions with corresponding nervous signs in mice. The lesions were most often found in the hippocampus and were characterized by degeneration and loss of pyramidal cells. They could be induced effectively by a single administration of 20 ml of 25% saline/kg orally or of 30 ml of 8.5% saline/kg intraperitoneally. This simple experimental system seems to be a useful model of central nervous system involvement.",
