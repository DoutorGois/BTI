     "AB": "Chemokines and their receptors are well described in the immune system, where they promote cell migration and activation. In the central nervous system, chemokine has been implicated in neuroinflammatory processes. However, an increasing number of evidence suggests that they have regulatory functions in the normal nervous system, where they could participate in cell communication. In this work, using a semiquantitative immunohistochemistry approach, we provide the first neuroanatomical mapping of constitutive neuronal CCR2 localization. Neuronal expression of CCR2 was observed in the anterior olfactory nucleus, cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, caudate putamen, globus pallidus, supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, amygdala, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and in the brainstem and cerebellum. These data are largely in accordance with results obtained using quantitative autoradiography with [(125)I]MCP-1/CCL2 and RT-PCR CCR2 mRNA analysis. Furthermore, using dual fluorescent immunohistochemistry we studied the chemical phenotype of labeled neurons and demonstrated the coexistence of CCR2 with classical neurotransmitters. Indeed, localization of CCR2 immunostaining is observed in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and in the ventral tegmental area as well as in cholinergic neurons in the substantia innominata and caudate putamen. Finally, we show that the preferential CCR2 ligand, MCP-1/CCL2, elicits Ca(2+) transients in primary cultured neurons from various rat brain regions including the cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and mesencephalon. In conclusion, the constitutive neuronal CCR2 expression in selective brain structures suggests that this receptor could be involved in neuronal communication and possibly associated with cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and related disorders.",
