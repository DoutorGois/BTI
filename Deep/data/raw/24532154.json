     "AB": "It's known that neurons in mammalian hibernators are more tolerant to hypoxia than those in non-hibernating species and as a consequence animals are capable of awakening from the arousal state without exhibiting cerebral damages. In addition, evidences have suggested that euthermic hamster neurons display protective adaptations against hypoxia, while those of rats are not capable, even though molecular mechanisms involved in similar neuroprotective strategies have not been yet fully studied. In the present work, overstimulation of glutamatergic receptors NMDA recognized as one of the major death-promoting element in hypoxia, accounted for altered network complexity consistent with a moderate reduction of hippocampal neuronal survival (p < 0.05) in hamsters. These alterations appeared to be featured concomitantly with altered glutamatergic signaling as indicated by significant down-regulation (p < 0.01) of NMDAergic (NR2A) and AMPAergic (GluR1, R2) receptor subtypes together with the metabotropic mGluR5 subtype. Diminished mRNA levels were also reported for NMDA receptor binding factors and namely PSD95 plus DREAM, which exert positive and negative regulatory properties, respectively, on receptor trafficking events. Conversely, involvement of glutamatergic signaling systems on neuronal excitotoxicity was strengthened by the co-activation of GABAAR-mediated effects as indicated by toxic morphological effects being notably reduced along with up-regulated GluR1, GluR2, mGluR5, DREAM, and Homer1c scaffold proteins when muscimol was added. Overall, these results point to a neuroprotective role of the GABAergic system against excitotoxicity episodes via DREAM-dependent inhibition of NMDA receptor and activation of AMPA receptor plus mGluR5, respectively, thus proposing them as novel therapeutic targets against cerebral ischemic damages in humans.",
