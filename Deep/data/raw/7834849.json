     "AB": "5-HT and muscarine (M) receptors total binding capacities (Rt) in different brain areas and spleen were determined using receptor radioligand binding assay (RLBA) after needling zusanli of rats. And the rats without needling and needling Taichong point were used as control. These results showed that 5-HT and M receptors Rt were decreased obviously than control group in rat's cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, spinal cord and spleen when needling zusanli can produce obvious acupuncture analgesia. 5-HT Rt in brain stem and medulla oblongata was obviously decreased and not changed in thalamus. M receptor Rt value was not changed clearly in brain stem and medulla oblongata as well, but it was obviously decreased in thalamus. These results showed that effects of acupoints on Various meridians are different, thus the results of acupuncture at Zusanli are distinct from taichong.",
