     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regional cerebral perfusion in patients with idiopathic REM behavior disorder (RBD) in order to establish the topography of networks involved. METHODS: We performed cerebral blood flow evaluation using (99m)Tc-Ethylene Cysteinate Dimer (ECD) SPECT on eight patients with polysomnographically confirmed RBD and nine age-matched controls. Comparisons were made using SPM2. RESULTS: We found increased perfusion in the pons and putamen bilaterally and in the right hippocampus. In addition, we observed a decreased perfusion in frontal (Brodmann area [BA] 4, 6, 10, 43, 44, 47 bilaterally and left BA 9, 46) and temporo-parietal (BA 13, 22, 43 bilaterally and left BA 7, 19, 20, 21, 39, 40, 41, 42) cortices. CONCLUSION: Perfusional abnormalities in patients with REM behavior disorder were located in the brainstem, striatum, and cortex. These abnormalities are consistent with the anatomic metabolic profile of Parkinson disease.",
