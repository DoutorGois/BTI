     "AB": "Effects of continuous oral administration of Buflomedil on acetylcholine (ACh) and neuroactive amino acids contents and energy metabolism in the brain were investigated using Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). In both WKY and SHR, continuous oral administration of Buflomedil (30 mg/kg x 7 days) had no effect on ACh content in all cerebral areas examined. On the other hand, continuous oral administration of Buflomedil to SHR induced a significant increase in the contents of glutamic acid and taurine in the striatum and hypothalamus, while it resulted in a significant decrease in the contents of glycine and taurine in the midbrain and hippocampus. Glucose and ATP contents in the striatum of SHR showed a significant increase following the continuous oral administration of Buflomedil. These results suggest that Buflomedil may be a drug capable of improving various neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with cerebrovascular insufficiency by modifying the content of neuroactive amino acids and accelerating energy metabolism in the brain.",
