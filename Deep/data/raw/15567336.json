     "AB": "We have investigated the metabolism of extracellular adenine nucleotides and adenosine in porcine brain. The cortex synaptic plasma membranes hydrolyzed ATP to ADP, AMP and adenosine. We also observed a slow hydrolysis of adenosine with the concomitant accumulation of inosine. These results indicate that NTPDase1, NTPDase2, ecto-5'-nucleotidase, and adenosine deaminase are present in cortex synaptic membranes from porcine brain. We further showed that all these enzymes are also abundant in synaptic membranes from hippocampus, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata and compared their specific activities. Brain cortex and hippocampus exhibited higher activities of NTPDase1 and NTPDase2 than cerebellum and medulla oblongata. It was consistent with the high level of the expression of NTPDases in the two first structures. Adenosine deaminase activity was found in all brain structures analyzed; however, it was lower than the activity of ecto-nucleotidases. Taken together, our data suggest that investigated enzymes have a ubiquitous abundance in porcine brain, and observed differences in their activities in cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata may correlate with the pattern of P2 receptor expression in these brain areas. In addition, low activity of adenosine deaminase may indicate that nonenzymatic mechanism(s) are responsible for the termination of P1 receptor signaling in porcine brain.",
