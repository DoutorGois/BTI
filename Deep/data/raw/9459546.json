     "AB": "In this study, we observed the changes of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-immunoreactivity (ir) and cell death in the rat hippocampal granule cell layer at various periods after adrenalectomy (ADX). Our results revealed that all of the rats shortly after ADX showed a rapid loss of GR-ir and subsequent appearance of degenerating cells in the granule cell layer. One month after ADX, however, about 80% of the rats displayed a restoration of GR-ir and the absence of degenerating cells in the granule cell layer, and this phenomenon was successively noted for 6 months. Hippocampal structural destruction 3 and 6 months after ADX was found in about 20% of the rats with loss of GR-ir in the granule cell layer; the ADX rats with even weak GR-ir in this area had a normal hippocampus. The treatment of rats with synthetic GR agonist, dexamethasone, immediately after ADX prevented the loss of GR-ir and significantly reduced the number of degenerating cells in the granule cell layer. Our results clarified that granule cell death after ADX was necessarily accompanied by the disappearance of GR-ir in the granule cell layer, suggesting that ADX-induced granule cell death is predicated on the loss of GR-ir and that the presence of GR-ir in this area may be important for granule cell survival.",
