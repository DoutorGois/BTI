     "AB": "New agonists and antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors were found among the derivatives of 1- or 2-alkyl-substituted imidazole-4,5- and pyrazole-3,4-dicarboxylic acids. Lipophilic surrounding of the nitrogen atom in these compounds was found to determine their ability to be either agonists or antagonists, while the distance between the terminal acidic functions was the same. An increase in the lipophilicity can also cause loss of selective action upon the NMDA receptors and occurrence of non- NMDA antagonistic activity.",
