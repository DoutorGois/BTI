     "AB": "Transient global ischemia reportedly results in glutamate receptor stimulation and harmful Ca(2+)-overloading, then activates some proteins involved in cell apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, but underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here we evaluated the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (L-VGCC) antagonist in mediating the release of cytochrome c and the expression of caspase-3 precursor protein (procaspase-3). Cytochrome c release from mitochondria is a critical step in the cell apoptotic process. We examined whether cytochrome c was translocated from mitochondria to the cytosol by Western blot in rat hippocampus after 15 min global ischemia. Released cytochrome c interacts with apoptotic protease activating factor-1 and caspase-9, both of which play important roles in the cytochrome c-dependent mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by activating caspase-3. Our studies demonstrated that the inactive precursor and active cleaved subunits of caspase-3 protease increased dramatically with the extent of reperfusion time. Following pretreatment with ketamine (a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist) and nifedipine (L-VGCC antagonist), cytosolic cytochrome c and the expression of procaspase-3 dramatically decreased, which might result in less neuron damage after ischemia.",
