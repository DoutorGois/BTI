     "AB": "The significant regional variation in brain superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was similar in mice from both warm and cool cohorts. Mice in the cool cohort generally had higher SOD activity, which varied significantly with body temperature in striatum and in preoptic area of the hypothalamus. Changes in SOD activity following heating were revealed only when warm and cool cohorts were analysed separately. SOD activity decreased significantly in striatum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus of the cool cohort only. The decline was to levels consistent with those of the warm cohort. Body temperature of cool mice increased more than that of warm mice following each increment of heating so resultant body temperatures became similar. The role of SOD as part of a differential defense against heat stress in warm and cool mice is presented.",
