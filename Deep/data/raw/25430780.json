     "AB": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been shown to be associated with pro-inflammatory markers, including elevated plasma levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). However, the precise role of neuroinflammation and central immune signaling on the development of this debilitating psychological disorder is not known. Here, we used stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL), an animal model of the disorder, to examine the role of central IL-1beta in PTSD. The results show that the severe stressor in SEFL induces a time-dependent increase in IL-1beta immunoreactivity and mRNA expression within the dentate gyrus of the dorsal hippocampus (DH). There was no increase in IL-1beta in the basolateral amygdala or the perirhinal cortex. Moreover, blocking the action of IL-1beta following the severe stressor with IL-1 receptor antagonist (10 mug, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.), 24 and 48 h after the stressor) prevented the development of SEFL. To provide further support for the role of IL-1beta in the development of SEFL, we show that systemic morphine, a treatment which is known to reduce both PTSD and SEFL, also reduces IL-1beta expression in the DH induced by the severe stressor. These studies provide the first evidence that IL-1 is involved SEFL and suggest that IL-1 signaling in the brain may have a critical role in the development of PTSD.",
