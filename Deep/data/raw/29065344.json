     "AB": "MR imaging studies in paediatric bipolar disorder have particularly focused on the amygdala and hippocampus, subcortical structures, and to a lesser extent on the thalamus. The purpose of this study was to perform structural analysis of the regions of interest (ROI) associated with mood regulation. In this study 18 children (between the ages of 12-18) were matched according to their age and sex and were divided into three groups. These were: a paediatric bipolar disorder group, risk group and a healthy control group. The structured diagnostic interviews were performed with children and their parents. T1 weighted MR images in the sagittal plane with a thickness of 1mm were taken from the subjects. Automatic structural brain analysis was performed, and the volume and volume fraction (VF) of the ROIs were obtained. Brain size in the patients with paediatric bipolar disorder (742.4 +/- 110.1cm(3)) was significantly smaller than the healthy control group (880.7 +/- 73.8cm(3)) (p</=0.05). MRI analysis between the paediatric bipolar disorder, risk group and healthy control group revealed no difference between them in terms of amygdala, thalamus or hippocampal volumes. In this study, there was no difference between the volumes of amygdala, thalamus or hippocampus.",
