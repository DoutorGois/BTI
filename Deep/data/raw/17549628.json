     "AB": "Status epilepticus (SE) is associated with a significant risk of cognitive impairment, and the increase of nitric oxide (NO) releasing has been reported during SE. We investigated the effects of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, aminoguanidine (AG), on spatial performance of rats in the Morris water maze. Treatment with 7-NI, but not with AG, improved the performance of rats after SE not only in acquisition of the task but also in probe test. Furthermore, the level of SE-induced malondialdehyde (MDA), end product of lipid peroxidation, was significantly decreased only in animals receiving 7-NI injection. Taken together, the results of the present study provided evidence that the NO pathway contributed to oxidative stress after SE, and nNOS/NO pathway may underlie one of the potential mechanisms contributing to SE-induced spatial memory deficits.",
