     "AB": "The environmental context in which abused drugs are taken contribute to the drug experience and is a powerful and persistent stimulus to elicit memories of that experience even in the abstinent addict. Using amphetamine (AMPH) as the unconditioned stimulus, the present study compared two popular context-dependent paradigms in rats, conditioned motor sensitization (CMS) and conditioned place preference (CPP), to ascertain whether particular brain regions were differentially involved. The neuronal substrates underlying these context-dependent behaviors are poorly understood, but regulators of the neuronal plasticity that accompany learning, such as neurotrophic factors and their cognate tyrosine kinase receptors (e.g., TrkB), are credible candidates. We found a significant elevation of TrkB-like immunoreactivity specifically in CA3/dentate gyrus (DG) subregions of the hippocampus after AMPH (0.3 mg/kg)-induced CPP, but not in the delayed-paired (control) AMPH condition. A higher AMPH dose (1.0 mg/kg) induced both CPP and CMS and elevated TrkB in the CA3/DG as well as in the nucleus accumbens shell. The development of both conditioned behaviors was blocked by intra-CA3/DG infusion of the Trk inhibitor K-252a. These findings reveal that CPP and CMS are induced by different doses of AMPH and are associated with TrkB changes in particular brain regions. Moreover, Trk receptors in the hippocampus are critical mediators of the neuronal changes necessary for inducing both forms of conditioning. Thus, although these two conditioning models are distinct, because they are commonly regulated by the hippocampal Trk system, these receptors may be a therapeutic target for attenuating the significance of contextual cues that otherwise strengthen the addictive properties of abused drugs.",
