     "AB": "Hyperammonemia found in congenital disorders has a toxic effect on the central nervous system. Disturbances of brain neurotransmitter metabolism have been proposed, such as an increased transport of tryptophan into the brain and an increased flux through the serotonin pathway. Results concerning the catecholamine pathway are, however, contradictory. We therefore studied whether hyperammonermia increases brain uptake of the neurotransmitter precursor amino acid tyrosine and whether these changes affect the concentration of neurotransmitters and their metabolites in different brain areas (frontal cortex, caudatus-putamen, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus/substantia nigra, brainstem) of rats made hyperammonemic with urease. The brain uptake of tyrosine was measured in the forebrain, brainstem, and cerebellum. The brain areas were analyzed for dopamine, 3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid; homovanillic acid, norepinephrine, and vanillylmandelic acid. The brain uptake index of tyrosine was increased in the forebrain and brainstem of the hyperammonemic rats with concomitantly elevated concentrations in the forebrain of tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan. The homovanillic acid content was significantly increased in the hypothalamus, hippocampus/substantia nigra and brainstem. The concentrations of norepinephrine, dopamine, and 3, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid were not significantly changed. Vanillylmandellic acid was decreased in the caudatus-putamen, thalamus, and hypothalamus. The data indicate an undisturbed neurotransmitter synthesis and, taken with the augmented tyrosine uptake at the blood-brain barrier, an increased flux through the dopamine pathway. These changes observed in the hyperammonemic animal model could contribute to the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and offer an explanation for the neuropsychiatric disturbances observed in children with congenital hyperammonemia.",
