     "AB": "The long-standing question concerning the direct actions of glutamate on the membrane potential of astroglial cells in the central nervous system was addressed using the in vitro kainic acid-lesioned hippocampal slice preparation and primary cell co-cultures of astrocytes and microglia derived from such lesions. The ultrastructure of the lesioned hippocampus was examined to aid in the identification of the cells appearing in culture. In culture, microglia appeared as flat cells, less than 1 micron in thickness at the edge of the cell, but thicker (about 5 microns) near the nucleus. The cytoplasm was packed with granular inclusions. Microglia appeared in two morphological forms, amoeboid and ramified. The amoeboid form was characterized by a cell body with a single process, and was always observed 1 day after starting the cell culture. Such cells became less frequent after 1 week in culture. The ramified form appeared as a rounded cell, devoid of processes, and were frequently observed in older cultures (greater than 1 week). Microglia did not round up after exposure to dibutyrylcyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and did not stain for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). An ultrastructural examination of the lesion demonstrated that microglia were present and that they contained many cytoplasmic granules similar to lipofuscin-containing granules. No filaments were observed in the cytoplasm of microglia. By contrast, the cytoplasm of astrocytes in culture had far fewer granules, rounded up to dibutyryl-cAMP, exhibited multiple processes, and stained for GFAP. In slices, astrocytes had no lipofuscin-containing granules, but numerous cytoplasmic filaments were present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
