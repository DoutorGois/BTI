     "AB": "Drosophila Flamingo (Fmi) is an evolutionally conserved seven-pass transmembrane receptor of the cadherin superfamily. Fmi plays multiple roles in patterning neuronal processes and epithelial planar cell polarity. To explore the in vivo roles of Fmi homologs in mammals, we previously cloned one of the mouse homologs, mouse flamingo1/Celsr2. Here, we report the results of our study of its embryonic and postnatal expression patterns together with those of two other paralogs, Celsr1 and Celsr3. Celsr1-3 expression was initiated broadly in the nervous system at early developmental stages, and each paralog showed characteristic expression patterns in the developing CNS. These genes were also expressed in several other organs, including the cochlea, where hair cells develop planar polarity, the kidney, and the whisker. The Celsr2 protein was distributed at intercellular boundaries in the whisker and on processes of neuronal cells such as hippocampal pyramidal cells, Purkinje cells, and olfactory neurons. Celsr2 is mapped to a distal region of the mouse chromosome 3. We discussed possible functions of seven-pass transmembrane cadherins in mouse development.",
