     "AB": "Magel2 belongs to the MAGE/necdin family of proteins, which have roles in cell cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis. The Magel2 gene is expressed in various brain regions, most notably the hypothalamus. Mice with a targeted deletion of Magel2 display hypoactivity, blunted circadian rhythm, decreased fertility, and increased adiposity. The human ortholog, MAGEL2, is one of a set of paternally expressed, imprinted genes inactivated in most cases of Prader-Willi syndrome, a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. To explore the role of Magel2, brain morphology, brain neurochemistry, and behavior were measured in Magel2-null mice. Brain volume was reduced in specific regions, particularly in the parieto-temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex, the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the nucleus accumbens, as measured by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging. Abnormal neurochemistry was detected in brain samples from adult mice, consisting of decreased serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the cortex and the hypothalamus, and decreased dopamine in the hypothalamus. Magel2-null mice displayed relatively normal motor and learning abilities, but exhibited abnormal behavior in novel environments. This study lends support to the important role of the circadian rhythm output gene Magel2 in brain structure and behavior.",
