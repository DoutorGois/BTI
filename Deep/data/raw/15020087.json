     "AB": "This paper describes a portable recording system and methods for obtaining chronic recordings of single units and tracking rhesus monkey behavior in an open field. The integrated system consists of four major components: (1) microelectrode assembly; (2) head-stage; (3) recording station; and (4) data storage station, the first three of which are carried by the monkey and weigh 800 g. Our system provides synchronized video and electrophysiological signals, which are transmitted by a wireless system to a distance of 50 m. Its major advantages are that neuronal recordings are made in freely moving monkeys, and well-separated action potentials with amplitude five times higher than the background noise are usually recorded and readily kept for many hours. Using this system, we were able to study \"place cells\" in non-human primate brains. The described methods provide a new way to examine correlations between single neuron activity and primate behaviors, and can also be used to study the cellular basis of social behaviors in non-human primates.",
