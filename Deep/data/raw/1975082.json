     "AB": "The effects of various subtype-selective opioid agonists and antagonists on the phosphoinositide (PI) turnover response were investigated in the rat brain. The kappa-agonists U-50,488H and ketocyclazocine produced a concentration-dependent increase in the accumulation of IP's in hippocampal slices. The other kappa-agonists Dynorphin-A (1-13) amide, and its protected analog D[Ala]2-dynorphin-A (1-13) amide also produced a significant increase in the formation of [3H]-IP's, whereas the mu-selective agonists [D-Ala2-N-Me-Phe4-Gly5-ol]-enkephalin and morphine and the delta-selective agonist [D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin were ineffective. The increase in IP's formation elicited by U-50,488H was partially antagonized by naloxone and more completely antagonized by the kappa-selective antagonists nor-binaltorphimine and MR 2266. The formation of IP's induced by U-50,488H varies with the regions of the brain used, being highest in hippocampus and amygdala, and lowest in striatum and pons-medulla. The results indicate that brain kappa- but neither mu- nor delta-receptors are coupled to the PI turnover response.",
