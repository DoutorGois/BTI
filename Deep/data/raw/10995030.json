     "AB": "The effect of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on cholinesterases activities was studied in the retina and, for comparison, in other nervous and nonnervous tissues. Streptozotocin diabetes did not affect acetylcholinesterase activity in the retina but increased its activity in the cerebral cortex (100%) and in serum (55%), and decreased it by 30-40% in erythrocytes. The butyrylcholinesterase activity was decreased by 30-50% in retina and hippocampus and to a lesser extent in retinal pigment epithelium from rats treated with streptozotocin for one week. Changes observed in cholinesterase activities were not correlated with the fasting blood glucose concentration. The results suggest that diabetes might influence a specific subset of cells and isoforms of cholinesterases. This, in turn, could lead to alterations associated with diabetes complications.",
