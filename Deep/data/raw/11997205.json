     "AB": "Until recently, it was believed that adult brains were unable to generate any new neurons. However, it is now commonly known that stem cells remain in the adult central nervous system and that adult vertebrates as well as adult invertebrates are currently adding new neurons in some specialized structures of their central nervous system. In vertebrates, the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus are the sites of neuronal precursor proliferation. In some insects, persistent neurogenesis occurs in the mushroom bodies, which are brain structures involved in learning and memory and considered as functional analogues of the hippocampus. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, secondary neurogenesis (including neuroblast proliferation and neuron differentiation) appears to be regulated by hormones, transmitters, growth factors and environmental cues. The functional implications of adult neurogenesis have not yet been clearly demonstrated and comparative study of the various model systems could contribute to better understand this phenomenon. Here, we review and discuss the common characteristics of adult neurogenesis in the various animal models studied so far.",
