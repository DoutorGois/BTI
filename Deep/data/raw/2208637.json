     "AB": "The depressant effect of adenosine (Ad) was studied electrophysiologically in hippocampal slices from 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 30- and 120-day-old rats. Ad (10 microM) depressed the field EPSP in CA1 to the same extent in all age groups. Caffeine (Caf), an Ad receptor antagonist, enhanced and nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBI), an Ad uptake blocker, depressed the field EPSP. Both these effects were, however, less prominent in slices from younger animals, a finding consistent with lower extracellular levels of endogenous Ad in neonatal rats.",
