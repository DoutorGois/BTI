     "AB": "Selective M1 cholinergic agonists may be useful in treating dementias due to cholinergic hypofunction. SR 95639 has recently been described as such a compound. We found the compound to have affinity for M1 sites (Ki = 2.1 microM) which was approximately 3-fold higher than its affinity for M2 sites. Functional partial agonism was suggested by an inconsistent increase in phosphoinositide (PI) turnover in rat hippocampal slices, combined with blockade of carbachol-stimulated PI turnover. In vivo M2-mediated effects were absent. Scopolamine-induced hyperactivity was attenuated by SR 95639 and scopolamine-impaired inhibitory avoidance and radial maze performance were improved. The compound appears to be a weakly selective M1 partial agonist with potential advantages over existing compounds.",
