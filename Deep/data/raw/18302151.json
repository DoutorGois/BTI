     "AB": "Attractin/Mahogany protein (Atrn) is known to be involved in a number of physiological and neuropathological events. Although the ubiquitous distribution of atrn mRNA has been described in neurons, lack of detailed information concerning the cellular and subcellular localization of protein product is impeding understanding of the role of Atrn. The present study immunohistochemically examined distributions of Atrn in rat and mouse central nervous systems (CNSs) by using a novel antibody for Atrn. Atrn was intensely expressed in most neurons and dendrites of large neurons, such as cortical pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Intense Atrn expression was also observed in the neuropil of gray matter in many regions of the CNS, such as the main and accessory olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, medial eminence, superior colliculus, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and layers 1 and 2 of the spinal cord. Furthermore, we found that astrocytes, microglia, and ependymal cells also express Atrn protein. Immunoelectron microscopy showed the subcellular distribution of Atrn in the plasma membrane of cell soma, dendrites, and spines in neurons and in the cytoplasmic membrane of Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria in neurons and glial cells. These findings indicate that Atrn is more widely expressed throughout the CNS than previously reported, and expression of Atrn by various cell types suggests that Atrn may serve multiple functions in the CNS.",
