     "AB": "Entorhinal and commissural/associational projections show a non-overlapping distribution in the hippocampus proper and the dentate gyrus. The expression of Ephrins and their Eph receptors in the developing hippocampus indicates that this family of axonal guidance molecules may modulate the formation of these connections. Here we focused on the role of the ephrin-A5 ligand in the development of the main hippocampal afferents. In situ hybridization showed that ephrin-A5 mRNA was detected mainly in the principal cells of the hippocampus proper and in the dentate gyrus throughout postnatal development. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed prominent expression of the EphA3 receptor, a putative receptor for ephrin-A5, in the main cells and the neuropil of the developing hippocampus. Tracing experiments in ephrin-A5(-/-) mice showed that commissural projections were transiently altered in the hippocampus proper at P5, but they were mistargeted throughout the postnatal development in the dentate gyrus. Immunocytochemistry with anti-calbindin antibodies revealed that the dentate mossy fiber projection was not altered in ephrin-A5(-/-) mice. Electron microscopy studies showed alterations in the density of synapses and spines in commissural/associational layers, but not in entorhinal layers, and in the mossy fibers in these animals. Taken together, these findings indicate that ephrin-A5 signaling is involved in the formation and maturation of synapses in the hippocampus.",
