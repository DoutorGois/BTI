     "AB": "Increasing data suggest that impairments of cellular plasticity/resilience underlie the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. A series of microarray studies with validating criteria have recently revealed a common, novel target for the long-term actions of the structurally highly dissimilar mood stabilizers lithium and valproate: BAG-1 [BCL-2 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2)-associated athanogene]. Because BAG-1 attenuates glucocorticoid receptor (GR) nuclear translocation, activates ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinases, and potentiates anti-apoptotic functions of BCL-2, extensive additional studies were undertaken. Chronic administration of both agents at therapeutic doses increased the expression of BAG-1 in rat hippocampus. Furthermore, these findings were validated at the protein level, and the effects were seen in a time frame consistent with therapeutic effects and were specific for mood stabilizers. Functional studies showed that either lithium or valproate, at therapeutically relevant levels, inhibited dexamethasone-induced GR nuclear translocation and inhibited GR transcriptional activity. Furthermore, small interfering RNA studies showed that these inhibitory effects on GR activity were mediated, at least in part, through BAG-1. The observation that BAG-1 inhibits glucocorticoid activation suggests that mood stabilizers may counteract the deleterious effects of hypercortisolemia seen in bipolar disorder by upregulating BAG-1. Additionally, these studies suggest that regulation of GR-mediated plasticity may play a role in the treatment of bipolar disorder and raise the possibility that agents affecting BAG-1 more directly may represent novel therapies for this devastating illness.",
