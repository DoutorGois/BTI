Results were consistent with the presence of a single recognition site in cerebellum and two sites in hippocampys, but the affinity of neither of the hippocampal sites correlated with that in the cerebellum. Muscimol did not alter the affinity or capacity of any of these sites under the conditions used, indicating that PCC does not show the benzodiazepine-like property of GABAergic modulation, at any of the subpopulations of its binding sites.",
