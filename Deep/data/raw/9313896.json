     "AB": "Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are central to the development of normal neuronal cytoarchitecture and have been suggested in previous studies to be altered in schizophrenia. We investigated hippocampal phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated MAP2 expression in schizophrenia in relation to neuronal orientation and interneuronal distance. One paraffin embedded mid-hippocampal block was obtained from each of 8 schizophrenic and 11 control postmortem brains and immunohistochemistry for the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of MAP2 performed. Within the corona ammonis (CA) subregions and the subiculum, we assessed densitometry readings for non-phosphorylated MAP2-positive neurones (MAP2-NP), and counted the number of neurones immunopositive for phosphorylated MAP2 (MAP2-P). Using image analysis computer software we measured interneuronal distances and neuronal orientation. While there were no overall alterations in densitometric density of MAP2-NP neurones in any hippocampal subregions, we found a left-sided increase in densitometric density of MAP2-NP neurones within the subiculum (F = 8.740, P < 0.021), and the CA1 (F = 7.044, P < 0.033) of schizophrenic subjects which were unrelated to age, postmortem interval or neuroleptic exposure. There was no accompanying alteration of interneuronal distances, neuronal orientation. The findings support previous work demonstrating altered subicular MAP2 expression in schizophrenia and indicate that the finding may be lateralised. However, in contrast to previous investigations, we have demonstrated this alteration in MAP2 expression is due to an increase in the non-phosphorylated form of MAP2, rather than a decrease in total MAP2 expression. These findings suggest that cytoskeletal assembly is abnormal in schizophrenia and generate testable hypotheses regarding the developmental basis of the disorder.",
