     "AB": "Concentrations of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) are elevated in the basal ganglia in Huntington's disease. The present study confirms these findings and, in addition, shows that concentrations of SLI are significantly elevated in the nucleus accumbens (4.04 +/- 0.66 versus 1.69 +/- 0.21 ng/mg protein in controls). This area is relatively spared pathologically and shows little atrophy in Huntington's disease. Since many patients with Huntington's disease are treated with haloperidol, we studied the effects of this drug in rats. There was a dose-dependent reduction of SLI in striatum, parietal cortex, and hippocampus. The elevated concentrations of SLI in the basal ganglia in Huntington's disease, therefore, do not appear to result from haloperidol therapy.",
