     "AB": "The magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP) was re-examined for monosynaptic transmission between mossy fibers and CA3 neurons in thin sections of the hippocampus of the guinea pig. Although an initial negative deflection in the field potential showed apparent short-term potentiation, this deflection was concluded to reflect non-synaptic activation of CA3 neurons. Accordingly, the magnitude of LTP of monosynaptic transmission was re-calculated at 3.4 +/- 0.9.",
