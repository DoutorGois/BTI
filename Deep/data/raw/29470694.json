     "AB": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is present in 30% of epileptic patients and does not respond to conventional treatments. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) induce endogenous neural stem cells, inhibit neurodegeneration, and promote brain self-repair mechanisms. The present study addresses the feasibility of BMSCs transplantation against pilocarpine-induced TLE experimentally. BMSCs were injected either intravenously (IV) or in hippocampus bilaterally (IC). Increased cell count of BMSCs was achieved via IC route. BMSCs treatment ameliorated the pilocarpine-induced neurochemical and histological changes, retained amino acid neurotransmitters to the normal level, downregulated the immunoreactivity to insulin growth factor-1 receptor, synaptophysin, and caspase-3 and reduced oxidative insult and inflammatory markers detected in epileptic model. It is worth noting that BMSCs IC-administered showed more pronounced effects than those administered via IV route. BMSCs transplantation presents a promise for TLE treatment that has to be elucidated clinically.",
