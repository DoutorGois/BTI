     "AB": "Nitric oxide (NO) has frequently been associated with secondary damage after brain injury. However, average NO levels in different brain regions before and after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its role in post-TBI mitochondrial dysfunction remain unclear. In this comprehensive profiling study, we demonstrate for the first time that basal NO levels vary significantly in the healthy cortex (0.44 +/- 0.04 muM), hippocampus (0.26 +/- 0.03 muM), and cerebellum (1.24 +/- 0.08 muM). Within 4 h of severe lateral fluid percussion injury, NO levels almost doubled in these regions, thereby preserving regional differences in NO levels. TBI-induced NO generation was associated with inducible NO synthase (iNOS) increase in ipsilateral but not in contralateral regions. The transient NO increase resulted in a persistent tyrosine nitration adjacent to the injury site. Nitrosative stress-associated cell loss via apoptosis and receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)-mediated necrosis were also observed in the ipsilateral cortex, despite high levels of NO in the contralateral cortex. NO-mediated impairment of mitochondrial state 3 respiration dependent on complex I substrates was transient and confined to the ipsilateral cortex. Our results demonstrate that NO dynamics and associated effects differ in various regions of the injured brain. A potential association between the observed mitochondrial electron flow through complex I, but not complex II, and the modulation of TBI induced NO levels in different brain regions has to be prospectively analyzed in more detail.",
