     "AB": "This data article contains supporting information regarding the research article entitled \"Traumatic brain injury accelerates amyloid-beta deposition and impairs spatial learning in the triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimers disease\" (H. Shishido, Y. Kishimoto, N. Kawai, Y. Toyota, M. Ueno, T. Kubota, Y. Kirino, T. Tamiya, 2016) [1]. Triple-transgenic (3xTg)-Alzheimers disease (AD) model mice exhibited significantly poorer spatial learning than sham-treated 3xTg-AD mice 28 days after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Correspondingly, amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition within the hippocampus was significantly greater in 3xTg-AD mice 28 days after TBI. However, data regarding the short-term and long-term influences of TBI on amyloid precursor protein (APP) accumulation in AD model mice remain limited. Furthermore, there is little data showing whether physical activity and motor learning are affected by TBI in AD model mice. Here, we provide immunocytochemistry data confirming that TBI induces significant increases in APP accumulation in 3xTg-AD mice at both 7 days and 28 days after TBI. Furthermore, 3xTg-AD model mice exhibit a reduced ability to acquire conditioned responses (CRs) during delay eyeblink conditioning compared to sham-treated 3xTg-AD model mice 28 days after TBI. However, physical activity and motor performance are not significantly changed in TBI-treated 3xTg-AD model mice.",
