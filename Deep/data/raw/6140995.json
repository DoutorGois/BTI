     "AB": "Concentrations of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SRIF-LI) were measured in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, septum-POA, median eminence, gastric antrum, fundus and pancreas in adult female hamsters to determine whether changes in somatostatin could be related to increased growth hormone (GH) secretion and somatic growth that follow bilateral transections of hippocampus (n = 18; 17 controls). In addition, choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was measured in the four brain regions in hippocampectomized (n = 10) and control hamsters (n = 10) to gain insight into the relationship between these two neurotransmitters. Hippocampal transections induced: significant acceleration of somatic growth; increased serum GH concentrations; increased concentrations of SRIF-LI in septum-POA and gastric antrum; reduced concentrations of SRIF-LI in hippocampus and pancreas; and reduced CAT activity in the hippocampus. These results suggest that somatostatinergic and cholinergic projections to hippocampus via fornix suppress GH and somatic growth in adult hamsters and that reduced release of SRIF-LI in the gastric antrum may contribute to the acceleration of somatic growth through facilitated nutrient digestion and entry.",
