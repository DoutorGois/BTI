In all regions of the dentate gyrus granule, the amplitude of the population spike recorded from the dentate granule cell layers, in response to electrical stimulation of the perforant path, decreased during hypoxia and recovered during reoxygenation. However, the ventral dentate gyrus granule cells (upper blade) were more susceptible to hypoxia than the dorsal ones (lower blade), indicating regional differences of neuronal susceptibility to hypoxia in the dentate gyrus.",
