     "AB": "It has been reported that electrolytic lesions of the hippocampus accelerate the onset of schedule-induced drinking (SID) and also lead to significant increases in adrenal weights [2]. In the present experiment three groups of Long Evans rats received electrolytic or 6-Hydroxydopamine or sham lesions of the hippocampus and one group received electrolytic cortical lesions. Half of each group were tested 1 hr/day for 10 days under scheduled food delivery and the other half received food in a single presentation. It was found that both electrolytic hippocampal and cortical lesions reduced the level of SID compared with sham and 6-Hydroxydopamine lesions which did not differ from each other. However, there is support for the suggestion that hippocampal catecholamine neurones are involved in corticosterone regulation as shown by a significant increase in plasma corticosterone levels in non-scheduled, 6-Hydroxydopamine lesioned rats.",
