     "AB": "Developing animals are known to be resistant to cerebral ischemia. To investigate the mechanisms by which developing animals exhibit ischemic resistance, we examined the changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) using hippocampal slices from gerbils. We found that increases of [Ca2+]i in hippocampal CA1 neurons is significantly less after OGD in developing gerbils than in adults. Western blot analysis of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid) receptors (AMPARs) showed that GluR2 expression, but not that of the other AMPARs is significantly higher in developing gerbils than in adults. Expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins such as HSP70, Bcl-XL, and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase type1 (PMCA1) are not higher in the developing gerbils than in adults. These results suggest that the higher expression of GluR2 is important for the smaller increases in [Ca2+]i and enhanced resistance to ischemia-induced neuronal damage in developing animals.",
