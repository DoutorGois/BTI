     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Several human studies have reported that coffee consumption improves cognitive performance. In the present study, we investigated whether instant decaffeinated coffee also ameliorates cognitive performance and attenuates the detrimental effects of scopolamine on memory. METHODS: Memory performance was evaluated in Morris water maze test and passive avoidance test. Instant decaffeinated coffee (p.o.) at 120 or 240 mg/kg in Sprague-Dawley rats, which is equivalent to approximately three or six cups of coffee, respectively, in a 60 kg human, was administered for two weeks. RESULTS: Oral gavage administration of instant decaffeinated coffee inhibited scopolamine-induced memory impairment, which was measured by Morris water maze test and passive avoidance test. Instant decaffeinated coffee suppressed scopolamine-mediated elevation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and stimulation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway (i.e., phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and p65) in the rat hippocampus. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that caffeine-free decaffeinated coffee may prevent memory impairment in human through the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation and subsequent TNF-alpha production.",
