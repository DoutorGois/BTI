     "AB": "Using in vivo microdialysis, we have investigated the effects of propofol on acetylcholine (ACh) release from various regions of the rat brain. Propofol 25 and 50 mg kg-1 i.p. decreased basal ACh release from the frontal cortex by 70% and 85%, respectively. Propofol 25 and 50 mg kg-1 i.p. decreased basal ACh release from the hippocampus by 47% and 72%, respectively. However, in rat striatum, propofol 25 mg kg-1 i.p. did not affect basal ACh release and 50 mg kg-1 i.p. produced slight inhibition of basal ACh release (by 19%) only in the second sample after i.p. injection. In addition, we also examined the pharmacological mechanisms mediating the interaction between propofol and a gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor complex. In the rat hippocampus, local application of bicuculline 1 mumol litre-1, a GABAA receptor antagonist, significantly antagonized the inhibitory effects of propofol 50 mg kg-1 i.p. on basal ACh release. In the rat frontal cortex, local application of bicuculline 1 mumol litre-1 did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of propofol 50 mg kg-1 i.p. on basal ACh release, while systemic application of bicuculline 1 mg kg-1 i.p. significantly antagonized the inhibitory effects of propofol 50 mg kg-1 i.p. These results suggest that propofol has powerful depressant effects on ACh release from the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus but not from the striatum, indicating that propofol has a \"region-selective\" anaesthetic action. Further, these results suggest that the inhibitory effects of propofol in the rat hippocampus may involve \"intra\" hippocampal GABAA receptors while the inhibitory effects in the rat frontal cortex may be mediated by GABAA receptors other than \"intra\" frontal cortex GABAA receptors.",
