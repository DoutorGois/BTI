     "AB": "The immunoreactivity of Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC) in the gerbil hippocampus associated with various sequelae of spontaneous seizures were investigated in order to identify the roles of NKCC in the epileptogenesis and the recovery mechanisms in these animals. The NKCC immunoreactivities in the CA2-3 regions, the subiculum and the entorhinal cortex, were significantly more intensified in the pre-seizure group of seizure sensitive (SS) gerbils than in the seizure resistant (SR) gerbils. Following the on-set of seizure, the immunoreactivity of NKCC was significantly changed. In the hippocampal complex except the CA1 region, NKCC immunoreactivity in GABAergic neurons was significantly decreased 30 min after seizure on-set, versus the pre-seizure group. On the other hand, NKCC immunoreactivity was dramatically elevated in the CA1 regions, and 3 h postictal NKCC immunoreactivity increased significantly in the dentate gyrus and the dendrites of the pyramidal cells in the CA2-3 regions. These findings suggest that altered NKCC expression may be associated with seizure activity, and have an important role in the postictal recovery by regulating GABA-mediated inhibitory circuit in the hippocampal complex of the gerbil.",
