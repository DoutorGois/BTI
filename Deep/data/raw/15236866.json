     "AB": "The present study was performed to determine whether the effects induced by GABA(B) receptor-acting drugs would be related with the alteration in GABA(B) receptor expression in the hippocampus using Mongolian gerbil, a genetic epilepsy model. The distribution patterns of both GABA(B) receptor 1A/B and GABA(B)receptor 2 immunoreactivities were similarly detected in the hippocampi of normal and seizure-prone gerbils. Following baclofen (GABA(B) receptor agonist) or phaclofen (GABA(B) receptor antagonist) treatment, GABA(B) receptor immunoreactivities were decreased or increased by dose-dependent manners, respectively. Vigabatrin (GABA transaminase inhibitor) or 3-mercaptopropionic acid (GAD inhibitor) treatment did not affect GABA(B) receptor expressions. These findings suggest that GABA(B) receptor expression in the gerbil hippocampus may be altered by baclofen or phaclofen treatment.",
