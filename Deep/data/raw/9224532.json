     "AB": "Although reports of dementia lacking the distinctive non-Alzheimer-type histopathology have been increasing, the concept is still far from clear. It has become apparent that this population shows neuropathological heterogeneity, and some recent reports have proposed a classification or criteria for these disease conditions. Of the reported cases, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) of motor neuron disease is unique in that the neurons of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex have ubiquitin-related abnormalities. Recently, a new ubiquitin-related abnormality, characterized by ubiquitinated inclusions in the neurites, has been found in some FTD cases. Using immunoelectron microscopy with immunogold particles, we have found that in these two disease conditions ubiquitinated inclusions consist of abnormal filaments of 10-15 nm in diameter. Our results support the speculation that there is a close relationship between ubiquitin and abnormal filaments in these two types of FTD, indicating that cytoskeletal-related disorders may underlie certain types of FTD.",
