     "AB": "Proteins and peptides have been demonstrated to penetrate across the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells by protein transduction domains. We show that protein transduction by 11 arginine (11R) is an efficient method of delivering proteins into the neurons of brain slices. Here, we demonstrate that PKA inhibitory peptide, fused with 11R and nuclear localization signal, delivers the peptide exclusively into the nuclear compartment of neurons in brain slices. This inhibitory peptide blocked both cAMP responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation and long-lasting long-term potentiation (LTP) induction, but not early LTP. These results highlight transduction of proteins and peptides into specific neuronal subcellular compartments in brain slices as a powerful tool for studying neuronal plasticity.",
