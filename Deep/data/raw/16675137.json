     "AB": "Neuropeptides are crucial mediators in nervous and endocrine systems. Processing and degradation, the major regulatory mechanisms, of enzymes are essential for the control of these peptidergic intercellular signaling systems. Damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase (or endothelin converting enzyme-like1), a member of the neprilysin family, has recently been identified as an M13 zinc metalloprotease. Damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase mRNA expression is strikingly restricted to neurons, and is remarkably induced in response to various types of neuronal injuries, although its function and substrate remain unknown. To clarify the role of damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase, we examined the localization and ontogeny of damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase mRNA expression in the rat nervous system using in situ hybridization. Damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase mRNA was detected at embryonic day 12, and its expression restricted to the ventral region of the neural tube. Subsequently, expression was also apparent in primordia of the striatum, hypothalamus, and cranial motor nuclei during neural development. This specific distribution was relatively maintained in the adult brain, although expression levels became weaker. Expression of damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase was absent in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. In addition to prominent expression in CNS, intestinal and sensory ganglia and retina demonstrated transient intense damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase mRNA expression during the embryonic period that then declined, and disappeared after birth. The results indicated that damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase might play an important role in embryonic neural development, in particular in peripheral ganglia derived from the neural crest, and in some neurons originating from the basal plate such as the hypothalamus and cranial motor neurons.",
