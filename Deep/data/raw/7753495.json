     "AB": "The effects of adenosine on synaptic transmission were studied with extracellular recordings of stimulus-induced population action potentials in area CA1 of hippocampal slices prepared from hibernating (HH) and warm-acclimated Turkish hamsters (WH) and rats. In HH as well as WH and rat slices, adenosine generally reduced the population spike amplitude and the slope of the field EPSP. The sensitivity for adenosine was significantly lower in HH slices than in WH and rat slices. The results are discussed with regard to the involvement of endogenous adenosine in the regulation of neuronal activity during entrance into and arousal from hibernation.",
