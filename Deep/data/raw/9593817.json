     "AB": "Neurocan is a nervous tissue-unique chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) whose expression and proteolytic cleavage are developmentally regulated. In the adult rat brain, neurocan is completely cleaved into some proteoglycan fragments including the C-terminal half known as neurocan-C and a N-terminal fragment with a 130 kDa core glycoprotein (neurocan-130). We describe here the differential distribution of these two neurocan-derived CSPGs in the adult rat cerebrum and the occurrence of neurocan-130 as a new member of a perineuronal net-constituting molecule. At the light microscopic level, neurocan-130 exhibited pericellular localization around a subset of neurons in addition to diffuse distribution in the neuropil. In contrast, neurocan-C was distributed only diffusely in the neuropil. Double staining with anti-neurocan-130 and anti-synaptophysin antibodies suggested that neurocan-130 was localized in the vicinity of the synapses, but not at the synapses. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that neurocan-130 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of glial cell processes, the so-called glial perineuronal net, encompassing the cell bodies of certain neurons. The presence of neurocan-130 in a limited number of glial cells may reflect some functional heterogeneity of the glia.",
