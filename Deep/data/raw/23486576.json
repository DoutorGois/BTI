     "AB": "The study compared the effects of KATP channels blockers 5-hydroxydecanoat and glibenclamide on rapid hypoxic preconditioning and posthypoxic hyperexcitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices induced by short-term hypoxia. The population spikes of CA1 neurons were recorded before, during, and after exposure to a short-term hypoxia. The blockers of KATP channels significantly degraded the potency of hypoxia episodes to inhibit the evoked neuronal population activity. In contrast to glibenclamide, 5-hydroxydecanoat eliminated the preconditioning action of hypoxia. Despite mitochondrial KATP channels play an important role in the mechanisms of rapid hypoxic preconditioning in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, the tested KATP channels blockers produced no significant effect on the development of posthypoxic hyperexcitability in these neurons.",
