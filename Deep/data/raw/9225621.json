     "AB": "Four experiments were conducted to determine the effects of bilateral damage to the hippocampus and area parahippocampalis (Hp-APH) on visual memory in pigeons using the delayed matching-to-sample (DMS) procedure. In Experiment 1, we generated visual retention gradients with delays of 0, 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 sec both preoperatively and postoperatively in three pigeons with considerable preoperative visual DMS experience. Bilateral Hp-APH lesions had no effect whatsoever on visual retention. In Experiment 2, we examined the effects of Hp-APH lesions on both the acquisition of a visual DMS task with a 0-sec delay, and the subsequent retention performance with delays of 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 sec. There was no difference between unoperated control pigeons and Hp-APH pigeons either in terms of the number of sessions required to learn the visual DMS task or in terms of their subsequent visual retention performance levels. In Experiments 3 and 4, we examined whether Hp-APH pigeons might be more sensitive than control pigeons to the effects of proactive interference (by reducing the duration of the intertrial interval) and retroactive interference (by introducing delay-interval illumination). Although reducing the duration of the intertrial interval and increasing the level of delay-interval illumination both resulted in lower performance levels on the visual DMS task, there was no indication that the Hp-APH pigeons were any more affected by the changes in interference levels than were unoperated control pigeons. These findings support the view that the Hp-APH in pigeons plays little role in the processing and retention of purely visual information.",
