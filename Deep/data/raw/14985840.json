     "AB": "An improved method is described for fast and reliable isolation of neurons from hippocampus of adult rats by a combination of mechanical and enzymatic means. The procedure allows the isolation of neurons from 500-600-d-old rats (over 300 g), preserving the proximal dendritic structure without impairing the electrical characteristics of the cells. Morphologically distinct neurons can be recognized. Using cell-attached, inside-out and whole-cell configurations of patch clamp technique, it was shown that the enzymatically isolated neurons in hippocampus from rats weighing more than 300 g exhibited voltage-gated calcium, sodium and potassium currents, outwardly rectifying chloride channel and large conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium channel currents. Approximately, 95% of healthy cells allowed the formation of giga-ohm seals.",
