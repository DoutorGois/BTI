     "AB": "The regional distribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in rat brain using the selective NMDA receptor ligand [3H]3-[+/-)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) has been quantitated by in vitro autoradiography. [3H]CCP binding was highest in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Relatively high levels of binding were also observed in the cerebral cortex, while moderate binding was obtained in the thalamus, striatum and granule cell layer of the cerebellum. Concurrent studies examining the phencyclidine receptor ligand [3H]1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]-piperidine (TCP), revealed a similar pattern of binding that correlated well with the localization of [3H]CPP-labeled NMDA receptors (r = 0.88, P less than 0.01).",
