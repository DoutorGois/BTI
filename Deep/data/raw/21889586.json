     "AB": "Peripherally administered inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induce the synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the periphery and the central nervous system, and trigger a variety of neurobiological responses. Indeed, prior reports indicate that peripheral LPS administration in rats disrupts contextual fear memory consolidation processes, potentially due to elevated cytokine expression. We used a similar, but partially olfaction-based, contextual fear conditioning paradigm to examine the effects of LPS on memory consolidation and reconsolidation in mice. Additionally, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and zinc finger (Zif)-268 mRNA expression in the hippocampus and the cortex, along with peripheral cytokines and chemokines, were assessed. As hypothesized, LPS administered immediately or 2 h, but not 12 h, post-training impaired memory consolidation processes that support the storage of the conditioned contextual fear memory. Additionally, as hypothesized, LPS administered immediately following the fear memory trace reactivation session impaired memory reconsolidation processes. Four hours post-injection, both central cytokine and peripheral cytokine and chemokine levels were heightened in LPS-treated animals, with a simultaneous decrease in BDNF, but not Zif-268, mRNA. Collectively, these data reinforce prior work showing LPS- and cytokine-related effects on memory consolidation, and extend this work to memory reconsolidation.",
