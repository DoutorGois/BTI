     "AB": "In the present study, we describe the biochemical characteristics and the autoradiographic distribution of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors in the rat central nervous system (CNS) after in vitro incubation of brain slices with 3H-TRH. Scatchard analysis showed that, in the range of concentrations tested (0.7-35 nM), 3H-TRH bound to a single-class of receptors with a dissociation constant of 6 nM and a number of binding sites of 20 fmol/mg protein. Increasing concentrations of unlabeled TRH produced a dose-dependent inhibition of 3H-TRH binding. The only analogue as potent as TRH to displace 3H-TRH binding was 3-Me-TRH, whereas 1-Me-TRH or TRH-free acid as well as pGlu-His, pGlu-Pro-NH2 or His-Pro-diketopiperazine were ineffective. Neither Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), neurotensin, somatostatin, D-Ala-Met-enkephalin nor VIP showed any significant affinity for TRH binding sites. Autoradiograms obtained by apposition of LKB 3H-Ultrofilm showed that the highest concentrations of 3H-TRH binding sites were found in the ventral dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation, the lateral amygdaloid nucleus, the nucleus accumbens, and the thalamic paraventricular nucleus. The biochemical characterization of 3H-TRH binding in brain sections is in good agreement with previous reports on membrane preparations and the autoradiographic localization of the binding sites provides anatomical support for the effects of TRH in the CNS.",
