     "AB": "The olfactory bulb of the rat contains chromogranin A at a similar level as the adrenal gland or the hypophysis as revealed by immunoblots. Olfactory chromogranin A also displays the same size as chromogranin A of endocrine cells. In the hippocampus and other brain regions, we could not detect chromogranin A by immunoblotting. In contrast, chromogranin A messenger ribonucleic acid (using S1 nuclease protection assays) was observed in all brain regions examined, including the olfactory bulb. By in situ hybridization histochemistry with a complementary ribonucleic acid probe (280 nucleotides), and by immunocytochemistry, chromogranin A synthesis could be localized to cell bodies of the mitral cell layer, of the external plexiform layer and of the periglomerular region of the olfactory bulb. Immunocytochemically, chromogranin A was also detected in the central projection areas of mitral and tufted cells in the primary olfactory cortex and the anterior amygdaloid area but not in the olfactory glomeruli, where the incoming olfactory nerve fibers of the primary olfactory neurons establish synaptic contacts. Taken together the data show that chromogranin A, following biosynthesis in the perikarya of the mitral and tufted cells, is specifically transported into their axonal terminals but not into their primary dendrites. We propose that the rat olfactory system could serve as a model for the study of chromogranin A regulation and function in neurons.",
