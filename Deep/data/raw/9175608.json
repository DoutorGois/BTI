     "AB": "The present study was aimed at characterizing the metabotropic receptor subtype which is involved in the activation of phospholipase D (PLD) by glutamate in rat hippocampal slices. We first observed that the ontogenetic profile of glutamate-induced hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and of phosphatidylcholine was strikingly similar. Both pathways were significantly activated by glutamate in tissue taken from 3-, 8- and 15-day old rats, but not in adult rats. PLD activation was strongest in slices taken from 8-day old rats. At this age, quisqualate had a higher potency for PLD activation (EC50: 0.6 microM) than 1S,3R-ACPD (EC50: 16 microM) and DHPG, a specific activator of group I mGluR, was a full agonist at PLD activation (EC50: 3.5 microM) indicating an involvement of a group I mGluR (mGluR1 and 5). MCPG and AIDA, two putative antagonists at mGluR1 receptors, caused a small but (in the case of MCPG) significant inhibition. DCG-IV, an activator of group II mGluR, was a weak partial agonist at PLD activation (EC50: 22 nM) while L-AP 4, an activator at group III mGluR, was totally inactive. Likewise, forskolin, a stimulant of cyclic AMP formation, was inactive either alone, or in combination with glutamatergic agonists. Pretreatment of the slices with pertussis toxin did not affect PLD activation. In summary, the glutamate-mediated activation of hippocampal PLD, which occurs transiently during postnatal development, is mediated by a group I mGluR, possibly involving mGluR5.",
