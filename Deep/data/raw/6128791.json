     "AB": "Intracerebroventricular administration of dynorphin produced potent and long-lasting effects on motor function and the electroencephalogram in rats. In addition, local iontophoretic or pressure ejection of dynorphin consistently inhibited hippocampal unit activity. None of these effects were significantly affected by naloxone even at high doses. Moreover, a fragment of dynorphin that failed to displace any of a number of tritiated narcotics from rat brain homogenates produced similar effects on these physiological measures in vivo. On the basis of a variety of criteria for \"opiate action,\" the results suggest that a second biologically active site within the dynorphin sequence is capable of quite potent but nonopiate effects.",
