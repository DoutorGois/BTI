     "AB": "The goal of this study was to support the hypothesis that visceral signals may integrate and influence behavior by way of direct pathways from the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) to the olfactory tubercle and the midline/intralaminar thalamus. An anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was iontophoresed bilaterally into the caudal NTS to optimize terminal labeling. NTS-cortical projections traversed both limbs of the diagonal bands providing heavy innervation, and terminated lightly within layer 3 of the olfactory tubercle. NTS-thalamic projections terminated within anterior and, as previously shown, posterior divisions of nucleus paraventricularis thalami and avoided the adjoining mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Heretofore unrecognized projections were traced to the parafascicular and reuniens thalamic nuclei, and the peripeduncular nucleus. Control experiments identified the nucleus gracilis as the principal source of ascending projections to ventroposterior lateral, posterior and intralaminar thalamic nuclei. Our data corroborate the supposition that olfactory signals may integrate with visceral stimuli in the striatal compartment of olfactory tubercle. NTS projections encompass thalamic nuclei that project topographically to the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and ventral (limbic) striatum, regions activated by visceral stimulation. Structural data support the idea that compartments of the non-discriminative thalamus may contribute to perception and behavioral responses to visceral stimulation.",
