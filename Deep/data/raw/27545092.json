     "AB": "Advantageous maneuvering through the environment to find food and avoid or escape danger is central to survival of most animal species. The ability to do so depends on learning and remembering different locations, especially home-base. This capacity is encoded in the brain by two systems: one using cues outside the organism (distal cues), allocentric navigation, and one using self-movement, internal cues (proximal cues), for egocentric navigation. Whereas allocentric navigation involves the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and surrounding structures, egocentric navigation involves the dorsal striatum and connected structures; in humans this system encodes routes and integrated paths and when over-learned, becomes procedural memory. Allocentric assessment methods have been extensively reviewed elsewhere. The purpose of this paper is to review one specific method for assessing egocentric, route-based navigation in rats: the Cincinnati water maze (CWM). The test is an asymmetric multiple-T maze arranged in such a way that rats must learn to find path openings along walls rather at ends in order to reach the goal. Failing to do this leads to cul-de-sacs and repeated errors. The task may be learned in the light or dark, but in the dark, wherein distal cues are eliminated, provides the best assessment of egocentric navigation. When used in conjunction with tests of other types of learning, such as allocentric navigation, the CWM provides a balanced approach to assessing the two major forms of navigational learning and memory found in mammals.",
