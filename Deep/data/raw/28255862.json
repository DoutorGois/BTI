     "AB": "Obesity and consumption of a high fat diet (HFD) are known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we have examined the protective and therapeutic effects of thymol (main monoterpene phenol found in thyme essential oil) on a HFD-fed rat model of AD. Fourty adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 5 groups:(n = 8 rats/group): group 1, control, consumed an ordinary diet, group 2 consumed a HFD for 8 weeks, then received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) via intrahippocampal (IHP) injection, group 3 consumed HFD for 8 weeks, then received beta-amyloid (Abeta)1-42 via IHP injections to induce AD, group 4 consumed HFD for 8 weeks, then received Abeta1-42, and was treated by thymol (30 mg/kg in sunflower oil) daily for 4 weeks, and group 5 consumed HFD for 8 week, then received Abeta1-42 after what sunflower oil was administered by oral gavage daily for 4 weeks. Biochemical tests showed an impaired lipid profile and higher glucose levels upon consumption of HFD, which was ameliorated by thymol treatment. In behavioral results, spatial memory in group 3 was significantly impaired, but groups treated with thymol showed better spatial memory compared to group 3 (p </= 0.01). In histological results, formation of Abeta plaque in hippocampus of group 3 increased significantly compared to group 1 and group 2 (p </= 0.05), but group 4 showed decreased Abeta plaques compared to group 3 (p </= 0.01). In conclusion, thymol decreased the effects of Abeta on memory and could be considered as neuroprotective.",
