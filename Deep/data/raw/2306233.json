     "AB": "Nuclear pool(s) of protein kinase C (PKC) may be a common target for hormones and growth factors which affect the trophic state of cells. The data presented demonstrate a time and dose-dependent activation of nuclear PKC by the HIV coat protein, gp120, in isolated nuclei from rat spleen and hippocampus. This gp120-stimulated PKC response was blocked by specific PKC inhibitors, a monoclonal antibody to PKC, and a monoclonal antibody directed against the murine T4 analog, L3T4. It is suggested that the gp120 interaction with the nuclear trophic factor-PKC system may impair normal gene expression, and thus result in the clinical symptoms associated in AIDS infection.",
