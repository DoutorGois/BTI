     "AB": "The effect of (S)alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (FMH), a specific inhibitor of histamine synthesis from histidine, on ischemic damage was examined in gerbil brain after forebrain ischemia. Two h after subcutaneous FMH injection, the histamine content of the brain was significantly reduced. Neuronal loss in the CA2 region of the hippocampus 7 days after 3 min ischemia was enhanced by treatment with FMH. These results indicate that depletion of brain histamine aggravates neuronal death of hippocampal CA2 neurons after 3 min ischemia.",
