     "AB": "CX 546, an allosteric positive modulator of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs), belongs to a drug class called ampakines. These compounds have been shown to enhance long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model of learning and memory, and improve animal learning task performance, and have augmented cognition in neurodegenerative patients. However, the chronic effect of CX546 on synaptic structures has not been examined. The structure and integrity of dendritic spines are thought to play a role in learning and memory, and their abnormalities have been implicated in cognitive disorders. In addition, their structural plasticity has been shown to be important for cognitive function, such that dendritic spine remodeling has been proposed as the morphological correlate for LTP. Here, we tested the effect of CX546 on dendritic spine remodeling following long-term treatment. We found that, with prolonged CX546 treatment, organotypic hippocampal slice cultures showed a significant reduction in CA3-CA1 excitatory synapse and spine density. Electrophysiological approaches revealed that the CA3-CA1 circuitry compensates for this synapse loss by increasing synaptic efficacy through enhancement of presynaptic release probability. CX546-treated slices showed prolonged and enhanced potentiation upon LTP induction. Furthermore, structural plasticity, namely spine head enlargement, was also more pronounced after CX546 treatment. Our results suggest a concordance of functional and structural changes that is enhanced with prolonged CX546 exposure. Thus, the improved cognitive ability of patients receiving ampakine treatment may result from the priming of synapses through increases in the structural plasticity and functional reliability of hippocampal synapses.",
