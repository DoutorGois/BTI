     "AB": "Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is a characteristic pathophysiological change of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a commonly diagnosed chronic sleep disorder. With the process of OSA, patients will suffer from the nervous system damage and appear to multiple cognitive dysfunction. The mechanism that how IH causes cognitive impairment is still unknown. Both control and experimental rats were placed in conditions absence and presence of intermittent hypoxia (IH) for 8h a day for a week, two weeks and four weeks, and then followed by behavioral assessments with Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. The results showed that the escape latency of the tested animals to IH significantly increased the escape latency on the last four training days in comparison to the control group. Consistent with this, the expressions of apoptosis/anti-apoptosis proteins were both changed in the hippocampus. Then we utilized the miRNA microarray assay to investigate the level of miRNA expression in rat hippocampus which suffered from intermittent hypoxia. It is noteworthy that the expressions of miR-26b and miR-207 were consistently dysregulated in all the experimental groups post IH. And we utilized qRT-PCR methods to verify the microarray results. Our results showed that microarray based analysis of microRNA expression in rat hippocampus after IH has shown that some microRNAs such as miR-26b and miR-207 could be involved in the OSA-induced cognitive impairments.",
