     "AB": "The effects of intracerebroventricular administration of neuropeptide Y (NPY) on central monoamine turnover were studied in rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT). NPY decreased noradrenaline turnover in the brainstem, hypothalamus, midbrain and hippocampus. Dopamine turnover was decreased in the brainstem and striatum of NPY-treated rats. Although alpha-MPT did not seem to affect the turnover of serotonin, the concentration of this amine after the administration of NPY was higher in the brainstem, hypothalamus and striatum. Our results suggest that NPY may play a role in the modulation of monoamine turnover in the central nervous system.",
