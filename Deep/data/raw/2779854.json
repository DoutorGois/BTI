     "AB": "Spontaneous field potential oscillations were recorded from the CA3 distal apical dendritic region of guinea pig hippocampal slices maintained in 'normal' artificial cerebrospinal fluid in vitro. Power spectral analysis revealed a mixture of frequencies mainly under 20 Hz without distinct peaks. High concentrations of extracellular Mg2+ blocked the activity. These findings suggest that the intrinsic spontaneous activity of the hippocampus is produced by partially synchronized synaptic potentials. This in vitro system may provide a suitable model for studying the mechanisms underlying the generation of EEG rhythms.",
