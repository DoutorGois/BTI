     "AB": "Although chronic voluntary physical activity has been shown to enhance hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in animals, the effects of forced exercise on a treadmill have not been fully investigated. We assessed induction of c-fos and BDNF expression with acute exercise at different running intensities. The mRNA for c-fos, a marker for neuronal activation, was up-regulated even under low-intensity running (15 m/min), although its induction appeared to be intensity dependent. On the other hand, increases in BDNF mRNA and protein were seen only at low-intensity running. At moderate-intensity running (25 m/min) which elevated blood lactate and corticosterone levels, induction of BDNF mRNA, but not its protein, was even depressed. Our study shows the first evidence that with an acute low-intensity exercise that is minimally stressful, hippocampal activation and BDNF expression can be achieved lending support to the idea that mild exercise could yield to greater benefits in hippocampal functions compared to the more strenuous forms.",
