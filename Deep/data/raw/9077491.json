     "AB": "Utilizing an affinity-purified antiserum directed against the carboxyl terminal region of atrophin-1/drplap (residues 1170-1185), we have examined the expression and distribution of the protein in a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. Immunohistochemical analyses of gelatin-embedded sections of monkey brain demonstrated a wide-spread distribution of the protein throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum. Labeling was primarily cytoplasmic within neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. Prominently staining regions included layers II, III, V, and VI of cerebral cortex, CA1-4 of the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, amygdala, thalamus, red nucleus, pons, Purkinje cells, and deep cerebellar nuclei. Immunoblot analysis of extracts of frontal cortex from a wide variety of mammalian species (human, monkey, rabbit, rat, mouse, and bovine) detected a 190 kDa band in each extract. No cross-reactive material of similar molecular weight was detected in an extract of avian (chicken) central nervous system (CNS) tissue. Furthermore, in the rat, expression of the protein was predominantly neuronal in origin as immunoblot analyses of non-neuronal tissue extracts detected little or no 190 kDa protein. Collectively these investigations suggest a ubiquitous expression of atrophin-1/drplap in mammalian CNS tissue and provide initial immunochemical data for the study of the neuroanatomic and perhaps, phylogenetic relationships between mammalian and non-mammalian forms of the protein.",
