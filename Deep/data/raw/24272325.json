     "AB": "The distribution of cysteine oxidase (CO) and cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase (CSD) was examined in 12 regions of the rat central nervous system (CNS). The distribution of CO activity, expressed as mumol of cysteine sulfinate formed per h per g, was the following: hypothalamus, superior and inferior colliculi, 94-99 mumol/h/g; olfactory bulbs, cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, 44-51 mumol/h/g; cerebellum, 71 mumol/h/g; pons-medula and spinal cord, 94 and 60 mumol/h/g, respectively. The distribution of CSD activity expressed as mumol of cysteine sulfinate decarboxylated per h per g was the following: hypothalamus and colliculi, 14-21 mumol/h/g; olfactory bulbs, cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum, 8-13 mumol/h/g; pons-medulla, 7.3; and spinal cord, 3.6 mumol/h/g. No CSD activity was detected in sciatic nerve. The subcellular distribution of CO and CSD activities was studied in hypothalamus, colliculi, and cerebral cortex. CO activity was localized in synaptosomes, mitochondria, and microsomes. CSD was primarily confined to the crude mitochondrial fraction and after subfraction, recovered mainly in the synaptosomal fraction.",
