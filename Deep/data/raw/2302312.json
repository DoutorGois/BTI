     "AB": "Rats with lesions in the posterodorsal septal area (aimed at transecting the precommissural fornix) and rats with lesions in the prelimbic sector of the medial frontal cortex were tested postoperatively on a neuropsychological test battery comprised of the following tasks: time-spent-eating in two adaptation boxes, time-to-emerge and ambulation in an open field, general activity, contingently-reinforced (continuous) and schedule-specific (delayed non-matching-to-sample) T-maze alternation, visual and olfactory discrimination in a T-maze, temporal alternation (response patterning) and tactile Go/No-Go discrimination in a runway, approach-avoidance conflict in the runway, step-through inhibitory avoidance, one-way active avoidance, two-way active avoidance, and conditioned taste aversion. It was found that: (1) rats with septal (SEP) lesions spent more time eating than control (CON) rats and rats with lesions in prelimbic cortex (PRE). PRE rats did not differ from CON rats; (2) PRE rats emerged into an open field faster, and spent less time in home cage than CON and SEP rats. SEP rats stayed in home cage less than CON rats. PRE and SEP rats crossed more squares in the open field than CON rats; (3) SEP and PRE rats were more active than CON rats; (4) SEP rats performed the contigently-reinforced and schedule-specific T-maze alternation tasks worse than PRE rats, and PRE rats performed these tasks worse than CON rats. PRE, but not SEP, rats showed improvement with continued practice at brief intertrial and interrun intervals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
