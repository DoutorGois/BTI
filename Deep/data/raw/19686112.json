     "AB": "Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of receptors for L-glutamate (GLU) and their transduction molecules in the gut mucosa as well as in the oral cavity. Among 20 amino acids, gastric vagal afferent fibers respond only to intragastric administration of GLU. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed activation of several forebrain regions in response to intragastric infusion of taste solutions (D-glucose [sweet], monosodium L-glutamate [MSG; umami], and NaCl [salty] at 60 mM) in rats. Glucose activated the nucleus accumbens. MSG activated the medial preoptic area, dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and habenular nucleus. Both glucose and MSG activated the amygdala. Some areas, such as the insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and caudate-putamen were activated by all three substances. Glucose-induced brain activation developed slowly and persisted for a long time, whereas activation by MSG developed rapidly during infusion and reduced rapidly after cessation of infusion. NaCl induced only small and transient activation. Thus, both activated areas and temporal response patterns in the brain were distinct between sweet and umami substances delivered in the stomach. Postoral taste substances may activate the brain via neural (vagal) and/or humoral pathways.",
