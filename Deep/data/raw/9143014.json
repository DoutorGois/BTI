     "AB": "We correlated trinucleotide CAG repeat numbers in the huntingtin gene with the regional brain atrophy and clinical phenotype in 23 adult autopsy cases of Huntington's disease (HD). CAG repeat number (39-56, mean 45.4 +/- 4.6) correlated inversely (P < 0.0001) with age at onset and death, but not with disease duration or initial symptoms. Cross-sectional areas of the striatum, pallidum, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, and the cortical grey and white matter within the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes at four levels (genu of the corpus callosum, amygdala, accumbens, hippocampus) were measured morphometrically from the coronal brain slices using image analysis. None of these morphometric variables correlated with number of CAG repeats. Thus, tissue atrophy in advanced HD is unrelated to the underlying genetic defect.",
