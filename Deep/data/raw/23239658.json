     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the migration of fluorescent dye PKH26-labeled BM-MSC in the Alzheimer's model rats. METHODS: Normal human bone marrow extracted for isolation of BM-MSC was cultured in vitro. The 5th passaged BM-MSC was labeled with PKH26, and observed under a fluorescence microscope for PKH26 labeling efficiency, and using flow cytometry BM-MSC surface markers was checked. The PKH26 labeled BM-MSC injected into the tail vein of the normal control group and AD animal model group, 14 days after finding the PKH26-labeled BM-MSC cells in the rat hippocampus using fluorescence microscopy. Using the Morris water maze experiment comparison of AD model and BM-MSC transplantation group of spatial learning and memory ability. RESULTS: TFlow cytometry showed BM-MSC surface markers CD73 and CD105 were positive. In vitro, PKH26-labeled rate of BM-MSC was 100 %. The Morris water maze experiment comparison of BM-MSC transplantation group and AD group of animals, BM-MSC transplantation group at 13, 14 days of spatial learning and memory ability than AD animal group had significantly improved. 14 days after BM-MSCs in rat hippocampus could be found which were PKH26-positive, consistent with DAPI staining. PKH26-positive cells in animal models of AD were significantly more than those in the normal control group. CONCLUSION: BM-MSC in AD rats not only migrates through the blood-brain barrier, but also mainly survives in the hippocampus of AD rats, and it can improve AD rat model of learning disabilities.",
