     "AB": "With the rapid development of electronic technologies, the public concern about the potential health hazards induced by radiofrequency (RF) radiation has been grown. To investigate the effect of 1800MHz RF radiation emitted from mobile phone on the rat's brain, the present study was performed. Forty male rats were randomly divided into two equal groups; control and exposed group. The later one exposed to 1800MHz emitted from mobile phone with an SAR value of 0.6W/kg for two hours/day for three months. The brain tissues were collected at the end of the experimental period and separated into hippocampus and cerebellum for subsequent biochemical, histological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic investigations. The rats that were exposed to RF- radiation had a significant elevation in MDA content and a significant reduction in antioxidant parameters (glutathione, super oxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) in both regions. Degenerative changes were observed in the hippocampus pyramidal cells, dark cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells with vascular congestion. In addition a significant DNA fragmentation and over expression of cyclooxygenase-2 apoptotic gene was detected. Those results suggested that, direct chronic exposure to mobile phone caused severe biochemical and histopathological changes in the brain.",
