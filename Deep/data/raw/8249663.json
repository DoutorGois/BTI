     "AB": "Infant rats were exposed to hypoxia. At different time periods after the hypoxic aggression the animals were subjected to a one-way active avoidance task consisting of 3 daily training sessions. Learning performance of hypoxic rats, expressed as the number of avoidances per 10 trials, was significantly decreased in all the sessions at posthypoxic day 35 (P < 0.001). The rate to which learning behaviour was affected by hypoxia was comparable among all 3 sessions in both groups. Histological evaluation of hippocampus and cortex at day 7 and day 35 after hypoxic exposure, did not reveal detectable structural changes. It can be concluded from this study that hypoxia, induced in 21 day old rats leads to learning performance deficits in the adult animal.",
