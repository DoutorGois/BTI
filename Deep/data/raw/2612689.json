     "AB": "A minimal intensity of the stimulation necessary for the induction of long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission (LTP) was investigated by intracellular recording in guinea pig in vitro hippocampal slices. High frequency stimulation of afferent fibres at intensities evoking in CA 1 neurons control excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) of amplitudes 1-5 mV, resulted usually in a long-lasting increase in response amplitude. LTP was not observed at lower stimulus strength. The coactivation of a certain, though small number of synaptic contacts is thus necessary for the production of LTP.",
