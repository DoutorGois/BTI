     "AB": "A series of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for anticonvulsant activity against intracerebro-ventriculas (i.c.v.) N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced seizures in mice. Among these compounds, (+)-1-methyl-1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrochloride ((+)-1a, FR115427) was the most effective anticonvulsant, and also protected CA1 hippocampal neurons from ischemia-induced neuronal degeneration in rats at 32 mg/kg i.p. In addition, (+)-1a showed anti-hypoxic activity in mice at 3.2-32 mg/kg i.p. The absolute configuration at the C-1 position of the isoquinoline ring was determined to be S by a single-crystal X-ray analysis of (+)-1a (+)-di-p-toluoyl-D-tartrate. Structure-activity relationships with regard to the anticonvulsant activity of this series of compounds are discussed, and the three-dimensional structures of (S)-(+)-1a and MK801 are compared.",
