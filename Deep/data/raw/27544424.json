     "AB": "The nucleus reuniens (RE) of the ventral midline thalamus is strongly reciprocally connected with the hippocampus (HF) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and has been shown to mediate the transfer of information between these structures. It has become increasingly well established that RE serves a critical role in mnemonic tasks requiring the interaction of the HF and mPFC, but essentially not tasks relying solely on the HF. Very few studies have addressed the independent actions of RE on prefrontal executive functioning. The present report examined the effects of lesions of the ventral midline thalamus, including RE and the dorsally adjacent rhomboid nucleus (RH) in rats on attention and behavioral flexibility using the attentional set shifting task (AST). The task uses odor and tactile stimuli to test for attentional set formation, attentional set shifting, behavioral flexibility and reversal learning. By comparison with sham controls, lesioned rats were significantly impaired on reversal learning and intradimensional (ID) set shifting. Specifically, RE/RH lesioned rats were impaired on the first reversal stage of the task which required a change in response strategy to select a previously non-rewarded stimulus for reward. RE/RH lesioned rats also exhibited deficits in the ability to transfer or generalize rules of the task which requires making the same modality-based choices (e.g., odor vs. tactile) to different sets of stimuli in the ID stage of the task. These results demonstrate that in addition to its role in tasks dependent on HF-mPFC interactions, nucleus reuniens is also critically involved cognitive/executive functions associated with the medial prefrontal cortex. As such, the deficits in the AST task produced by RE/RH lesions suggest the ventral midline thalamus directly contributes to flexible goal directed behavior.",
