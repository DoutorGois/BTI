     "AB": "In septo-hippocampal cell cultures, brief potassium depolarization produces calcium-dependent decreases in neurofilament proteins and loss of fine neuritic processes within 24 h. It is not known whether neurons later exhibit delayed degeneration and die, live with enduring neurofilament loss, or restore neurofilament protein levels. Therefore, we exposed septohippocampal cultures to 6 min potassium depolarization (60 mM) with 2.8-11.8 mM extracellular Ca2+ and evaluated immunoreactivity for low, medium and heavy neurofilament proteins, neuronal number, and neuronal morphology for 10 days. Neuronal number remained unchanged; neurofilament protein levels recovered to between 31% and 99% of control levels, and fine neuritic processes reappeared.",
