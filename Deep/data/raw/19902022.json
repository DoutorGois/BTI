     "AB": "The standardised Ginkgo biloba extract EGb761 is known for its potential beneficial effects in the prevention and therapy of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms and the specific role of its constituents are largely unknown. The aim of the present feeding trial was to investigate the effects of EGb761 and its major constituents on the expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in the pathogenesis of AD in mouse brain. Six month old C57B6 mice were fed semi synthetic diets enriched with either EGb761 or one of its main fractions, flavonols and terpenelactones, respectively, over a period of 4 weeks. Thereafter, mRNA of alpha-secretase, neprilysin, amyloid precursor protein (App), App binding protein-1 and acetylcholine esterase was quantified in hippocampus and cortex. EGb761 and its flavonol fraction had no effects on relative mRNA levels of the respective genes in mouse brain. However, the terpenelactone fraction significantly decreased the mRNA levels of App in the hippocampus. Taken together, a 4 week dietary treatment with EGb761 or its main fractions had only moderate effects on mRNA levels of AD related genes in cortex and hippocampus of mice.",
