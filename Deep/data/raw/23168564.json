     "AB": "In this study, we have shown the feasibility of hollow manganese oxide nanoparticles (HMON) conjugated with an antibody of Abeta1-40 peptide (abAbeta40) (HMON-abAbeta40) for MRI of amyloid plaques in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. MR brain images in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and their nontransgenic littermates were acquired using a 7.0 T MRI system before, and 24 and 72 h after an injection of HMON-abAbeta40. After the injection of HMON-abAbeta40, we found hyperenhanced spots in the frontal cortex area on T1-weighted MR images for transgenic mice, which corresponded qualitatively to amyloid plaques detected by thioflavin-S staining. For quantitative analysis, percent MR signal changes in six brain regions (olfactory cortex, frontal cortex, cerebral cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex) were compared between transgenic and wild-type mice. We found significant increases in the percent MR signal changes in the olfactory cortex, frontal cortex, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus, but there were no significant differences in the thalamus and cerebellar cortex for transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice. This unique strategy allowed us to detect brain regions subjected to amyloid plaque deposition in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mouse models and has a potential to be developed for human applications, which has a current utility in preclinical research, particularly in monitoring therapeutic response for drug development in Alzheimer's disease.",
