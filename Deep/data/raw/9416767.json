     "AB": "The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of caffeine and the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam, and a combination of both on beta-endorphin (beta-EN) levels in specific rat brain regions. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-200 g) adapted to a 12-hour light: 12-hour dark illumination cycle were used in this study. Caffeine (10 mg/kg), diazepam (2 mg/kg) or a combination of caffeine (10 mg/kg) and diazepam (2 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally to rats at 11:00 hr. Control animals were injected with saline. Animals were sacrificed by decapitation 1 h after injection, the brains were immediately removed; the cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and midbrain were dissected and their B-EN levels measured by radioimmunoassay. Caffeine administration significantly increased B-EN levels in the cortex. Similarly, administration of diazepam alone resulted in a significant increase of B-EN levels in cortex. However, concurrent administration of diazepam and caffeine resulted in higher increase of B-EN levels in cortex. No significant changes in B-EN levels were detected in hippocampus and midbrain after administration of either caffeine or diazepam alone. On the other hand, when diazepam and caffeine were concurrently administered a significant increase of B-EN levels were observed in the midbrain. Moreover, administration of diazepam alone resulted in a significant increase of B-EN levels in hypothalamus. This increase was still observed following concurrent administration of diazepam and caffeine. These results clearly indicate that diazepam alters caffeine-induced effects on B-EN in specific rat brain regions.",
