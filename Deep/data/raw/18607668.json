     "AB": "Junctophilins (JPs) contribute to the formation of junctional membrane complexes between the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum, and provide a structural platform for channel communication during excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells. In the brain, two neuronal JP subtypes are widely expressed in neurons. Recent studies have defined the essential role of neural JPs in the communication between cell-surface and intracellular channels, which modulates the excitability and synaptic plasticity of neurons in the cerebellum and hippocampus.",
