     "AB": "The effect of undernutrition on the activity of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAc) (markers for the GABA-ergic and the cholinergic transmitter system, respectively) was studied in various parts of the rat brain at the age of 10, 15 and 21 days, and at day 54 following 33 days of rehabilitation. The brain regions investigated were the olfactory bulbs, cerebellum, pons-medulla, hypothalamus, colliculi, cerebral cortex hippocampus and the residual brain. Undernutrition resulted in a marked retardation of the developmental rise of the activities of both enzymes, expressed in terms of either total brain part or unit weight or protein. The effect diminished with age even during the period of nutritional deprivation. In most brain regions the enzyme activities were restored to normal after rehabilitation. In the cerebral cortex the total activity of both enzymes was persistently reduced, although the concentration of GAD exceeded the control levels. A negative correlation was manifested between the activities of GAD and ChAc in the different brain parts (except the cerebellum) during development. The correlation became significant by day 21 in the controls, but only after postweaning rehabilitation of the undernourished rats. The results showed therefore that undernutrition caused a reversible retardation in the development of these two transmitter enzymes, and they suggested that even the balance of the GABA-ergic and cholinergic systems throughout the brain can be restored to normal by rehabilitation.",
