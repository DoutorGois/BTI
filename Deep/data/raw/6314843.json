     "AB": "A method for the determination of cholecystokinins in biological material, based on high-pressure liquid chromatography with direct electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC), is described. Using this method, the levels of cholecystokinin tetrapeptide and octapeptide sulfate in rat brain cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and brain stem were measured and found to be comparable to those reported using radioimmunoassay methods. We show that HPLC-EC is sensitive enough to accurately determine neuropeptides in brain tissue without prior derivatization and is therefore, due to its simplicity, an attractive alternative to existing methods.",
