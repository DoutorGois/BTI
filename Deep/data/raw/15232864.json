     "AB": "The aim of this work was the comparative cytochemical study of some parameters of neurotransmitter and protein metabolism in the hippocampus (CA3 field) of August and Wistar rats, which were used as genetic-functional models demonstrating different brain organization, in particular, in respect to an emotional stress. Using quantitative cytochemical methods it was demonstrated that the activities of aminopeptidase, monoaminooxidase (substrates--tryptamine and serotonin), and glutamate dehydrogenase, were lower in the hippocampus of August rats (predisposed to emotional stress) as compared to that one in Wistar rats (resistant to emotional stress). August rats were also characterized by smaller sizes of neuronal cytoplasm and nuclei and by their lower protein content and concentration. The analysis of the data obtained has shown the existence of neurons with different modalities within the limits of CA3 hippocampal field, and these characteristics are thought to define the morphochemical differences in the hippocampus (CA3 field) of genetically different rats.",
