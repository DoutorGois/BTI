     "AB": "Axon sprouting typically occurs in a brain region that has been partially denervated. The present study demonstrates, quantitatively, evidence for sprouting outside the region of deafferentation. A modification of the Timm sulfide silver histochemical method was used to monitor an increase in the mossy fiber terminal field in the fascia dentata of adult rats following severe deafferentation of the outer three-fourths of stratum moleculare by unilateral entorhinal lesions. Computer-assisted image processing techniques were used to quantify mossy fiber sprouting. In stratum granulosum, and to a lesser extent in the deep (supragranular) portion of stratum moleculare (areas separated from the zone of deafferentation), there was a three-fold increase in the area of mossy fiber staining on the side of the lesion compared to the non-operated side (and unoperated animals). Much of the increased staining was located near the tip of the infrapyramidal (ventral) blade of the fascia dentata. Since mossy fiber sprouting apparently occurs in the absence of degeneration-produced synaptic dilution in that region, it may represent an example of post-lesion growth initiated by conditions fundamentally different from those normally believed to induce sprouting.",
