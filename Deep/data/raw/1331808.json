     "AB": "The quantal hypothesis proposes that chemical synaptic transmission involves the probabilistic release of multimolecular packets of transmitter. Analysis of the resulting trial-to-trial fluctuations in postsynaptic response can provide estimates both of the number of quanta released and of the size of their postsynaptic effect. This in turn permits the quantification of the relative contributions of pre- and postsynaptic factors to the strength of a given synapse. Quantal analysis of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus has proved difficult and has led to contradictory conclusions when applied to long-term potentiation. Here we report the use of a combination of quantal analysis procedures to provide evidence that both pre- and postsynaptic changes can contribute substantially to the maintenance of long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The initial setting of the presynaptic release mechanism seems to determine their relative importance.",
