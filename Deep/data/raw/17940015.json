     "AB": "The hippocampus is essential for episodic memory, which requires single-trial learning. Although long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength is a candidate mechanism for learning, it is typically induced by using repeated synaptic activation to produce precisely timed, high-frequency, or rhythmic firing. Here we show that hippocampal synapses potentiate robustly in response to strong activation by a single burst. The induction mechanism of this single-burst LTP requires activation of NMDA receptors, L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, and dendritic spikes. Thus, dendritic spikes are a critical trigger for a form of LTP that is consistent with the function of the hippocampus in episodic memory.",
