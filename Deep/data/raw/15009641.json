     "AB": "In order to reveal the mechanism of herbal glycoside recipes retrieving deficient ability of spatial learning memory in mice suffering from cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, a microarray system was used to analyze gene expression in those groups with increasing ability of spatial learning memory who were different from ischemic mice. In this work, we reported a comprehensive characterization of gene expression profiles of mouse hippocampus by the use of cDNA microarray system containing 1176 known genes in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) ischemic mice after treating with different dosage recipes of glycoside herbs (30, 90, and 270 mg/kg). The ability of spatial learning memory in ischemic mice was found to be decreased. The pathological process in ischemic mouse brain showed that a complex related to 100 genes' expression yielded 1.8-fold. Dose-dependent effects showed an improvement in the deficient ability and reduction in infarct volume when treated with glycoside recipes. Many genes (38-46) in expression were found greater than 1.8-fold in those effective recipes groups, including genes in cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, nerve system transcription factors, DNA binding protein, etc. Nine genes related to retrieving deficient ability of spatial learning memory treated with glycoside recipes were also found in this study. These results suggest that microarray analysis of gene expression might be useful for elucidating the mechanisms of pharmacological function of recipes.",
