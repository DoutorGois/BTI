     "AB": "This experiment determined the effects of transplantation of fetal hippocampus on the ability of male rats with hippocampal lesions to acquire versions of a radial arm maze that depended on either extramaze cues or intramaze cues for solution. Rats receiving transplants took significantly more trials than control rats to emit three consecutive errorless trials in the extramaze cue (spatial) variation of the maze. Rats with just hippocampal lesions never differed from any other group. No differences in this measure were found for the intramaze cue condition. Rats receiving transplants made more repeat entries into reinforced arms in both versions of the maze than control rats and more reentries into neverbaited arms in the spatial maze. Rats with hippocampal lesions failed to differ from any other group on this measure in the spatial maze, but were different from normal rats in the intramaze cue maze. These data suggest that in some tasks transplants of fetal tissue lead to greater behavioral impairment than lesions alone.",
