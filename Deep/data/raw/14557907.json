     "AB": "The principal glucocorticoid in rats, corticosterone, interacts with neurons in the limbic system and leads to morphological and behavioral changes. Putative corticosterone-triggered mediators are neurotrophins. In the present study we investigated the effects of early postnatal corticosterone treatment in rats on neurotrophic factors of the nerve growth factor (NGF) family and their receptors. Newborn rats were treated with corticosterone-containing polymers until postnatal day 12. The mRNA and protein levels of the neurotrophins of the NGF family (NGF, BDNF, NT-3 and NT-4/5) and their receptors (trkA, trkB, trkC and p75) were quantified in septum and hippocampus using RT-PCR. In the septal region, we found an unchanged mRNA expression after corticosterone treatment, whereas in the hippocampus there was a general increase in mRNA. Particularly, the gene expression of NGF, NT-3, and the high affinity receptors trkA, trkB and trkC increased significantly. Quantification of the neurotrophin protein levels using an ELISA revealed significant treatment effects for NGF and NT-4/5 in the hippocampus. The present study of corticosterone treatment in young rats demonstrates interactions of steroid hormones with neurotrophic factors and their receptors in the septo-hippocampal system during the first two postnatal weeks.",
