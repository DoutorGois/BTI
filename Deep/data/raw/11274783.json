     "AB": "Estrogens can influence the survival, plasticity and function of many adult neurons. Many of these effects, such as neurite outgrowth and increased dendritic spine density, are mediated by changes in neuronal cytoskeletal architecture. Since neurofilament proteins play a key role in the maintenance and remodeling of the neuronal cytoskeleton, we postulated that changes in neurofilament light chain mRNA may parallel some of the alterations in neuronal architecture which follow bilateral ovariectomy. We measured neurofilament light chain mRNA levels using a ribonuclease protection assay at two time-points after ovariectomy in mature female rats. One week after ovariectomy, neurofilament light chain mRNA levels (corrected for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA) did not differ from sham-operated animals in the five brain regions examined (hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus, frontal cortex and occipital cortex). Four months after ovariectomy, neurofilament light chain mRNA levels were similarly unchanged in the hypothalamus and striatum. In contrast, statistically significant increases in neurofilament light chain mRNA expression were observed in the three regions receiving basal forebrain projections (hippocampus, frontal cortex and occipital cortex). In situ hybridization demonstrated increases in neurofilament light chain mRNA expression involving subpopulations of smaller medial septal neurons. There also appeared to be an increased number of larger septal neurons following long-term ovariectomy. We propose that atrophic changes involving basal forebrain projection fibers are followed by compensatory axonal growth by other 'intact' basal forebrain neurons. Increased neurofilament light chain mRNA expression and somatic hypertrophy in medial septal neurons may both be reflective of the need to sustain an axonal network which is larger and more complex. In contrast, increased neurofilament light chain mRNA expression observed in basal forebrain targets following long-term ovariectomy may be reflective of compensatory changes taking place in local neurons.",
