     "AB": "This study describes the catecholaminergic innervation of rat hippocampal neurons at the electron microscopic level by using an antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and immunocytochemical techniques. In a first series of experiments, the course and distribution as well as the synaptic contacts of TH-immunoreactive fibers were analyzed with the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) method. Next, peroxidase immunostaining of TH fibers was combined with glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) immunostaining, using avidinated ferritin as a second electrondense marker. Our results demonstrate that TH-immunostained terminals establish asymmetric synaptic contacts with spines of pyramidal neurons, and symmetric synaptic contacts with cell bodies and dendritic shafts of ferritin-labeled GAD-immunoreactive nonpyramidal cells.",
