     "AB": "The effect of a lesion of the perforant path (PP) on self-stimulation (SS) of the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) was tested in mice between 8 and 21 days after surgery. The current intensities tested ranged between 0 and 80 microA (peak to peak 100 Hz sine-wave). The PP lesion led to a two-fold increase in SS rates at intensities above 30 microA without affecting the baseline SS rates (0 microA) and SS threshold (30 microA). The lesion also led to a significant increase in LEC after-discharge (AD) threshold and eliminated behavioral convulsions during SS testing. The suppression of AD by i.p. Na phenobarbital injection (10 mg/kg) led to a similar increase in SS rates in sham-lesioned mice; there was no difference in PP-lesioned animals. These results might be interpreted as evidence in favor of an independence of the neuronal processes mediating entorhinal and hippocampal reward-related behaviors.",
