     "AB": "Objective To observe the influence of adrenomedullin (ADM) on neuron apoptosis, infarction volume of brain, and the expression of early growth response 1 (Egr-1) mRNA in ischemia-reperfusion rats. Methods The arteria cerebri media was tied for 2 h to construct the ischemia model. Infarction volume was detected by triphenltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, neuronal apoptosis and necrosis was detected with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick labeling (TUNEL) method, and the Egr-1 mRNA expression was examined by in situ hybridization (ISH). Results Infarction volume after ischemia-reperfusion is (269 +/- 20) mm(3). Infarction volume after injection of ADM through different ways are femoral vein (239 +/- 17) mm(3) (decreased by 11.2%), arteria carotis (214 +/- 14) mm(3) (by 20.4%) and lateral cerebral ventricle (209 +/- 13) mm(3) (by 22.3%), respectively. The results indicate that injecting ADM through arteria carotis and lateral cerebral ventricle is much more effective than it through femoral vein (P < 0.05). The TUNEL-positive cells in cerebral cortex or hippocampus are few in the sham operation group, but much more in the ischemia-reperfusion group. After being supplied with ADM, especially through arteria carotis interna or lateral cerebral ventricle way, the TUNEL-positive cells decreased obviously. Expression of Egr-1 mRNA was low in the cerebral cortex of the sham operation group rats, enhanced in the ischemia and reperfusion group rats, and enhanced markedly after treatment with ADM, especially through arteria carotis interna or lateral cerebral ventricle way (P < 0.01). Conclusion Injection of ADM through different ways could alleviate neural dysfunction, decrease neuron apoptosis and brain infarction volume, and increase the expression of Egr-1 mRNA.",
