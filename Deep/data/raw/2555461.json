     "AB": "Whole-cell voltage-clamp recording techniques were used to investigate the blockade of voltage-dependent K+ channels by phencyclidine (PCP) in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. All recordings were carried out in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1-2 microM) to eliminate Na+ currents. Step depolarization from a holding potential of -40 mV activated a slowly rising, minimally inactivating K+ current (IK). PCP (0.5-1000 microM) caused a reduction in the maximum conductance of IK [IC50(+30 mV), 22 microM] without altering its voltage dependency. The PCP block of IK diminished at depolarized potentials. Analysis according to the scheme of Woodhull (1973) suggested that block occurs via binding to an acceptor site (presumably within the channel pore) that senses 40-50% of the transmembrane electrostatic field. PCP had no effect on the kinetic properties of IK and the block failed to show use dependency, suggesting that PCP may bind to the IK channel via a hydrophobic mechanism not requiring open channels. For comparison, we also investigated the effect of PCP on the transient K+ current, IA, activated by step depolarization following a 200 msec prepulse to -90 mV (20 mM tetraethylammonium was present in the bathing solution to reduce IK). In contrast to the potent blocking action of PCP on IK, the drug only affected IA at high concentrations [IC50(+30 mV), 224 microM]. At concentrations causing substantial block (300-500 microM), PCP produced an acceleration in the IA inactivation rate, and, for brief (5-6 msec) depolarizing steps, the suppression of IA was use dependent. These observations suggest that PCP block of IA requires open channels. PCP reduced inward current responses induced by the excitatory amino acid agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) at substantially lower concentrations than those required for its effects on K+ channels [IC50(-60 mV), 0.45 microM]. The PCP-like dioxadrol stereoisomer dexoxadrol (10 microM) blocked NMDA-evoked inward current responses, while its behaviorally inactive enantiomer levoxadrol did not. Dexoxadrol and levoxadrol also blocked IK in a stereoselective fashion (IC50's, 73 and 260 microM, respectively), whereas the sigma ligands (+)- and (-)-SKF 10,047 and (+)-3-[3-hydroxyphenyl]-N-(1-propyl)piperidine [(+)-3-PPP] had little effect on the current (IC50's, greater than 300-500 microM). We conclude that PCP causes a selective, voltage-dependent block of IK in hippocampal neurons via a PCP- and not a sigma-type acceptor site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
