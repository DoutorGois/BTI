Adjacent structures including hippocampus, septal nuclei, globus pallidus, and thalamus were unaffected. It is hypothesized that trophic molecules or other chemicals are released at the injury site and these induce the c-fos gene in cells throughout the ipsilateral hemisphere. Fos induction might mediate metabolic or plasticity responses to the focal injury.",
