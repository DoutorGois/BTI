     "AB": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats received injections of cocaine (20 mg/kg/dose, IP) every 12 h for 14 days and were sacrificed on the 15th day. The chronic cocaine treatment caused an increase in the levels of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the hippocampus. 5-HIAA levels in the frontal cortex were also increased, but 5-HT levels were unaltered by the chronic cocaine treatment. Similarly, striatal levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA were unchanged by repeated administration of cocaine. Chronic cocaine administration did not alter the density of [3H]8-OH(DPAT), [3H]mesulergine, or [3H]ketanserin binding in the hippocampus, choroid plexus, and frontal cortex, respectively. Furthermore, repeated injection of cocaine did not alter serotonergic-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Thus, repeated administration of cocaine causes region-specific alterations in 5-HT levels but does not change the properties of the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C, or 5-HT2 receptors.",
