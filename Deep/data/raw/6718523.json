     "AB": "In this study, rat hippocampus was lesioned bilaterally after completion of amygdaloid kindling, to examine how hippocampus affects the kindling permanency. The ventral hippocampal lesions of the kindled rats inhibited reappearance of any kindled seizures. The other rats with the same lesions showed the regression of generalized convulsion. These results suggest that hippocampus, especially ventral parts of hippocampus, would have rather facilitatory or maintaining influence on the kindled neural circuits, relating to the catecholaminergic system in rat forebrain.",
