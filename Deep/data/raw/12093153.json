     "AB": "FGF-2 is a potent neurotrophic factor for several populations of CNS neurons and has been shown to protect hippocampal neurons from glutamate-induced cell death in vitro and in vivo. Mechanisms underlying the neurotrophic and protective actions of FGF-2 have been resolved only in part. Using glutamate-treated cultured hippocampal neurons we show that FGF-2 shares its neuroprotective capacity with GDNF. Hippocampal neurons express glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), its receptors c-Ret and the lipid-anchored GDNF family receptor-alpha1 (GFRalpha-1), and the FGF receptor 1 (FGFR I). Neutralizing antibodies to GDNF abolish the neuroprotective effect of FGF-2. In support of the notion that GDNF is required to permit the protective effects of FGF-2 we find that FGF-2 up-regulates GDNF and GFRalpha-1 in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, FGF-2-induced GDNF causes enhanced phosphorylation of c-Ret and the signaling components Akt and Erk. A putative downstream target of FGF-2 and GDNF are bcl-2 gene family members, whose mRNAs are differentially up-regulated by the two factors. Together, these data suggest that GDNF is an important protective factor for glutamate-lesioned hippocampal neurons and an essential mediator of the neuroprotective actions of FGF-2.",
