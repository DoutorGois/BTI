     "AB": "The aim of this study was to characterize the expression profiles at different time points in the PTSD-like syndrome rat hippocampus and perform analyses. PTSD rat models were made as reported by Rau, and we collected the hippocampus at different time points. The lncRNAs at different time points were compared by microarray and listed. We used quantitative real-time PCR to confirm the lncRNA profiling expression data. Bioinformatics analysis was performed on EU056364_P1. Compare with control, a total of 948 lncRNAs and 2514 mRNAs were found (fold-change > 2.0) among the four time points. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis of EU056364_P1 suggested it might be involved in memory development through the target gene Camk2a.This study revealed different lncRNAs expressed at different time points in PTSD and explored the targets of PTSD.",
