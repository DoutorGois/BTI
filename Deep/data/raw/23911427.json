     "AB": "Activation of PKCvarepsilon, an abundant and developmentally regulated PKC isoform in the brain, has been implicated in memory throughout life and across species. Yet, direct evidence for a mechanistic role for PKCvarepsilon in memory is still lacking. Hence, we sought to evaluate this in rats, using short-term treatments with two PKCvarepsilon-selective peptides, the inhibitory varepsilonV1-2 and the activating psivarepsilonRACK, and the novel object recognition task (NORT). Our results show that the PKCvarepsilon-selective activator psivarepsilonRACK, did not have a significant effect on recognition memory. In the short time frames used, however, inhibition of PKCvarepsilon activation with the peptide inhibitor varepsilonV1-2 significantly impaired recognition memory. Moreover, when we addressed at the molecular level the immediate proximal signalling events of PKCvarepsilon activation in acutely dissected rat hippocampi, we found that psivarepsilonRACK increased in a time-dependent manner phosphorylation of MARCKS and activation of Src, Raf, and finally ERK1/2, whereas varepsilonV1-2 inhibited all basal activity of this pathway. Taken together, these findings present the first direct evidence that PKCvarepsilon activation is an essential molecular component of recognition memory and point toward the use of systemically administered PKCvarepsilon-regulating peptides as memory study tools and putative therapeutic agents.",
