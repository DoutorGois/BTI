     "AB": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders in school-aged children. Symptoms consistent with ADHD have been observed in 8-77 % of children with epilepsy. Researchers have been motivated to search for alternative forms of treatment because 30 % of patients with ADHD cannot be treated by psychostimulants. Several studies support the use of a multimodal treatment approach that includes neurofeedback (NF) for the long-term management of ADHD. These studies have shown that NF provides a sustained effect, even without concurrent treatment with stimulants. We aimed to assess cognitive flexibility in ADHD children with and without temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and to evaluate the effects of NF on cognitive flexibility in these groups of children. We prospectively evaluated 69 patients with ADHD aged 9-12 years. The control group was 26 ADHD children without TLE who received no treatment. The first experimental group comprised 18 children with ADHD. The second experimental group comprised 25 age-matched ADHD children with TLE. This group was further divided in two subgroups. One subgroup comprised those with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (16 patients, 9 with hippocampal sclerosis and 7 with hippocampal atrophy), and the other with lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (9 patients, 5 with temporal lobe dysplasia, 3 with temporal lobe cysts, and 1 with a temporal lobe cavernoma). We treated their ADHD by conducting 30 sessions of EEG NF. Reaction time and error rates on the Trail Making Test Part B were compared before and after treatment, and significant differences were found for all groups of patients except those who had mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal atrophy. Our results demonstrate that in most cases, NF can be considered an alternative treatment option for ADHD children even if they have TLE. Additional studies are needed to confirm our results.",
