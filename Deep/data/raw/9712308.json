The factors regulating proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation of neuronal progenitors are now being elucidated. Cells from the adult hippocampus can be propagated, cloned in vitro, and induced to differentiate into neurons and glial cells. Cells cultured from the adult rodent hippocampus can be genetically marked and transplanted back to the adult brain, where they survive and differentiate into mature neurons and glial cells. Although multipotent stem cells exist in the adult rodent dentate gyrus, their biological significance remains elusive.",
