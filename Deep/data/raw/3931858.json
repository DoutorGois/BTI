     "AB": "Acetylcholine metabolism was studied in cats with Gm1 gangliosidosis. Marked increases in acetylcholine synthesis (130% of controls) and K+-stimulated release of ACh (142-165% of controls) were observed in cortical and hippocampal brain slices of diseased cats. Cortical synaptosomes prepared from affected cats had significantly elevated rates of high affinity choline transport (131% of controls). These results indicate that in Gm1 gangliosidosis there is an unique disease-induced activation of cholinergic activity in the nervous system. These changes may result from disease-induced proliferation of functional cholinergic nerve endings and/or altered regulation of acetylcholine metabolism.",
