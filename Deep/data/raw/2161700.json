     "AB": "The neuropeptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is synthesized by discrete populations of hypothalamic neurons which project in different brain regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and amygdala nuclei. The purpose of the present study was to identify the alpha-MSH-immunoreactive species contained in these different structures and to compare the ionic mechanisms underlaying alpha-MSH release at the proximal and distal levels, i.e. within the hypothalamus and amygdala nuclei, respectively. The molecular forms of alpha-MSH-related peptides stored in discrete areas of the brain were characterized by combining high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation and radioimmunoassay detection. In mediobasal and dorsolateral hypothalamic extracts, HPLC analysis confirmed the existence of a major immunoreactive peak which co-eluted with the synthetic des-N alpha-acetyl alpha-MSH standard. In contrast, 3 distinct forms of immunoreactive alpha-MSH, which exhibited the same retention times as synthetic des-, mono- and di-acetyl alpha-MSH, were resolved in amygdala nuclei, hippocampus, cortex and medulla oblongata extracts. The proportions of acetylated alpha-MSH (authentic alpha-MSH plus diacetyl alpha-MSH) contained in these extrahypothalamic structures were, respectively, 78, 80, 60 and 92% of the total alpha-MSH immunoreactivity. In order to compare the ionic mechanisms underlaying alpha-MSH release from hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic tissues, we have investigated in vitro the secretion of alpha-MSH by perifused slices of hypothalamus and amygdala nuclei. High potassium concentrations induced a marked increase of alpha-MSH release from both tissue preparations. However, a higher concentration of KCl was required to obtain maximal stimulation of amygdala nuclei (90 mM) than hypothalamic tissue (50 mM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
