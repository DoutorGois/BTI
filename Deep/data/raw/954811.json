     "AB": "The rate of 3H-acetylcholine (ACh) formation from i.v. injected 3H-choline was studied in the rat hippocampus after various treatments which alter the activity of cholinergic septal hippocampal neurons. Administration of pentobarbital and placement of acute septal lesion reduced the formation of 3H-ACh but did not change 3H-choline content. Chloral hydrate administration reduced the formation of 3H-ACh and also increased 3H-choline content. The chloral hydrate induced increase in 3H-choline occurred also in animals with chronic septal lesions. Electrical stimulation of the septum caused an increase in both 3H-ACh and 3/-choline. Chronic septal lesion caused a reduction in both radioactive and endogenous ACh, but did not affect radioactive or endogenous choline. These findings suggest that there are multiple pools of choline in the brain and that the precursor pool for ACh synthesis is difficult to measure. Overall, the parameter that best correlated with cholinergic activity was the level of 3H-ACh. Possible mechanisms, for this finding are discussed.",
