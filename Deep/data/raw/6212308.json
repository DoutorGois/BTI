     "AB": "Radiation induced (30 Gy) morphological changes of experimental malignant brain tumors, which were produced by chemical carcinogenesis, were investigated by microangiography and correlated with the histological findings in 62 BD-IX-rats. In randomized groups the investigations were performed 2, 3, 6 and 8 weeks after the radiation was finished. Morphologically different reactions could be differentiated: remissions or partial recovery of the tumors, rest or recurrent tumor and uninfluenced tumor growth. The characteristic findings, the reasons for different courses and possible conclusions concerning the radiotherapeutical effect are discussed.",
