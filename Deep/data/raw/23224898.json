     "AB": "The pH milieu of the central and peripheral nervous systems is an important determinant of neuronal excitability, function, and survival. In mammals, neural acid-base homeostasis is coordinately regulated by ion transporters belonging to the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE) and bicarbonate transporter gene families. However, the relative contributions of individual isoforms within the respective families are not fully understood. This report focuses on the NHE family, specifically the plasma membrane-type NHE5 which is preferentially transcribed in brain, but the distribution of the native protein has not been extensively characterized. To this end, we generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes NHE5. In both central (cortex, hippocampus) and peripheral (superior cervical ganglia, SCG) nervous tissue of mice, NHE5 immunostaining was punctate and highly concentrated in the somas and to lesser amounts in the dendrites of neurons. Very little signal was detected in axons. Similarly, in primary cultures of differentiated SCG neurons, NHE5 localized predominantly to vesicles in the somatodendritic compartment, though some immunostaining was also evident in punctate vesicles along the axons. NHE5 was also detected predominantly in intracellular vesicles of cultured SCG glial cells. Dual immunolabeling of SCG neurons showed that NHE5 did not colocalize with markers for early endosomes (EEA1) or synaptic vesicles (synaptophysin), but did partially colocalize with the transferrin receptor, a marker of recycling endosomes. Collectively, these data suggest that NHE5 partitions into a unique vesicular pool in neurons that shares some characteristics of recycling endosomes where it may serve as an important regulated store of functional transporters required to maintain cytoplasmic pH homeostasis.",
