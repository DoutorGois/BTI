     "AB": "It is an open question whether new synapses form during hippocampal LTP. Here, we show that late-phase LTP (L-LTP) is associated with a significant increase in numbers of synaptic puncta identified by synaptophysin and N-cadherin, an adhesion protein involved in synapse formation during development. During potentiation, protein levels of N-cadherin are significantly elevated and N-cadherin dimerization is enhanced. The increases in synaptic number and N-cadherin levels are dependent on cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein synthesis, both of which are also required for L-LTP. Blocking N-cadherin adhesion prevents the induction of L-LTP, but not the early-phase of LTP (E-LTP). Our data suggest that N-cadherin is synthesized during the induction of L-LTP and recruited to newly forming synapses. N-cadherin may play a critical role in L-LTP by holding nascent pre-and postsynaptic membranes in apposition, enabling incipient synapses to acquire function and contribute to potentiation.",
