     "AB": "The distribution of mRNA encoding the inwardly rectifying K+ channel, BIR1 [1] was investigated in rat tissues, and a comparison made with the expression of related genes rcKATP and GIRK1 using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This showed BIR1 to be expressed in all areas of the brain examined, in the eye but not in any other peripheral tissue. This pattern was distinct from rcKATP and GIRK1. Additional in situ hybridisation studies of the central expression of BIR1 demonstrated high levels of BIR1 mRNA in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, taenia tecta and cerebellum and at lower levels in the cortex, habenular nucleus, olfactory bulb, primary olfactory cortex, thalamus, pontine nucleus and amygdaloid nucleus.",
