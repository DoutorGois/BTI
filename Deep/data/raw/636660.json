     "AB": "Influence of electrical stimulation (100 cps., 1.0 ms) of medial parts of dorsal and ventral hippocampus (field CA1), and the lateral parts of dorsal and posterior hippocampus (field CA3) on general behaviour, elaboration of instrumental and manifestation of delayed reactions was studied in chronic experiments on cats. Stimulation of medial parts of dorsal and ventral hippocampus elicited a reaction of orienting reflex type to natural stimuli. Stimulation of lateral parts of dorsal and posterior hippocampus evoked arrest reactions. Medial and lateral parts of hippocampus produced different influences on elaboration of conditioned reflexes. In the first case elaboration was possible, but developed slower, while in the second case the ability to learn during stimulation was completely lost due to development of arrest reaction. Stimulation of different parts of the hippocampus disturbed delayed reactions, reducing the number of correct responses.",
