     "AB": "A number of experimental and theoretical reports have suggested that the ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) wave-generating cells are involved in the generation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and REM sleep dependent cognitive functions. No studies to date have examined anatomical projections from PGO-generating cells to those brain structures involved in REM sleep generation and cognitive functions. In the present study, pontine PGO wave-generating sites were mapped by microinjecting carbachol in 74 sites of the rat brainstem. Those microinjections elicited PGO waves only when made in the dorsal part of the nucleus subcoeruleus of the pons. In six rats, the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was microinjected into the physiologically identified cholinoceptive pontine PGO-generating site to identify brain structures receiving efferent projections from those PGO-generating sites. In all cases, small volume injections of BDA in the cholinoceptive pontine PGO-generating sites resulted in anterograde labeling of fibers and terminals in many regions of the brain. The most important output structures of those PGO-generating cells were the occipital cortex, entorhinal cortex, piriform cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and many other thalamic, hypothalamic, and brainstem nuclei that participate in the generation of REM sleep. These findings provide anatomical evidence for the hypothesis that the PGO-generating cells in the pons could be involved in the generation of REM sleep. Since PGO-generating cells project to the entorhinal cortex, piriform cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, these PGO-generating cells could also be involved in the modulation of cognitive functions.",
