     "AB": "Hippocampal sclerosis is the most frequent pathology encountered in resected tissue obtained from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The main hallmarks of hippocampal sclerosis are neuronal loss and gliosis. Several authors have proposed that an increase in blood vessel density is a further indicator, based on interpretations from staining of markers related to both blood-brain barrier disruption and the formation of new blood vessels. However, previous studies performed in our laboratory using correlative light and electron microscopy revealed that many of these \"blood vessels\" are in fact atrophic vascular structures with a reduced or virtually absent lumen and are often filled with processes of reactive astrocytes. Thus, \"normal\" vasculature within the sclerotic CA1 field is drastically reduced. Since this decrease is consistently observed in the human sclerotic CA1, this feature can be considered another key pathological indicator of hippocampal sclerosis associated with temporal lobe epilepsy.",
