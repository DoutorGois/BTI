     "AB": "In this study the effects of muscarinic antagonists and agonists on M1 muscarinic receptors in the isolated rat superior cervical ganglion and the rat hippocampal slice were investigated. Oxotremorine and APE but not pilocarpine, McN-A-343 or 4-Cl-McN-A-343 induced small M2 muscarinic receptor-mediated hyperpolarizations in the rat superior cervical ganglion. Nevertheless, for all the agonists investigated the pA2 values of the muscarinic antagonists pirenzepine, AF-DX 116 and p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol indicated the presence of only M1 muscarinic receptors in the rat superior cervical ganglion and hippocampal slice. Full agonistic behaviour with respect to depolarization of the rat superior cervical ganglion was observed for pilocarpine, McN-A-343 and 4-Cl-McN-A-343. Oxotremorine and arecaidine propargyl ester were partial agonists in this preparation, with maximal effects of 35 and 46% of the maximum obtained with pilocarpine, respectively. Pilocarpine, oxotremorine and arecaidin propargyl ester displayed full agonistic behaviour on the increase in firing rate of pyramidal cells in rat hippocampal slices. Whereas 4-Cl-McN-A-343 was a partial agonist (maximal effect of 63% of the maximum obtained with pilocarpine), McN-A-343 displayed no agonistic or antagonistic activity in rat hippocampal slices. It remains to be established whether the heterogeneous behaviour of the agonists in both preparations reflects as yet unknown differences in the M1 receptor protein or results from differences in the coupling of receptor to second messenger.",
