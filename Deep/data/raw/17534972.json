     "AB": "The study of the intracellular mechanics that underlay changes in synaptic efficacy is a rapidly evolving field of research. It is currently believed that NMDA receptors play a significant role in the induction of synaptic plasticity, whereas AMPA receptors play a significant role in its expression. For AMPA receptors, it has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of the GluR2 carboxyl termini is required for the expression of long-term depression of synaptic efficacy (LTD) in vitro (Ahmadian et al. (2004) EMBO J 23:1040-1050). In the present study, we sought to determine whether similar mechanisms are involved in vivo, where different stimulation parameters are required for the induction of LTD. We initially used a paired-burst (PB) paradigm that reliably induces LTD in vivo. In these animals we were able to prevent the induction and expression of PB-LTD by administering a peptide (GluR-3Y) that acted as a competitive inhibitor of tyrosine phosphorylation. In a separate set of animals, we exposed animals to brief periods of stress (S) before using low-frequency stimuli to induce LTD (S-LTD). Again, GluR2-3Y blocked both the induction and expression of S-LTD. In contrast, an inert version of the peptide, with alanine replacing the three tyrosine residues, did not inhibit LTD induction. In addition, we demonstrated that GluR2-3Y did not affect the induction of long-term potentiation in vivo. These findings support the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation and AMPA receptor endocytosis are necessary steps for the induction and maintenance of two forms of LTD in the CA1 region.",
