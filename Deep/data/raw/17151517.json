     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Trichloroethylene (TCE) is extensively used as a degreasing agent in the metal industry and as a solvent for organic compounds. Its neurotoxicity (with respect to both the peripheral and central nervous systems) is now widely acknowledged. OBSERVATION: Here, we report the case of a 32-year-old male drug addict presenting temporal seizures after \"huffing\" TCE (i.e. voluntary inhalation). The patient also deve loped a \"psycho-organic syndrome\" which included cognitive dysfunction (with memory disorders in particular) and personality changes. These disorders had not been noticed by the patient's wife prior to the last episode of inhalation. Four months later, the cognitive disorders had stabilized and no further seizures had been observed. CONCLUSION: The patient's overall clinical picture (notably featuring neuropsychological disorders) and electroencephalographic and brain imaging data argue in favor of a selective effect of TCE on the temporal lobe.",
