     "AB": "The mas proto-oncogene encodes a seven membrane-spanning G-protein-coupled receptor which is activated by angiotensins. In the postnatal and adult rat, mas mRNA is specifically expressed at high levels in hippocampal neurons. We report here using in situ hybridization and RNase protection that brief seizure episodes lead to a significant and transient increase in mas mRNA in the hippocampus. Increased levels of mas transcripts were detected 2, 4, and 6 h following seizure. By 24 h post seizure, baseline levels were detected. The presumed subsequent increase of the mas receptor protein may contribute to anatomical and physiological plasticity that is associated with intense activation of hippocampal pathways.",
