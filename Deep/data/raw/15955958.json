     "AB": "Thirty patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized to 500 or 2,000 mg of methylprednisolone (MP) over 5 days. They were prospectively studied neuropsychologically before and at days 6 and 60 after onset of the therapy, using a double-blind study design. Patients showed selective deterioration of declarative memory retrieval at day 6, which was fully reversible at day 60. Although the sample size was small, these effects were independent of the administered MP dose.",
