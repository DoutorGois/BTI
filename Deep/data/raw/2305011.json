     "AB": "The effect of diazepam on spontaneous and tail-pinch-induced behaviour was monitored together with the measurement of extracellular ascorbate using constant potential voltammetry with carbon paste electrodes. Diazepam (3 mg/kg) was followed by eating during the 1st hour after administration in non-food-deprived rats and a reduction in the behaviour triggered by a mild tail-pinch 90 min after drug administration. There was no change in ascorbate concentration in parallel with the spontaneous eating; however, the brisk increase in ascorbate concentration in striatum, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus, which accompanies the tail-pinch, was decreased in size and duration after diazepam. This effect was blocked by the central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro15 1788 (5 mg/kg).",
