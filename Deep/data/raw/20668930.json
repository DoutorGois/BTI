     "AB": "Organotellurium compounds have been synthesized since 1840, but pharmacological and toxicological studies about them are still incipient. Therefore, the objective of this study was to verify the effect of acute administration of the organochalcogen 3-butyl-1-phenyl-2-(phenyltelluro)oct-en-1-one on some parameters of oxidative stress in the brain of 30-day-old rats. Animals were treated intraperitoneally with a single dose of the organotellurium (125, 250, or 500 mug/kg body weight) and sacrificed 60 min after the injection. The cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum were dissected and homogenized in KCl. Afterward, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), carbonyl, sulfhydryl, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide (NO) formation, and hydroxyl radical production were measured in the brain. The organotellurium enhanced TBARS in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, and increased protein damage (carbonyl) in the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. In contrast, the compound provoked a reduced loss of thiol groups measured by the sulfhydryl assay in all the tissues studied. Furthermore, the activity of the antioxidant enzyme CAT was reduced by the organochalcogen in the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum, and the activity of SOD was inhibited in all the brain tissues. Moreover, NO production was increased in the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum by this organochalcogen, and hydroxyl radical formation was also enhanced in the cerebral cortex. Our findings indicate that this organotellurium compound induces oxidative stress in the brain of rats, corroborating that this tissue is a potential target for organochalcogen action.",
