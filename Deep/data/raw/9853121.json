     "AB": "Systemic administration of pilocarpine, which results in status epilepticus followed by recurrent seizures in rats, is a widely used experimental model of chronic limbic epilepsy. Marked structural alterations have been documented in pilocarpine-induced epilepsy, and these include cell loss in the hippocampus and other brain areas, and sprouting of mossy and cholinergic fibers in the hippocampus. Evidence is accumulating that neurotrophins and neurotrophin receptors are involved in the cascade of these events. Two and 4 months after pilocarpine-induced epilepsy, neurons containing the 75-kDa low affinity neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) were investigated with immunohistochemistry in the medial septal and diagonal band nuclei. No significant differences in the distribution and number of immunoreactive neurons were found in the epileptic rats compared to control saline-treated animals. However, in the epileptic animals, a significant decrease in the perikaryal size of p75NTR-immunoreactive neurons of the septal/diagonal band region was found by 60 days, and such atrophic changes were more marked in the diagonal band nuclei by 120 days. These findings indicate that the p75NTR-containing cell bodies, which include the neurons projecting to the hippocampal formation and are cholinergic in the normal brain, survive after months of spontaneous recurrent seizures, during which, therefore, a supply of p75NTR to target regions is maintained in the chronic epileptic brain. However, the present data point out that these p75NTR-containing neurons undergo a significant shrinkage in pilocarpine-induced chronic epilepsy, thus indicating that they are involved in the brain pathology of temporal lobe epilepsy.",
