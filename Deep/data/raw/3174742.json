     "AB": "Hippocampal rhythmic slow activity (RSA) was recorded during rotation and vibration stimulation after saline and ethanol (2 g/kg) administration in restrained alcohol-sensitive (ANT) and alcohol-insensitive (AT) rats implanted with chronic bipolar electrodes in the dorsal hippocampus. The saline-treated ANT rats had more high-frequency RSA than the AT rats, especially during the rotational stimulation of the optovestibular mechanisms. The difference was not found during ethanol sessions. Plasma corticosterone levels were significantly higher in the AT than the ANT rats after the recording sessions. This first electrophysiological demonstration of an alcohol-sensitivity difference in the brain between these rat lines is discussed in relation to behavioral tilting plane test used in the development of the lines, to the different innate responses of the lines to acute stress, and to the plausible line differences in brain GABAergic and serotonergic mechanisms that are known to modulate hippocampal EEG in rodents.",
