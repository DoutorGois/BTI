     "AB": "Neurons expressing the tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) mRNA within the raphe nuclei of control rats showed a distribution similar to that observed using an antibody for TPH. Numerous packed cells expressing the TPH mRNA were observed in the ventral and dorsal zone of the nucleus raphe dorsalis (NDR) and in the pars dorsalis of the nucleus centralis superior (NCS) whereas fewer and more scattered neurons were found in the pars medialis of NCS. Five days after the intracerebroventricular injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), which markedly reduced the serotonin (5-HT) content in the hippocampus, caudate putamen and cortex, the hybridization signal had completely disappeared in the dorsal region of the NDR. In the ventromedial region, above and between the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), which includes the pars dorsalis of NCS, there was a partial decrease of cell number and a marked increase of the grain density over spared neurons. No significant change was noted in the number of TPH-positive cells and hybridization signal in individual neurons of the pars medialis of NCS. Consistent with previous evidence of increased TPH activity in the residual 5-HT terminals, the present study shows that synthesis of the TPH mRNA may be augmented in some neurons surviving the lesion.",
