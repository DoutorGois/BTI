The anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold (FG) were simultaneously injected into the lateral septum. After double-immunocytochemistry, PHA-L-labeled terminals were found in synaptic contact with dendrites of retrogradely FG-labeled neurons in the lateral hypothalamic/lateral preoptic area.",
