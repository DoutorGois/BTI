     "AB": "CONTEXT: Platonia insignis Mart. (Clusiaceae), commonly known as \"bacuri,\" is a timber and fruit native species of the Brazilian Amazon. Some plants of the Clusiaceae family have their pharmacological properties associated with the presence of xanthone and polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols derivatives, which have antioxidant and anticarcinogenic activities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the in vivo potential of extracts, fractions, and garcinielliptone FC isolated from of Platonia insignis seeds as a natural antioxidant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats (250-280 g; 2 months old) were treated with Tween 80 0.05% dissolved in 0.9% saline (i.p, vehicle - control group), ethanol extract (EE), hexane extract (HE), dichloromethane fraction (DMF), ethyl acetate fraction (EAF), and garcinielliptone FC (GFC) isolated from P. insignis at doses 2 mg/kg (i.p.). All groups were observed for 24 h after the treatment. The antioxidant enzymatic activities [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)] were measured using spectrophotometric methods. RESULTS: There were no marked alterations in SOD and CAT activities in rat hippocampus after pretreatment with EE, HE, DMF, EAF, and GFC. However, the pretreatment with GFC induced a significantly increase of 13, 17, 19, and 13% in SOD activities when compared to EE, HE, DMF, or EAF groups, respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that GFC isolated from P. insignis has a significant potential to be used as a natural antioxidant agent probably due to the modulation of enzymatic activity of hippocampal SOD.",
