     "AB": "The administration of aluminum (Al) to uremic rats leads to Al accumulation in different brain regions with subsequent alteration of brain gangliosides. Addition of 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3[24R,25-(OH)2D3] did not influence the brain Al content determined by plasma argon emission spectrometry, but prevented the decrease in brain gangliosides. By using electron microscopy and laser microprobe mass analysis, it was demonstrated that in rats given 24R,25-(OH)2D3 together with Al, the metal was mainly kept within perivascular astrocytes of the blood-brain barrier. On the contrary, in rats given Al only, the metal was evenly distributed throughout the brain areas causing extensive demyelination, chromatolysis of nerve cells in some brain regions (hippocampus) and brain edema. Our results could find application in the prevention of Al-induced encephalopathy in patients on hemodialysis.",
