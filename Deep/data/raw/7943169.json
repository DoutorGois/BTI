     "AB": "We examined the brains of 37 leprosy patients (mean age, 76.3 +/- 7.8 years), 5 patients with Alzheimer-type dementia (mean age, 79.0 +/- 9.5 years), and 23 age-matched non-dementia controls (mean age, 77.6 +/- 5.4 years). The frequency of beta-amyloid (A beta)-positive cases was lower (27.0%) in leprosy patients (n = 37) than in controls (47.8%; P = 0.05, Z = 1.49). When senile plaque subtypes were examined, type III (classical) plaques were significantly fewer (P < 0.05) in leprosy subjects compared with controls. Interestingly, neurofibrillary tangles in the temporal cortex were much more frequent in leprosy patients than in controls (P < 0.05). However, hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons in leprosy patients were well preserved. These data indicate that 1) leprosy patients have a low risk of A beta deposition but a high risk of abnormal tau deposition, 2) abnormal tau deposition is unrelated to A beta deposition in leprosy, and 3) neuronal loss is unrelated to abnormal tau deposition. It is not clear at present whether the result is related to the disease process itself, antileprosy treatment, environmental factors, or the genetic background in leprosy patients.",
