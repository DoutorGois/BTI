     "AB": "The gamma-secretase complex, a membrane-bound aspartyl protease, hydrolyzes the transmembrane domains of several integral membrane proteins including the key signaling molecules amyloid precursor protein (APP), Notch, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), and N- and E-cadherins. The proteolysis processing of these proteins is critical for generation of signaling molecules that may participate in neuronal communication and plasticity. Using a potent gamma-secretase inhibitor, L-685,458, we examined if blockade of its activity in the hippocampus can influence contextual and spatial memory in rats. Surprisingly, we observed that post-training blockade of gamma-secretase activity leads to enhanced long-term memory in two hippocampus-dependent tasks. This suggests that a signaling molecule(s) generated by gamma-secretase activity may have a negative influence on long-term memory formation.",
