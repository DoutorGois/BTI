     "AB": "Rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurones were monosynaptically activated via stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway. On changing from a 1 mM Mg2+-containing to a Mg2+-free medium there was a pronounced prolongation of the intracellularly recorded excitatory postsynaptic potential. This effect was reversibly abolished by the selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV). We propose that Mg2+ normally prevents expression of NMDA receptor-mediated responses during low-frequency stimulation. During a period of tetanic stimulation, however, cells may depolarize sufficiently to allow a significant NMDA component of the response to be manifest. This could then initiate long-term potentiation.",
