     "AB": "The activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) after a learning experience is a common feature in the formation of several associative memories. We recently demonstrated that the increase in the hippocampal phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels 1 h after a short exploration of an open field (OF) was associated to detection of spatial novelty and was not related to the memory formation of habituation in this non-associative learning paradigm. Moreover, after a long training of three OF sessions, hippocampal pCREB levels were below to that observed in control rats. The present results show that such decrease does not correlate with memory retrieval or improvement in long-term memory of habituation. Instead, it is associated with the familiarity to the arena. Our experiments revealed that the relevant variable to induce CREB deactivation was the prolonged exploration of the arena (30 min). A 15 min OF exploration was ineffective. Furthermore, the last 5 min period of a prolonged exploration was crucial to change CREB phosphorylation state: when exploration took place in a novel arena the level of pCREB increased; in contrast, when it was performed in the familiar OF, pCREB levels decreased. Taken as a whole, our results suggest that CREB phosphorylation state in the hippocampus switches in response to exposure to a novel or to a familiar spatial environment.",
