     "AB": "We studied messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of receptors for glucocorticoid (GR), thyroid hormone (TR), androgen (AR), and estrogen (ER) and their changes with age in the hippocampal subregions in postmortem human brain. In situ hybridization was done with biotin-labeled antisense synthetic oligonucleotide probes. About 80% or more of the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal subregions expressed mRNAs for individual receptors in the brains of subjects younger than 65. The ratio of mRNA-containing neuron density to total neuron density significantly decreased with age for GR in CA1 and CA3, and for AR in CA1. Non-significant trends in the reduction with age in the ratio of ER mRNA-containing neurons in CA1 and the ratio of GR mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus also were found. Age-related reductions in nuclear receptor protein mRNA expression in neurons in the hippocampal subfields may be important in the impairments of cognition, emotion, and responses to acute stress in the aged.",
