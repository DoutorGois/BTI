     "AB": "BACKGROUND: A recent genome-wide association study linked a common variant in RELN (rs7341475G) with risk for schizophrenia in women. In the largest neuroimaging intermediate phenotype study reported so far, we evaluated the effect of rs7341475 on an extended array of different neuroscientific measures. METHODS: Brain structure was evaluated with voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging. Brain function during working memory was examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging. The RELN expression was determined in postmortem brain tissue of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. A total of 736 datasets were examined (voxel-based morphometry: n = 230, diffusion tensor imaging: n = 93, functional magnetic resonance imaging: n = 308, RELN expression: n = 105). RESULTS: Our analyses did not provide evidence for a significant main effect of gene or gene x sex interaction effect on any of the examined measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not suggest a significant impact of rs7341475 on brain structure, function, and RELN expression, arguing that this single nucleotide polymorphism and others linked with it do not affect brain measures related to the biology of schizophrenia.",
