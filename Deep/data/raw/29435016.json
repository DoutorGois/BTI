     "AB": "Impairment of neurogenesis in the hippocampus following whole-brain irradiation is the most important mechanism of radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanism remains obscure, meaning an ideal therapeutic target has not been identified. Evidence indicates that DNA methylation in neurons regulates synaptic plasticity and neuronal network activity. In the present study, the expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the hippocampus was analyzed to investigate their potential function in radiation-induced neurogenesis impairment. Sprague-Dawley rats were used throughout the present study, apportioned to the following groups: Control, radiation only, zebularine (a DNMT inhibitor) only, and radiation and zebularine together. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that radiation inhibited cellular proliferation and dendritic growth within new neurons of the hippocampus. In addition, western blot analysis demonstrated lower expression levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3A protein following radiation treatment compared with that in the non-irradiated control. Furthermore, compared with the radiation-only group, the radiation and zebularine group had significantly lower cell proliferative abilities, dendritic growth, and DNMT1 and DNMT3A protein levels. The results of the present study indicated that DNMT1 and DNMT3A may be involved in the pathogenesis of whole-brain radiation-induced neurogenesis impairment.",
