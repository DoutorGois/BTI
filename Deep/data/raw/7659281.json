     "AB": "The effect of cold water stress (CWS) on the phosphorylation of tau proteins in rat brain was studied using monoclonal antibodies to phosphorylated (PHF-1) and non-phosphorylated (TAU-1) epitopes. CWS induced an immediate 2-3-fold increase of PHF-1 signal in the soluble fraction of rat brain cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. A maximal 3-4-fold increase occurred in 30-90 min. The soluble TAU-1 signal decreased following the CWS and at 60 min became significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in the control. Both signals returned to the normal range within 3 h. CWS induced a similar increase in PHF-1 signal in adrenalectomized animals and in animals subchronically treated with cortisone. These data indicate that stress induces rapid phosphorylation of soluble rat brain tau without direct involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.",
