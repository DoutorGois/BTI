     "AB": "Dysfunction and loss of synapses are early pathogenic events in Alzheimer's disease. A central step in the generation of toxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1). Here, we have elucidated whether downregulation of septin (SEPT) protein family members, which are implicated in synaptic plasticity and vesicular trafficking, affects APP processing and Abeta generation. SEPT8 was found to reduce soluble APPbeta and Abeta levels in neuronal cells through a post-translational mechanism leading to decreased levels of BACE1 protein. In the human temporal cortex, we identified alterations in the expression of specific SEPT8 transcript variants in a manner that correlated with Alzheimer's-disease-related neurofibrillary pathology. These changes were associated with altered beta-secretase activity. We also discovered that the overexpression of a specific Alzheimer's-disease-associated SEPT8 transcript variant increased the levels of BACE1 and Abeta peptides in neuronal cells. These changes were related to an increased half-life of BACE1 and the localization of BACE1 in recycling endosomes. These data suggest that SEPT8 modulates beta-amyloidogenic processing of APP through a mechanism affecting the intracellular sorting and accumulation of BACE1.",
