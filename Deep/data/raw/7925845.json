     "AB": "Long-term cultures of brain slices were used to test if the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine induces beta-amyloid-related peptides in hippocampus and if such effects are accompanied by other manifestations of brain aging. Chloroquine administration resulted in the appearance of a carboxyl-terminal fragment of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP); the 27-kDa antigen was detectable after 24 h, increased rapidly for 6-10 days, and was eliminated upon drug washout. Immunocytochemical analyses showed that beta-amyloid immunoreactivity accumulated in the perikarya of pyramidal neurons, primarily in the form of punctate bodies. These effects were accompanied by a correlated loss (and recovery) of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin and by a delayed reduction of postsynaptic glutamate receptors, while cytoskeletal proteins were unchanged. Acute administration of chloroquine had no evident effects on synaptic responses but prolonged applications caused a decrease in the maximum amplitude of field potentials. Finally, a brief pretreatment with the excitotoxin kainic acid had little effect with regard to APP fragments or synaptophysin, but altered the events following from a subsequent infusion of chloroquine. Buildup of the 27-kDa APP fragment and loss of synaptophysin were more rapid and, more importantly, did not reverse upon washout of chloroquine. These findings indicate that lysosomal dysfunction in hippocampus results in the accumulation of a particular APP fragment and suggest that this event, or a variable correlated with it, is linked to the loss of synaptic proteins. They also raise the possibility that certain aspects of brain aging reflect a synergism between lysosomal disturbances and excitotoxicity.",
