     "AB": "Substance P (SP), a member of the tachykinin family, is widely distributed in the central nervous system and is involved in a variety of physiological processes including cardiovascular function, inflammatory responses, and nociception. We show here that intrahippocampal administration of SP triggers self-sustaining status epilepticus (SSSE) in response to stimulation of the perforant path for periods too brief to have any effect in control rats, and this SSSE generates a pattern of acute hippocampal damage resembling that known to occur in human epilepsy. The SP receptor (SPR) antagonists, spantide II and RP-67,580, block both the initiation of SSSE and SSSE-induced hippocampal damage and terminate established anticonvulsant-resistant SSSE. SSSE results in a rapid and dramatic increase in the expression of preprotachykinin A (a precursor of SP) mRNA and SP in principal neurons in CA3, CA1, and the dentate gyrus as well as in hippocampal mossy fibers. SP also increases glutamate release from hippocampal slices. Enhanced expression of SP during SSSE may modulate hippocampal excitability and contribute to the maintenance of SSSE. Thus, SPR antagonists may constitute a novel category of drugs in antiepileptic therapy.",
