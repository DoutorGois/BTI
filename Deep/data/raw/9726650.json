     "AB": "Flesinoxan acts as a full 5-HT1A receptor agonist and displays anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties. 5-HT1A receptor agonists, including flesinoxan, increase corticosterone (B) levels in the blood and reduces 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampus. In this study, we examined whether the 5-HT1A receptor downregulation induced by flesinoxan involves corticosterone control of 5-HT1A receptor gene transcription. In experiment I, intact male Wistar rats (180-200 g) were treated with flesinoxan (1.0, 3.0 and 10 mg/kg bw, sc) or vehicle and decapitated 3 h later. Flesinoxan administration resulted in a significant, dose-dependent downregulation of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA in the dentate gyrus and dorsal raphe nucleus. In experiment II, rats were sham-operated and implanted with a cholesterol pellet (100 mg) or were adrenalectomized and implanted with a corticosterone pellet (20 mg corticosterone + 80 mg cholesterol). Flesinoxan injection also caused a dose-dependent decrease of 5-HT1A mRNA in the dentate gyrus of adrenalectomized animals with corticosterone replacement. There was no effect in the dorsal raphe nucleus. In experiment III, adrenalectomized and adrenalectomized + corticosterone rats were sc injected with flesinoxan (10 mg/kg bw) or vehicle, and flesinoxan appeared to downregulate 5-HT1A receptor expression in the dentate gyrus independently of corticosterone as well. No significant effects were observed in the dorsal raphe nucleus. It is concluded that flesinoxan reduces 5-HT1A receptor expression in the dentate gyrus both through homologous downregulation and a corticosterone-mediated effect on the serotonergic (5-HT) system.",
