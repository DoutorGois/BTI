     "AB": "Changes in the mRNA encoding alpha1, alpha2, beta2 and gamma2 subunits of the GABAA receptor associated with the anxiolytic effects of alprazolam were measured in 20 brain regions using in situ hybridization techniques. Compared to non-punished controls, punishment decreased alpha1 mRNA levels in two nuclei of the amygdala, the cerebral cortex, and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and decreased alpha2 mRNA levels in the hippocampus. Punishment increased beta2 mRNA levels in ventroposterior thalamic nucleus and gamma2 mRNA levels in the CA2 area of the hippocampus. All of these effects were reversed when alprazolam increased punished responding, while alprazolam alone had no effect on either non-punished responding or GABAA receptor subunit regulation in these brain regions. Some brain regions that were unaffected by punishment were altered by alprazolam plus punishment. These results demonstrate that punishment and alprazolam can produce reciprocal changes in the mRNA levels for some subunits of the GABAA receptor. These changes may alter GABAergic synaptic inhibition by altering the density of GABAA receptors or their efficacy to bind drugs. They suggest that the underlying mechanisms by which drugs affect behavior can depend upon the conditions under which behavior is assessed.",
