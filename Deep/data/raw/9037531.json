     "AB": "The 5-HT2C receptor2 is a prominent serotonin receptor that is uniquely expressed in the central nervous system and has been implicated in a variety of psychiatric diseases. While characterizing the 5-HT2C receptor gene, we observed that the mRNA contains a long 3' untranslated region that binds multiple brain proteins. Two proteins, molecular weights 55 and 58 kDa, were of particular interest because they were detected only in brain regions known to express the 5-HT2C receptor abundantly, namely, the hippocampus and cortex. These proteins bind with high affinity to the 5-HT2C receptor mRNA at its extreme 3' end (Kd = 1.8 nM), and binding can be specifically competed by selected regions of the 3' UTR. Furthermore, binding of the 55 and 58 kDa proteins to the mRNA is directionally specific and shows preference for an AU-rich loop containing 6 to 7 nucleotides. These results suggest the possibility that these two brain specific proteins may play a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of the 5-HT2C receptor, and that post-transcriptional control of 5-HT2C receptor expression may be an important regulatory mechanism which has not been previously reported for this serotonin receptor subtype.",
