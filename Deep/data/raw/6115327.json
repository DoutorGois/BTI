     "AB": "The activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and the concentration of somatostatin-like immunoreactive material (SLI) have been measured in 8 brain regions from 12 normal individuals and 12 cases of presenile and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. ChAT activity was significantly lower in all 8 brain regions of demented patients and the SLI concentration was significantly reduced in 7 of the the 8. There were correlations between the extent of the reductions of ChAT activity and SLI concentration in four brain regions, and a greater reduction of parietal cortex SLI in younger patients than in the more elderly.",
