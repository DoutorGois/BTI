     "AB": "Lowering extracellular [Ca2+] in rat hippocampal slices induces spontaneous epileptiform activity in area CA1, which is characterized by rhythmic burst firing of CA1 neurons and by prolonged negative potential shifts at the pyramidal cell body layer. This activity is accompanied by transient decreases of [Na+] and increases of [K+] in the extracellular space. In spite of the complete blockade of synaptic transmission, the wave of epileptiform activity propagates across area CA1. These findings suggest, that non-synaptic mechanisms may play a role in the generation and spread of epileptiform activity in the mammalian CNS.",
