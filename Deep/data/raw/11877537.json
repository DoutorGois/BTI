     "AB": "Axon sprouting and synaptic reorganization in the hippocampus are associated with the development of seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy. Synaptic interactions among CA1 pyramidal cells were examined in fragments of hippocampal slices containing only the CA1 area from saline- and kainate-treated rats. Glutamate microapplication to the pyramidal cell layer increased excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) frequency, but only in rats with kainate-induced epilepsy. In bicuculline, action potentials evoked in single pyramidal cells increased the frequency of network bursts only in slices from rats with kainate-induced epilepsy. These data further support the hypothesis that excitatory connections between CA1 pyramidal cells increase after kainate-induced status epilepticus.",
