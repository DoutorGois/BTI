     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX) plays a crucial role in pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsion. However, it is unclear whether NCX is critically involved in hyperthermia-induced convulsion. In this study, we examined the potential changes in NCX3 in the hippocampus and cerebrocortex of rats with hyperthermia-induced convulsion. METHODS: Twenty-one Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to control group, convulsion-prone group and convulsion-resistant group (n = 7 in each group). Whole-cell patch-clamp method was used to record NCX currents. Both the Western blotting analysis and immunofluorescence labeling techniques were used to examine the expression of NCX3. RESULTS: NCX currents were decreased in rats after febrile convulsion. Compared to the control group, NCX3 expression was decreased by about 40% and 50% in the hippocampus and cerebrocortex of convulsion-prone rats, respectively. Furthermore, the extent of reduction in NCX3 expression seemed to correlate with the number of seizures. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant reduction in NCX3 expression in rats with febrile convulsions. Our findings also indicate a potential link between NCX3 expression, febrile convulsion in early childhood, and adult onset of epilepsy.",
