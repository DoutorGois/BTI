     "AB": "In the hippocampus, synaptic depression of potentiated synapses in the form of depotentiation, or of naive synapses in the form of long-term depression (LTD) is mediated by distinct molecular mechanisms. Activation of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) is critically required for both hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and LTD in vivo, but their involvement in depotentiation is unclear. In this study, we investigated whether this class of mGluRs contributes to depotentiation in freely moving rats. Male adult Wistar rats underwent chronic implantation of stimulating and recording electrodes in the perforant path and dentate gyrus granule cell layer, respectively, as well as an injection cannula in the ipsilateral cerebral ventricle. Robust LTP which endured for over 24 h, was induced by high frequency tetanization (HFT, 200 Hz). Depotentiation was induced with LFS (5 Hz, 600 pulses) given 5 min after the LTP-inducing tetanus was applied. The selective group 1 mGluR antagonists, (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine and (R,S)-1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid significantly inhibited both depotentiation and LTP. Activation of group I mGluRs leads to changes in postsynaptic intracellular calcium levels. These findings suggest that activation of group I mGluRs mediate thresholds for depotentiation and for persistent LTP. Effects may be linked to the intensity and duration of the calcium signal elicited by LFS and HFT.",
