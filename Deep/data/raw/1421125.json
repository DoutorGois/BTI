     "AB": "The effects of extracellularly-applied synthetic philanthotoxin-343 (PhTX-343) on transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) at Schaffer-collateral/commissural-CA1 synapses were investigated. PhTX-343 was ineffective in antagonizing CA1 field-EPSPs mediated by AMPA/kainate receptors. However, when a micromolar concentration of the toxin was present during tetanization, the induction of LTP was suppressed. In contrast, when PhTX-343 was applied either immediately after or long after tetanization no effect on LTP could be found. It appears that the synaptic, non-NMDA receptors of the CA1-region are insensitive to PhTX-343. Suppression of LTP induction could result from antagonism of postsynaptic NMDA receptors, but the results do not rule out other possibilities such as presynaptic block.",
