     "AB": "This is the first in situ hybridization analysis of expression of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor (TRAF) during development. TRAF4 is observed throughout mouse embryogenesis, most notably during ontogenesis of the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous system, and of nervous tissues of sensory organs. TRAF4 is preferentially expressed by post-mitotic undifferentiated neurons. Interestingly, TRAF4 remains expressed in the adult hippocampus and olfactory bulb, known to contain multipotential cells responsible for neoneurogenesis.",
