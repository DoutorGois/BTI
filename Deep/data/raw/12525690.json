     "AB": "Electrical coupling between pyramidal cell axons, and between interneuron dendrites, have both been described in the hippocampus. What are the functional roles of the two types of coupling? Interneuron gap junctions enhance synchrony of gamma oscillations (25-70 Hz) in isolated interneuron networks and also in networks containing both interneurons and principal cells, as shown in mice with a knockout of the neuronal (primarily interneuronal) connexin36. We have recently shown that pharmacological gap junction blockade abolishes kainate-induced gamma oscillations in connexin36 knockout mice; without such gap junction blockade, gamma oscillations do occur in the knockout mice, albeit at reduced power compared with wild-type mice. As interneuronal dendritic electrical coupling is almost absent in the knockout mice, these pharmacological data indicate a role of axonal electrical coupling in generating the gamma oscillations. We construct a network model of an experimental gamma oscillation, known to be regulated by both types of electrical coupling. In our model, axonal electrical coupling is required for the gamma oscillation to occur at all; interneuron dendritic gap junctions exert a modulatory effect.",
