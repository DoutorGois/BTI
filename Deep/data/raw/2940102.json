     "AB": "The properties of [3H]nitrendipine binding to cardiac and cerebral membranes from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and renal (RHR), deoxycorticosterone/NaCl (DOCA-HR) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats were investigated. The maximal numbers of binding sites (Bmax) in the striatum, thalamus and hippocampus for SHR increased by 21.4-40.0, 28.1-40.4 and 21.4-34.1% of the numbers in WKY, but the apparent dissociation constants (KD) in the cerebral membranes differed very little between WKY and SHR. In the cardiac membranes, KD and Bmax values differed very little between WKY and SHR. In the RHR and DOCA-HR, the Bmax values in the striatum, thalamus and hippocampus were similar to those of WKY. These findings suggest that the increase in Bmax of [3H]nitrendipine in the striatum, thalamus and hippocampus of SHR may play a part in the development and maintenance of high blood pressure in SHR.",
