     "AB": "An increasing number of observations suggest an important role for voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels in epilepsy. We studied the cell-specific distribution of Kv4.2, phosphorylated (p) Kv4.2 and the Kv4.2 interacting protein NCS-1 using immunocytochemistry in different epilepsy-associated focal lesions. In hippocampal sclerosis (HS), Kv4.2 and pKv4.2 immunoreactivity (IR) was reduced in the neuropil in regions with prominent neuronal cell loss. In both HS and malformations of cortical development (MCD), intense labeling was found in neuronal somata, but not in dendrites. Strong NCS-1 IR was observed in neurons in all lesion types. Western blot analysis demonstrated an increase of total Kv4.2 in all lesions and activation of the ERK pathway in HS and ganglioglioma. These findings indicate that Kv4.2 is expressed in both neuronal and glial cells and its regulation may involve potassium channel interacting proteins, alterations in the subcellular localization of the channel, as well as phosphorylation-mediated posttranslational modifications.",
