     "PG": "46101-9",
     "AB": "The biophysical properties of small conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (SK) channels are well suited to underlie afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) shaping the firing patterns of a conspicuous number of central and peripheral neurons. We have identified a new scorpion toxin (tamapin) that binds to SK channels with high affinity and inhibits SK channel-mediated currents in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus as well as in cell lines expressing distinct SK channel subunits. This toxin distinguished between the SK channels underlying the apamin-sensitive I(AHP) and the Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels mediating the slow I(AHP) (sI(AHP)) in hippocampal neurons. Compared with related scorpion toxins, tamapin displayed a unique, remarkable selectivity for SK2 versus SK1 ( approximately 1750-fold) and SK3 ( approximately 70-fold) channels and is the most potent SK2 channel blocker characterized so far (IC(50) for SK2 channels = 24 pm). Tamapin will facilitate the characterization of the subunit composition of native SK channels and help determine their involvement in electrical and biochemical signaling.",
