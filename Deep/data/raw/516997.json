     "AB": "Using a brigthness discrimination model in rats, the labeling of discrete hippocampus formation structures was studied after intraventricular application of [3H]-fucose. This substance was injected 5 min before training as well as 5 min, 3, 7 and 23 h after training, the pulse period lasting 120 min in all cases. A significantly training-related enhanced labeling of CA1, CA3 and CA4 cell bodies and fibres revealed that a biphasic time course occurring when radioactive fucose was applied 5 min before training and 7 h after training, whereas the increased labeling of area dentata structures was evidenced only after application of radioactive fucose 5 min before and after training. In all structures under investigation the training-related increase in labeling was more pronounced in the fibre layers than in the pyramidal and granular cell bodies.",
