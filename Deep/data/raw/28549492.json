     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Anesthetic isoflurane plus surgery has been reported to induce cognitive impairment. The underlying mechanism and targeted intervention remain largely to be determined. Ginsenoside Rb1 was reported to be neuroprotective. We therefore set out to determine whether ginsenoside Rb1 can attenuate isoflurane/surgery-induced cognitive dysfunction via inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. METHODS: Five-months-old C57BL/6J female mice were treated with 1.4% isoflurane plus abdominal surgery for two hours. Sixty mg/kg ginsenoside Rb1 were given intraperitoneally from 7 days before surgery. Cognition of the mice were assessed by Barnes Maze. Levels of postsynaptic density-95 and synaptophysin in mice hippocampus were measured by Western blot. Levels of reactive oxygen species, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in mice hippocampus were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Here we show for the first time that the ginsenoside Rb1 treatment attenuated the isoflurane/surgery-induced cognitive impairment. Moreover, ginsenoside Rb1 attenuated the isoflurane/surgery-induced synapse dysfunction. Finally, ginsenoside Rb1 mitigated the isoflurane/surgery-induced elevation levels of reactive oxygen species, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in the mice hippocampus. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ginsenoside Rb1 may attenuate the isoflurane/surgery-induced cognitive impairment by inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress pending future studies.",
