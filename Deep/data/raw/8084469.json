     "AB": "Induction of post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) and long-term potentiation (LTP) was analyzed in hippocampal slices obtained from (i) young (6 months old) rats of different strains (Sprague-Dawley, SD; spontaneously hypertensive rats, SHR; and Wistar-Kyoto, WKY), and (ii) from aged (20-24 months old) SD and Fischer 344 (F 344) rats, each group showing a different performance in the Morris maze test. After the application of an electrical tetanus (1 s, 100 Hz, 50 microA) in the stratum moleculare, a significant difference was found in the percent of induction of the dentate PTP in hippocampal slices obtained from rats of different strains and ages. In particular, the induction of the dentate PTP was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in slices obtained from young SD or spontaneously SHR rats, having the better performance in the Morris maze than in slices obtained from old SD or F 344 rats or young WKY rats which had poorer performances in the Morris maze. On the contrary, no significant differences were found in the percent of induction of the LTP in the dentate area of hippocampal slices obtained from rats of different strains and ages. Moreover, after the application of an electrical tetanus (1 s, 100 Hz, 50 microA) in the stratum radiatum, no significant differences were found in the percent of induction of both PTP and LTP in the CA1 area of hippocampal slices obtained from rats of different strains and ages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
