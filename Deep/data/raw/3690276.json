     "AB": "Cerebral blood vessels (BVs) of dogs subjected to global brain ischemia by complete cardiac arrest of 15 min followed by 8 h of reperfusion, were studied in neocortex and hippocampus by means of transmission electron microscopy. Widespread endothelial microvilli were present in the postischemic animals. The number of endothelial microvilli in the postischemic animals (mean/BV in the neocortex = 3.26 and in the hippocampus = 2.54) was significantly larger than that in the non-ischemic controls (mean/BV in the neocortex = 1.39 and in the hippocampus = 0.84), P for both regions being less than 0.05. Arterioles, venules and capillaries, all were equally affected. Endothelial pinocytotic vesicles were also observed frequently in the postischemic dogs. Marked pericapillary swelling of astrocytic foot processes was present in the surrounding neuropil. It is concluded that the prominent cerebral endothelial microvilli recognized after 8 h of reperfusion following cardiac arrest in this experimental model of global brain ischemia, may play a significant role in the development of delayed postischemic hypoperfusion.",
