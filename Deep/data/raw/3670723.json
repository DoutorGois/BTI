     "AB": "Acute and chronic alterations of the monoamine levels in the rat cerebellum and hippocampus after late prenatal and early postnatal administration of chlorpromazine, were examined using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. During a critical phase of development (one week postnatal), chlorpromazine produced increased levels of both serotonin and dopamine in both brain regions. At 24 weeks postnatal, or 21 weeks after cessation of drug administration, the levels of all 3 monoamines were decreased in the cerebellum and increased in the hippocampus. The early disruption in the normal monoamine levels may be related to abnormal growth patterns observed in previous studies.",
