     "AB": "Progesterone's effects on hippocampus-dependent behavior and synaptic connectivity maybe mediated through the progestin receptor (PR). Although estrogen induces PR mRNA and cytosolic PR in the hippocampus, nuclear PR immunoreactivity is undetectable by light microscopy, suggesting that PR is present at extranuclear sites. To determine whether this is the case, we used immunoelectron microscopy to examine PR distribution in the hippocampal formation of proestrus rats. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that PR labeling is present in extranuclear profiles throughout the CA1 and CA3 regions and dentate gyrus, and, in contrast to light microscopic findings, in nuclei of a few pyramidal and subgranular zone cells. Most neuronal PR labeling is extranuclear and is divided between pre- and postsynaptic compartments; approximately 30% of labeled profiles were axon terminals and 30% were dendrites and dendritic spines. In most laminae, except in CA3 stratum lucidum, about 15% of PR-immunoreactive profiles were unmyelinated axons. In stratum lucidum, where the mossy fiber axons course, more than 50% of PR-labeled profiles were axonal. The remaining 25% of PR-labeled profiles were glia, some resembling astrocytes. PR labeling is strongly dependent on estrogen priming, insofar as few PR-labeled profiles were detected in ovariectomized, oil-replaced females. Synapses formed by PR-labeled terminals were predominantly asymmetric, consistent with a role for progesterone in directly regulating excitatory transmission. These findings suggest that some of progesterone's actions in the hippocampal formation may be mediated by direct and rapid actions on extranuclear PRs and that PRs are well positioned to regulate progesterone-induced changes at synapses.",
