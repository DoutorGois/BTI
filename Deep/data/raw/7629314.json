     "AB": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) represent members of a recently discovered neuropeptide family involved in central regulation of endocrine and autonomic functions. The present study employed an in situ hybridization approach to provide the first detailed comparative mapping of ANP, BNP, and CNP mRNAs in brain. Results indicate that ANP mRNA is highly expressed in anterior olfactory nuclei, limbic cortices, dorsal endopiriform nucleus, hippocampal subfield CA1, cortical amygdaloid nuclei, medial habenula, anteroventral periventricular and arcuate nuclei, periventricular stratum, zona incerta, mammillary nuclei, inferior olive, nucleus ambiguus, and pontine paragigantocellular nuclei. CNP mRNA is expressed at highest levels in olfactory nuclei, limbic cortices, dorsal endopiriform nucleus, hippocampal subfields CA1-3, anteroventral periventricular and arcuate nuclei, and numerous brainstem regions (including the pontine, lateral reticular, solitary tract, prepositus hypoglossal, and spinal trigeminal nuclei). Positive labeling for BNP mRNA was not observed in brain. The presence of both ANP and CNP mRNA in the same regions of distinct nuclei (e.g., the anteroventral periventricular and arcuate nuclei) suggests the potential for coexpression. Overall, the present data are consistent with a prominent role for both ANP and CNP in neuroendocrine regulation and central cardiovascular integration. The extensive localization of ANP and/or CNP mRNA in olfactory nuclei, limbic cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and diencephalic limbic relays further indicate a putative role for ANP and CNP as neuromodulators of olfactory/limbic information processing.",
