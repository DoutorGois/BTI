     "AB": "Epidemiological studies in children have proved that lead (Pb) exposure causes deficits in neural and cognitive functions. The present study assessed the oxidative stress on postnatal day 30, in the hippocampus, cerebellum and frontal cortex of rat pups exposed to Pb during specific periods of early brain development. Five groups of rat pups were investigated, and 0.2% Pb acetate in drinking was the dosage used. (i) Gestation and lactation (GL) group (n = 9) of rat pups was exposed to Pb during gestation and lactation through their mother, (ii) gestation (G) group (n = 9) of rat pups was exposed to Pb during gestation only, (iii) lactation (L) group (n = 9) of rat pups was exposed to Pb during lactation only, (iv) pre-gestation (PG) group (n = 9) of rat pups was born to mothers who were exposed to Pb for 1 month before conception, and (v) normal control (NC) (n = 9) group of rats pups had no exposure to Pb during gestation and lactation period. From the present study, it is evident that Pb exposure during different periods of early brain development (GL, G, L and PG groups) causes oxidative stress and lactation period (postnatal period) of Pb exposure produces maximum oxidative stress.",
