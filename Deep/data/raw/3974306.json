     "AB": "The accuracy of poly(U) translation was measured in the post-mitochondrial supernatant from whole brain of 7- and 33-month-old Fischer 344 rats. Measurements were made: under in vitro conditions in which translation fidelity was similar to what is known about the accuracy of translation in vivo; and under stresses of varying Mg2+ concentrations (3-12 mM), pH (6.6-8.4), temperature (26-42 degrees C) and in the presence or absence of 2.4% ethanol. No significant difference could be detected between the responses of old and young extracts, the activities of their Phe- and Leu-tRNA synthetases, and their endogenous amounts of Phe-tRNA and Leu-tRNA, despite the fact that the rats studied corresponded in age (by actuarial criteria) to 90-year-old human beings. The accuracy of poly(U) translation was also studied: in liver and hippocampus extracts from 7- and 33-month-old rats; and in brain extracts from 3- and 29-month-old rats. The results were similar to those obtained in brain extracts from 7-month-old rats. Explanations are provided for the inconsistencies which exist in the literature regarding the effect of aging on the accuracy of protein synthesis. It is shown that the inconsistencies are likely to reflect inadequate methodology in three previous studies rather than biological diversity in the control of translation fidelity in aged animals.",
