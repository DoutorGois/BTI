     "AB": "Serotonin 5-HT3 receptors are involved in various brain functions including as an emesis target during cancer chemotherapy. We report here the development of (S)-2,3-dimethoxy-5-(3'-[(18)F]fluoropropyl)-N-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)benza mide ([(18)F]fesetron) as a potential PET imaging agent for serotonin 5-HT3 receptors. By radiolabeling((S)-2,3-dimethoxy-5-(3'-tosyloxypropyl)-N-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3 -yl)benzamide) with fluorine-18, (S)-[(18)F]fesetron was obtained in 5 to 10% decay-corrected yields and with specific activities >74GBq/mumol at the end of radiosynthesis. PET imaging in rats showed low uptake of [(18)F]fesetron in the brain with retention of binding in the striatal and cerebellar regions. Using colliculi as a reference region, ratios were 3.4 for striata and 2.5 for cerebellum. Ex vivo brain PET analysis displayed binding of [(18)F]fesetron in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellar regions. Cerebellar regions corresponded to area postrema and nucleus tract solitaris known to contain 5-HT3 receptors. Dorsal hippocampus showed the highest uptake with ratio of >17 with respect to colliculi, while area postrema and striata had ratios of >10. Thus, [(18)F]fesetron exhibited a unique binding profile to rat brain regions known to contain significant amounts of serotonin 5-HT3 receptors. However, the very low brain uptake limits its usefulness as a PET radiotracer in this animal model.",
