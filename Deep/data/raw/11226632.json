     "AB": "By using extracellular recordings of field potential, the exact pathway by which the endogenous ACh influencing the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 area was analysed in slices of rat hippocampus. The results showed that: (1) the application of (-) huperzine A, an AChE inhibitor extracted from Chinese herb Qian Ceng Ta (Huperzia Serrata), could enhance the induction of LTP, while this drug showed little effect on the second components of multiple population spikes that were recorded in Mg(2+)-free medium and had proven to be N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated response; and (2) scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, could significantly suppressed the induction of LTP, while most of the suppressive effect of scopolamine was blocked when slices were pretreated by bicuculline, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor antagonist. These results suggest that endogenous ACh potentiates the induction of LTP through the inhibition of GABAergic interneurons that modulate pyramidal neurons, but not through the activation of NMDA receptors located on pyramidal neurons.",
