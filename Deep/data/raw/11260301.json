In this study, we examined the expression of AGEs in human hippocampus using immunohistochemistry and determined its utility for estimating the age of cadavers of unknown age. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hippocampus tissues were obtained at autopsy from 31 individuals, including 10 fire victims, aged 0--96 years within 3 days postmortem. Immunostaining using anti-AGE antibody demonstrated that the perikarya of pyramidal neurones in the hippocampus was immunoreactive for the anti-AGE antibody, and the immunoreactivity was increased with age. Quantitative analysis of the AGE-immunoreactivity in the pyramidal neurones of the CA4 region revealed a significant correlation between the AGE-immunoreactivity and the age in nonfire death cases with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 (P < 0.01). The significant correlation could be obtained even in fire death cases affected by the unusual environmental condition. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the immunohistochemical analysis of AGEs in human hippocampus may be useful for the age estimation of cadavers with unknown age.",
