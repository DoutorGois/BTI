     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is emerging evidence suggesting that abnormal transport of amyloid-beta (Abeta) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is involved in diabetes-associated cognitive decline. We investigated whether PPARgamma agonists restore Abeta transport across the BBB and hippocampal plasticity in db/db mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Efflux and influx of Abeta across the BBB were determined by stereotaxic intra-cerebral or i.a. infusion of [(125) I]-Abeta1-40 respectively. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), which are involved in Abeta influx and efflux, PPARgamma and NF-kappaB p65 at the BBB, as well as hippocampal Abeta, caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 were assayed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. In vivo, hippocampal LTP was recorded, and Morris water maze and Y-maze tasks were performed. KEY RESULTS: Treatment with PPARgamma agonists, rosiglitazone (0.8 mg.kg(-1) ) and pioglitazone (9.0 mg.kg(-1) ), for 6 weeks significantly increased Abeta efflux and decreased Abeta influx across the BBB in db/db mice. Concomitantly, they decreased hippocampal Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 , suppressed neuronal apoptosis, as indicated by decreased caspase-3 activity and increased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and increased hippocampal plasticity, characterized by an enhanced in vivo LTP and better performance in behavioural tests. Furthermore, the PPARgamma agonists induced the expression of LRP1 gene by activation of PPARgamma and suppressed RAGE gene expression by inactivation of NF-kappaB signalling at the BBB of db/db mice. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: PPARgamma agonists modify abnormal Abeta transport across the BBB and this is accompanied by amelioration of beta-amyloidosis and an improvement in hippocampal plasticity in diabetic mice.",
