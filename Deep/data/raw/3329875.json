     "AB": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers significant advantages over computerized tomography (CT) and teleradiographic techniques when used for the evaluation and management of epilepsy and functional neurological disorders. Depth recording and radiofrequency electrodes can be more accurately positioned within structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus. The extent of corpus callosum section, lobectomy, topectomy, and radiofrequency stereotactic lesions can now be readily confirmed and related with seizure, neurological, and behavioral outcome. Occult, usually low grade, intraparenchymal neoplasms not visualized on CT scans can be located by MRI and biopsied or excised by MRI stereotactic techniques.",
