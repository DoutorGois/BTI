     "AB": "Kindling is a model of the neural plasticity that occurs following stimulation to the brain, which can result in epileptogenesis. The amygdala (Am), one of the most sensitive structures from which to induce electrical kindling, is comprised of distinct nuclei that possess differences in threshold for seizure initiation, unique cellular and molecular morphology, and specific neuroanatomical connections within the amygdala and, to other cortical and subcortical brain structures. The aim of this study was to map the spread of epileptiform activity throughout the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres during the transition stage between oral automatisms and generalized clonic seizures, by measuring changes in mRNA expression for c-fos, NGFI-A, and BDNF. The stimulating electrode was implanted in either the basolateral (BL) or the lateral (CeL) or medial (CeM) subdivisions of the central nucleus of the amygdala. The rats were kindled once daily using afterdischarge-threshold electrical stimulation until the first forelimb clonic seizure was induced. They were sacrificed 30 min later, and their brains were prepared for in situ hybridization to measure mRNA expression of c-fos, NGFI-A and BDNF. The results demonstrate that: (1) the threshold to elicit an afterdischarge from the BL was lower than that of either the medial (CeM) or lateral (CeL) subdivisions of the Ce, which did not differ from each other; (2) the patterns of mRNA expression for c-fos, NGFI-A and BDNF were highly similar to each other when the stimulation site was the BL or the CeL, and included mainly limbic cortical and subcortical areas ipsilateral to the electrode; (3) c-fos was the only probe to be expressed in the contralateral hemisphere following the first motor seizure, and the pattern of its expression reflected a subset of structures recruited in the ipsilateral hemisphere including the claustrum, insular and perirhinal cortices; (4) unexpectedly, stimulation of the CeM elicited seizures and afterdischarges of shorter duration than those evoked by stimulation of the BL or CeL, and failed to increase mRNA expression for any of the probes in the hippocampus or in the contralateral hemisphere. A neuroanatomical model of Am-induced seizure propagation is proposed suggesting that the Claust-Ins-PRh play a pivotal role during the transition between oral automatisms and generalized clonic convulsions.",
