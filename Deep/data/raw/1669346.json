     "AB": "The probabilistic nature of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) induced monosynaptically in CA3 neurons by impulses of granule cells was studied in thin transverse sections of the guinea pig hippocampus. More than 600 EPSPs were recorded under several conditions, their amplitudes were measured, and histograms representing the EPSP amplitude distribution were constructed. Quantal parameters were estimated by the method of maximum likelihood. Of 9 neurons examined in the control solution, one neuron showed an exceptionally large number of transmission failures. The amplitude distribution of EPSPs recorded from this neuron could be described by Pascal statistics, but not by binomial or Poisson statistics. The EPSP amplitude distribution from the other neurons could be described by either binomial, Poisson, or Pascal predictions with a minor preference for the last statistic. When an apparently homogeneous group of data was divided into two subgroups and parameters were estimated separately, inconsistent values were obtained in some neurons with no failures. 2-Amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (APB) suppressed the EPSPs reversibly at relatively low concentrations. Theoretical curves calculated according to the Pascal statistics fit quite well to the entire amplitude distribution of EPSPs recorded under the action of APB. The suppression of EPSPs by APB was accompanied by a marked decrease in mean quantal content (m) with no significant reduction in mean quantal amplitude (q). A quantum induced an increase in membrane conductance of about 150 pS. These results suggest that the release probability of the mossy fiber terminal fluctuates temporally according to a gamma distribution, and that APB reduces the liberation of the transmitter from mossy fiber terminals, thereby suppressing transmission between mossy fibers and CA3 neurons.",
