     "AB": "AIMS: Docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3; DHA) is known to play a critical role in postnatal brain development. However, no study has been performed to investigate its preventive effect on prenatal stress-induced behavioral and molecular alterations in offspring. In the present study, rats were exposed to restraint stress on days 14-20 of pregnancy, three times a day, 2 hours each time; DHA was given at the doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg/day for two weeks. RESULTS: We showed that prenatal restraint stress caused (1) learning and memory impairment, (2) BDNF mRNA level decrease, (3) oxidative damage to proteins, (4) enhanced expression of nitric oxide synthase and apoptosis, and (5) abnormalities in mitochondrial metabolism that included changes in mitochondrial complexes I-V, and enhancement of expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion/fission (Mfn-1, Mfn-2, Drp-1) and autophagy (Atg3, Atg7, Beclin-1, p-Akt, and p-mTOR) in the hippocampus of offspring. INNOVATION: Besides the well-known role in child brain development, we reported the novel finding of DHA in protecting prenatal stress-induced cognitive dysfunction involving the modulation of mitochondrial function and dynamics. CONCLUSION: Maternal feeding of DHA significantly prevented prenatal stress-induced impairment of learning and memory and normalized the biomarkers of oxidative damage, apoptosis, and mitochondrial metabolism in the hippocampus of both male and female offspring. These results suggest that maternal feeding of DHA exerts preventive effects on prenatal stress-induced brain dysfunction and that modulation of mitochondrial metabolism may play critical role in DHA protection.",
