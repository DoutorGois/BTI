     "AB": "Phosphorylation of various AMPA receptor subunits can alter synaptic transmission and plasticity at excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the central nervous system. Here, we identified threonine-840 (T840) on the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors as a novel phosphorylation site. T840 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) in vitro and is a highly turned-over phosphorylation site in the hippocampus. Interestingly, the high basal phosphorylation of T840 in the hippocampus is maintained by a persistent activity of a protein kinase, which is counter-balanced by a basal protein phosphatase activity. To study the function of T840, we generated a line of mutant mice lacking this phosphorylation site using a gene knock-in technique. The mice generated lack T840, in addition to two previously identified phosphorylation sites S831 and S845. Using this mouse, we demonstrate that T840 may regulate synaptic plasticity in an age-dependent manner.",
