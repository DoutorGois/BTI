     "AB": "Changes in the phosphoinositide (PPI) signal transduction system induced by E-5842, a new sigma(1) (sigma(1)) receptor ligand and potential atypical antipsychotic, were studied in the rat frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Acute treatment with E-5842 increased phospholipase C (PLC) activity in the striatum and the hippocampus. Chronic treatment with E-5842 induced an increase in the activity of PLC in the frontal cortex and the striatum. Similar up-regulation of the activity of the enzyme was also observed in rat frontal cortex membranes in presence of GTPgammaS. After chronic treatment with E-5842, it was also observed a significant increase of the immunoreactivity levels of G(q/11)alpha in the frontal cortex. Our results suggest that part of the antipsychotic effects of E-5842 could be related to the regulation of the PPI signal transduction pathway, especially after a prolonged treatment.",
