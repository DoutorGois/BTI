     "AB": "Neuronal activity in hippocampal slices can be synchronized by drugs which either block synaptic inhibition (e.g. bicuculline methiodide) or do not (e.g. 4-aminopyridine). Here we compare these two drugs to assess the role of inhibition on the recruitment of neurones into synchronous epileptiform bursts. With 4-aminopyridine we recorded an acceleration of neuronal activity, and in most cells a slow depolarization (mean 6.8 mV), during the ca. 100 ms preceding the population burst. With bicuculline these changes occurred ca. 10 ms before the population bursts, and depolarizations reached a mean of 2.5 mV. We propose that bicuculline-sensitive synaptic inhibition retards the recruitment of neurones into epileptiform synchronous bursts.",
