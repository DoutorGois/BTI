     "AB": "1. Generalized convulsive seizures can be elicited by a single unilateral microinjection of the cholinergic muscarinic agonist, carbachol, into the specific sites of the thalamus including ventral posterolateral and the reticular thalamic nuclei. The implication of the thalamic specific and reticular neurons is reviewed and discussed. 2. On the basis of the c-fos regional expression and well-known efferent and afferent pathways linking these regions, a neuronal network relating the limbic, thalamo-striatal-cortical, and central autonomic systems, was constructed. 3. The pattern of Fos immunoreactivity associated with long-lasting isocortical vasodilatation elicited by generalized convulsive seizures in anesthetized rat following cholinergic stimulation of the thalamus can be attributed to both the electrocortical activity and the long-lasting increase in cortical blood flow. We propose that the sustained cerebral cortical blood flow response during convulsive epileptic seizures may implicate intracerebral vasodilatory and vasoconstrictory neural mechanisms. Double-labeled NADPH-d and Fos-positive neurons implicated in maintaining the sustained isocortical vasodilatory response were found in the anterior lateral hypothalamic area. Inhibition of these neurons prevented the increase in cortical blood flow despite an increased metabolic demand manifested by the ictal electrocortical activity. 4. Medial temporal lobe atrophy, including hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus (piriform and entorhinal cortices) are the most common pathology in man. However the origin of medial lobe atrophy remain uncertain. Our results provide evidence that the allocortical microvascular inflammation may be in origin of the neurovascular degenerative processes leading to atrophy.",
