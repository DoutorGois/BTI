     "AB": "DA11 is the first fatty acid binding protein (FABP) for which gene expression has been shown to be upregulated following neuronal injury in the adult peripheral nervous system. To understand better the potential regulatory role(s) of this unique FABP in axonal growth and neuronal differentiation, we undertook a temporal and spatial study of DA11 gene expression in the developing rat central nervous system (CNS). Transient upregulation of DA11 mRNA and protein levels in CNS tissues were quantified by Northern blot hybridization and Western immunoblot analyses at different developmental ages. Homogenates of embryonic and neonatal cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brain stem, and hippocampal tissues contained 100-fold more DA11 mRNA and protein than corresponding adult tissues. Significant increase in DA11 mRNA was observed as early as embryonic day (E) 14 in cerebral cortex and cerebellum and E19 in brain stem and hippocampus. Postnatal levels of DA11 remained elevated through postnatal day (P) 10 in cerebral cortex, P14 in brain stem and hippocampus, and P20 in cerebellum. Localization of DA11-like immunoreactivity to specific CNS tissues, cell types, and intracellular compartments at P9 revealed a spatial pattern of neuronal expression different than that reported for other FABPs. DA11 protein was detected in the nucleus, cytoplasm, axons, and dendrites of differentiating neurons in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, brain stem, spinal cord, and olfactory bulb. The strong association of DA11 gene expression with development throughout the CNS suggests that this unique FABP plays an important role in axonal growth and neuronal differentiation in many different neuronal populations.",
