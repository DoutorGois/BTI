     "AB": "Antioxidants can be useful as a supportive therapy in diabetes, and we try to elucidate some of the mechanisms by which these compounds are able to protect from diabetic complications. For this purpose we have assayed, in vitro and in vivo, the ability of CR-6 (3,4-dihydro-6-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-1(2H)-benzopyran), an antioxidant able to scavenge nitrogen reactive species, to protect glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. Glucose, in vitro, inhibited GPx activity in a concentration-dependent manner; CR-6 was able to protect GPx activity from glucose-induced inactivation. Alloxan-induced experimental diabetes in mice promoted oxidative stress in the retina and hippocampus, after 3 weeks of hyperglycemia. CR-6 administration prevented not only the alterations of oxidative stress markers (tissue GSH and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and GPx activity) but also the impairment of retinal function (as assessed by the modifications in electroretinogram b-wave amplitude). The findings herein confirm the role of nitrogen reactive species in diabetes; therefore, antioxidants effectively quenching these species, such as CR-6, should be considered for the adjuvant treatment of diabetes.",
