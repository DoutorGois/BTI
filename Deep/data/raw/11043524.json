     "AB": "Adult female rats sustained aspirative fimbria-fornix lesions and, 2 weeks later, received intrahippocampal grafts of fetal septal or mixed septal-raphe cell suspensions. Twenty-four months later, the extracellular concentration of hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) was determined by microdialysis. Basal ACh levels (5-65 fmol/5 microl sham-operated rats) were strongly reduced after lesioning (3-7 fmol/5 microl). In septally transplanted and septal-raphe co-transplanted rats, hippocampal ACh concentrations were restored to near-normal levels (15-25 fmol/5 microl), indicating long-term functional survival of hippocampal transplants. After administration of citalopram (100 microM by infusion) and fenfluramine (20 mg/kg i.p.), the hippocampal ACh efflux was increased by 2- to 3-fold in all groups of rats. The relative increase of ACh was highest in co-transplanted rats, an effect which was possibly due to functional interactions between grafted raphe and septal neurons.",
