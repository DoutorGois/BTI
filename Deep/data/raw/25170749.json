     "AB": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Methamphetamine abuse may produce cognitive impairment. Baicalein, a bioactive flavonoid, has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. This study examined the effects of baicalein pretreatment on memory performance in the passive avoidance test after either one dose or an acute binge of methamphetamine in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice. METHODS: Methamphetamine was administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of either one dose (3 mg/kg) or an acute binge (3 mg/kg, 4 i.p. injections at 2-hour intervals). The effects of baicalein pretreatment (1 mg/kg, i.p.) on methamphetamine-induced changes of locomotor activity and memory performance were compared with those of eticlopride, a selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist. The effects of baicalein on acute binge methamphetamine-induced oxidative stress (malondialdehyde- and nitrotyrosine-modified protein production) in the mouse hippocampus were also examined. RESULTS: One-dose methamphetamine treatment (i.p., 30 min before or immediately after the training trial) induced hyperlocomotion and amnesia in mice, which were blocked by eticlopride but not by baicalein pretreatment. The memory performance in mice was impaired 5 days after acute binge methamphetamine, which was significantly attenuated by baicalein but not by eticlopride pretreatment. Baicalein pretreatment also attenuated acute binge methamphetamine-induced oxidative stress in the mouse hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Baicalein exhibits antioxidative and neuroprotective effects in attenuating acute binge methamphetamine-induced memory deficits and oxidative hippocampal damage.",
