     "AB": "Erythropoietin (EPO), essential for erythropoiesis, provides neuroprotection. The EPO receptor (EPOR) is expressed in both neural and non-neural cells in the brain. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that EPO provides beneficial therapeutic effects, even in the absence of the neural EPOR. In this study, EPOR-null mice were rescued with selective EpoR expression driven by the endogenous EpoR promoter in hematopoietic tissue, but not in the neural cells. Anesthetized young adult female EPOR-null and wild-type mice were subjected to traumatic brain injury (TBI) induced by controlled cortical impact. EPO (5000 U/kg) or saline was intraperitoneally administered at 6 h and 3 and 7 days post-injury. Sensorimotor and spatial learning functions were assessed. Expression of EPOR and its downstream signal proteins were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Our data demonstrated that EPO treatment significantly reduced cortical tissue damage and hippocampal cell loss, and improved spatial learning following TBI in both the wild-type and EPOR-null mice. EPO treatment significantly improved sensorimotor functional recovery, with better outcomes in the wild-type mice. EPO treatment upregulated anti-apoptotic proteins (p-Akt and Bcl-XL) in the ipsilateral hippocampus and cortex of the injured wild-type and EPOR-null mice. These data demonstrate that EPO significantly provides neuroprotection following TBI, even in the absence of EPOR in the neural cells, suggesting that its therapeutic benefits may be mediated through vascular protection.",
