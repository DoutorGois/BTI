     "AB": "Previously we reported that basal neuropeptide Y (NPY)-like immunoreactivity-(LI) in hippocampus of the \"depressed\" Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats was lower compared to the control Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) and that electroconvulsive stimuli (ECS) raise NPY-LI in discrete brain regions. Here we studied NPY mRNA expression, NPY Y(1) receptor (Y(1)) mRNA expression and binding sites, and behavior under basal conditions (Sham) and after repeated ECS. Baseline NPY and Y(1) mRNAs in the CA1-2 regions and dentate gyrus were lower while the Y(1) binding was higher in the FSL. ECS had larger effects on both NPY and behavior in the FSL rats. ECS increased NPY mRNA in the CA1-2, dentate gyrus and hypothalamus in FSL, but only in the dentate gyrus in FRL. ECS also increased Y(1) mRNA in the CA1-2, dentate gyrus and the parietal cortex in both strains, while in the hypothalamus the increase was observed only in the FSL rats. Consistently with Y(1) mRNA increase, Y(1) binding was downregulated in the corresponding regions. ECS decreased FSL immobility in the Porsolt swim test. These findings suggest that NPY is involved in depressive disorder and that antidepressant effects of ECS may in part be mediated through NPY.",
