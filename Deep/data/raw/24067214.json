     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) protein in preeclampsia(PE) model rats. METHODS: Adult SD rats were divided into PE model group (n=7) induced by endotoxin, normal pregnancy group (n=6) and non-pregnancy group (n=12) treated with an equal volume of saline. AQP4 protein expression in the brain of the rats was detected with immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. RESULTS: The blood pressure in PE model rats (135-/+9 mmHg) was significantly higher than that in normal pregnancy rats (116-/+8 mmHg) and non-pregnancy rats (112-/+6 mmHg) (P<0.02). The rats in PE model group showed obvious proteinuria compared with the other two groups (3.8-/+0.5 vs 2.6-/+0.6 and 2.3-/+0.4, P<0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that AQP4 protein was localized primarily around the brain parenchymal blood vessels. Western analysis revealed a significantly elevated AQP4 protein expression in PE model group (39.6-/+4.9) compared with that in normal pregnancy group (26.5-/+4.3) and non-pregnancy group (9.7-/+2.1) (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The up-regulation of AQP4 protein around the intraparenchymal blood vessels of the brain may play a role in the development of eclampsia.",
