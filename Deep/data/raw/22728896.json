     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of different types of extracellular and neurotoxic aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta). Recently, bioactive compounds extracted from natural sources showing neuroprotective properties have become of interest in brain neurodegeneration. We have purified, characterized, and evaluated the protective potential of one extract enriched in polyphenols obtained from Aristotelia chilensis (MQ), a Chilean berry fruit, in neuronal models of AD induced by soluble oligomers of Abeta1-40. For example, using primary hippocampal cultures from rats (E18), we observed neuroprotection when the neurons were co-incubated with Abeta (0.5 muM) plus MQ for 24 h (Abeta = 23 +/- 2%; Abeta + MQ = 3 +/- 1%; n = 3). In parallel, co-incubation of Abeta with MQ recovered the frequency of Ca2+ transient oscillations when compared to neurons treated with Abeta alone (Abeta = 72 +/- 3%; Abeta + MQ = 86 +/- 2%; n = 5), correlating with the changes observed in spontaneous synaptic activity. Additionally, MAP-2 immunostaining showed a preservation of the dendritic tree, suggesting that the toxic effect of Abeta is prevented in the presence of MQ. A new complex mechanism is proposed by which MQ induces neuroprotective effects including antioxidant properties, modulation of cell survival pathways, and/or direct interaction with the Abeta aggregates. Our results suggest that MQ induces changes in the aggregation kinetics of Abeta producing variations in the nucleation phase (Abeta: k1 = 2.7 +/- 0.4 x 10-3 s-1 MQ: k1 = 8.3 +/- 0.6 x 10-3 s-1) and altering Thioflavin T insertion in beta-sheets. In conclusion, MQ induces a potent neuroprotection by direct interaction with the Abeta aggregates, generating far less toxic species and in this way protecting the neuronal network.",
