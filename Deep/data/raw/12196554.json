     "AB": "Visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1) belongs to the family of neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) proteins, a neuronal subfamily of EF-hand [corrected] calcium-binding proteins that are myristoylated at their N termini. NCS proteins are discussed to play roles in calcium-dependent signal transduction of physiological and pathological processes in the CNS. The calcium-dependent membrane association, the so-called calcium-myristoyl switch, localizes NCS proteins to a distinct cellular signaling compartment and thus may be a critical mechanism for the coordinated regulation of signaling cascades. To study whether the biochemically defined calcium-myristoyl switch of NCS proteins can occur in living neuronal cells, the reversible and stimulus-dependent translocation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged VILIP-1 to subcellular targets was examined by fluorescence microscopy in transfected cell lines and hippocampal primary neurons. In transiently transfected NG108-15 and COS-7 cells, a translocation of diffusely distributed VILIP-1-GFP but not of myristoylation-deficient VILIP-1-GFP to the plasma membrane and to intracellular targets, such as Golgi membranes, occurred after raising the intracellular calcium concentration with a calcium ionophore. The observed calcium-dependent localization was completely reversed after depletion of intracellular calcium by EGTA. Interestingly, a fast and reversible translocation of VILIP-1-GFP and translocation of endogenous VILIP-1 to specialized membrane structures was also observed after a depolarizing stimulus or activation of glutamate receptors in hippocampal neurons. These results show for the first time the reversibility and stimulus-dependent occurrence of the calcium-myristoyl switch in living neurons, suggesting a physiological role as a signaling mechanism of NCS proteins, enabling them to activate specific targets localized in distinct membrane compartments.",
