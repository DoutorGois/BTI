     "AB": "Eleven patients being evaluated with intracranial electroencephalography for medically resistant temporal lobe epilepsy participated in a visual recognition memory task. Interictal epileptiform spikes were manually marked and their rate of occurrence compared between baseline and three 2 s periods spanning a 6 s viewing period. During successful, but not unsuccessful, encoding of the images there was a significant reduction in interictal epileptiform spike rate in the amygdala, hippocampus, and temporal cortex. During the earliest encoding period (0-2000 ms after image presentation) in these trials there was a widespread decrease in the power of theta, alpha and beta band local field potential oscillations that coincided with emergent focal gamma frequency activity. Interictal epileptiform spike rate correlated with spectral band power changes and broadband (4-150 Hz) desynchronization, which predicted significant reduction in interictal epileptiform spike rate. Spike-triggered averaging of the field potential power spectrum detected a burst of low frequency synchronization 200 ms before the interictal epileptiform spikes that arose during this period of encoding. We conclude that interictal epileptiform spikes are modulated by the patterns of network oscillatory activity that accompany human memory offering a new mechanistic insight into the interplay of cognitive processing, local field potential dynamics and interictal epileptiform spike generation.",
