     "TI": "Anxiolytic activity of the MGLU2/3 receptor agonist LY354740 on the elevated plus maze is associated with the suppression of stress-induced c-Fos in the hippocampus and increases in c-Fos induction in several other stress-sensitive brain regions.",
     "PG": "502-13",
     "AB": "LY354740 is a potent and selective agonist for group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors, mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, with anxiolytic activity in several animal models of anxiety, including the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Here, we studied neuronal activation in mouse brain after EPM exposure in saline- and LY354740-treated mice using c-Fos immunoreactivity as a marker. The effect of LY354740 on c-Fos expression was also studied in cage control (no EPM) mice. Pretreatment with LY354740 (20 mg/kg, s.c.) produced robust anxiolytic behavior on the EPM. LY354740 administration decreased EPM-induced increases in c-Fos expression in the CA3 of the hippocampus, while having no significant effects on basal c-Fos expression in the hippocampus. LY354740 administration significantly increased c-Fos expression in specific limbic regions, including the lateral division of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeL), lateral parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, and Edinger-Westphal nucleus, whether or not animals were exposed to the EPM. Moreover, LY354740 administration per se significantly increased c-Fos expression in regions processing sensory information, including the paraventricular and lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus as well as the nucleus of the optic tract and superior colliculus. In particular, the suppression of fear-evoked neuronal activity in the hippocampus and drug-induced increases in neuronal activation in the CeL have been previously linked to the anxiolytic effects of clinically effective drugs such as benzodiazepines, and thus may contribute to anxiolytic actions of LY354740 in animal models and human anxiety patients.",
