     "AB": "Electrophysiological activity was recorded from single neurons (units) in the hippocampal formation (HF) of freely moving homing pigeons in order to provide a taxonomy of unit types found in the avian HF; a taxonomy that could be used to define regional subdivisions and be compared with unit types found in the mammalian hippocampus. Two distinct types of unit were observed in the avian HF. One type was uniformly characterized by relatively rapid firing rates and shorter spike widths, and was found throughout the HF. The other type was more variable in activity profile but, compared with the fast-firing units, was characterized by slower firing rates and longer spike widths. However, despite the variable nature of the slow-firing units, most slow-firing units recorded within a given anatomical region displayed similar firing rates, spike widths, and interspike intervals. In general, ventral HF units displayed activity patterns similar to projection cells found in the mammalian Ammon's horn. Most dorsocaudal units displayed activity patterns similar to presumed granular cells in the mammalian dentate gyrus. By contrast, most dorsorostral units displayed activity patterns similar to a type of unit found in the mammalian subiculum. Although different in some details, the overall activity profile of units found in the avian HF, and their regional distribution, is strikingly similar to unit types found in the mammalian hippocampus, suggesting that unit activity profile is one hippocampal dimension conserved through evolution.",
