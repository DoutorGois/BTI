     "AB": "In vivo intracellular recordings were obtained from septohippocampal neurons identified by their antidromic response to electrical stimulation of the fimbria in rats anesthetized with pentobarbital or urethane. Beside the antidromic response, fimbria stimulation evoked a short-latency depolarizing potential (EPSP) followed by an hyperpolarizing potential which reversed polarity when recorded with KCl-filled electrodes. This IPSP is therefore likely to be chloride-dependent. It was followed by a long-lasting (80-250 ms) depolarizing potential often associated with a burst of spikes. Septohippocampal neurons therefore receive an inhibitory, chloride-mediated, input which itself triggers a long-lasting excitatory event. These results are consistent with extracellular observations. Their significance in the septohippocampal circuitry is discussed.",
