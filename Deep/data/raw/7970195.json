     "AB": "To clarify the relationship between delayed neuronal death and apoptosis, we made an attempt to detect DNA strand breaks in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons following transient ischemia by an in situ DNA double strand breaks staining. The condensed nuclei of neurons in CA1 were occasionally seen and positively stained 3 days after ischemia. The degenerating dark neurons with condensed nuclei in CA1 markedly increased in number and were clearly stained for DNA strand breaks 5 days after ischemia, whereas normal-looking nuclei remained unstained. No neurons were stained in other hippocampal subfields and dentate gyrus. The present study strongly indicates that the CA1 pyramidal neurons die through an apoptotic process.",
