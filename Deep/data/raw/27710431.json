     "AB": "The aim of this study was to compare the protective effects of curcumin, curcumin-beta-cyclodextrin nanoparticle curcumin (BCD-CUR) and nanoliposomal curcumin (NLC) on unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) induced poison in mice. Curcumin, BCD-CUR, and NLC were prepared and their properties of zeta potential, particle size, encapsulation efficiency, and loading capacity were characterized. Eighty-eight male ICR mice on normal chow diet were randomly divided into 11 groups, and intraperitoneally injected with UDMH alone, or together with different doses of curcumin, BCD-CUR or NLC daily for up to 10 d. Enzyme activities of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were analyzed by fully-automatic analyzer and neurotransmitter levels were determined with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 150 mg/kg curcumin treatment alone significantly reduced levels of serum ALT and LDH that were induced by UDMH and markedly increased level of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) that were reduced by UDMH in the hippocampus. 150 mg/kg BCD-CUR not only decreased significantly the increase of ALT, LDH and glutamate (Glu) but also recovered levels of AST and GABA. 150 mg/kg NLC recovered profoundly levels of AST and GABA while decreased remarkably the UDMH induced increase of ALT, LDH, Glu and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). In addition, treatments with all tested doses of NLC significantly reduced the UMDH induced dopamine (DA), the monoamine neurotransmitter. NLC had more profound protective effects against liver and central nervous system injury induced by UDMH than a suspension of BCD-CUR or curcumin did in mice.",
