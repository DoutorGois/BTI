     "AB": "The Brown-Roberts-Wells (BRW) Arc System can be compared to spatial navigation because both utilize the concept of direction to and spatial location of a point in space by referencing to a horizontal angle (azimuth) and a vertical angle (declination) relative to the horizon. The BRW system also permits the determination of the distance from a reference surface of the arc system to the point (target). The methods of determining these parameters are explained in detail with illustrations.",
