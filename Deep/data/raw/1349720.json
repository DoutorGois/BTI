     "AB": "The expression of the protein products of the immediate-early genes c-fos, Fos B, Fos-related proteins (FRAs), c-jun, jun B, jun D and krox-24 was investigated in the rat hippocampus at various times after electrically-induced hippocampal seizures. Hippocampal seizures induced all the immediate-early gene proteins in dentate granule cells with differing time-courses. In addition, Krox-24, Fos and Jun D were also induced in somatostatin-containing interneurons throughout the hippocampus and also in a small percentage of parvalbumin-containing interneurons. Thus, hippocampal seizures induce waves of immediate-early gene protein expression in dentate granule cells and a selective expression of krox-24, Fos and Jun D in hippocampal somatostatin interneurons. These results suggest that biochemical and/or morphological changes occurring in dentate granule cells and somatostatin interneurons after seizures may be regulated by immediate-early gene expression, and that these immediate-early gene proteins may be involved in seizure development in the nervous system.",
