     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of hippocampal neuron loss in temporal epileptic patients. METHODS: Hippocampal neurons from neonatal rats were taken and a Sombati's epileptic model was established. DNA ladder electrophoresis, TUNEL staining, fluorescence labeling and flow cytometry were used to detect and to quantitate dead neurons. RESULTS: After the treatment of culture solution without magnesium, epileptic discharge occurred. Three to twenty-four hours after treatment, the percentage of necrotic cells in the model group was higher than that in the control group. The difference of percentage of necrotic cells between the two groups was the greatest 6 hours after the treatment (14.65% vs 8.33%). There was no difference in the percentage of necrotic cells between the 2 groups since 24 hours after the treatment. The neuronal apoptosis began at the 6th hour after epileptic discharge. The percentage of apoptic cells in the model group was 14.65%, significantly higher than that in the control group (11.2%, P < 0.01). With the going on of the epileptic process, the difference in percentage of apoptotic neurons between the 2 groups kept on increasing. CONCLUSION: Recurrent epileptic discharge leads to necrosis of neurons in the early stage and induces apoptosis of neurons in the latter stage. The specific death pattern depends on multiple factors.",
