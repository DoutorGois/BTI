     "AB": "The present study investigates, by immunocytochemistry, the behavior of different neuronal subpopulations of the rat hippocampus in neurodegenerative processes induced by the neurotoxicant trimethyltin. The calcium-binding proteins calbindin and parvalbumin are used as selective markers of different neuronal subpopulations. The effects of the neurotoxicant were apparent 21 days after a single i.p. administration with severe neuronal loss, which was significant in CAI and CA3, as revealed by cell counts after cresyl violet staining. Immunolabeling with calbindin D28-k (CB) and parvalbumin (PV) indicated severe cell loss of CB-containing neurons, essentially reflecting the generalized neuronal loss, while PV-containing neurons appeared to be selectively spared by the neurotoxicant-induced degeneration.",
