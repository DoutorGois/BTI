     "AB": "Dynamic regulation of synaptic AMPA receptor localization underlies certain forms of synaptic plasticity and researchers are just beginning to identify molecules that may play a role in the synaptic delivery of glutamate receptors. One candidate is mLin-10, the mammalian homolog of the C. elegans receptor targeting protein LIN-10. Here, we investigated the role of mLin-10 in glutamate receptor trafficking. Cellular localization studies, in both whole brain and cultured neurons, revealed that mLin-10 is enriched in the trans-Golgi network and present in dendrites and spines--regions where protein sorting and synaptic delivery are known to occur. The specific localization of mLin-10 in Golgi is disrupted by a point mutation in an mLin-10 PDZ domain, indicating that a PDZ domain mediates this localization. Interactions between mLin-10 and glutamate receptors in both intracellular and synaptic membrane fractions were detected through biochemical assays. GST-pull down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments in heterologous cells delineated the protein domains required for interaction. These results demonstrated that glutamate receptors interact directly with mLin-10 through a PDZ domain-mediated mechanism. A PDZ point mutation enhances surface delivery of exogenous glutamate receptors in transfected neurons, suggesting that mLin-10 may regulate AMPA receptor trafficking in vivo.",
