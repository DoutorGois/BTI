     "AB": "In a previous study of a kindling model using stimulation of the entorhinal cortex we found a redistribution of synaptic vesicles into the close vicinity of the active zone of synapses of Type I (Gray 1959) in the hippocampal gyrus dentatus. In this paper, ultrastructural studies of the same model are being continued using planimetry of the synaptic apparatus. A significant increase of the postsynaptic apparatus, area enlargement by 53%, increase of the perimeter by 28% and shape irregularity are being reported. No changes in shape or in size have been demonstrated in presynaptic structures or in the morphology of presynaptic mitochondria. These findings are discussed in relation to increased functional readiness of the synapses as signs of active reconstruction of the synaptic apparatus.",
