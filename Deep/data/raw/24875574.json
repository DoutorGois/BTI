     "AB": "Voltage-gated calcium channels regulate gene expression by controlling calcium entry through the plasma membrane and by direct interactions of channel fragments and auxiliary beta subunits with promoters and the epigenetic machinery in the nucleus. Mutations of the calcium channel beta(4) subunit gene (CACNB4) cause juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in humans and ataxia and epileptic seizures in mice. Recently a model has been proposed according to which failed nuclear translocation of the truncated beta(4) subunit R482X mutation resulted in altered transcriptional regulation and consequently in neurological disease. Here we examined the nuclear targeting properties of the truncated beta(4b(1-481)) subunit in tsA-201 cells, skeletal myotubes, and in hippocampal neurons. Contrary to expectation, nuclear targeting of beta(4b(1-481)) was not reduced compared with full-length beta(4b) in any one of the three cell systems. These findings oppose an essential role of the beta(4) distal C-terminus in nuclear targeting and challenge the idea that the nuclear function of calcium channel beta(4) subunits is critically involved in the etiology of epilepsy and ataxia in patients and mouse models with mutations in the CACNB4 gene.",
