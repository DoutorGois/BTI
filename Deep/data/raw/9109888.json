     "AB": "We examined the relation of APOE-epsilon 4, hippocampal volume, and cognitive performance in ten pairs of cognitively normal twins who had a mean age of 62.5 years (SD = 7.8). There were no significant differences in neuropsychological measures of the groups categorized by the presence of an epsilon 4 allele. However, the mean normalized right and left hippocampal volumes were smaller in the epsilon 4 groups compared to the group without epsilon 4. Combined with prior reports, these findings suggest that epsilon 4 is associated with differences in brain morphology that may be evident when no symptoms of dementia are present.",
