     "AB": "Stress-induced helplessness in rodents constitutes a well-defined model to investigate neurobiological mechanisms of depression. Neurotrophins like nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have both been shown to be involved in neurobiological changes of physiological and pathological reactions to stress. In this study we investigated NGF and BDNF protein levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus in mice treated with an established model of inducible helplessness via electric footshocks compared to untreated controls at various times (0 h up to 14 days after treatment). NGF levels were transiently decreased by one forth in the frontal cortex of shocked mice at 6 h after the stress treatment, whereas BDNF levels remained unchanged in the brain areas investigated throughout the time course. In addition, frontal cortex BDNF levels showed a significantly higher concentration in the right compared to the left hemisphere (up to 3-fold). This effect was detectable independently of treatment, namely in shocked and control mice at any time point measured. In conclusion, a transient decrease of frontal NGF constitutes the most striking correlate of neurobiological changes in this animal model of stress-induced change of behaviour. Interhemispherical differences of BDNF content in the frontal cortex are a new finding that might reflect intracerebral side dominance. Thus, subsequent studies of frontal cortex BDNF expression should carefully consider an interhemispherical variance to avoid misinterpretation.",
