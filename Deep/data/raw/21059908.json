     "AB": "Ca(2+)/calmodulin protein kinase IIalpha (CaMKIIalpha) has a central role in regulating neuronal excitability. It is well established that CaMKIIalpha translocates to excitatory synapses following strong glutamatergic stimuli that induce NMDA-receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation in CA1 hippocampal neurons. We now show that CaMKIIalpha translocates to inhibitory but not excitatory synapses in response to more moderate NMDAR-activating stimuli that trigger GABA(A)-receptor (GABA(A)R) insertion and enhance inhibitory transmission. Such moderate NMDAR activation causes Thr286 autophosphorylation of CaMKIIalpha, which our results demonstrate is necessary and sufficient, under basal conditions, to localize CaMKIIalpha at inhibitory synapses and enhance surface GABA(A)R expression. Although stronger glutamatergic stimulation coupled to AMPA receptor insertion also elicits Thr286 autophosphorylation, accumulation of CaMKIIalpha at inhibitory synapses is prevented under these conditions by the phosphatase calcineurin. This preferential targeting of CaMKIIalpha to glutamatergic or GABAergic synapses provides neurons with a mechanism whereby activity can selectively potentiate excitation or inhibition through a single kinase mediator.",
