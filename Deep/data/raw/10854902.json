     "AB": "We have evaluated the neuroprotective effects of the decahydroisoquinoline LY377770, a novel iGlu5 kainate receptor antagonist, in two models of cerebral ischaemia. Global ischaemia, induced in gerbils by bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) for 5 min, produced a large increase in locomotor activity at 96 hr post-occlusion and a severe loss of CA1 cells in the hippocampus histologically at 120 hr post-occlusion. LY377770 (80 mg/kg i.p. 30 min before or 30 min after BCAO followed by 40 mg/kg i.p. administered at 3 and 6 hr after the initial dose) attenuated the ischaemia-induced hyperactivity and provided (92%) and (29%) protection in the CA1 cells respectively. This protection was greater than that seen with maximally tolerated doses of other glutamate receptor antagonists (CGS19755, CPP, MK-801, ifenprodil, eliprodil, HA-966, ACEA1021, L701,324, NBQX, LY293558, GYKI52466 and LY300164). Focal ischaemia was induced by infusing 200 pmol of endothelin-1 (Et-1) adjacent to the middle cerebral artery and LY377770 was administered at 80 mg/kg i.p. immediately, 1 or 2 hr post-occlusion followed by 40 mg/kg i.p. 3 and 6 hr after the first dose. The infarct volume, measured 72 hr later, was reduced by LY377770 when given immediately (P<0.01), at 1 hr (P<0.05) but not significantly at 2 hr post-occlusion. Reference compounds, LY293558 (20 mg/kg i.p. and then 10 mg/kg as above) and MK-801 (2.5 mg/kg i.p. ), both administered immediately post-occlusion produced significant (P<0.05) but somewhat less neuroprotection. In parallel microdialysis studies, LY377770 (75 mg/kg i.p.) attenuated ischaemia-induced increases in extracellular levels of glutamate, but not of dopamine. In conclusion, these results indicated that iGlu5 kainate receptors play a central role in ischaemic brain damage following global and focal cerebral ischaemia. LY377770 is a novel, soluble, systemically active iGlu5 antagonist with efficacy in global and focal ischaemia, even when administered post-occlusion. LY377770 may therefore be useful as a neuroprotectant in man.",
