     "AB": "Although evidence shows that victims of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) suffer repetitive episodes of hypoxemia, only subtle abnormalities have been found in their brains by light microscopy. The aim of the present study was to determine whether apoptosis, a form of cell death that can be triggered by hypoxemia and that leaves no scarring detectable by light microscopy, would be present in hypoxia-sensitive brain regions of SIDS victims. We looked for the presence of apoptosis with an in situ end-labeling method that detects DNA fragmentation. We studied 29 SIDS victims who were age-matched to nine control cases. We found significant neuronal apoptosis in 79% of the SIDS cases: 55% of the cases positive in the hippocampus and 96% positive in the brainstem. Whereas the distribution of apoptosis in the hippocampus was in hypoxia-sensitive subregions, the distribution in the brainstem was mostly in dorsal nuclei, including those involved with sensation in the face and position of the head (nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract and vestibular nuclei). The control cases showed no significant apoptosis in the hippocampus and a mild degree in the brainstem in three cases. Our results indicate the occurrence of an acute insult at least several hours before death, an insult from which the infants had apparently recuperated. This suggests that SIDS victims suffered repeated apoptosis resulting in significant neuronal damage and, thus, functional loss in key brain regions. The involvement of specific nuclei in the brainstem may be linked to the fact that prone sleeping is a significant risk factor for SIDS. Enhanced neuronal death by apoptosis may thus have major implications for understanding the sequence of events leading to SIDS.",
