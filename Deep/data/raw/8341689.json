     "AB": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are neuronal survival molecules which utilize the Trk family of tyrosine kinase receptors. Using double-label in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that mRNAs for BDNF and its high-affinity receptor TrkB are coexpressed in hippocampal and cortical neurons. Also, a large number of neurons in these areas coexpress NGF and BDNF mRNAs. Epileptic seizures lead to increased levels of both BDNF/TrkB and NGF/BDNF mRNAs in double-labeled cells. Our results show that individual neurons of the central nervous system can coexpress neurotrophins and their receptors and produce two neurotrophic factors. These factors could support neuronal survival after brain insults, not only via retrograde transport but also through autocrine mechanisms.",
