     "AB": "Pilocarpine (PILO), a muscarinic agonist, produces status epilepticus when administered to rats in vivo and induces interictal or ictal patterns of epileptiform activity in rat hippocampal slices. We investigated the effects of PILO (10 microM) on paired pulse inhibition (PPI) in the CA3 region of rat hippocampal slices. PPI was assessed by stimulating either the alveus or str. radiatum and recording the extracellular response from str. pyramidale of CA3. The evoked population spike following the second stimulus was compared to the first. PILO was bath applied for 1 h and then washed out to assess acute and long lasting effects. PILO decreased the amplitude of evoked population spikes measured in CA3. PPI following alveus stimulation was not affected by PILO; however, a significant loss of PPI at 15 and 30 ms interpulse intervals occurred following str. radiatum stimulation in the presence of PILO and 5 mM [K+]o artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). The decrease in PPI at the 15 ms interval persisted following wash-out of PILO. PILO in 7.5 mM [K+]o ACSF produced epileptiform activity and a resultant long lasting loss of PPI that followed str. radiatum stimulation. This effect was not observed following epileptiform activity produced by 7.5 mM [K+]o alone, suggesting that the loss of PPI was due to PILO. Because str. radiatum-evoked PPI was selectively impaired, PILO appears to preferentially decreased feed-forward inhibition. The more dramatic loss of PPI following exposure to PILO and high [K+]o may represent the first steps in the development of chronic seizures that results from PILO-induced status epilepticus in rats.",
