     "AB": "The effect of an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine on wet-dog shaking (WDS; also, WDS = wet-dog shakes) induced by electrical stimulation of the hippocampus was investigated. Clonidine (0.01-0.32 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited the appearance of WDS in a dose-dependent manner without showing any effect on hippocampal afterdischarge. Although clonidine has been reported to inhibit the activity not only of noradrenergic but also of serotonergic neurons, a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) antagonist, cinanserin at doses up to 32 mg/kg had no significant effect on hippocampal stimulation-induced WDS. Therefore, a possible anti-5-HT action of clonidine in the inhibition of WDS can be excluded. The WDS inhibition produced by clonidine was blocked significantly by pretreatment of the rats with an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, but not with a narcotic antagonist, naloxone. The present results suggest that a central noradrenergic function may be involved in WDS induced by hippocampal stimulation.",
