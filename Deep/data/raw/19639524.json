     "AB": "Recent studies have shown that exposure to hyperoxia in infant rats leads to extensive apoptotic degeneration in the cortex and white matter of the developing brain. Besides its antiepileptic effects, topiramate exerts neuroprotective effects in animal models of stroke, hypoxia ischemia, excitotoxic insults, and status epilepticus. In the present study, we investigated the effects of topiramate against hyperoxia-induced neurodegeneration in the developing brain. Eighteen Wistar rat pups were divided into three groups: control group, hyperoxia+phosphate buffered saline treated group and hyperoxia+topiramate treated group. Hyperoxia groups were exposed to 80% oxygen (n=12) in plexiglas chambers in which the oxygen concentration was monitored twice daily from birth until postnatal day five. The hyperoxia+topiramate group received an intraperitoneal injection of topiramate at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day. At postnatal day 5, all animals were killed. Neuronal cell death and apoptosis were evaluated. Histopathological examination showed that topiramate significantly diminished apoptosis in the CA1 region and dentate gyrus of hippocampus. Topiramate may offer a therapeutic potential for neuroprotection under conditions of hyperoxic brain injury.",
