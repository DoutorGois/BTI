     "AB": "The expression of the c-fos proto-oncogene, as estimated by immunohistochemistry of the FOS nuclear protein, was studied in both focal and generalized seizures induced in rats by systemic administration of pilocarpine. Focal seizures, as indicated by the occurrence of stereotyped oral movements, chewing and sniffing, were evoked by either a subconvulsant dose of pilocarpine (200 mg/kg) or the association of a convulsant dose of pilocarpine (400 mg/kg) with SCH 23390, a selective D-1 dopamine receptor antagonist. This seizure pattern resulted in FOS accumulation in certain limbic areas, namely, the piriform cortex, amygdala, and olfactory tubercle. On the other hand, in rats developing generalized seizures, accumulation of FOS was also found in hippocampus, cingulate cortex, frontal cortex, striatum, accumbens, as well as in certain thalamic nuclei. Generalized seizures, including motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus, were induced by either a convulsant dose of pilocarpine (400 mg/kg) or a low dose of pilocarpine (15-200 mg/kg) combined with either lithium or the D-1 selective agonist SKF 38393. These findings indicate a close correlation between the sequence of behavioural alterations induced by pilocarpine and the proto-oncogene activation. The results provide the basis for mapping the areas of origin and the pathways of generalization of seizure activity. As shown by the effects of dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists, the process of generalization appears to be controlled by the dopamine system.",
