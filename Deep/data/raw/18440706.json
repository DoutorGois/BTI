     "AB": "There is little information on the molecular mechanisms in FK506-mediated neuroprotection. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of FK506, an immunosuppressant and neuroprotectant, on trimethyltin (TMT)-induced neurotoxicity in the rat hippocampus. Histologically, TMT-induced neuronal damage was partially prevented by FK506 in the hippocampal CA1 region, but not in CA3. FK506 treatment significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells in CA1, but not in CA3, and also prevented induction of cognitive deficits by TMT. Microarray analysis of the rat hippocampus detected 14 genes with TMT-induced alteration of mRNA expression that was rescued by FK506 treatment. Subsequent quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed elevated mRNA levels for four inflammatory genes, glutathione S-transferase, lysozyme, matrix Gla protein, and osteopontin after TMT treatment. Upregulation of these genes was reversed by FK506 treatment at 5 days postgavage. Immunohistochemistry revealed that FK506 reduced osteopontin (OPN) induction by TMT in the periarterial area at 5 days postgavage. Our data suggest that inflammatory gene expression is involved in TMT-induced damage to the hippocampal CA1 region, resulting in apoptosis, and that this process is initiated by periarterial OPN activation, and can be alleviated by FK506.",
