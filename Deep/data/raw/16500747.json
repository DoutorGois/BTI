     "AB": "Ageing is associated with a decrease in the brain content of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and with decreased neuroplasticity. The glutamate receptor subunits GluR2 and NR2B play a significant role in forebrain synaptic plasticity. We investigated GluR2 and NR2B in the aged prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum, and tested if treatment with a preparation containing EPA and DHA can reverse age-related changes. The study compared adult and old (3-4 and 24-26 month) rats, and the latter were fed a standard diet or a diet supplemented for 12 weeks with omega-3 PUFA at 270mg/kg/day (ratio EPA to DHA 1.5:1). Ageing was associated with decreases in the GluR2 and NR2B subunits in all structures. These decreases were fully reversed by omega-3 PUFA supplementation. Age-related changes in the phospholipid PUFA content were also seen. Decreases in DHA were mostly corrected by supplementation. This study supports the neuroprotective effect of omega-3 fatty acids in brain ageing, and illustrates specific mechanisms underlying this effect.",
