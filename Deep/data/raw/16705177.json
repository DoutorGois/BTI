     "AB": "CPEB-mediated translation is important in early development and neuronal synaptic plasticity. Here, we describe a new eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein, Neuroguidin (Ngd), and its interaction with CPEB. In the mammalian nervous system, Ngd is detected as puncta in axons and dendrites and in growth cones and filopodia. Ngd contains three motifs that resemble those present in eIF4G, 4EBP, Cup, and Maskin, all of which are eIF4E binding proteins. Ngd binds eIF4E directly, and all three motifs must be deleted to abrogate the interaction between these two proteins. In injected Xenopus oocytes, Ngd binds CPEB and, most importantly, represses translation in a cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE)-dependent manner. In Xenopus embryos, Ngd is found in both neural tube and neural crest cells. The injection of morpholino-containing antisense oligonucleotides directed against ngd mRNA disrupts neural tube closure and neural crest migration; however, the wild-type phenotype is restored by the injection of a rescuing ngd mRNA. These data suggest that Ngd guides neural development by regulating the translation of CPE-containing mRNAs.",
