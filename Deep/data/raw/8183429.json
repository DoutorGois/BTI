     "AB": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of arachidonic acid on [3H]d-aspartate outflow in rat hippocampus synaptosomes and slices. Arachidonic acid 1) increased basal outflow of [3H]d-aspartate in both synaptosomes and slices, and 2) increased K(+)-evoked overflow in slices but not in synaptosomes. The latter effect was dependent (at least in part) on arachidonic acid metabolism, most likely mediated by lipo-oxygenase metabolites and free radical production. It was prevented by nordihydroguairetic acid but not by indomethacin, and was significantly reduced by free radical scavengers (superoxide-dismutase and catalase). This effect was dependent upon stimulation since it could not be observed after a continuous perfusion of arachidonic acid in the absence of stimulation. Furthermore, it was long-lasting since a 30 min perfusion of arachidonic acid was sufficient to exert a significant effect on a stimulation following termination of the application.",
