     "AB": "Following systemic administration of the noradrenaline (NA) neurotoxin, DSP4 (50 mg/kg), rats were found to be retarded in the rate at which they acquired the \"right-turn\" running response in a modified T-maze choice situation, as measured by the total number of errors per session and median latency to reach the goal box. Desipramine (DMI, 20 mg/kg), injected 30 min before DSP4 blocked the acquisition retardation. DSP4 was found to have a short-lasting effect upon spontaneous motor activity, while food and water intake recovery was complete within 7 days of the injection. Both the NA-accumulation data and endogenous NA concentrations indicated profound NA, but not 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA), depletions in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. These data seem to confirm the role of the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system in an instrumental learning situation.",
