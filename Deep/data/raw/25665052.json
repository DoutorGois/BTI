     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Selective head cooling (SHC) with moderate hypothermia (HT) and whole-body cooling are beneficial following perinatal asphyxia. SHC with systemic normothermia (NT) or minimal HT is under-investigated, could obviate systemic complications of moderate HT, and be applicable to preterm infants. We hypothesized that minimal systemic HT with SHC following hypoxia-ischemia (HI) would be neuroprotective compared with systemic NT. METHODS: Newborn pigs underwent global HI causing permanent brain injury before being randomized to NT (rectal temperature (Trectal) 38.5 degrees C) or minimal HT (Trectal 37.0 degrees C) with SHC (cooling cap and body wrap) for 48 h followed by 24-h NT with 72-h survival. RESULTS: SHC did not reduce global or regional neuropathology score when correcting for insult severity or compared with a NT group matched for HI severity but increased mortality by 26%. During 48 h, the SHC mean +/- SD Trectal was 37.0 +/- 0.2 degrees C, and Tdeep brain and Tsuperficial brain were 35.0 +/- 1.1 degrees C and 31.5 +/- 1.6 degrees C, respectively, with stable Tbrain achieved >/= 3 h after starting cooling. CONCLUSION: This is the first study in newborn pigs of minimal systemic HT with SHC for 48 h and a further 24 h of NT following HI. Mortality was increased in the cooled group with no neuroprotection in survivors.",
