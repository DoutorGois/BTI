     "AB": "Neuronal degeneration has been shown to be involved in various neurological disorders. Growth/trophic factors and their receptors are known to be important for the regeneration and survival of neurons. We report here the molecular cloning of a receptor-like protein tyrosine kinase, bsk, (for brain specific kinase). Bsk is highly related to the eph/elk receptor-like kinase family members. Northern blot analysis shows that it is expressed specifically in the brain, with no expression detected in adult heart, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney. In situ hybridization analysis of adult mouse brain sections indicates that bsk is expressed at high levels in the hippocampus, tenia tecta, indusium griseum, and the piriform cortex, major components of the limbic system that are important for learning and memory. In addition, elevated levels of expression are found in other areas of the limbic system such as the amygdala, medial septum, and nucleus of the diagonal band, and in the olfactory bulb, which has close connections to the limbic system. The highest level of expression is found in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and the pyramidal cell layer of the piriform cortex. In 16.5 day mouse embryos, bsk is expressed predominantly in the primordial cortex of the telencephalon. An antibody against a C-terminal peptide of bsk recognized a 105 kD protein in the 16.5 day embryonic head extract. Our analysis shows that bsk is a growth factor receptor-like protein tyrosine kinase and that its greatest expression in the adult brain is associated with components of the limbic system.",
