     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) can promote neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of rat hippocampus. METHODS: Western blot analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and immunofluorescent double labeling combined with confocal microscope were used to detect neurogenesis in the DG of the hippocampus in rats after ICH. RESULTS: The expression of DCX protein in the ipsilateral DG of the hippocampus was enhanced in the rats 1 day after ICH (0.202-/+0.062) as compared with that in normal rats (0.127-/+0.088), reaching the peak level at 14 days (0.771-/+0.108, P<0.01) and beginning to decrease at 28 days (0.582-/+0.121, P<0.01). Meanwhile, DCX-positive cells and BrdU-positive cells, and DCX/BrdU double-labeled cells were detected in the DG of the hippocampus. Compared with those in the control group, BrdU/NeuN double-labeled cells were markedly increased in the granular cell layer of the DG at 28 days after ICH (1.808-/+1.020 vs 5.654-/+1.671, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: ICH can promote neurogenesis in the DG of rat hippocampus.",
