     "AB": "In the present study, we investigated expressions of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) and of the plasma membrane glutamate transporters [glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) and excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC-1)] in the gerbil hippocampus following transient ischaemia. The expressional levels and distribution patterns of VGLUT immunoreactivities were unaltered until 3 days after ischaemic-insults. However, VGLUT-2 immunoreactivity in the CA1 region was reduced at 4 days after ischaemia due to delayed neuronal death. In addition, both GLT-1 and GLAST immunoreactivities in the CA1 region were enhanced at 30 min - 12 h after ischaemia-reperfusion and their expression began to reduce at 24 h after ischaemia-reperfusion. In contrast, EAAC-1 immunoreactivity was transiently reduced in the CA1 region at 30 min after ischaemia, re-enhanced at 3-12 h after ischaemia, and re-reduced at 24 h after ischaemia. These findings suggest that malfunctions of plasma membrane glutamate transporters, not of VGLUT, may play an important role in the elevation of extracellular glutamate concentration following ischaemic insults.",
