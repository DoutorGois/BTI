     "AB": "Electrolytic lesions made in the medial septum of the rat brain caused an 80% decrease in the activity of choline acetyltransferase and a 33% reduction in ATP-citrate lyase activity in the synaptosomal fraction from the hippocampus. Decreases in the activities of the two enzymes in the cytosol (S3) fraction were 70 and 13%, respectively. The activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, acetyl-CoA synthase, and carnitine acetyltransferase in crude hippocampal homogenates and in subcellular fractions were not affected by septal lesions. The data indicate that ATP-citrate lyase is linked to the septal-hippocampal pathway and that the enzyme is preferentially located in cholinergic nerve endings that terminate within the hippocampus.",
