     "AB": "Diazepam modulation of native gamma2-containing GABA(A) (gammaGABA(A)) receptors increases channel conductance by facilitating protein interactions involving the gamma2-subunit amphipathic (MA) region, which is found in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 (Everitt et al., 2009). However, many drugs, predicted to act on different GABA(A) receptor subtypes, increase channel conductance leading us to hypothesize that conductance variation in GABA(A) receptors may be a general property, mediated by protein interactions involving the cytoplasmic MA stretch of amino acids. In this study we have tested this hypothesis by potentiating extrasynaptic GABA(A) currents with etomidate and examining the ability of peptides mimicking either the gamma2- or delta-subunit MA region to affect conductance. In inside-out hippocampal patches from newborn rats the general anesthetic etomidate potentiated GABA currents, producing either an increase in open probability and single-channel conductance or an increase in open probability, as described previously (Seymour et al., 2009). In patches displaying high conductance channels application of a delta((392-422)) MA peptide, but not a scrambled version or the equivalent gamma2((381-403)) MA peptide, reduced the potentiating effects of etomidate, significantly reducing single-channel conductance. In contrast, when GABA currents were potentiated by the gamma2-specific drug diazepam the delta MA peptide had no effect. These data reveal that diazepam and etomidate potentiate different extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor subtypes but both drugs modulate conductance similarly. One interpretation of the data is that these drugs elicit potentiation through protein interactions and that the MA peptides compete with these interactions to disrupt this process.",
