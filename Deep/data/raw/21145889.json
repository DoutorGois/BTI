     "AB": "Hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) is a major factor in the pathogenesis of developmental brain injury, leading to cognitive deficits and motor disabilities in preterm infants. The haematopoietic growth factor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been shown to exert a neuroprotective activity in rodent models of ischaemic stroke and is currently subject to phase I/II clinical trials in adults. Results of studies examining the effect of G-CSF in perinatal brain damage have been contradictory. We have previously shown that G-CSF increases NMDAR-mediated excitotoxic brain injury in the neonatal mouse brain. In this study, we evaluated the effect of G-CSF on long-term outcomes after HI. On postnatal day 5, mice pubs were first randomly assigned to a sham operation or HI and then divided into four treatment groups: i) G-CSF; ii) phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 1h after injury; iii) G-CSF and iv) PBS 60 h after injury. G-CSF (200 mug/kg BW) was administered five times within a 24h interval. Neuromotor and cognitive outcomes were assessed by open-field, novel object recognition tests and rotarod tests starting on P90, with subsequent histological analyses of brain injury. G-CSF treatment did not improve either neurobehavioural outcomes or brain injuries. Interestingly, the application of PBS and G-CSF in the acute phase increased brain damage in the hippocampus. We could not confirm the neuroprotective properties of G-CSF in neonatal HI brain damage. The exacerbation of injury by the administration of substances in the acute phase might indicate a heightened state of neurological sensitivity that is specific to mechanisms of secondary neurodegeneration and influenced by unidentified external factors possibly associated with the treatment protocol during the acute phase.
