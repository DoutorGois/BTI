     "AB": "It has been proposed that DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice perform differently on some learning and memory tasks because of functional differences in the hippocampal formation. To evaluate this hypothesis, DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice were tested on 2 forms of conditioned fear: contextual fear conditioning, which depends on the integrity of the hippocampal formation, and auditory cue conditioning, which does not. Both mouse strains displayed equivalent conditioning when the auditory cue was paired with shock, but DBA/2 mice showed significantly less conditioning to the context in which shock was experienced. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the pattern of spared and impaired performance, which DBA/2 mice display on a variety of learning and memory tasks, is related to impaired hippocampal formation function.",
