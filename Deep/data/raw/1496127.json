     "AB": "1. Recordings were obtained from transverse slices of rat hippocampus, which were placed in a perfusion chamber and superfused with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. 2. The effects of 10 microM (+)- or (-)-oxaprotiline applied by the bath were examined on the population spike, postsynaptic excitability in low Ca2+-high Mg2+ medium, the epileptiform discharge in Mg2+-free medium and long-term potentiation (LTP). Only the last paradigm (LTP) was significantly enhanced by (+)-oxaprotiline. 3. In rats chronically injected with (+)-oxaprotiline, neither LTP nor the actions of a variety of neurotransmitters in low Ca2+-high Mg2+ medium were significantly altered. 4. Intracellular recordings showed a small depolarization (3.5 +/- 1.6 mV) in response to 10 microM (+)- or (-)-oxaprotiline. Neither input resistance nor inward rectification, long-lasting afterhyperpolarization or accommodation were significantly altered. 5. Acute application, but not chronic treatment with (+)-oxaprotiline affects long-term potentiation in the hippocampal slice, presumably due to an effect on gabaergic inhibition.",
