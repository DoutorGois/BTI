     "AB": "The learned helplessness (LH) developed after repeat inescapable stress is a well validated animal model of human major depression and is not species specific. c-Fos, the protein product of the protooncogene c-fos, is expressed in neurons under a variety of stressors and could reflect the regional neuronal activation. Using the LH paradigm in mice, we examined c-Fos expression in several brain regions related to stress response or major depression. The LH mice showed significantly lower c-Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in the hippocampus dentate gyrus and the lateral septal nucleus, and higher FLI in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus compared with the naive mice. Our finding in the mice LH model supported previous studies in rats showing that the lateral septal nucleus and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus are important in LH behaviors. We further demonstrated that hippocampus dentate gyrus, a region important for learning and major depression, may also be involved in the LH behaviors. These related brain regions could provide a basis for further exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying LH behaviors.",
