     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Activation of principal hippocampal neurons is controlled by feedforward and feedback inhibition mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons. The effects of halothane on glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic excitation of inhibitory interneurons have not been reported yet. METHODS: The effects of halothane on glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents and on spike threshold in visually identified interneurons were studied with tight-seal, whole-cell voltage- and current-clamp recordings in thin slices from adult mouse hippocampus. The excitatory postsynaptic currents were pharmacologically isolated into their N-methyl-D-aspartate and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated components using selective antagonists. RESULTS: Halothane (0.37-2.78 mM) reversibly blocked non-N-methyl-D-aspartate and N-methyl-D-aspartate excitatory postsynaptic currents in hippocampal oriens-alveus interneurons. Half-maximal inhibition was observed at similar concentrations (0.59 mM and 0.50 mM, respectively). Halothane inhibited synaptically generated action potentials at concentrations that did not elevate the spike threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Halothane blocks glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic activation of inhibitory interneurons in the mouse hippocampus.",
