     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of MDA, SOD, LDH of cultured hippocampal neurons injury induced by amyloid-beta protein (Abeta 25-35) and the protective effect of puerarin and ligustrazine. METHOD: Primary hippocampal neurons were cultured and induced by Abeta 25-35. The concentrations of MDA, SOD and LDH in cultured hippocampal neurons were measured after exposed to Abeta 25-35, puerarin and ligustrazine. RESULT: The Alzheimer disease (AD) model was successfully established in cultured hippocampal neurons. AD group has remarkably increased MDA and LDH level, and decreased SOD level, Piracetan group and combined application group of have remarkably decreased MDA and LDH level and increased SOD level, compared with AD group (P < 0.01). Ligustrazine together with puerarin group has remarkably decreased MDA and LDH level and increased SOD level, compared with ligustrazine group and puerarin group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Abeta 25-35 can induce cultured hippocampal neurons injury, combined application of ligustrazine, and puerarin can alleviate the injury.",
