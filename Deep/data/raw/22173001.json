     "AB": "Environmental enrichment has been shown to have profound effects on the healthy adult brain and as a remedial tool for brains compromised by injury, disease, or negative experience. Based upon these findings and evidence from the prenatal stress literature, we ventured an exploratory study to examine the effects of parental enrichment on offspring development. Using Long Evans rats, paternal enrichment was achieved by housing sires in enriched environments for 28 days prior to mating with a control female. For the maternal enrichment paradigm, female rats were also housed in enriched environments for 28 days (7 days prior to conception and for the duration of pregnancy). Increased size, multiple levels for exploration, an abundance of stimulating toys, and numerous cagemates for social interaction were characteristic of the enriched environments. Offspring were assessed using two early behavioral tests and then sacrificed at postnatal day 21 (P21). Brain tissue from the frontal cortex and hippocampus was harvested for global DNA methylation analysis. Parental enrichment, preconceptionally and prenatally, altered offspring behavior on the negative geotaxis task and openfield exploratory behavior task. Paternal enrichment significantly decreased offspring brain weight at P21. Additionally, both environmental enrichment paradigms significantly decreased global methylation levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of male and female offspring. This study demonstrates that positive prenatal experiences; preconceptionally in fathers and prenatally in mothers, have the ability to significantly alter offspring developmental trajectories.",
