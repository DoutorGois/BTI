     "AB": "Recent studies have highlighted a variety of cognitive effects caused by cholinolytic drug injections into different cortical structures. These findings were largely interpreted as evidence for location-specific cholinergic modulation of synaptic encoding mechanisms. Here, using evoked field responses in anaesthetized rat dorsal hippocampus we show that in addition to reinforcement of synaptic connections (long-term potentiation, LTP), endogenous acetylcholine also regulates firing gain of CA1 pyramidal neurons (EPSP-spike potentiation). Gain augmentation upon increase in cholinergic drive involves evoked synchronous firing at both apical and basal afferent projections, unlike enhancement of activity-induced LTP constrained to the basal afferent system. These data indicate that acetylcholine can act as an effective input and gain controller in the hippocampus. Modulation of synaptic plasticity would determine the relative dominance of afferent inputs while the facilitation of synchronous firing is likely to promote a more generalized spread of excitation and long range communication within the limbic cortex.",
