     "AB": "A reaction of high-temperature solid-phase catalytic isotope exchange (HSCIE) was studied for the preparation of tritium- and deuterium-labeled ligands of glutamate and dopamine receptors. Tritium-labeled (5S,10R)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclopenten-5,10-imine ([G-(3)H]MK-801) and R(+)-7-hydroxy-N,N-di-n-propyl-2-aminotetraline ([G-(3)H]-7-OH-DPAT) were obtained with a specific activity of 210 and 120 Ci/mol, respectively. The isotopomeric distribution of deuterium-labeled ligands was studied using time-of-flight mass-spectrometer MX 5310 (ESI-o-TOF) with electrospray and orthogonal ion injection. Mean deuterium incorporation per ligand molecule was 11.09 and 3.21 atoms for [G-(2)H]MK-801 and [G-(2)H]-7-OH-DPAT, respectively. The isotope label was shown to be distributed all over the ligand molecule. The radioreceptor binding of tritium-labeled ligands [G-(3)H]MK-801 and [G-(3)H]-7-OH-DPAT was analyzed using the brain structure of Vistar rats. It was demonstrated that [G-(3)H]MK-801 specifically binds to hippocampus membranes with K(d) 8.3 +/- 1.4 nM, B(max) being 3345 +/- 300 fmol/mg protein. The [G-(3)H]-7-OH-DPAT ligand specifically binds to rat striatum membranes with K(d) 10.01 +/- 0.91 nM and B(max) 125 +/- 4.5 fmol/mg protein. It was concluded that the HSCIE reaction can be used for the preparation of highly tritium-labeled (+)-MK-801 and 7-OH-DPAT with retention of their physiological activities.",
