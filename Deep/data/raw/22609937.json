     "AB": "Prostaglandin (PG) F(2alpha) is one of the major prostanoids biosynthesized by cyclooxygenases (COXs) from arachidonic acid. Although it has been reported that there is a selective surge in PGF(2alpha) production in the hippocampus during kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure activity, the precise intra-hippocampal distribution of PGF(2alpha) has not been elucidated due to the paucity of effective histological techniques for detecting PGs in tissues. We investigated the tissue distribution of PGF(2alpha) in the rat hippocampus 30 min after KA injection by developing fixation and immunohistological-staining methods. To detect PGF(2alpha) directly on histological sections, we used systemic perfusion fixation with water-soluble carbodiimide fixative, followed by immersion of the brains in Zamboni's fixative. We then performed immunofluorescence staining with anti-PGF(2alpha) antibody, with negative control experiments used to confirm the staining specificity. Definitive immunolabeling for PGF(2alpha) was evident most markedly in pyramidal cells of the hippocampal cornu Ammonis (CA) 3 sector and neurons of the hilus in KA-treated rats. Immunolabeling for PGF(2alpha) was also evident in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Double immunfluorescence staining revealed that PGF(2alpha)-immunopositive neurons expressed cytosolic phospholipases A(2), COX-2, and FP receptor. These results suggest that the major source of PGF(2alpha) production immediately after KA injection was neurons of the hippocampal CA3 sector, hilus and dentate gyrus. These neurons exert PGF(2alpha)-mediated functions via FP receptors in an autocrine/paracrine manner and may play pathophysiological roles in the acute phase (30 min) of excitotoxicity.",
