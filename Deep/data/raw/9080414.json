     "AB": "Halothane-anesthetized male rats were subjected to either moderately severe parasagittal fluid percussion-induced traumatic brain injury (TBI) or sham injury, and for 30 min immediately after injury hypoxia was induced in half the rats from each group by substituting a 13% O2 source to deliver halothane for continued anesthesia. At 60 min post-TBI, Northern blot analysis showed a significant increase in c-fos mRNA levels, by 60-100% above sham control levels in the frontal cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. Although hypoxia in sham-injured rats did not by itself alter c-fos mRNA levels, it did significantly potentiate the TBI-induced changes in c-fos mRNA in all three brain regions. These findings show that hypoxia is an important factor influencing genomic responses to TBI.",
