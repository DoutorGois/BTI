     "AB": "The DHCR24 (24-dehydrocholesterol reductase) gene codes a multifunctional protein which consists of enzymatic, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic activities. It exists in almost all neurons and protects the neural cells against amyloid beta toxicity. Several studies have shown the down regulation of DHCR24 in Alzheimer's disease. We examined the time profile of DHCR24-mRNA alteration in an animal model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced cognitive impairment. The DHCR24 mRNA levels of hippocampus and cognitive impairment were evaluated at 7, 14, and 21 days after intracerebroventricular (ICV)-STZ/Saline administration. DHCR24 expression was down regulated at 14 and 21 days after ICV-STZ administration. The decrease in expression of DHCR24 preceded the onset of the cognitive impairment. These results suggest the potential relation between DHCR24 expression and cognitive impairment.",
