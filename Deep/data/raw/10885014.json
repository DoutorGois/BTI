     "AB": "The unitary postsynaptic mechanism of plasticity in striatum, neocortex, hippocampus and cerebellum involves the LTP/LTD excitation as result of AMPA and NMDA receptor phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, while the LTP/LTD of inhibition is the result of the GABA receptor phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. It follows from this mechanism that when NMDA channels are closed, the determinant role in receptor phosphorylation is played by the PKG. When the NMDA channels are open, the determinant role in receptor phosphorylation is played by the PKC and CaMKII.",
