     "AB": "In the nine years that have passed since the discovery of CCK in the brain, we have learned much about its biochemistry and anatomy. The anatomy of CCK in the brain is complex and in some instances does not fit with classical anatomical concepts. It is apparently common for some brain structures to have multiple CCK innervation and for interneurons and possible projection neurons to be present in the same structures, which may also receive afferent CCK input. Much work needs to be done before we completely understand the biochemistry, anatomy and function of CCK in the brain.",
