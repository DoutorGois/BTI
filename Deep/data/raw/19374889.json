     "AB": "Environmental enrichment is known to induce plastic changes in the brain, including morphological changes in hippocampal neurons, with increases in synaptic and spine densities. In recent years, the evidence for a role of astrocytes in regulating synaptic transmission and plasticity has increased, and it is likely that morphological and functional changes in astrocytes play an important role in brain plasticity. Our study was designed to evaluate changes in astrocytes induced by environmental enrichment in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, focusing on astrocytic density and on morphological changes in astrocytic processes. After 8 weeks of environmental enrichment starting at weaning, male CF-1 mice presented no significant changes in astrocyte number or in the density of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity in the stratum radiatum. However, they did present changes in astrocytic morphology in the same region, as expressed by a significant increase in the ramification of astrocytic processes measured by the Sholl concentric circles method, as well as by an increase in the number and length of primary processes extending in a parallel orientation to CA1 nerve fibers. This led astrocytes to acquire a more stellate morphology, a fact which could be related to the increase in hippocampal synaptic density observed in previous studies. These findings corroborate the idea that structural changes in astrocytic networks are an integral part of plasticity processes occurring in the brain.",
