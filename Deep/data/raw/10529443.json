     "AB": "Vitamin E (alpha-gamma-tocopherol) is an important component in biological membranes. A decrease in its concentration imposes structural and functional damage to the cells. The object of this study was to assess the effect of a graded dietary vitamin E (E) intake on E concentration in specific regions of the brain, and its influence on vitamin C levels and neurological function. Following a 2-month period, rats supplemented with 5, 30, 60, 250 or 500 mg all-rac-alpha-tocopherol-acetate/kg diet (mg E/kg diet) exhibited a significant increase of E concentration in brain and peripheral tissues. However, while blood and liver showed a dose response increase in E concentration which correlated well with the different levels of E in the diet, the central nervous system (CNS) followed the same pattern of increase of vitamin E in brain tissue only when the diet was supplemented with 5, 30, or 60 mg E/kg diet. No further increase in E concentration was observed when the diet was supplemented with 250 or 500 mg E/kg diet. Similarly, the heart tissue showed a significant increase in its E concentration when the was enriched with 5, 30, or 60 mg E/kg diet, with no further increases at 250 or 500 mg. Vitamin C concentration in brain cortex and cerebellum, plasma, liver, and heart was reduced in the groups receiving 250 or 500 mg E/kg diet. Compared to the low E group, rats supplemented with the 60, 250 or 500 mg E/kg diet showed a significant enhancement in striatal dopamine (DA) release, but no differences were observed among the latter three groups.",
