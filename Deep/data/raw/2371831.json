     "AB": "Senile changes in the human olfactory bulb were studied histopathologically in 133 individuals ranging in age from 40 to 91 years with a mean age of 64.3 years. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the olfactory bulb were observed in 47 subjects aged over 50 years. The frequency of NFTs was 35.3% (47/133) in total and 40.5% (47/116) among subjects 50 years of age or older. The frequency of individuals with NFTs increased linearly with age. Senile plaques (SPs) were observed in 5 individuals over 60 years old at a frequency of 3.8% (5/133) in total and 5.7% (5/88) among individuals 60 years old or more. Granulovacuolar degeneration was rarely seen, and amyloid angiopathy was not recognized. Senile changes in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus were also examined. In some cases, the frequencies of NFTs and SPs in the hippocampal region were not identical to those in the olfactory bulb. However, it was not apparent whether senile changes first appear in the olfactory bulb or in the hippocampal region.",
