     "AB": "The aim of this retrospective, multicenter clinical study was to evaluate the aetiology of epilepsy in surgically treated patients in China. The detailed clinical records of all intractable partial epilepsy (IPE) were reviewed in five tertiary referral centres from June 1991 to June 2000. 1650 patients (927 males, 723 females) were recruited. 41.4% had aetiological factors, including the histories of major brain trauma (20.9%), febrile seizure (6.5%), meningitis (5.4%), encephalitis (5.0%), prenatal distress (2.1%), birth trauma (0.8%) and family history of seizure (0.7%). The pathological lesions were divided into eight groups according to the nature of the lesion: scar (19.2%), vascular malformations (VM) (17.7%), hippocampal sclerosis (HS) (16.2%), tumours (15.0%), gliosis (12.1%), neuronal migration disorders (NMDs) (7.4%), intracranial infection (4.5%), and other lesions (7.9%). In conclusion, effective management of these aetiological factors and pathological lesions may be essential to deal with IPE. Scar, HS, VM, NMDs are the most likely consequences of antecedent morbid events.",
