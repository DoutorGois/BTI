     "AB": "Ethylcholine mustard aziridinium ion (AF64A) was administered via intracerebroventricular injection to rats. Unilateral injection of 40 nmol AF64A resulted in pronounced toxicity with an 80% mortality rate. Administration of 10 nmol unilaterally resulted in a significant reduction in both acetylcholine content and ouabain stimulated acetylcholine release in the hippocampus 2, 4 and 7 days after treatment. Non-specific changes in hippocampal levels of dopamine, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine were also observed. Bilateral injection of 5 nmol AF64A was more effective than a unilateral 10 nmol injection in reducing acetylcholine release from hippocampus 4 and 7 days after treatment. Hippocampal acetylcholine content was also reduced (to 35% of control). In contrast, there was less effect on acetylcholine content in striatum and frontal cortices, and acetylcholine release from these areas was not decreased. Although there was a transient reduction in hippocampal 5-hydroxytryptamine content 4 days after treatment, this had recovered to control levels within 7 days. 5-Hydroxytryptamine levels in striatum or cortex were not affected, nor were there any changes in noradrenaline or dopamine contents in the areas studied. This study indicates that, in the correct dose range, AF64A can exert selective effects on cholinergic systems, particularly in the hippocampus. The selective cholinotoxicity of this compound makes it a useful tool in developing animal models of cholinergic dysfunction.",
