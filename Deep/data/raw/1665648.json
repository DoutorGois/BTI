     "AB": "Analysis was made of the composition of four structures of human brain in health (n-12), schizophrenia (n-10), and Alzheimer's senile dementia (n-8). Protein maps obtained by means of two-dimensional electrophoresis were used to analyze tissue samples of the structures under study. In the investigation, the neocortex was represented by the frontal cortex (field 10), the old cortex by the hippocamp, the midbrain by black substance, and medulla oblongata by the inferior olive. Comparative study of the protein maps revealed quantitative differences in certain brain structures in health as well as differences between these structures in health and mental pathology.",
