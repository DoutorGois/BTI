     "AB": "The CHAT gene encodes choline acetyltransferase, which is an enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain. This study collected structural MRI, genetic, and behavioral data from 324 healthy Chinese adults, and examined the associations between CHAT genetic variants, parahippocampal and hippocampal structure, and short-term memory span. After controlling for intracranial volume, sex, and age, CHAT SNP rs12246528 had the strongest association with parahippocampal structure, with the A allele being linked to smaller volume, surface area, and thickness. SNP rs1917814 had the strongest association with hippocampal volume, with the T allele being linked to larger hippocampal volume. After controlling for sex and age, CHAT rs3729496 had the strongest association with memory span, with the T allele being associated with a greater memory span. Finally, the left parahippocampal gyrus surface area was positively associated with memory span. This study provides the first evidence for the involvement of the CHAT gene in parahippocampal and hippocampal structures and memory span in healthy Chinese adults.",
