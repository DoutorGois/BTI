     "AB": "GABA(B) receptors play an important role in the excitability of neuronal networks and can influence seizure activity. Here we demonstrate for the first time that kindling, an animal model for human temporal lobe epilepsy, leads to both early and delayed changes of GABA(B) receptor immunoreactivity in hippocampal and cortical areas. We propose that the altered GABA(B) receptor levels might be a compensatory mechanism to reduce excitability induced by recurrent kindled seizures, or alternatively, may promote the development of kindled epilepsy.",
