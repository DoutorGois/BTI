     "AB": "Glutamatergic synapses form onto both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. These two types of glutamatergic synapses differ in their electrical responses to high-frequency stimulation and postsynaptic density protein composition. However, it is not known whether they differ in the actin cytoskeleton composition. In the present study, we used hippocampal neuronal cultures prepared from glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67)-GFP knock-in mice and analyzed the differences in the actin cytoskeleton at glutamatergic synapses contacting GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. Drebrin-binding actin filaments enriched in dendritic spines are known to play a pivotal role in spine formation. Immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated that drebrin accumulated at glutamatergic synapses on GABAergic neurons as well as at those on glutamatergic neurons. However, the density of drebrin clusters along dendrites in GABAergic neurons was significantly lower than those of glutamatergic neurons. Furthermore, the level of drebrin accumulating at glutamatergic synapses was lower on GABAergic neurons than on glutamatergic neurons. In neurons overexpressing drebrin, drebrin cluster density and accumulation levels in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons were similar, suggesting that the low drebrin levels in the glutamatergic postsynaptic sites on GABAergic neurons may be because GABAergic neurons express low levels of drebrin. On the other hand, pharmacological analysis demonstrated that the postsynaptic localization of drebrin depended on actin cytoskeleton organization in both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. Together these results indicated that, although GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons share common regulatory systems affecting drebrin localization, the density of drebrin-positive glutamatergic synapses formed on GABAergic neurons is lower than those on glutamatergic neurons. This is probably due to the low expression of drebrin in GABAergic neurons.",
