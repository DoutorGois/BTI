     "AB": "Oxygen free radicals and lipid peroxidation may play significant roles in the progress of injury induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion of the central nervous system. Rosiglitazone, a well known activator of PPARgamma, has neuroprotective properties in various animal models of acute central nervous system damage. In the present study, we evaluate the possible impact of rosiglitazone on chronic cerebral hypoperfused-rats in regard to the levels of oxidative stress, reduced glutathione, and hippocampal neuronal damage. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion was generated by permanent ligation of both common carotid arteries of Wistar rats for one month. Animals in treatment group were given rosiglitazone orally at doses of 1.5, 3, or 6mg/kg per day of the 1month duration. The treatment significantly lowered the levels of both malondialdehyde and neuronal damage, while elevated the reduced glutathione level markedly. These findings suggest that the beneficial effect of rosiglitazone on hypoperfusion-induced hippocampal neuronal damage might be the result of inhibition of oxidative insult.",
