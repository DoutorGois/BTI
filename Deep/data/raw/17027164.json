     "AB": "In the CNS, l-serine (l-Ser) plays an essential role in neuronal survival by evoking a variety of biological responses in glial cells. Initially, we examined whether glutamate, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) induce the secretion of l-Ser in astrocytes isolated from Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). The secretion of l-Ser was significantly induced with glutamate and SNP in cultured astrocytes. Next, to gain insight into the involvement of l-Ser in glutamate-induced neuroprotection, we compared the secretion of l-Ser in astrocytes isolated from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and normotensive rats, WKY. We also examined the mRNA expression of the enzyme that produces l-Ser, 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), and a neural amino acid transporter, ASCT1, in the cultured astrocytes. A dose-dependent study of glutamate in astrocytes of SHRSP indicated differences in the secretion of l-Ser, and gene expression of PHGDH and ASCT1, compared with levels in the WKY astrocytes. We demonstrated that both the secretion and the gene expression were significantly attenuated in glutamate-treated astrocytes from SHRSP. Cerebral ischemia in SHRSP induced a massive efflux of glutamate, causing delayed neuronal death in region CA1 of the hippocampus. The results suggest that the attenuated secretion of l-Ser in astrocytes is involved in neuronal vulnerability and survival in SHRSP during the production of glutamate, as the secretion of l-Ser, which is stimulated by glutamate, is closely related to the protective effect against glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity. We conclude that glutamate and SNP up-regulate the secretion of l-Ser in primary astrocytes. Secretion of l-Ser is regulated in astrocytes in response to glutamate and nitric oxide and may correspond to the level of l-Ser needed for neuronal survival during brain insults such as ischemic stroke in SHRSP.",
