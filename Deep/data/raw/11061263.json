     "AB": "The authors studied six patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy and postictal psychosis using quantitative MRI and histopathology, and compared the results with 45 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy without postictal psychosis. Total hippocampal volumes were not different between the two groups. However, patients with postictal psychosis had a relatively preserved anterior hippocampus, and temporal lobe dysplasia was more frequent (p = 0.006, chi-square test). These findings may be associated with the clinical symptoms.",
