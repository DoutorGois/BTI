     "AB": "The distribution of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) mRNA was characterized in the hippocampus of humans with Alzheimer disease (AD) and in rats with experimental lesions (unilateral ablation of the entorhinal cortex) that model selected features of AD. In both AD and the lesion model, we observed a shift in the location of astrocytes containing prevalent ApoE mRNA from the neuropil to regions with densely packed neurons. The increased abundance of ApoE mRNA in astrocytes close to neuron cell bodies could be indicative of lipid uptake in regions where neurons are degenerating or where synaptic remodeling is taking place.",
