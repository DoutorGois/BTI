     "AB": "The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus has a central role in learning and memory in adult rodents. The DG is generated soon after birth, although new neurons continue to be generated in the DG throughout life. The proneural factors Mash1 (Ascl1) and neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) are expressed during formation of the DG but their role in the development of this structure has not yet been addressed. Here, we show that Ngn2 is essential for the development of the DG. Ngn2 mutant mice have fewer DG progenitors and these cells present defects in neuronal differentiation. By contrast, the DG is normal in Mash1 mutant mice at birth, and loss of both Mash1 and Ngn2 does not aggravate the defect observed in Ngn2 single mutants. These data establish a unique role of Ngn2 in DG neurogenesis during development and raise the possibility that Ngn2 has a similar function in adult neurogenesis.",
