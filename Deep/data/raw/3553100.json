     "AB": "Double immunostaining was performed for electron microscopy to analyze the synaptic connections between glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-immunoreactive axons and cholecystokinin (CCK)-immunoreactive neurons in the hilar region of the rat hippocampal formation. Following immunostaining for CCK, the diaminobenzidine (DAB) reaction product was silver-intensified and gold-substituted. In a subsequent second immunostaining for GAD, the immunoreactive elements were labeled using a single DAB reaction. Electron microscopic analysis of the double-stained Vibratome sections demonstrated that the single DAB-labeled GAD-immunoreactive boutons form symmetrical synaptic connections on the soma and primary dendrites of the DAB-gold-labeled CCK-immunoreactive neurons.",
