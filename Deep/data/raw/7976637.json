     "AB": "The omega-conopeptide, SNX-111 (NEUREX Corporation) was administered to rats 1 hour following a lateral fluid percussion brain injury to determine if the drug could reduced the extent and duration of trauma-induced calcium accumulation. Administration at doses of 3 or 5 mg/kg (i.v.) markedly reduced the extent of calcium accumulation as determined using 45calcium autoradiography primarily within the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The reduction of calcium accumulation was particularly event within the parietal cortex beginning as early as 6 hours and lasting out to 48 hours following injury. Although not as effective as in the cerebral cortex, SNX-111 did exhibit a reduction of calcium accumulation within the dorsal hippocampus especially at 24 and 48 hours after the insult. These preliminary results demonstrate that SNX-111 can reduce the injury-induced accumulation of calcium even when administered 1 hour after the insult and offers this compound as a potential therapeutic treatment for traumatic brain injury.",
