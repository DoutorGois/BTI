     "AB": "Alpha-asarone is a bioactive component of Acorus tatarincuii Schott with low bioavailability, which is often used for treatments of various brain diseases in clinical setting. This study was to formulate biodegradable methoxy polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid (mPEG-PLA) nanoparticles (NPs) surface-modified by lactoferrin (Lf), for delivering alpha-asarone into the brain following intranasal administration. Alpha-asarone NPs were prepared by premix membrane emulsification. The relative parameters were optimized by a Box-Behnken experimental design. The particle size, zeta potential, and dispersibility index of NPs and Lf-NPs were characterized. Their ex vivo permeation, pharmacokinetics, distribution in the brain and other tissue, brain targeting, and toxicity were investigated. Following intranasal administration, Lf-NPs had a better permeability and no significant poor bioavailability compared to NPs; the area under curve from 0 to 12 h of alpha-asarone in Lf-NPs of the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, olfactory bundles, and thalamus were 2.14-, 4.17-, 3.62-, and 1.96-fold of those in NP group, respectively. Lactoferrin could enhance the efficacy of brain targeting with NPs and reduce its liver accumulation. Toxicity of NPs on nasal mucosal cilia and epithelial cells was also decreased by Lf. To summarize, these results demonstrate that Lf-NPs of alpha-asarone have potential as a carrier for nose-to-brain delivery of alpha-asarone for brain diseases.",
