     "AB": "In order to verify the biological aspects of 'autogeneic' bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) transplantation for neurological disorders, we aimed our study towards the assessment of the survival, distribution, and differentiation of autologous BMSC in the central nervous system (CNS). We harvested rat BMSC from femur bones, and the nuclei were then fluorescently labeled by a 24-h co-culture with bis-benzimide. These BMSC were stereotactically injected into the striatum (n=6) or thoracic cord (n=8) of each animal. We evaluated the distribution and differentiation of 'autogeneic' BMSC in the brain and spinal cord after 4 weeks, using the immunohistochemistry technique. We found some injected cells in the ipsilateral striatum, hippocampus, neocortex, and bilateral corpus callosum, and approximately 20% and 15% of the engrafted cells expressed neuronal and astrocytic markers, respectively. Other injected cells were distributed in the dorsal funiculus and adjacent gray matter, and about 10% and 15% of these cells expressed neuronal and astrocytic markers, respectively. Although the precise mechanism of BMSC transdifferentiation still remains unclear, the present results show that 'autogeneic' BMSC could highly differentiate into their own CNS neural cells, suggesting that they are surrounded by favorable conditions.",
