     "AB": "A newly synthesized agonist for muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors CS-932, (R)-3-(3-iso-xazoloxy)-1-azabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane hydrochloride, showed a relatively higher affinity for M1 than M2 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-cells in comparison with ACh. CS-932 elevated the intracellular Ca2+ level only in M1-CHO cells, although ACh increased the level in both M1- and M3-CHO cells. CS-932 and ACh reduced forskolin-stimulated accumulation of cAMP in M2-CHO cells by 20% and 80%, respectively. This neurochemical profile of CS-932 indicates that the compound can activate M1-receptor-mediated functions selectively. CS-932 increased firing of cholinoceptive neurons in rat hippocampal slices, and this excitation was antagonized by pirenzepine, but not by AF-DX 116. CS-932 increased awake and decreased slow wave sleep episodes of daytime EEG in free-moving rats. It counteracted scopolamine-induced slow waves in rat cortical EEG. CS-932 also increased the power of alpha- and beta-waves, but decreased delta-wave of the cortical EEG in anesthetized monkeys. It ameliorated scopolamine-induced impairment of working memory in rats. Orally administered CS-932 had the best penetration into the brain among the muscarinic agonists tested and caused the least salivary secretion among the cholinomimetics examined. These results indicate that CS-932 has potential as a cognitive enhancer with fewer side effects in therapy for Alzheimer disease.",
