     "AB": "Physiological release of endogenous opioids in the rat hippocampus was detected by an in vitro radioligand displacement assay using [3H][D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,glyol5]enkephalin ([3H]DAGO), a mu selective opioid agonist. In this assay, radioligand binding to opioid receptors in the in vitro hippocampal slice was reduced by competition with endogenous opioids released following tissue depolarization. Veratridine-induced opioid release caused displacement of [3H]DAGO that could be blocked by either tetrodotoxin addition or calcium removal from the incubation buffer. Maximal displacement of [3H]DAGO also required the presence of peptidase inhibitors in the incubation buffer. None of the buffer composition changes directly affected [3H]DAGO binding to rat brain membranes. Calcium-dependent displacement of [3H]DAGO binding from mu receptor sites elicited by focal electrical stimulation depended on the intensity and frequency of stimulation and positioning of the electrode in the slice. Maximal displacement of [3H]DAGO binding was observed following high intensity (150-300 microA), high frequency (10-50 Hz) stimulation of the perforant path, a major afferent fiber system to the hippocampus previously shown to contain proenkephalin-derived opioids. Low frequency stimulation (0.1-1 Hz) was ineffective. Stimulation of the mossy fibers (containing both dynorphins and enkephalins) also significantly reduced mu receptor binding, but to a lesser extent. Electrical stimulation of the hippocampal slice at sites not containing opioid peptides did not cause mu receptor displacement. These results demonstrate that under physiological conditions, the release of endogenous opioids from the major opioid containing pathways can be detected in a single hippocampal slice following high frequency stimulation.",
