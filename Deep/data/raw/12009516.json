     "AB": "Live-trapping of animals in natural populations is one of the main ways to determine population processes. We examined the effects of live-trapping on the expression of N-methyl-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits in the hippocampus of snowshoe hares. Snowshoe hares were obtained either with or without the stress of live-trapping. The CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus were dissected and analyzed for the presence of NMDA receptor subunits. Trapping resulted in a significant reduction of NMDA receptor 1 (NR1) in each of the regions examined but did not affect the levels of either NMDA receptor 2A or B (NR2A or NR2B). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the association between NR1 and NR2A was decreased in the trapped animals. These results suggest that stress associated with the trapping experience may adversely affect the structure and/or function of the NMDA receptor.",
