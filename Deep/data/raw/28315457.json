     "AB": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Root powder of Achyranthes aspera Linn. (A. aspera) belongs to family Amaranthaceae is used in Indian traditional medicine for the management of epilepsy and its efficacy is widely acclaimed among the different rural communities. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was aimed to establish the possible anticonvulsant effect of A. aspera methanolic root extract using acute anticonvulsant models and to evaluate the acute toxicity and neurotoxic potential A. aspera extract. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A. aspera methanolic extract was standardized with respect to betaine using HPTLC. The maximal electroshock (MES), pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), picrotoxin and bicuculline induced seizure models were used to evaluate the anticonvulsant potential of standardized A. aspera root extract. The GABA content in cortex and hippocampus of extract treated mice was evaluated using HPLC. Moreover, the animals were also evaluated for acute toxicity study and neurotoxicity test. RESULTS: A significant enhancement in the seizure threshold was observed by A. aspera extract (5 and 10mg/kg) treated mice in PTZ, picrotoxin and bicuculline models as compared to saline treated mice respectively, whereas the extract failed to show protection in MES induced seizures. Moreover, A. aspera treatment (5 and 10mg/kg) significantly enhances the GABA levels in hippocampus and cortex as compared to saline treated group. A. aspera root extract was devoid of any sign of acute toxicity as well as neurotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: A. aspera root extract exhibits significant anticonvulsant effect by facilitation of GABAergic neurotransmission in the brain.",
