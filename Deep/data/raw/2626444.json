     "AB": "The time course of the effects of the long-acting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, galanthamine, on a spatial navigation task and on AChE and acetylcholine (ACh) levels were investigated in mice. Mice received either saline or ibotenic acid injections into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nBM). The control and nBM group were than trained to perform a modified Morris swim task and the time to find the hidden platform was recorded. The nBM group took significantly longer to find the platform than the control group in the reversal phase of testing. Galanthamine attenuated the performance deficit in the nBM-lesioned group in a time-dependent manner, with peak performance at four hours after injection of 5.0 mg/kg galanthamine IP. This dose impaired performance of the task in control mice, with the most severe deficits observed at two hours after injections when motor activity was severely reduced. Galanthamine (5.0 mg/kg IP) significantly decreased cortical AChE activity and significantly increased cortical ACh content in control mice in a time-dependent manner. The time courses of the neurochemical effects, however, did not correlate precisely with the behavioral time course. Galanthamine concentrations up to 1 x 10(-5) M did not affect choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, [3H]hemicholinium-3 (HCh-3) binding to the choline carrier, [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate (QNB) binding to muscarinic receptors, or [3H]acetylcholine binding to nicotinic receptors in cortical homogenates. AChE activity was inhibited by galanthamine in cortical homogenates with an IC50 of 4.1 x 10(-7) M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
