     "AB": "Ammonia-induced apoptosis and its prevention by GABAC receptor stimulation were examined using primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Ammonia (0.5-5 mm NH4Cl) dose-dependently induced apoptosis in pyramidal cell-like neurons as assayed by double staining with Hoechst 33258 and anti-neurofilament antibody. A GABAC receptor agonist, cis-4-aminocrotonic acid (CACA, 200 microm), but not GABAA and GABAB receptor agonists, muscimol (10 micro m) and baclofen (50 microm), respectively, inhibited the ammonia (2 mm)-induced apoptosis, and this inhibition was abolished by a GABAC receptor antagonist (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA, 15 microm). Expression of all three GABAC receptor subunits was demonstrated in the cultured neurons by RT-PCR. The ammonia-treatment also activated caspases-3 and -9 as observed in immunocytochemistry for PARP p85 and western blot. Such activation of the caspases was again inhibited by CACA in a TPMPA-sensitive manner. The anti-apoptotic effect of CACA was blocked by inhibitors for MAP kinase kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PD98059 (20 microm) and KT5720 (1 microm), suggesting possible involvement of an upstream pro-apoptotic protein, BAD. Levels of phospho-BAD (Ser112 and Ser155) were decreased by the ammonia-treatment and restored by coadministration of CACA. These findings suggest that GABAC receptor stimulation protects hippocampal pyramidal neurons from ammonia-induced apoptosis by restoring Ser112- and Ser155-phospho-BAD levels.",
