     "AB": "The effects of intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) on K+ currents in hippocampal cells were examined using acutely isolated cells obtained from adult guinea pigs. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were carried out in a configuration that allowed a continuous perfusion of the intracellular medium. Recording media were made to block inward currents and allowed selective activation of K(+)-dependent outward currents. Voltage-dependent outward currents consisted of an initial rapidly decaying component followed by a sustained component. The time constant of decay of the transient current was about 25 msec, and previous studies (Numann et al., 1987) showed that the kinetic and pharmacological properties of this current closely resembled the A current recorded in invertebrate neurons (Connor and Stevens, 1971; Thompson, 1982). Intracellular perfusion of hippocampal cells with a solution containing elevated Ca2+ (about 4.5 x 10(-4) M) elicited outward currents at the holding potential (-45 to -55 mV) and produced changes in voltage-dependent K+ currents. The transient outward current (IA) activated by depolarization was suppressed with increases in Ca2+i. Delayed, sustained K+ currents were greatly potentiated. Data also showed that, among the 3 effects elicited by Ca2+i, suppression of IA was most sensitive to Ca2+i elevation. Previous results (Numann et al., 1987) showed that IA had a lower threshold (about -45 mV) than sustained currents (about -40 mV). By using low levels of depolarization (-40 mV), IA can be selectively activated, and the suppressive effect of Ca2+i on IA was confirmed on the kinetically isolated IA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
