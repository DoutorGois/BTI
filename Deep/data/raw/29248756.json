     "AB": "The concentration and distribution of Mg, P, Cl, K, Cu and Zn in the dorsal hippocampus CA1 region of rat brains were studied during memory consolidation and reconsolidation processes stimulated with inhibitory avoidance (IA) tests. Experimental rats were divided into four groups: i) group not submitted to inhibitory avoidance task (IA-N); ii) group submitted to inhibitory avoidance training session (IA-Y); iii) group submitted to inhibitory avoidance reactivation session but did not step down from the platform (IAR-N); and iv) group submitted to avoidance reactivation session and stepped down from the platform (IAR-Y). Elemental concentration and distribution in the CA1 hippocampus region were obtained through the Particle-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) technique. The results indicate that the concentration of Mg, P, Cl, K and Cu increased during memory consolidation. During the memory reconsolidation process, the concentrations of Mg, P, Cl and K increased, while Cu and Zn had no significant changes with respect to their basal condition. These results show that the major part of these elements may be engaged in memory consolidation could be also participating in memory reconsolidation. For all elements, the general trend related to their concentration did not change during reconsolidation regardless the presence of a novelty event, i.e. stepping down from the platform.",
