     "AB": "Depression is diagnosed in 15-30% of patients following myocardial infarction (MI) and this may also be observed in the rat. We measured the effects of the antidepressant sertraline on behavioural and biochemical events following MI in a rat model. Following surgery, MI rats and sham controls were treated with sertraline (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline. Subgroups of rats were tested for behavioural depression 14 days after surgery. Apoptosis was estimated in other rats by measuring caspase-3 activity and TUNEL positive cells (3 days after surgery) in limbic structures (amygdale, hippocampus, hypothalamus, frontal and prefrontal cortices). Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was measured 14 days after surgery. Behavioural signs of depression (decreased sucrose intake and forced swimming time) were found in saline-treated MI rats but not in sertraline-treated rats. Compared with controls, caspase-3 activity and TUNEL positive cells were significantly increased in most limbic structures of MI rats. High prefrontal Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in MI rats correlated with low forced swimming time. Apoptosis was not found in sertraline-treated MI rats. These results establish the bases of a rat model of depression following MI and show for the first time that a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor prevents both behavioural and biochemical markers in this model.",
