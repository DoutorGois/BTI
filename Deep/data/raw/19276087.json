     "AB": "In the central nervous system, collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) is a transducer protein that supports the semaphorin-induced guidance of axons toward their cognate target. However, we previously showed that CRMP2 is also expressed in immune cells and plays a crucial role in T lymphocyte migration. Here we further investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying CRMP2 function in chemokine-directed T-cell motility. Examining Jurkat T-cells treated with the chemokine CXCL12, we found that 1) CXCL12 induces a dynamic re-localization of CRMP2 to uropod, the flexible structure of migrating lymphocyte, and increases its binding to the cytoskeletal protein vimentin; 2) CXCL12 decreases phosphorylation of the glycogen synthase kinase-3beta-targeted residues CRMP2-Thr-509/514; and 3) tyrosine Tyr-479 is a new phosphorylation CRMP2 residue and a target for the Src-family kinase Yes. Moreover, phospho-Tyr-479 increased under CXCL12 signaling while phospho-Thr-509/514 decreased. The functional importance of this tyrosine phosphorylation was demonstrated by Y479F mutation that strongly reduced CXCL12-mediated T-cell polarization and motility as tested in a transmigration model and on neural tissue. We propose that differential phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and Yes modulates the contribution of CRMP2 to cytoskeletal reorganization during chemokine-directed T-cell migration. In addition to providing a novel mechanism for T lymphocyte motility, our findings reveal CRMP2 as a transducer of chemokine signaling.",
