     "AB": "The transcription factor nuclear factor one X (NFIX) plays a central role during the development of the neocortex and hippocampus, through the activation of astrocyte-specific gene expression and the repression of progenitor-specific pathways. However, our understanding of transcriptional targets of NFIX during cortical development remains limited. Here, we identify the transcription factor Bobby sox (Bbx) as a target for NFI-mediated transcriptional control. BBX is expressed within ventricular zone progenitor cells within the developing neocortex and hippocampus, and its expression is upregulated in Nfix (-/-) mice. Moreover, we reveal that NFIX can repress Bbx promoter-driven expression. Collectively, these data suggest that Bbx is a downstream target of NFIX during development of the forebrain.",
