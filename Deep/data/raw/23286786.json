     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is widely recognized as a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD. Abeta1-42 a major component of amyloid plaques, has shown synaptotoxicity associated with impaired long-term potentiation and cognitive deficits. Alteration of neurogenesis in AD patients has been reported, while little is known about how Abeta1-42 affects hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult brain. In this study, we injected human Abeta1-42 peptide into hippocampal CA1 area of adult mouse brain bilaterally and evaluated histological change and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain showed that Abeta1-42-injection resulted in an extensive neurodegeneration in the Abeta-accumulated area and CA3 in hippocampus. Immunostaining showed that intrahippocampal Abeta1-42-injection dramatically decreased the number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) compared to the vehicle injection. Moreover, a significant decrease in the number of BrdU/double-cortin double-positive cells in Abeta1-42-injected hippocampus was observed, suggesting that Abeta1-42-injection inhibited progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in subgranular zone of the DG in the adult brain. We also found that the Abeta1-42-mediated decline of neurogenesis was associated with decreased protein levels of cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) in the hippocampus. These results suggest that Abeta1-42 inhibits hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult brain possibly through down-regulation of INF-gamma and NF-kappaB signaling pathway. This study provides a new insight into Abeta1-42-mediated decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult central nervous system.",
