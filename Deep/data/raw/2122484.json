     "AB": "Developing rats were either malnourished or adequately nourished during the prenatal period by feeding their dams diets of 6% (low) or 25% (adequate) casein content 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy. All pups received adequate nutrition from the day of birth onwards. Beginning at 160 days of age male rats were tested in a DRL-18 sec operant task. It was found that prenatal malnutrition impaired performance during acquisition, though asymptomatic levels were not significantly different. Subsequent limited hold DRL-18 sec schedules in which late as well as early responses went unrewarded indicated that the timing ability of the prenatally malnourished rats was excellent and similar to that of the controls. These late effects of fetal protein malnutrition are discussed in terms of the difficulty in adapting to the change from CRF to DRL-18 sec (possibilities include a reduced ability to develop a timing strategy or increased sensitivity to the change in reinforcement contingencies), while retaining the ability to time responses accurately once the task was acquired.",
