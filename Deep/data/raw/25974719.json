     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore relationships between clinical improvement and relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes after shunt-insertion in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) as measured by dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: In 20 idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients rCBF was measured preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. Because of shunt-induced right-sided artefacts, evaluation was restricted to 12 left-sided cortical, subcortical, and periventricular regions of interest. Correlations between rCBF and clinical symptoms were analyzed in shunt responders. RESULTS: In responders, the postoperative regions of interest-based rCBF increase of 2% to 9% was significant in the parenchyma, the hippocampus, and the anterior periventricular white matter. Perfusion improvement in the cingulus, caudate head, and thalamus correlated with decreased disturbance in one or more of the domains neuropsychology, gait, balance, and total performance. CONCLUSIONS: Apparently, dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging can measure postoperative perfusion changes in responders. Postoperatively, perfusion increase in some grey matter structures seems to determine the degree of clinical improvement.",
