     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: We set out to develop a muscarinic M1-selective agonist (based on the structure of the functionally M1-selective xanomeline) that could be radiolabeled with fluorine-18 for use as an imaging agent for positron emission tomography. METHODS: The radiochemical synthesis was achieved, employing the arts of organic and radiochemical syntheses. Binding selectivity studies employed biodistribution studies, using autoradiography and/or tissue dissection, in wild-type or muscarinic receptor knockout mice. RESULTS: [(18)F]Fluoroxanomeline shows rather uniform uptake in all mouse brain regions and high specific binding, with a brain-to-blood ratio of 32 at 60 min postinjection. In addition, the specific binding is demonstrated by a 58% to 75% decrease in brain uptake upon coinjection with 5 nmol of unlabeled fluoroxanomeline or xanomeline. Brain uptake studies with [(3)H]xanomeline in muscarinic knockout mice show decreased uptake in M1 (17-34%) and M2 (2-20%) knockout mice compared with control. However, statistical significance was observed in only a few regions. Comparison of [(18)F]fluoroxanomeline in knockout mice showed no difference in M1 or M4 knockout mice but a general decrease in M2 (2-24%) knockout mice. The decrease of [(18)F]fluoroxanomeline uptake in M2 knockout mice reached statistical significance in brain stem, cerebellum, frontal cortex, hippocampus, inferior colliculus and superior colliculus. CONCLUSION: Although xanomeline displays highly selective M1 agonist activity in functional assays, little selectivity for muscarinic subtype binding was observed for xanomeline or its fluorine-containing analogue, fluoroxanomeline. This emphasizes the lack of correlation between functional selectivity and binding selectivity.",
