     "AB": "In freeze-fracture replicas of the hippocampus of guinea pig, gap junctions were found on membranes identified as belonging to the apical dendrites or somata of the CA3 pyramidal cells. The junctions were not part of mixed synapses. It is concluded that adjacent pyramidal cells, which in places lacked an interposed glial sheath are electrically coupled.",
