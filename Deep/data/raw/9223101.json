     "AB": "Glutathione (GSH) is considered the primary molecule responsible for peroxide removal from the brain. Inhibition of its rate-limiting synthetic enzyme, glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS), results in morphological damage to both cortical and nigral neurons in rodents. Here, we report cloning of the catalytic heavy chain GCS mRNA from mouse and its localization in the murine brain. Heavy chain GCS appears to be localized in glial populations in the hippocampus, cerebellum and olfactory bulb, with lower levels of expression in the cortex and substantia nigra. Variations in GCS levels and subsequent GSH synthesis may explain differences in susceptibility to neuropathology associated with oxidative stress noted in these various brain regions.",
