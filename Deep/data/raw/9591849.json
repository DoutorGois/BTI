     "AB": "Cerebral ischemia models using mice have drawn increasing attention, particularly because of the availability of transgenic animals. However, the variability of intracranial vasculature at the circle of Willis in mice can influence the degree of ischemia in both the bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion and intraluminal suture occlusion models. We have developed a method to predict the extent of the anastomosis between carotid and vertebrobasilar circulation in three mouse strains (C57BL/6, CBA, and DBA/2) by measuring cortical microperfusion with laser Doppler flowmetry during a 1-minute occlusion of both CCA. When animals showed residual cortical microperfusion of less than 12% during bilateral CCA occlusion, the mice showed absence of functional anastomosis, developed ATP depletion in the frontal cortex during occlusion, and had ischemic neuronal death in the hippocampus and caudoputamen after occlusion for 15 minutes and recirculation for 7 days. Furthermore, those mice exhibited decreased local cerebral blood flow and associated ischemic neuronal death in the hippocampus, within the territory supplied by the posterior cerebral artery, with the intraluminal suture occlusion model. The current study demonstrates the need for assessment of intracranial vasculature in each animal by measuring cortical microperfusion during temporary occlusion of both CCA, no matter whether cerebral ischemia is produced by bilateral CCA occlusion or intraluminal suture occlusion in transgenic mice.",
