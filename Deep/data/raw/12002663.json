     "AB": "Cell death was reduced in cultured rat hippocampal cells treated with aluminum chloride by dantrolene and dimethylsulfoxide, indicating aluminum toxicity may be mediated through release of calcium from intracellular stores and oxidative stress. Cell death was reduced to a lesser degree by cycloheximide and actinomycin D, indicating some evidence for apoptosis, however apoptosis did not appear to be a major cause of cell death from aluminum toxicity.",
