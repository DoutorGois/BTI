     "AB": "Stereotaxic injection of AF64A, into the medial septum of the rat, resulted in significant loss of presynaptic cholinergic markers in this structure. No significant change was observed for the presynaptic neuronal markers for dopamine- and serotonin-containing neurons in either the medial septum or hippocampus. The AF64A lesion also resulted in a significant reduction of muscarinic receptors as demonstrated by a loss of [3H]QNB binding in the medial septum. Subtype analysis showed the decrease of receptor binding in the medial septum to be due to a loss of M1 receptors as well as other muscarinic receptor subtypes. In the hippocampal formation, [3H]hemicholinium-3 binding was significantly reduced in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, and in the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum of the hippocampus. AF64A lesion resulted in a significant increase (Bmax) in non-M1 muscarinic receptors in hippocampal stratum oriens, in areas CA2, CA3, and CA4. AF64A lesion of the medial septum did not result in muscarinic receptor alterations in any other region of the hippocampal formation examined. These results indicate that postsynaptic muscarinic receptors in the stratum oriens of the CA2 to CA4 region of the hippocampus mediate primarily the function of the cholinergic cell bodies of the medial septum. These receptors are not of the M1 subtype.",
