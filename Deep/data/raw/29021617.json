     "AB": "We analyzed the localization of ubiquinol, the reduced form of coenzyme Q10 (Re-CoQ10), in mouse brain sections using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to evaluate the effect of dietary Re-CoQ10 in mouse brain. Mice were orally administered Re-CoQ10 for 14 days and brain Re-CoQ10 content was subsequently quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. IMS was employed to visualize Re-CoQ10 at a resolution of 150 mum in the mouse brain. Increased Re-CoQ10 was observed in the corpus callosum, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebellum, brain stem, substantia nigra and striatum. These regions are related to movement, memory and vital life functions. Thus, we demonstrated the effect of Re-CoQ10 administration on the specific localization of Re-CoQ10 in the brain.",
