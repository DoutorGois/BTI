     "AB": "N6-cyclohexyl[3H]adenosine, ([3H]CHA), was used to label adenosine A1 receptors in crude synaptic membranes prepared from rat and guinea pig brain. The density of [3H]CHA binding sites was highest in the rat hippocampus and cerebellum and in the guinea-pig hippocampus. A micro-dissection of coronal sections of guinea-pig hippocampus revealed that the specific binding capacity for [3H]CHA in area CA-1 was 20-30% higher than in area CA-3, dentate gyrus and subiculum. Selective neuronal lesions of serotonergic, noradrenergic and cholinergic afferents to the hippocampus failed to alter [3H]CHA binding to hippocampal membranes. These results suggest that [3H]CHA binding sites are not associated with axons or terminals of these neurones in the hippocampus. Intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid reduced the number of [3H]CHA recognition sites by 30% with no alteration in the affinity of [3H]CHA for these receptors. Thus, a significant portion of A1 receptors may be associated with intrinsic neurones of the hippocampus which do not appear to be innervated by noradrenergic, cholinergic or serotonergic axons.",
