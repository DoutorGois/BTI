     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs) are commonly associated with medically resistant epilepsy that usually starts in childhood. Presurgical workup and surgical strategies remain controversial. The authors present a study of long-term seizure outcome after noninvasive presurgical investigations and different surgical strategies were used in a series of pediatric patients. METHODS: Twenty-four children who underwent operations at a single center between 1986 and 2006 were eligible for this retrospective study. The authors reviewed medical records including sex, age at seizure onset, age at surgery, seizure type and pharmacoresistance, lesion location, extent and complications of resection, histopathological findings, prescription of seizure and antiepileptic drugs, outcome, and tumor recurrence. RESULTS: At the last follow-up examination (range 1-16 years after initial treatment, mean 6.7 years) 20 children (83.3%) were seizure free. The authors did not find the rundown phenomenon in any of the patients. Complete antiepileptic drug withdrawal was achieved in 12 children (50%). In 4 of 15 children with temporal DNTs, the lesionectomy alone failed to control seizures. These results could be explained by the wider epileptogenic zone. The only significant predictor for favorable seizure outcome was an absence of preoperative generalized seizures. CONCLUSIONS: In children with extratemporal DNTs the results suggest that complete lesionectomy alone without invasive presurgical investigations are effective for long-term seizure control. For children with temporal DNTs not invading the amygdalohippocampal complex, extensive presurgical evaluations seem indicated. The absence of preoperative generalized seizures was associated with a better seizure outcome.",
