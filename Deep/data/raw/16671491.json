     "AB": "Aquaporins are intrinsic membrane proteins involved in water transport in fluid-transporting tissues. In the brain, aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is expressed widely by glial cells, but its function is unclear. Extensive basic and clinical studies indicate that osmolarity affects seizure susceptibility, and in our previous studies we found that AQP4 -/- mice have an elevated seizure threshold in response to the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazol. In this study, we examined the seizure phenotype of AQP4 -/- mice in greater detail using in vivo electroencephalographic recording. AQP4 -/- mice were found to have dramatically longer stimulation-evoked seizures following hippocampal stimulation as well as a higher seizure threshold. These results implicate AQP4 in water and potassium regulation associated with neuronal activity and seizures.",
