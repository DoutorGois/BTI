     "AB": "It is recognized that the main trigger of Alzheimer disease related neurodegeneration is beta-amyloid peptide, which subsequently generates different metabolic disorders in neuron and finally leads to neuronal death. Several biologically active products were tested as neuroprotectors, but only few of them demonstrated any efficiency. Proline-rich polypeptide-1 was tested as a neuroprotective agent on Abeta25-35 animal model of Alzheimer disease. Biochemical analysis (determination of spectrum of neuroactive amino acids, such as glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glycine, aspartate and taurine), as well as behavioral, electrophysiological and morphological studies were performed to reveal the neuroprotective potential of proline-rich polypeptide in rats. Based on the results of our study it can be concluded that proline-rich polypeptide-1 has a potential to be one of the effective preventive or therapeutic agents against neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease.",
