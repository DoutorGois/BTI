     "AB": "Groups of rats received bilateral destruction of either the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) by infusion of ibotenic acid, the dorsal noradrenergic bundle (DNB) by infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine, or both NBM + DNB (COMB). These lesion groups along with sham operated controls were trained on a food reinforced spatial delayed conditional discrimination task in a T-maze. All four groups were able to attain a criterion of 85% correct responses despite significant group differences in the number of trials to criterion and number of correct responses during training. Performance of the DNB and NBM groups on acquisition trials was significantly lower than controls, significantly higher than the COMB group, but not significantly different from each other. When tested at delays of 30-300 s, all groups demonstrated parallel rates of decline in performance. On reversal learning trials, the NBM and COMB groups were significantly impaired, whereas the performance of the DNB group was better than controls. No significant interaction between the DNB and NBM lesions was observed on any of the behavioral measures. Biochemical analyses demonstrated significant reductions of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in cortex but not hippocampus of the NBM and COMB groups, and a significant reduction of norepinephrine (NE) in cortex and hippocampus of the DNB and COMB but not the NBM group. The concentration of other monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitters in the lesion groups were unchanged from controls. These results suggest that DNB and NBM lesions produce separate and independent cognitive impairments that do not severely disrupt retention of trial independent (reference memory) and trial dependent (working memory) information on this T-maze task.",
