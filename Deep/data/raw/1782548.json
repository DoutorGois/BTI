     "AB": "When neurons die, the filaments of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) undergo structural and antigenic modifications. The exact mechanism of this modification is unknown, but glial cells could play an important role. Previous studies have shown that astroglial processes infiltrate extracellular NFT. In this study we use double immunolabelling to show that microglia also infiltrate extracellular NFT. Therefore, along with the previously identified astroglia, the microglia could be responsible for the modification of extracellular NFT.",
