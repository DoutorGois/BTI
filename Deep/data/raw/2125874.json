     "AB": "The efferent projections of septal nuclei from the brain areas relating to pain in the rat were studied with WGA-HRP and HRP methods. The results are obtained as follows: The septal areas project widely to some brain areas relating to pain, for instance, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, hypothalamus, habenular, amygdaloid complex, cingulate cortex and hippocampus ets, but the projections of medial septal nucleus, lateral septal nucleus and diagonal band nucleus are different. It is possible that these fiber projections are one of the morphological basis of septal nuclei for regulating pain.",
