     "AB": "The amounts of adenylyl cyclase type I (AC I) were examined in various parts of the postmortem brains from alcoholics who prior to death had been abstinent from alcohol for at least 6 months and compared with controls using immunoblot analysis with anti-AC I specific antibody. It was revealed that a significant reduction of AC I was observed in both frontal and temporal cortices. On the other hand, in other areas (occipital cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, and hippocampus) the amounts were comparable between alcoholics and controls. In the next step, we examined two subtypes of human AC mRNA levels (AC I and AC VIII) in blood cells by quantitative RT-PCR using [alpha-32P]dCTP with two sets of the synthetic oligonucleotide primers based on the DNA sequences reported elsewhere (Villacres, E.C. et al., Genomics 16 (1993) 473-478; J. Parma et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 179 (1991) 455-462). The amounts of amplified DNAs of both AC I and AC VIII were significantly smaller in alcoholics than in controls. On the other hand, the amounts of amplified DNA of beta-actin DNA were almost equal between alcoholics and controls. It appears from these results that a reduction in the amount of AC subtypes may be a biological marker for alcoholics.",
