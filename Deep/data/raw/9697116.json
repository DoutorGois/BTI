     "AB": "Spatial learning and various physiological parameters were examined in old (57 month), middle aged (38 month), adult (18 month) and young (3-3.5 month) male deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Performance during acquisition of a water maze task was not significantly reduced for middle aged and adult mice relative to young reproductively active (breeding) mice. Performance was deteriorated in old mice relative to young breeding mice on block 4 of training. Retention of this spatial task, however, was reduced in all three older groups relative to young breeding mice. Corrected hippocampal volume (corrected for brain weight) was reduced only in old mice relative to young breeding mice although absolute volumes of hippocampus were lower in all groups relative to young breeding mice. Old mice also were shown to have lower levels of plasma testosterone and lighter brains relative to young breeding mice. Spatial retention was not deficient in old, middle aged and adult mice relative to a group of young reproductively quiescent male (non-breeding) mice. Young breeding mice displayed better spatial performance and had significantly higher plasma testosterone levels, corrected hippocampal volume and brain weight relative to young non-breeding mice. These results indicate that retention of a spatial task is more sensitive to the age of male deer mice than acquisition of the task. Hippocampal volume, although a gross morphological feature, appears to be sensitive to the effects of ageing in male deer mice. Plasma testosterone levels do not appear to be a crucial factor underlying age-related deficits in retention of a spatial task.",
