     "AB": "Rapidly emerging evidence suggests that glial cells in the central nervous system are sensitive to oestrogen actions. However, the functional consequences of the cellular mechanisms of these cells have proven difficult to study in vivo because of the intimate relationships between neurones and glia. Microarray technology offers the potential to uncover steroid hormone regulation of glial-specific genes that may play a role in hormone-dependent neuronal-glial interactions. Analysis of transcriptomes from the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) of oestradiol and vehicle-treated adult ovariectomised mice revealed an up-regulation of several glial specific genes by oestradiol, including glutamine synthetase (GS), which facilitates the conversion of glutamate to glutamine and plays an integral role in amino acid neurotransmission. In situ hybridisation confirmed that oestradiol treatment resulted in an up-regulation of GS gene expression in the arcuate and ventromedial nuclei of the MBH, as well as the medial amygdala and hippocampus. Moreover, oestradiol increased protein expression of GS in both the MBH and hippocampus. Neurones are incapable of de novo net synthesis of glutamate from glucose and are dependent on glial-provided precursors such as glutamine to renew their amino acid transmitter pools. Thus, oestradiol induced expression of GS suggests a significant role for glial cells in hormonal modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission important to female reproductive behaviours, neuroendocrine physiology and cognitive functions.",
