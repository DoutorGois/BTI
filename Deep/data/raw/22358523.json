     "AB": "UNLABELLED: Transglutaminase catalyzes the intermolecular cross-linking of peptides between Gln and Lys residues, forming an epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine bond. Amyloid beta-peptide, a major constituent of the deposits in Alzheimer disease, contains Lys16, Lys28, and Gln15 which may act as substrates of transglutaminase. Transglutaminase treatment of amyloid beta-peptide (1-28) and amyloid beta-peptide (1-40) yielded cross-linked oligomers. Transglutaminase-treated Abeta retarded neurite extension of PC12 cells, and rat cultured neurons of hippocampus and septum, brain areas severely affected by Alzheimer disease, and subsequently caused cell death, whereas the transglutaminase-untreated counterparts did not show harmful effects. The transglutaminase-catalyzed oligomers of amyloid beta-peptide and their neurotoxicity may be involved in two characteristics in Alzheimer disease, neuronal degeneration and formation of the insoluble deposits.
