     "AB": "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: Galantamine, a drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, has neuroprotection in several experimental models and stimulates adult neurogenesis in the rodent brain, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. This study examined whether galantamine affects the expression of neurotrophic/growth factors in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. METHODS: Nine-week-old male ddY mice were used. The mRNA levels of neurotrophic/growth factors were analyzed by a real-time quantitative PCR. The protein levels of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) were analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Acute administration of galantamine (0.3-3 mg/kg, i.p.) increased IGF2 mRNA levels in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex, in time- and dose-dependent manner. Galantamine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a transient increase in fibroblast growth factor 2 mRNA levels and a decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels in the hippocampus, while it did not affect the mRNA levels of other neurotrophic/growth factors. The galantamine-induced increase in the hippocampal IGF2 mRNA levels was blocked by mecamylamine, a nonselective nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (nAChR) antagonist, and methyllycaconitine, a selective alpha7 nAChR antagonist, but not by telenzepine, a preferential M(1) muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist. Moreover, the selective alpha7 nAChR agonist PHA-543613 increased the IGF2 mRNA levels, while donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, did not. Galantamine also increased hippocampal IGF2 protein, which was blocked by methyllycaconitine. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that galantamine increases hippocampal IGF2 levels via alpha7 nAChR activation in mice and imply that the effect may contribute to its neuroprotection or neurogenesis.",
