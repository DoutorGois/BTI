     "AB": "Effects of ID-540 (1-methyl-5-(o-fluorophenyl)-7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one) on the central nervous system were evaluated electrophysiologically and behaviorally in cats and rabbits. The reference compound used was diazepam. 1. ID-540 as well as diazepam produced muscle relaxation, grooming, facilitation of appetite and suppression of defensive behaviors. ID-540 made the animals lie on their side during sleep, but diazepam did not. 2. Though more effectively inducing an increase in fast activity and a decrease in frequency of hippocampal theta-waves than diazepam, ID-540 scarcely affected the amplitude of subcortical EEG (hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus), which diazepam decreased in cats. 3. ID-540 and diazepam increased the waking phase and decreased the paradoxical sleep phase. 4. ID-540 and diazepam at a dose of 1 mg/kg decreased the duration of amygdala after-discharge for 1 h in cats. Diazepam increased the duration of the after-discharge after it had been decreased, but ID-540 did not. ID-540 did not affect the duration of hippocampal after-discharge whereas diazepam prolonged it. 5. ID-540 depressed more effectively the hippocampal arousal response to stimulation of the ventro-medial hypothalamus than did diazepam in rabbits. 6. ID-540 depressed amygdalo-hippocampal evoked potential in cats. 7. ID-540 did not affect norepinephrine-induced pressor response but reduced hypothalamic pressor response in cats.",
