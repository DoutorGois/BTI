     "AB": "BACKGROUND: An increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in neurons has been proposed as an important effect of volatile anesthetics, because they alter signaling pathways that influence neurotransmission. However, the existing data for anesthetic-induced increases in [Ca2+]i conflict. METHODS: Changes in [Ca2+]i were measured using fura-2 fluorescence spectroscopy in rat cortical brain slices at 90, 185, 370, and 705 microM isoflurane. To define the causes of an increase in [Ca2+]i, slices were studied in Ca2+-free medium, in the presence of Ca2+-channel blockers, and in the presence of the Ca2+-release inhibitor azumolene. The authors compared the effect of the volatile anesthetic with that of the nonanesthetic compound 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane. Single-dose experiments in CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices with halothane (360 microM) and in acutely dissociated CA1 neurons with halothane (360 microM) and isoflurane (445 microM) also were performed. RESULTS: Isoflurane at 0.5, 1, and 2 minimum alveolar concentrations increased basal [Ca2+]i in cortical slices in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). This increase was not altered by Ca2+-channel blockers or Ca2+-free medium but was reduced 85% by azumolene. The nonanesthetic 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane did not increase [Ca2+]i. In dissociated CA1 neurons, isoflurane reversibly increased basal [Ca2+]i by 15 nM (P < 0.05). Halothane increased [Ca2+]i in dissociated CA1 neurons and CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices by approximately 30 nM (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: (1) Isoflurane and halothane reversibly increase [Ca2+]i in isolated neurons and in neurons within brain slices. (2) The increase in [Ca2+]i is caused primarily by release from intracellular stores. (3) Increases in [Ca2+]i occur with anesthetics but not with the nonanesthetic 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane.",
