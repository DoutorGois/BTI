     "AB": "PURPOSE: The identification of variables associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy related to hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) would improve surgical decision-making and post-operatory follow-up in this group of patients. METHODS: We analyzed the independent association between the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31 (QOLIE-31) of 81 consecutive patients with refractory MTLE-HS. The clinical, demographic, radiological and electrophysiological variables were analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis. KEY FINDINGS: Approximately 36% (adjusted R(2)=0.36; R coefficient=0.66) of the QOLIE-31 overall score variance was explained by the history of initial precipitant injury, family history of epilepsy, disease duration, age of epilepsy onset, seizure frequency and presence of psychiatric axis-II diagnosis. The variance of QOLIE-31 sub-scales was: seizure worry=7%; overall QOL=11%; emotional well-being=32%; energy/fatigue=38%; cognitive function=13%; medication effects=7%; social function=13% (R coefficient between 0.30 and 0.65). SIGNIFICANCE: The pre-surgical variables studied had relatively low prediction capacity for the overall QOLIE-31 score and its sub-scales in this set of Brazilian patients with refractory MTLE-HS.",
