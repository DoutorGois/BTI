     "AB": "We present a dataset of 1,576 single neurons recorded from the human amygdala and hippocampus in 65 sessions from 42 patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for localization of epileptic seizures. Subjects performed a recognition memory task with pictures as stimuli. Subjects were asked to identify whether they had seen a particular image the first time ('new') or second time ('old') on a 1-6 confidence scale. This comprehensive dataset includes the spike times of all neurons and their extracellular waveforms, behavior, electrode locations determined from post-operative MRI scans, demographics, and the stimuli shown. As technical validation, we provide spike sorting quality metrics and assessment of tuning of cells to verify the presence of visually-and memory selective cells. We also provide analysis code that reproduces key scientific findings published previously on a smaller version of this dataset. Together, this large dataset will facilitate the investigation of the neural mechanism of declarative memory by providing a substantial number of hard to obtain human single-neuron recordings during a well characterized behavioral task.",
