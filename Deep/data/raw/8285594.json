     "AB": "We report a family with autosomal dominant parkinsonism. The propositus developed parkinsonism at a relatively young age (45 years) and came to autopsy after a 6-year illness. She had typical features of Parkinson's disease except for an absence of rest tremor, although this was present in other family members. A diagnosis of Lewy body parkinsonism was confirmed by neuropathological examination. Additional pathological features included the presence of cortical Lewy bodies and anti-ubiquitin-positive neurites in the cornu Ammonis 2 and 3 (CA2-3) region of the hippocampus. This kindred is similar both clinically and pathologically to a few previously reported pedigrees, further strengthening recent evidence of a genetic etiology of some forms of Parkinson's disease.",
