     "AB": "Animals fed a diet deficient in thiamine or treated with a drug preventing the utilization of thiamine (thiamine antagonist) exhibited alterations in ligand binding to muscarinic receptors in several brain regions. Using quantitative techniques of receptor autoradiography, an increase in muscarinic receptor binding was demonstrated in such regions as the corpus callosum, lamina VI of the parietal cortex, caudate-putamen, ventral nucleus of the thalamus, stratum lacunosum moleculare and stratum oriens of the hippocampus, and the hilus of the area dentata. As a result of thiamine deficiency, this increase in muscarinic receptor populations was primarily due to an increase in the binding of the low-affinity agonist site. In the same experiment, a decrease in muscarinic receptor binding was found in the ventromedial region of the hypothalamus. Thiamine deficiency thus causes an up-regulation of muscarinic receptor binding in several regions of rat brain while causing a down-regulation of these same receptors in other brain areas.",
