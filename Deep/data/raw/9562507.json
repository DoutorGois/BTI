     "AB": "Changes of three different cytosolic Ca2+ binding proteins, calbindin-D28k, calretinin, and parvalbumin mRNA expression in the brain of the hamster during aging were investigated by in situ hybridization using brains from hamsters aged 4, 9, 13, 19, to 24 months old. In cerebellum area, calbindin-D28k transcripts showed about 50% to 68% decrease in content in aged-hamster (19 and 24 months old) compared with young (4 months) and adult (9 months), whereas calretinin and parvalbumin mRNA expression remain unchanged throughout the ages examined. Calbindin-D28k gene expression was decreased during aging also in the hippocampus (approximately 60% reduction) and striatum (approximately 25%). In the same areas, striatum and hippocampus, calretinin and parvalbumin mRNA expression in the equivalent sections were not significantly changed with age. These data raise the possibility that CNS calbindin-D28k expression may be selectively down-regulated during aging. The statistically significant decrease of calbindin-D28k mRNA in the normal aging process also suggests and provides further support for the hypothesis that this calcium binding protein may have an important role in neuronal degeneration.",
