     "AB": "The therapeutic strategy against autism, a severe neurological development disorder, is one of the challenges of this decade. Recent findings show that oxidative stress plays a crucial role on the pathophysiology of autism, and laser acupuncture at Shenmen (HT7) can improve oxidative status in many neurological disorders. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of laser acupuncture at HT7 on behavior disorders and oxidative stress status in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus of the valproic acid rat model of autism. Laser acupuncture was performed once daily during postnatal day (PND) 14-PND 40. Behavioral tests including rotarod, open-field, learning and memory, and social behavior tests were performed during PND 14-PND 40. At the end of study, brain oxidative status including malondialdehyde levels and the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were determined in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. Laser acupuncture at HT7 significantly improved autistic-like behaviors. Decreased malondialdehyde levels were observed in all areas mentioned above, however, increased glutathione peroxidase activity was observed only in the striatum and hippocampus. No changes in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were observed in any investigated area of the brain. Therefore, our study suggests that laser acupuncture at HT7 partly mitigates autistic-like symptoms via improved oxidative status.",
