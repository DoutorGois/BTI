     "AB": "The membrane protein HPC-1/syntaxin 1A is believed to play a key role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and it was recently suggested to be required for synaptic plasticity. Despite evidence for the function of HPC-1/syntaxin 1A in synaptic plasticity, the underlying cellular mechanism is unclear. We found that although fast synaptic transmission and long-term depression were unaffected, HPC-1/syntaxin 1A knock-out (STX1A(-/-)) mice showed impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in response to theta-burst stimulation in CA1 hippocampal slices. The impairment in LTP was rescued by the application of forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, or more robust stimulation, suggesting that cAMP/protein kinase A signaling was suppressed in these mice. In addition, catecholamine release from the hippocampus was significantly reduced in STX1A(-/-) mice. Because HPC-1/syntaxin 1A regulates exocytosis of dense-core synaptic vesicles, which contain neuromodulatory transmitters such as noradrenaline, dopamine and 5-HT, we examined the effect of neuromodulatory transmitters on LTP induction. Noradrenaline and dopamine enhanced LTP induction in STX1A(-/-) mice, whereas catecholamine depletion reduced LTP induction in wild-type mice. Theses results suggest that HPC-1/syntaxin 1A regulates catecholaminergic systems via exocytosis of dense-core synaptic vesicles, and that deletion of HPC-1/syntaxin 1A causes impairment of LTP induction.",
