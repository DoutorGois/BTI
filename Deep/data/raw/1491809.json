     "AB": "Considering that adenosine decreases glutamate release from brain slices by stimulating presynaptic A1 receptors, we have attempted to modulate glutamate release in vivo during global ischemia with an agonist (R-phenylisopropyladenosine, R-PIA) of A1 receptors. Extracellular hippocampal glutamate was sampled by microdialysis and measured by HPLC. Conscious rats were submitted to transient global ischemia for 20 min. Ischemia induced a significant increase (10 fold) in extracellular glutamate. R-PIA (20 micrograms/kg) administered i.p. 30 min before ischemia significantly reduced (-64%) glutamate release. Conversely, R-PIA (100 microM) continuously infused through the hippocampal dialysis probe did not significantly modify glutamate efflux. The efficiency of infused R-PIA was evidenced by the decrease (-47%) of glutamate release induced by veratridine depolarization. These results indicate that the depressive action of R-PIA during ischemia results from various effects which are not restricted to a local action on the hippocampus.",
