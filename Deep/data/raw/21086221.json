     "AB": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to report on 52 children operated on for pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy, with special emphasis on histopathology and correlation with clinical features. METHODS: Charts were retrospectively analyzed. All children underwent comprehensive clinical, electrophysiological and radiological investigations before surgery. Surgical procedures were tailored according to scalp, foramen ovale and eventually depth electrode recordings. Histopathology was compared with clinical variables (chi (2) and Fisher's exact tests). Outcome was evaluated using the Engel scale. RESULTS: Developmental tumor was found in 14 cases, malformation of cortical development (MCD) in 26, isolated hippocampal sclerosis (HS) in 5 and gliosis in 7. Dual pathology (DP) affected 18 patients and the main extrahippocampal lesion consisted of microscopic sub-cortical heterotopias (HS-HT) for 15 patients who shared a particular clinical pattern: a history of febrile seizures (FS) and/or brain injury, early onset of epilepsy without latent period from FS to the first temporal seizure, and a particularly good outcome following surgery. CONCLUSION: In our pediatric temporal lobe surgery series, the prevalence for MCD and for DP was higher than in adult series. Age at seizure onset depends on pathology, and is earlier when involving the neocortex rather than only the hippocampus. We identify the association HS-HT (the most frequent DP in this series), with particular clinical features.",
