     "AB": "The caspase family of cell death proteases has been implicated in the mechanism of neuronal death following seizures. We investigated the expression and processing of caspases 6 and 7, putative executioner caspases. Brief limbic seizures were evoked by intraamygdala kainic acid to elicit unilateral death of target hippocampal CA3 neurons in the rat. Seizures rapidly induced cleavage of constitutively expressed caspase-6, followed by elevated VEIDase activity and the proteolysis of lamin A. Neuronal caspase-6 immunoreactivity was markedly upregulated within cortex and hippocampus in relation to bursts of polyspike paroxysmal discharges. In contrast, while caspase-7 expression also increased within cortical and hippocampal neuronal populations in response to the same seizure patterns, caspase-7 was not proteolytically activated. These data highlight differences in expression and activation of caspases 6 and 7 in response to identifiable seizure patterns, focusing potential therapeutic targets for neuroprotection in epilepsy.",
