     "AB": "There is accumulating evidence that methamphetamine (MA) is a widely abused drug popular among pregnant women. MA exposure is associated with changes in the function of neurotransmitter systems, namely the dopaminergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic systems. Since N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA) are affected by MA-induced glutamate release, we assessed the expression of NMDAR subunits (NR1, NR2A, and NR2B) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), which is connected with NMDAR. We measured the expression of these proteins in adolescent (30 days old) and adult (60 days old) rat males exposed to MA during the entire prenatal period and compared them with the same parameters in age matched saline-exposed rats. There was a significant increase in the NR1 and NR2B subunits in the hippocampus of adult males, but not in adolescent males. We identified a significant change in adult MA-induced rats when compared to adult controls for NR2A and NR2B, while in adolescent MA rats this change was close to the boundary of significance. In summary, our study suggests that prenatal MA exposure is connected with changes in NMDAR subunit expression in adult rats but not in adolescent rats.",
