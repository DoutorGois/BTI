     "AB": "Mixed natural antioxidants can be combined in a prophylactic food against age related disease involving reactive oxygen species. beta-Catechin is an antioxidant drink, having free radical scavenging activities. It contains green tea extract as a main component as well as ascorbic acid, sunflower seed extract, dunaliella carotene and natural vitamin E. In the present study, we examined the effect of beta-catechin on lipid peroxide formation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in aged rat brain and the effect on 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in ipsilateral cortex, 30 min after ferric chloride solution was injected into the left cortex of rats. beta-Catechin solution was orally administered to aged rats and normal rats for 1 month. One-month administration of beta-catechin solution increased SOD activity in the mitochondria fraction of striatum and midbrain and decreased thiobarbiturate reactive substance formation in the cortex and cerebellum of aged rats. It also inhibited 8-OHdG formation in the ipsilateral cortex 30 min after injection of ferric chloride solution. These results suggest that beta-catechin is a suitable prophylactic beverage against age-related neurological diseases associated with reactive oxygen species.",
