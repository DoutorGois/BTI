     "AB": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have frequently, although not unambiguously, reported hippocampal volume deficit in schizophrenia. Data on the hippocampal volumes in first-episode schizophrenia, however, are sparse. In addition, a recent topographic MRI study proposed a regionally specific volume loss in the hippocampus of chronic schizophrenics, but to date no reports have replicated this finding. In this study two-dimensional MRI-based topographic brain mapping was used to study the possibility of regional changes in the hippocampus of 22 controls and 18 patients with first-episode, neuroleptic-naive schizophrenia. Compared to controls, there were no significant differences between hippocampal volumes, regional volumes, or length of the hippocampus in the patients with schizophrenia. These data are at odds with the previous reports on hippocampal volume loss in first-episode schizophrenia, and with the hypothesis of regionally specific hippocampal volume deficit in schizophrenia.",
