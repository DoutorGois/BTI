     "AB": "Abstract Stroke is one of the most debilitating diseases, and it is unfortunate that only a small percentage of patients can be treated with thrombolytic agents. Consequently, there is an urgent need of finding an alternative procedure for reoxygenating the so-called penumbra at the earliest time as possible for reducing morbidity and disability. A preliminary, preclinical study has been carried out by using rat hippocampal and cortical brain slices subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation. Oxygen-ozone gaseous mixture appeared to be effective in reverting damage of brain tissues, supporting the evaluation of this approach in well-designed clinical trials in stroke patients.",
