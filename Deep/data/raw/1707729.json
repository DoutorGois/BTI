     "AB": "Volkensin, a ribosome-inactivating toxic lectin which has been proposed as a 'suicide transport' agent in the CNS, was unilaterally injected in the rat dorsal hippocampus at a dose of 1.2 ng. Three to 5 days after the injection, degenerating neurons were observed at the electron microscope in the medial septum-diagonal band area ipsilateral to the injection. Ten days after the injection, the number of pyramidal neurons in the CA3 region of the contralateral hippocampus, which are the major source of hippocampal commissural fibers, was obviously decreased. At the same survival time, the number of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactive neurons in the ipsilateral medial septum-diagonal band area was moderately but significantly decreased. These neurons are known to be the major source of the septohippocampal cholinergic projection. Concomitantly, microchemical assays of ChAT levels revealed a 25% decrease of enzyme activity in the medial septum-diagonal band area ipsilateral to the injection. This was accompanied by a 33% decrease of ChAT in the ipsilateral ventral hippocampus which was interpreted to be due, at least in part, to the degeneration of cholinergic septal neurons projecting to both the dorsal and the ventral hippocampus. Taken together, these results provide clear evidence that volkensin is taken up by nerve terminals in the injected area of the brain and retrogradely transported to the cell bodies originating the projection, which are killed by the toxin. The usefulness of the strategy of 'suicide transport' in the CNS is, therefore, confirmed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
