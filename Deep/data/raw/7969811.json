     "AB": "We examined the effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A agonists on walking related, atropine-resistant, rhythmical slow activity (wr-RSA) of the hippocampus in rats. Selective 5-HT1A agonists, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), flesinoxan, buspirone and ipsapirone significantly decreased the power value of 7-9 Hz band activity and the median frequency of wr-RSA. The order of potency was 8-OH-DPAT > flesinoxan = buspirone in power reduction. The 5-HT1A antagonists, (-)pindolol, (-)propranolol and spiperone, inhibited the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on wr-RSA. Pretreatment with parachlorophenylalanine did not abolish the effect of 8-OH-DPAT. These results indicate that 5-HT1A agonists reduce both power and median frequency values of wr-RSA through activation of post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the forebrain in unanesthetized rats, in vivo.",
