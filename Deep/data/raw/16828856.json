     "AB": "Androgens, such as testosterone (T), can have reinforcing effect, which may be due in part to actions of T's metabolite, 3alpha-androstanediol (3alpha-diol). To investigate rewarding effects of 3alpha-diol, gonadally intact adult male hamsters were given a two-bottle choice test to determine the amount of 3alpha-diol that would be self-administered over 4 days of exposure. After 2 days of habituation and 4 days of monitoring of consumption, hamsters were tested in an activity monitor and the open field (locomotion/exploration), paw lick (analgesia) and resident-intruder (aggression) tasks. Hamsters consumed significantly more 3alpha-diol than vehicle in the two-bottle choice test. Hamsters that were allowed to self-administer 3alpha-diol made significantly more beam breaks and total entries in the open field had increased latencies to pawlick, and engaged in significantly fewer attacks, than did hamsters with access to vehicle alone. Hamsters that self-administered 3alpha-diol had higher levels of 3alpha-diol in serum, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, striatum and midbrain than did hamsters with access to vehicle alone. Together, these data suggest that 3alpha-diol may have rewarding effects.",
