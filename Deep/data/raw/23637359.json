     "AB": "Length estimates of particular features of biological tissues can be useful in evaluating function. Such estimates have been notoriously difficult to obtain because of the requirement for an isotropic interaction between the area probes and the linear features of cells and tissues, which are most likely not isotropically oriented. For complex embedded structures, such as subdivisions of the brain, the turning of the tissue before sectioning that is needed to ensure an isotropic interaction has made it difficult to delineate many regions of interest and limited the number of unbiased stereological studies of length. The recent development of a virtual isotropic spherical probe, the spaceball, makes it relatively easy for the isotropic interaction between probe and structure to be realized. This article describes the use of the spaceball probe to estimate length, and gives an example of estimating total capillary length in CA1 stratum radiatum of the human hippocampus.",
