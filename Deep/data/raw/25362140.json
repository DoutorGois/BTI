     "AB": "The functions of type II diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) delta and -eta in the brain are still unclear. As a first step, we investigated the spatial and temporal expression of DGKdelta and -eta in the brains of mice. DGKdelta2, but not DGKdelta1, was highly expressed in layers II-VI of the cerebral cortex; CA-CA3 regions and dentate gyrus of hippocampus; mitral cell, glomerular and granule cell layers of the olfactory bulb; and the granule cell layer in the cerebellum in 1- to 32-week-old mice. DGKdelta2 was expressed just after birth, and its expression levels dramatically increased from weeks 1 to 4. A substantial amount of DGKeta (eta1/eta2) was detected in layers II-VI of the cerebral cortex, CA1 and CA2 regions and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, mitral cell and glomerular layers of the olfactory bulb, and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of 1- to 32-week-old mice. DGKeta2 expression reached maximum levels at P5 and decreased by 4 weeks, whereas DGKeta1 increased over the same time frame. These results indicate that the expression patterns of DGK isozymes differ from each other and also from other isozymes, and this suggests that DGKdelta and -eta play distinct and specific roles in the brain.",
