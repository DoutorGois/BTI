     "AB": "To attend successfully, a specification of what is currently relevant is necessary, but not sufficient. Irrelevant stimuli that are also present in the environment must be recognized as such and filtered out at the same time. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we showed that posterior brain regions in parietal, occipital and temporal cortex are recruited in order to ignore distracting visual stimuli, while the specification and selection of relevant stimuli is associated with differential activity in frontal cortex and hippocampal areas instead. The results thus suggest that the selection of relevant objects can be anatomically dissociated from the handling of competing irrelevant objects. The dissociation between the increased involvement of parietal and occipital cortex in handling distraction on one hand, and that of frontal cortex in target specification on the other provides neurophysiological support for models of attention that make this functional distinction.",
