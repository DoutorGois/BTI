     "AB": "Background. Neuronal apoptosis is the major cause of diabetes central neuropathy, but its role in volumetric changes of hippocampus has not been clarified. The aims of this study were to assess the role of apoptosis in volumetric changes of dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 region of hippocampus and to determine a reference point in which these neuropathological changes reach a meaningful level. Methods and Materials. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats (N = 10) by streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). Six weeks after diabetes, verification animals were divided into four groups as follows: diabetic treated with insulin (3-5 U), diabetic treated with vitamin C (80 mg/kg), and diabetic and control groups. At the end of 8 weeks, numerical density of apoptotic neurons and volume of dentate gyrus and CA3 were calculated by stereological methods. Results. The number of apoptotic neurons in DG and CA3 in diabetic group showed significant level of difference in comparison with the control (P < 0.001). The volume of DG and CA3 in diabetic and vitamin C showed significant level of difference compared with control (P < 0.001). Conclusion. Our results suggest that DG and CA3 volume reduction begins and progresses independently of neuronal loss.",
