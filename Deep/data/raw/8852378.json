     "AB": "Exposure to cocaine during fetal development has been demonstrated to produce a variety of brain and behavioral changes. Cocaine is a potent releaser of a variety of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, which act as developmental signals. Since serotonin plays an important role in astroglial maturation, migration, and growth factor production (e.g. S-100 beta), we proposed that these properties of astroglial cells will be altered in a brain prenatally exposed to cocaine. To observe cocaine's effects on astroglial development, we performed immunocytochemical analyses of a variety of developmental protein makers including BrdU, Gap-43, vimentin, and S100 beta. Our results demonstrate that prenatal cocaine administration produces decreased cell proliferation as measured by BrdU staining, retarded neurite outgrowth as ascertained by increased Gap-43 immunoreactivity, increased density of vimentin-positive radial glial cells, and diminished tissue S100 beta immunoreactivity. Overall, these results suggest that cocaine delays astroglial development. This delay would have profound effects on neuronal development and outgrowth and, thus, development of the entire brain.",
