     "AB": "Despite numerous studies in which hippocampal abnormalities were found, schizophrenia patients' hippocampal neural activity has not been systematically evaluated on a specific hippocampal-dependent task. The transverse-patterning task (TP) is sensitive to the relational mnemonic capabilities of the hippocampus. Ten schizophrenia patients and 10 controls performed TP and control tasks that are not hippocampal dependent. As predicted, patients displayed a behavioral impairment in TP and not in control tasks. Magnetoencephalography showed controls activating right hippocampus during TP performance. Patients showed more bilateral or left hippocampal activation during TP, and greater left lateralization was associated with better performance on TP. Patients' abnormal hippocampal lateralization may play a role in the hippocampal-dependent behavioral deficit.",
