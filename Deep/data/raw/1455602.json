     "AB": "To characterize the convulsions induced by an aqueous extract of Palicourea marcgravii (Pm), male Wistar rats were injected sc with 3.75 g/kg of the extract, and electroencephalogram and behavior were observed for periods up to 180 min after the Pm injections. Sleep spindles and generalized convulsive seizures were observed following Pm administration. Spiking activity was detected in both cortical and hippocampus recordings. They lasted approximately 2 min and were followed by a period of postical depression and/or death. These results agreed with previous behavioral experiments which suggested the toxic effect of Pm aqueous extract was mainly at the central nervous system level.",
