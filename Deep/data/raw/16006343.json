     "AB": "A 79-year-old patient with neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD) presented with a selective environmental reduplicative paramnesia (RP), the belief that one or more environments exist simultaneously in two or more physical locations. Clinical presentation and neuropathological examination revealed an atypical form of AD. High neurofibrillary tangle densities were observed in the frontal and temporal association cortex, whereas the parietal and entorhinal cortex, as well as the hippocampus, were nearly spared. These findings are compared to those reported in frontal and frontotemporal variants of AD and discussed in the light of current anatomoclinical models for environmental RP.",
