     "AB": "Resveratrol is a naturally occurring phytoalexin found in red grapes, and believed to have neuroprotective, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. But little is known about its effect on the neural impairments induced by microglial over-activation, which leads to neuroinflammation and multiple pathophysiological damages. In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of resveratrol on the impairments of neural development by microglial over-activation insult. The results indicated that resveratrol inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent release of cytokines from activated microglia and LPS-dependent changes in NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Conditioned medium (CM) from activated microglia treated by resveratrol directly protected primary cultured hippocampal neurons against LPS-CM-induced neuronal death, and restored the inhibitory effects of LPS-CM on dendrite sprouting and outgrowth. Finally, neurons cultured in CM from LPS-stimulated microglia treated by resveratrol exhibited increased spine density compared to those without resveratrol treatment. Our findings support that resveratrol inhibits microglial over-activation and alleviates neuronal injuries induced by microglial activation. Our study suggests the use of resveratrol as an alternative intervention approach that could prevent further neuronal insults.",
