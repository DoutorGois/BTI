     "AB": "A retrospective pathological study of 118 rabbits presenting with neurological disease was conducted. Diagnoses were categorized on the basis of aetiopathogenesis as inflammatory, vascular, traumatic, metabolic-toxic, neoplastic, degenerative or idiopathic. Central nervous system (CNS) lesions were present in 85 (72.0%) of the rabbits and in most of these cases (70.3%) a causative agent was identified. The majority of animals (n=78, 66.1%) had disease of an inflammatory nature and 71 of these 78 rabbits had one of two zoonotic infectious diseases: encephalitozoonosis (n=69, 58.5%) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis (n=2). Infections with zoonotic potential are therefore a major cause of CNS disease in the rabbit.",
