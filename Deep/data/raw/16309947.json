     "AB": "A network of brain areas collectively represent location, but the underlying nature of this \"cognitive map\" has remained elusive. A recent study reports that the activity patterns of some entorhinal cortical neurons form a remarkably regular array of evenly spaced peaks across the surface of the environment. These \"grid cells\" might be the basis of a metric used for calculating position, and their discovery could greatly advance our understanding of how navigational computations are performed.",
