     "AB": "The prefrontal cortex and subiculum of the hippocampal formation was sampled from 10 Macaca mulatta aged 7 to 30 years. There was no significant difference in RNA content of frontal and subicular neurons between 7 and 20 years. The mean RNA content was 22.86 pg for the cortical and 45.14 pg for the subicular neuron. Contrarily, a significant decrease in neuronal RNA content in both the prefrontal cortex and the subiculum was found for the four M. mulatta of advanced age. The oldest M. mulatta aged 27 to 30 years revealed a mean RNA content of 16.8 pg for the prefrontal cortex and 33.5 pg for the subiculum. Age-related RNA changes in M. mulatta was discussed in relation to that in the human brain.",
