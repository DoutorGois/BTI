     "AB": "There are still no clear biophysical models for Associative Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and Depression (LTD) in the hippocampus, where two populations of synapses targeted to the same receptive field are involved. Here we propose a model that allows an interpretation of the experiments in terms of the molecular processes that may be involved in associative memory. The model suggests that retrograde messengers could have a critical role in the induction and maintenance of associative LTP and LTD, by controlling the coupling between the two populations of synapses.",
