     "AB": "The effects of chronic delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC) and marijuana administration on the properties of brain cannabinoid receptor populations of the rat and monkey, respectively, were examined in this study. It was determined that the properties of the cannabinoid receptors in the striatum, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and brainstem/spinal cord of the rat do not appear to be irreversibly altered by chronic exposure to delta 9-THC. Similarly, the cannabinoid receptors in the caudate, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum of the monkey do not appear to be irreversibly altered by chronic exposure to marijuana smoke.",
