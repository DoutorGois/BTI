     "AB": "The role was studied of ephrin-B3, a ligand of the Eph family of tyrosine kinase receptors, in the formation of cortical connectivity. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that EphA4, a receptor of ephrin-B3, was expressed in the lateral thalamus (visual and somaotosensory thalamus) of the developing rat brain, but not in the medial thalamic nuclei which project to the limbic cortex. Correspondingly, ephrin-B3 was expressed strongly in the developing limbic cortex including amygdala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. To examine the action of ephrin-B3 on thalamic axons, either lateral or medial thalamic explants were cultured on membranes obtained from ephrin-B3-expressing COS cells. Axonal growth was inhibited for cells from the lateral thalamus but not from the medial thalamus. These results suggest that ephrin-B3 contributes to regional specificity by suppressing axonal growth of lateral thalamic neurons.",
