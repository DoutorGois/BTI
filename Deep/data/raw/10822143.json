     "AB": "Neurogenesis occurs throughout life in mammalian dentate gyrus. The effect of learning on newborn cell survival was studied in rat. Rats were trained on a hippocampus-dependent spatial learning task by using Morris water maze. Neurogenesis was evaluated by 5-bromo-2'deoxyuridine administered before learning. Several newborn cells expressed the immature neuron marker TOAD-64. The main findings were as follows: (1) the survival of newborn cells was enhanced by learning at early stage of differentiation; (2) the newborn cells saved by learning were mainly located in the rostral part of external blade of granule cell layer and (3) there was a correlation between the actual individual learning and newborn cell survival.",
