     "AB": "Modification of brain muscarinic cholinergic system normal functioning can be considered as an appropriate strategy for the study of its role in sleep-wakefulness cycle basic mechanisms in general and in the course/maintenance of PS in particular. For this aim systemic application of muscarinic cholinoreceptors antagonists is significant because it gives possibility to modify functioning all of known five sub-types of muscarinic cholinoreceptors and to study the character of sleep disturbances in these conditions. Problem is very topical because the question about the intimate aspects of BMChS involvement in PS maintaining mechanisms still remains unsolved. In cats Atropine systemic administration was made once daily at 10:00 a.m. and continuous EEG registration of sleep-wakefulness cycle ultradian structure, lasting for 10 hour daily, was started immediately. In sum each animal received anti-muscarinic drugs for 12 times. Thereafter drug administrations were ceased and EEG registration of sleep-wakefulness cycle ultradian structure was continued during 10 consecutive days. On the basis of results obtained in these conditions we can conclude that brain muscarinic cholinergic system normal functioning is significant for basic mechanisms of sleep-wakefulness cycle. During wakefulness, at the level of neocortex and hippocampus, MChS supports only EEG activation, while it is one of the main factors in PS triggering and maintaining mechanisms.",
