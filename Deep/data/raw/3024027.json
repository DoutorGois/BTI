     "AB": "The effect of the purinergic agonist, 2-chloroadenosine (2-CADO), on central cholinergic parameters was studied in the rat. The drug (20 micrograms, i.c.v.) increased acetylcholine (ACh) content (approximately 30%) and inhibited sodium dependent high affinity choline uptake (30%) in the hippocampus. In striatum, the increase of ACh content was less marked (approximately 15%) and was not associated with inhibition of choline uptake. In both areas, ACh accumulation was prevented by theophylline but not by atropine or oxotremorine pretreatments. Differences were noted in the purinergic control of cholinergic function in the hippocampus and striatum. In hippocampus, the selective degeneration of noradrenergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic afferent pathways or the destructions of intrinsic neurons did not prevent the rise in ACh content induced by 2-CADO. Differently, in striatum, the action of 2-CADO was potentiated both by raphe deafferentation and by inhibition of serotonin synthesis and was completely prevented by chronic unilateral decortication. The cholinergic effect of 2-CADO was unchanged after impairment of the noradrenergic or dopaminergic systems. In addition, the D- and L-isomers of phenylisopropyladenosine, which have different affinities for A1 purinergic receptors but equal affinity for the A2 purinergic subtype, differed in their ability to affect acetylcholine content in these two brain regions, suggesting that A1 purinergic receptor activation mediates the effect of 2-CADO in the hippocampus and A2 receptor activation mediates the drug's action in the striatum.",
