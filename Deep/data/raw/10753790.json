     "AB": "Schizophrenia is often associated with cognitive deficits, particularly within the domains of memory and language. Specific cognitive deficits have recently been linked to psychotic phenomena, including verbal hallucinations and disorganized speech. Impairments of working and semantic memory are primarily due to dysfunction of the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and hippocampus. Cognitive skills in schizophrenia predict social functioning and may serve as outcome measures in the development of effective treatment strategies.",
