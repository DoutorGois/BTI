     "AB": "Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic effective in treating the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of patients with schizophrenia. Our previous study has shown that chronic administration of quetiapine attenuates the decrease in levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampi of rats subjected to chronic-restraint stress. In the present study, we investigated the effects of quetiapine on hippocampal neurogenesis that had been compromised in stressed rats. Newborn cells in the hippocampus were labeled by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and immature neurons were detected immunohistochemically using an antibody against phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB). The restrained rats (4 h/day for 7 days) showed lower levels of hippocampal neurogenesis indicated by decreased numbers of BrdU-labeled and pCREB-positive cells. Post-stress administration of quetiapine (10 mg/kg) for 7 or 21 days reversed the stress-induced suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis, evidenced in the numbers of BrdU-labeled and pCREB-positive cells that are comparable to those in non-stressed rats but higher than those in the vehicle-treated rats. The results may help us understand the therapeutic effects of quetiapine on cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia and depression, in which the structure and functions of the hippocampus are implicated.",
