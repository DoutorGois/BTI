     "AB": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role in cognitive functions, including working memory, attention regulation, behavioral inhibition, as well as memory storage. The functions of PFC are very sensitive to norepinephrine (NE), and even low levels of endogenously released NE exert a dramatic influence on the functioning of the PFC. Activation of beta-adrenoceptors (beta-ARs) facilitates synaptic potentiation and enhances memory in the hippocampus. However, little is known regarding these processes in the PFC. In the present study, we investigate the role of beta2-AR in synaptic plasticity and behavioral memory. Our results show that beta2-AR selective agonist clenbuterol facilitates spike-timing-dependent long-term potentiation (tLTP) under the physiological conditions with intact GABAergic inhibition, and such facilitation is prevented by co-application with the cAMP inhibitor Rp-cAMPS. Loading postsynaptic pyramidal cells with Rp-cAMPS, the PKA inhibitor PKI(5-24), or the G protein inhibitor GDP-beta-S significantly decreases, but does not eliminate, the effect of clenbuterol. Clenbuterol suppresses the GABAergic transmission, while blocking GABAergic transmission by the GABA(A) receptor blocker partially mimics the effect of clenbuterol. In behavioral tests, a post-training infusion of clenbuterol into mPFC enhances 24-h trace fear memory. In summary, we observed that prefrontal cortical beta2-AR activation by clenbuterol facilitates tLTP and enhances trace fear memory. The mechanism underlying tLTP facilitation involves stimulating postsynaptic cAMP-PKA signaling cascades and suppressing GABAergic circuit activities.",
