     "AB": "A quantitative morphological study of the changes in the dentate gyrus molecular layer in response to the removal of perforant path afferents was made utilizing electron microscopic techniques. Alterations in 1. the population of remaining afferents, 2. glial cells, and 3. granule cell dendrites are reported. The major observation was an increase in intact bouton density in the region of denervation which began at 5 days post-lesion and continued through 11 days post-lesion, the longest post-lesion survival time studied.",
