     "AB": "Administration to rats of chronic electroconvulsive shock (ECS) or chronic desipramine (DMI, 10 mg/kg daily i.p. for 3 weeks) did not affect either basal or forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in membranes prepared from the caudate nucleus. In cerebellar membranes prepared from rats which had received chronic ECS, forskolin-stimulated activity was significantly increased compared to activity in sham- or single ECS treated rats. Forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase was increased in both hippocampal and cerebellar membranes from rats which received chronic DMI, compared to saline-treated animals. In cerebellar membranes, increases comparable to those with forskolin were also obtained with guanylyl-5'-imidodiphosphate (GppNHp) after both treatments, while with Mn2+ ions, either alone or in the additional presence of forskolin, the changes observed were similar to those previously reported in cortical membranes. A possible mechanism for these effects was investigated by studying antidepressant-induced and in vitro desensitization of the cyclic AMP response in slice preparations from the various brain areas. In slices from caudate nucleus, chronic DMI did not alter stimulation of cyclic AMP formation by either noradrenaline or forskolin, while in cerebellar slices the noradrenaline response was significantly reduced, and in hippocampal slices both responses were reduced (heterologous desensitization). In vitro incubation of cortical slices with noradrenaline also resulted in a reduction in the response to both agents. However, in membranes prepared from the desensitized cortical slices, there was no change in the degree of activation of adenylate cyclase by either NaF or forskolin. Thus, the increase in these activities, observed in certain brain areas after chronic antidepressant treatment may not necessarily be related to beta-adrenoceptor desensitization.",
