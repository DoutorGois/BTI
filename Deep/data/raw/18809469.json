     "AB": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases involved in brain development and the etiology of adult cerebral injuries. In this study, we determined the MMP-2 and 9 responses following hypoxic ischemia (HI) injury in the developing brain. First, we characterized the developmental changes of MMP activity in the rat brain from embryonic day 18 (E18) to postnatal day 120 (P120). MMP-2 activity was high from E18 to P3 and decreased with age (P< or =0.001), while MMP-9 activity was not detectable. MMP-2 immunoreactivity was closely associated with differentiating cortical plate and subplate neurons. Next, we characterized the proteolytic changes after unilateral HI brain injury in 3- (P3) and 21- (P21) day-old rats. Zymography revealed that in the P21 rat brain, MMP-9 activity (150 and 92 kDa forms) was increased at 6 h and remained elevated 24 h post-injury in the ipsilateral injured hemisphere (P< or =0.001), whereas there was a gradual increase in MMP-2 (65 kDa) activity, reaching a peak at 5 days (P< or =0.001). Similarly, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) indicated significant elevations in MMP-9 and MMP-2 mRNA expression in the injured cortex (P< or =0.05) and hippocampus (P< or =0.05) at 1 and 5 days post-injury, respectively in the P21 rat brain. In the P3 rat brain, zymography results revealed that both pro (92 kDa) and cleaved (87 kDa) MMP-9 activities were upregulated in the ipsilateral injured hemisphere from 6 h to 1 day after injury (P< or =0.001). In contrast, cleaved MMP-2 (60 kDa) was only moderately upregulated at 6 h (P< or =0.01), while pro MMP-2 (65 kDa) levels were unaffected. MMP-9 mRNA expression was also increased at 6 h (P< or =0.05) following injury at P3, whereas MMP-2 expression remained unchanged compared with the uninjured contralateral hemisphere. Immunohistochemistry indicated that MMP-9 protein expression was localized predominantly to neurons and peri-vascular astrocytes in the affected regions at early time points, whereas MMP-2 was present on reactive astrocytes surrounding the infarct at later time points. Together, these results indicate that MMP-2 may be primarily associated with the development and differentiation of cortical plate neurons and wound recovery processes. Conversely, MMP-9 appeared to be associated with more acute processes during the period of lesion development.",
