     "AB": "Soluble oligomeric forms of amyloid beta (AbetaO) are regarded as a main cause of synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and have been a primary target in the development of drug treatments for AD. The present study utilized a mouse model of AD induced by intrahippocampal injection of AbetaO (10 muM) to investigate the effects of Gami-Chunghyuldan (GCD), a standardized multi-herbal medicinal formula, on the presentation of memory deficits and neurohistological pathogenesis. GCD (10 and 50mg/kg/day, 5 days, p.o.) improved AbetaO-induced memory impairment as well as reduced neuronal cell death, astrogliosis, and microgliosis in the hippocampus. In addition, GCD prevented AbetaO-triggered synaptic disruption and cholinergic fiber loss. These results suggest that GCD may be useful in the prevention and treatment of AD.",
