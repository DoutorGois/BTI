     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Substance use disorder (SUD) patients with a history of trauma exhibit poorer treatment outcome, greater functional impairment and higher risk for relapse. Endorsement of prior trauma has, in several SUD populations, been linked to abnormal functional connectivity (FC) during task-based studies. We examined amygdala FC in the resting state (RS), testing for differences between cocaine patients with and without prior trauma. METHODS: Patients with cocaine use disorder (CUD; n=34) were stabilized in an inpatient setting prior to a BOLD fMRI scan. Responses to Addiction Severity Index and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used to characterize the No-Trauma (n=16) and Trauma (n=18) groups. Seed-based RSFC was conducted using the right and left amygdala as regions of interest. Examination of amygdala RSFC was restricted to an a priori anatomical mask that incorporated nodes of the limbic-striatal motivational network. RESULTS: RSFC was compared for the Trauma versus No-Trauma groups. The Trauma group evidenced greater connectivity between the amygdala and the a priori limbic-striatal mask. Peaks within the statistically significant limbic-striatal mask included the amygdala, putamen, pallidum, caudate, thalamus, insula, hippocampus/parahippocampus, and brain stem. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that cocaine patients with prior trauma (versus without) have heightened communication within nodes of the motivational network, even at rest. To our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study to examine amygdala RSFC among those with CUD and trauma history. Heightened RSFC intralimbic connectivity for the Trauma group may reflect a relapse-relevant brain vulnerability and a novel treatment target for this clinically-challenging population.",
