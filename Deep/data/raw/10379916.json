     "AB": "In seasonally breeding songbirds, song behavior and neural morphology change seasonally. Song control nuclei are larger during the breeding season, as determined by multiple cytological labels. Seasonal changes in song nuclei are regulated by testosterone (T), and several song nuclei contain intracellular androgen receptors (AR). Changes in AR levels may interact with changes in plasma T levels to regulate song nuclei morphology. We measured seasonal changes in AR-immunoreactive cells in the telencephalic song nucleus HVc using the affinity-purified PG21 antibody to rat AR. We caught wild adult male Gambel's white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) during spring breeding in Alaska and during autumn migration in Washington State. To enhance PG21 labeling, animals were treated with T for 90 minutes (as in Smith et al. [1996] J. Histochem. Cytochem. 44:1075-1080). AR+ cells were found in HVc and other song nuclei, hippocampus, nucleus taeniae (homologue to mammalian amygdala), and the hypothalamus. HVc volume was larger in spring (S) than autumn (A), in both the PG21- and Nissl-stained sections (S:A = 1.9 and 1.7, respectively). In spring, but not autumn, PG21 and Nissl measurements were slightly different (PG21:Nissl = 1.07), perhaps because PG21 labeled the most caudal extent of HVc more clearly. In HVc, AR+ cell density and number were greater in spring. The percentage of AR+ cells was also increased in spring. Qualitatively, the staining intensity of individual cells was higher in spring. In time course studies, the T injection enhanced PG21 staining within 15 minutes, suggesting that it increases labeling via AR translocation to and concentration in the cell nucleus.",
