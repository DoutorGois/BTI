     "AB": "Previous research has suggested that cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGKs) may play a role in long-term potentiation in hippocampus, but their site of action has been unknown. We examined this question at synapses between pairs of hippocampal neurons in dissociated cell culture. Injection of a specific peptide inhibitor of cGK into the presynaptic but not the postsynaptic neuron blocked long-lasting potentiation induced by tetanic stimulation of the presynaptic neuron. As controls, injection of a scrambled peptide or a peptide inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase into either neuron did not block potentiation. Conversely, injection of the alpha isozyme of cGK type I into the presynaptic but not the postsynaptic neuron produced activity-dependent potentiation that did not require NMDA receptor activation. Evidence from Western blots, reverse transcription-PCR, activity assays, and immunocytochemistry indicates that endogenous cGK type I is present in the neurons, including presynaptic terminals. These results support the idea that cGK plays an important presynaptic role during the induction of long-lasting potentiation in hippocampal neurons.",
