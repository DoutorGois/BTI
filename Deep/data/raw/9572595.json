     "AB": "Glutamate receptors of the metabotropic type (mGluRs) activate protein kinase C in hippocampus, but few physiological functions of this pathway are known. The present data show that mGluRs utilize protein kinase C to inhibit another second messenger system, the adenylyl cyclase pathway, in neurons of the CA1 area of hippocampus. Activation of mGluRs prevented beta-adrenergic receptors, which couple to adenylyl cyclase, from blocking the slow Ca2+-dependent afterhyperpolarization (AHP). Since the afterhyperpolarization modulates neuronal responsiveness, crosstalk between protein kinase C and the adenylyl cyclase pathway is likely to have physiological consequences. Moreover, mGluRs themselves block the afterhyperpolarization, so the observed interference with the beta-adrenergic response constitutes a hierarchical relationship in which mGluRs are dominant over beta-adrenergic receptors.",
