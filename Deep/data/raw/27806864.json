     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the functioning of mesolimbic and fronto-striatal areas involved in reward-based spatial learning in teenaged girls with bulimia nervosa (BN) that might be involved in the development and maintenance of maladaptive behaviors characteristic of the disorder. METHOD: We compared functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen level-dependent response in 27 adolescent girls with BN to that of 27 healthy, age-matched control participants during a reward-based learning task that required learning to use extra-maze cues to navigate a virtual 8-arm radial maze to find hidden rewards. We compared groups in their patterns of brain activation associated with reward-based spatial learning versus a control condition in which rewards were unexpected because they were allotted pseudo-randomly to experimentally prevent learning. RESULTS: Both groups learned to navigate the maze to find hidden rewards, but group differences in brain activity associated with maze navigation and reward processing were detected in the fronto-striatal regions and right anterior hippocampus. Unlike healthy adolescents, those with BN did not engage the right inferior frontal gyrus during maze navigation, activated the right anterior hippocampus during the receipt of unexpected rewards (control condition), and deactivated the left superior frontal gyrus and right anterior hippocampus during expected reward receipt (learning condition). These patterns of hippocampal activation in the control condition were significantly associated with the frequency of binge-eating episodes. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with BN displayed abnormal functioning of the anterior hippocampus and fronto-striatal regions during reward-based spatial learning. These findings suggest that an imbalance in control and reward circuits may arise early in the course of BN.
