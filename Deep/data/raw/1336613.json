     "AB": "New developments in corticosteroid receptor research enabled us to perform a highly detailed study on the neuroanatomical topography of MR and GR in the rat hippocampus. Receptor immunocytochemistry was used to map the distribution of GR protein with the help of a monoclonal antibody raised against the purified rat liver GR-hormone complex. Furthermore, in situ hybridization with 35S-labeled RNA probes, which were transcribed from cDNAs complementary to either a fragment of the rat brain MR gene or to the rat liver GR gene, was applied to investigate the localization of MR and GR mRNA in the limbic brain. The pyramidal neurons of cell field Ca1 and CA2 and the granular neurons of the dentate gyrus showed marked GR immunoreactivity (GRir) as well as intense labeling of GR mRNA. The radiolabeled density of GR mRNA in cell fields CA3 and CA4 was considerable less, whereas low-to-almost-undetectable levels of GRir could be observed in these regions. MR mRNA appeared to be evenly distributed over all cell fields of the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus. The topography of GRir, GR mRNA and MR mRNA was found to agree with the cellular distribution of MR and GR binding sites in the hippocampus. Moreover, the microanatomy of MR and GR in the hippocampus appeared to overlap. Our data strongly suggest that MR and GR are co-expressed in the majority of pyramidal and granular neurons of the hippocampal formation. This assumption is based on coherence in the detection of different aspects of the receptor cycle of MR and GR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
