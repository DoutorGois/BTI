     "AB": "The involvement of synaptosomal neurotransmitter amino-acids in seizure susceptibility and seizure severity was explored. The amino-acid contents of brain synaptosomes were determined in three sublines of Rb mice differing in their response to an acoustic stimulus: Rb1, clonic-tonic seizure-prone, Rb2, clonic seizure-prone, and Rb3, seizure-resistant. Synaptosomes were prepared from 6 brain areas considered to be involved in seizure activity: olfactory bulbs, amygdala, inferior colliculus, hippocampus, cerebellum, pons-medulla. The steady-state levels of GABA and glycine (Gly), inhibitory amino-acids, of taurine (Tau), an inhibitory neurotransmitter of neuromodulator, of aspartate (Asp) and glutamate (Glu), excitatory amino-acids, as well as of serine (Ser) and glutamine (Gln), two precursors of neurotransmitter amino-acids, were determined by HPLC. Low levels of Tau, GABA, and Ser in hippocampus, Gly in amygdala, Glu in hippocampus, inferior colliculus and pons, Gln and Asp in inferior colliculus appeared to correlate with seizure-susceptibility. GABA and Asp in olfactory bulb, Gln in amygdala, hippocampus and pons, ser in olfactory bulb and pons, appeared to be associated either with seizure-severity or -diversity. A strong involvement of hippocampus (Tau, GABA, Ser, Glu, and Gln) and inferior colliculus (Asp, Glu, Gln) in audiogenic seizure-susceptibility, and of olfactory bulb (GABA, Asp) in seizure-severity and/or -diversity is suggested.",
