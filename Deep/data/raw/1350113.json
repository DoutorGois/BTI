     "AB": "Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), in addition to its neuroendocrine role, may act as a central neurotransmitter. Cerebral cortical CRH may have an important role in behavioral and neurodegenerative disorders. To gain an understanding of factors that may influence cortical CRH, we investigated the effect of several neurotransmitters and neuropeptides on the release of immunoreactive CRH (iCRH) from various cerebral cortical regions [frontal (FC), parietal (PC), temporal (TC), and occipital (OC)] in vitro. The hypothalamic release of iCRH was also evaluated under the same experimental conditions. Basal release of iCRH was approximately 2-fold, and KCl-stimulated iCRH release was approximately 4-fold higher in the hypothalamus than in any of the cortical regions. Cortical iCRH release was stimulated by 10 nM somatostatin (SRIF) in PC and 1 nM neuropeptide Y (NPY) in TC. Cortical iCRH release was inhibited by 1 and 10 nM acetylcholine (ACh), 0.1 microM glutamate, and 10 nM NPY. These effects were confined to the FC and/or PC. Hypothalamic iCRH release was stimulated by 1 and 10 nM ACh, 10 microM GABA, and 1 and 10 nM serotonin but was inhibited by 10 nM SRIF and 1 microM GABA. Growth hormone-releasing hormone did not affect cortical or hypothalamic iCRH release. These results demonstrate that CRH release from the cerebral cortex and the hypothalamus are under different regulatory mechanism(s). Furthermore, they indicate that the release of CRH in various cortical regions may be regulated differentially by the same neurotransmitter.",
