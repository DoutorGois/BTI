     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of H102 on the expression of amyloid protein and amyloid precursor protein in the hippocampus of APP695 transgenic mice. METHODS: The 9-month-old APP695 transgenic mice were randomly divided into the model group and the H102 group; C57BL/6J mice were adopted as normal control group. The H102 group were injected with H102 in a dose of 3 microl/per mouse in lateral ventricle, once a day, for ten days; while the model group and the control group were injected with saline. The hippocampus and temporal cortex of the brain sections from transgenic mice and wild type female mice were subjected to immunohistochemistry and Congo red histological staining, and observed the difference of the protein expression under microscope. The expression of the APP protein was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Abeta and APP immunohistochemistry showed density of positive cell in the CA1 region of hippocampus of control group were less than model group. H102 peptide reduced the area, and density of positive cells. Congo red staining showed there were lots of amyloid plagues in the brains of model mice but not in the brains of normal control. And the Western blot showed the content of the APP protein of the model group was much higher than the H102 group. H102 significantly decreased the amyloid plagues. CONCLUSION: The expression of APP, Abeta are increased in APP695 transgenic mice, and H102 can decrease the level of APP, Abeta in transgenic mice.",
