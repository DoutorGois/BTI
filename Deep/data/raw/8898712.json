     "AB": "Postischemic delayed neuronal death (DND) in CA1 of the gerbil hippocampus is thought to be caused by an abnormal increase of Ca2+ influx into the cell, mediated by excessive activation of glutamate receptors. One subtype of glutamate receptors, the AMPA receptor, is not permeable to calcium ions as long as an edited form of its GluR2 subunit is present. It is possible that global ischemia interferes with the posttranscriptional editing of the GluR2 mRNA and thus leads to calcium influx via the AMPA receptor. In order to test this hypothesis, we examined the extent of GluR2 RNA editing in CA1 and CA3 microdissected from gerbil hippocampus after 5 min of global ischemia and various recirculation intervals. At each interval tested, quality and quantity of mRNA editing in the vulnerable CA1 region were the same as in CA3. Furthermore, postischemic mRNA editing in both hippocampal regions was indistinguishable from editing in untreated control animals. Our results clearly demonstrate that global ischemia does not cause impairment of GluR2 RNA editing, which is thus not responsible for the abnormal calcium permeability of the postischemic cell membrane.",
