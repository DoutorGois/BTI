     "AB": "The distribution of the P2X2 receptor subunit of the adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-gated ion channels was examined in the adult rat central nervous system (CNS) by using P2X2 receptor-specific antisera and riboprobe-based in situ hybridisation. P2X2 receptor mRNA expression matched the P2X2 receptor protein localisation. An extensive expression pattern was observed, including: olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, habenula, thalamic and subthalamic nuclei, caudate putamen, posteromedial amygdalo-hippocampal and amygdalo-cortical nuclei, substantia nigra pars compacta, ventromedial and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei, supraoptic nucleus, tuberomammillary nucleus, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, dorsal raphe, locus coeruleus, medial parabrachial nucleus, tegmental areas, pontine nuclei, red nucleus, lateral superior olive, cochlear nuclei, spinal trigeminal nuclei, cranial motor nuclei, ventrolateral medulla, area postrema, nucleus of solitary tract, and cerebellar cortex. In the spinal cord, P2X2 receptor expression was highest in the dorsal horn, with significant neuronal labeling in the ventral horn and intermediolateral cell column. The identification of extensive P2X2 receptor immunoreactivity and mRNA distribution within the CNS demonstrated here provides a basis for the P2X receptor antagonist pharmacology reported in electrophysiological studies. These data support the role for extracellular ATP acting as a fast neurotransmitter at pre- and postsynaptic sites in processes such as sensory transmission, sensory-motor integration, motor and autonomic control, and in neuronal phenomena such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). Additionally, labelling of neuroglia and fibre tracts supports a diverse role for extracellular ATP in CNS homeostasis.",
