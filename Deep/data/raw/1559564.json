     "AB": "To study the hypothesis that neural transplantations can alter seizure susceptibility in a genetic animal model of epilepsy, 93 pubescent genetically epilepsy-prone rats with stage 9 seizures received either bilateral inferior colliculi (N = 21) or lateral ventricle (N = 42) transplants or sham transplants (N = 30). The grafts consisted of embryonic locus ceruleus, neocortical, or cerebellar tissue. Starting 2 days after the transplantation the rats were subjected to audiogenic stimulations every other day for 61 days. Latency to the running and tonic phase, seizure severity score, and duration of the tonic and clonic phase were compared in the neural transplant and sham-operated controls. Rats that received transplants had a longer latency to the tonic phase and a shorter duration of the clonic phase than the controls. At age 110 days the rats had electrodes implanted bilaterally into the angular bundle and were kindled. No difference in kindling rate was found between the rats that received neural grafts and the sham-operated controls. Cerebrospinal fluid concentration of norepinephrine was not altered by the transplants. This study demonstrates that the anticonvulsant effects of neural transplants, using the genetically epilepsy-prone model of epilepsy, are mild.",
