     "AB": "rsec6 and rsec8 are two components of a 17S complex in mammalian brain that is homologous to the yeast 834 kDa Sec6/8/15 complex which is essential for exocytosis. Purification and partial amino acid sequencing of the mammalian rsec6/8 complex reveals that it is composed of eight novel proteins with a combined molecular weight of 743 kDa. The complex is broadly expressed in brain and displays a plasma membrane localization in nerve terminals. Membrane associated rsec6/8 complex coimmunoprecipitates with syntaxin, a plasma membrane protein critical for neurotransmission. These data suggest a role for the mammalian rsec6/8 complex in neurotransmitter release via interactions with the core vesicle docking and fusion apparatus.",
