     "AB": "When Kasba (Chuzan) virus (an orbivirus) was injected intracerebrally into 1-, 2- or 4-week-old mice, non-purulent necrotizing encephalitis developed and the mice showed nervous symptoms and became moribund. The necrotic lesions were more severe in younger animals. In 1-week-old mice, viral titres rose until 7 days post-infection, while in 2- and 4-week-old animals the titres reached a peak on day 3 and then declined gradually. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes increased in the white matter, hippocampus and subpial area of the cerebral cortex of infected animals, and lectin-RCA-1-positive cells, thought to be microglial cells, increased in the necrotic lesions. The number of these glial cells increased even after viral titres had declined. In this study there were no survivors in any age group, but survival time increased with age.",
