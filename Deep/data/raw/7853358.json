     "AB": "Activation and translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) during KCN-induced histotoxic hypoxia was studied in rat brain slices prepared from cerebellum, hippocampus, and cortex. Treatment with 1-10 mM KCN produced a significant increase in PKC translocation and enzyme activity in the particulate fraction of cerebellar and hippocampal slices. In cortical slices, PKC activity was not affected by cyanide treatment. The membrane-associated PKC activity reached a maximum 30 minutes after incubation with KCN and remained elevated up to 60 minutes in both the hippocampus and cerebellum. Pretreatment with MK-801 and APV, specific NMDA receptor antagonists, blocked the cyanide-stimulated translocation in the hippocampus and cerebellum, whereas CNQX, an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, did not alter the response. These results demonstrate that cyanide stimulates PKC activation and translocation from the cytosol to membranes in select brain areas and NMDA receptor activation mediates this process.",
