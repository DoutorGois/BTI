     "AB": "DNA extracted from regional brain samples of hypoxic/ischemic neonatal rats showed internucleosomal cleavage indicative of apoptosis. Cells containing cleaved DNA were identified by in situ labelling in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus of the ipsilateral hemisphere. When the effects of increasing the length of the hypoxia were examined, increases were seen in the amount of internucleosomally cleaved DNA and in the number of labelled cells.",
