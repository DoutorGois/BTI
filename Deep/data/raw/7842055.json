     "AB": "The memory performances of rats receiving a reversible inactivation of either the medial septum or one side of the ventral hippocampus were compared in a radial arm maze task allowing the assessment of both working and reference memory. After pre-surgery training, rats were chronically equipped with bilateral cannulae into the ventral hippocampus and a single cannula into the medial septum. Following post-surgery retraining, animals received a series of test trials during which they received saline or lidocaine injections in either the medial septum or one side of the ventral hippocampus. Lidocaine injections in either structure resulted in both reference and working memory deficits. However, animals were more impaired after septal injections than after unilateral hippocampal injections. This result suggests that the septo-hippocampal formation acts as a functionally homogeneous structure essential for spatial processing.",
