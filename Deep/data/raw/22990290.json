     "AB": "Tetanus toxin (TeT) is an exotoxin and has a capacity for neuronal binding and internalization. In the present study, we compared changes in the immunoreactivities and protein levels of interleukin (IL-) 2 as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and IL-4 as an anti-inflammatory cytokine in the hippocampus proper (HP) and dentate gyrus (DG) after systemic treatment of 10 or 100 ng/kg TeT into mice. In this study, we could not find any neuronal damage or loss in any subregions of the hippocampus after TeT treatment. In the control groups, strong IL-2 immunoreactivity was shown in the stratum pyramidal (SP) of the HP and in the granule cell layer (GCL) of the DG. At 6 h post-treatment, IL-2 immunoreactivity was hardly detected in the SP and GCL; however, strong IL-2 immunoreactivity was shown in the stratum oriens of the HP in both the groups. Thereafter, intermediate IL-2 immunoreactivity was shown in the SP and GCL. On the other hand, intermediate IL-4 immunoreactivity was detected in the SP and GCL of the control groups. At 6 h post-treatment, IL-4 immunoreactivity in the SP and GCL was apparently increased. Thereafter, IL-4 immunoreactivity was lower than that at 6 h post-treatment. In brief, IL-2 and 4 immunoreactivities were easily detected in SP and GCL in the controls and dramatically decreased and increased at 6 h post-treatment, respectively.",
