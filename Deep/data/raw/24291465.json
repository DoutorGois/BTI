     "AB": "In patients, cancer and treatments provoke cognitive impairments referred to \"chemofog\". Here a validated neurobehavioral animal model, the unique way to explore causal direct links between chemotherapy used in clinical practices and brain disorders, allowed investigation of the direct long-term impact of colo-rectal cancer chemotherapy on cognition and cerebral plasticity. Young and aged mice received three injections every 7 days during 2 weeks of 5-fluorouracil either alone (5-FU, 37.5 mg/kg) or in combination with oxaliplatin (3 mg/kg) or with glucose (5%). The long-term effects (from day 24 to day 60) of chemotherapy were tested on emotional reactivity, learning and memory, behavioral flexibility and hippocampal cell plasticity. 5-FU (in saline)-treated aged and also young mice exhibited specific altered cognitive flexibility and behavioral hyper-reactivity to novelty, whereas the combination 5-FU (in saline)/oxaliplatin (in glucose) did not provoke any cognitive dysfunction. We thus observed that glucose counteracted 5-FU-induced altered executive functions and hippocampal cell proliferation in vivo, and protected neural stem cells in vitro from toxicity of 5-FU or oxaliplatin. In conclusion, these data suggest that the lasting chemotherapy-induced selective impairment of executive functions, whatever the age, and associated with a reduced number of hippocampal proliferating cells, can be counteracted by co-administration with glucose.",
