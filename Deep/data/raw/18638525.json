     "AB": "The mainly glia-derived protein S100B has been shown to be involved in the pathophysiology of diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, schizophrenia or depression. These diseases go along with distinct changes of cerebral neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors. Few and partly inconsistent data exist on the influence of cerebral S100B protein levels on different neurotransmitters. Therefore we investigated levels of serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and residual neocortex in S100B knock out (S100B KO) mice compared to wildtype controls. There was a significant increase of hippocampal BDNF (+53%) and a decrease of hippocampal (-12%) and residual neocortical (-15%) NA in 10-month-old S100B KO mice compared to wildtype mice whereas the other mediators investigated did not show genotype-dependent changes. The increased hippocampal BDNF may represent an endogenous attempt to compensate trophic effects of S100B protein especially on serotonergic neurons, which have been shown to be unaffected in S100B KO mice previously. As referred to changes in NA levels functional studies are warranted to elucidate the link between S100B protein and the noradrenergic metabolism.",
