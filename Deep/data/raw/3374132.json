     "AB": "After development of a 5 alpha-reductase activity (5 alpha-RA) assay based on the capacity of microsomes to convert [3H]testosterone (T) to [3H]dihydrotestosterone (DHT), we analyzed 5 alpha-RA in neural tissues of fetal rhesus macaques at 50, 80 and 150 days of gestation. This method allowed us to collect kinetic data on the properties of the 5 alpha-reductase resident in fetal brain at 150 days of gestation. The Km and Vmax calculated from these data were 4.32 microM and 22.6 nmol.mg protein-1.h-1, respectively. Analyses of 5 alpha-RA in microsomes from the hypothalamic-preoptic area-amygdala (HPA) at dilutions of 1/25 and 1/50 indicated higher enzyme activity with increasing dilution of the microsomes. Measurement of 5 alpha-RA using concentrations of [3H]T which saturated the enzyme in diencephalon (DIEN), brain stem (B.STEM), temporal (TCTX) and frontal cortex (FCTX) of six 50-day old fetuses (3 males and 3 females) revealed no obvious sex differences in 5 alpha-RA, however, a significant difference (P less than 0.05) between tissues was noted. The DIEN and B.STEM contained significantly (P less than 0.05) higher levels 5 alpha-RA than the FCTX while the TCTX contained an intermediate level of activity. Significant increases in 5 alpha-RA were observed in FCTX and TCTX with time of gestation (50, 80 and 150 days). Other tissues, including amygdala, hippocampus, cerebellum, tegmentum and septum also change with fetal age. These data demonstrate the existence of 5 alpha-reductase in the fetal monkey brain. Significant changes in cortical 5 alpha-RA suggest some role for 5 alpha-reductase in development.",
