     "AB": "Formation of conditioned switching-over of heterogeneous instrumental reflexes in dogs was more successful than in rats, which testifies about significant differences of the functional organization of analytical-synthetic brain activity in rodents and predatory animals. Experiments with lesion of the hippocampus (in rats) and the records of its electrical activity (in dogs) allowed to conclude that the hippocampus of the both types of animals belongs to the system of structures, participating in the formation of conditioned switching-over. The data, obtained in the process of elaboration of the switching-over and probabilistic reinforcement of the alimentary conditioned stimulus, testify that providing for the reactions to signals with low probability of reinforcement in different species of animals is one of the functions of the hippocampus.",
