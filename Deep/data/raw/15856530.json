     "AB": "Subtle effects of low-dose exposure to environmental toxicants may be altered or masked by an inappropriate choice of anaesthesia prior to manipulation or termination of experimental animals. This study was designed to investigate effects of various anaesthetics and terminal procedures on neurotransmitters from male Sprague-Dawley rats. Significant changes in neurotransmitters were observed in the caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and substantia nigra but not the frontal cortex upon exposure to isoflurane, an Equithesin-like mixture or carbon dioxide relative to control animals that were decapitated without anaesthesia. Terminal use of any of these three anaesthetics also masked or altered some of the changes induced by exposure to Aroclor 1254. These results suggest that it is critical to avoid anaesthetizing experimental animals and that decapitation is the preferred method for euthanasia when conducting neurochemical studies.",
