     "AB": "Type I and Type II adrenal steroid receptors from rat renal and hippocampal cytosols were studied by the technique of Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography. Type I receptors were labelled with [3H]aldosterone plus excess RU26988, and Type II receptors with [3H]dexamethasone. On a Mono Q anion exchange column the molybdate-stabilized renal and hippocampal Type I receptors both eluted as single symmetrical peaks at 0.27 M NaCl, with a recovery of approximately 90% and 60-fold purification (renal) and 10-15-fold (hippocampal). Molybdate-stabilized Type II binding sites from both hippocampal and renal cytosols co-eluted with the Type I sites. On Superose gel filtration renal Type I receptor-steroid complexes consistently eluted two fractions later than hippocampal Type I complexes, suggesting that the renal complexes are smaller; Type II receptor-steroid complexes from both cytosols co-eluted, consistently one fraction behind hippocampal Type I sites. Sequential gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography achieved a 1000-fold purification of renal Type I binding sites, with an overall recovery of 10%.",
