     "AB": "Alterations of [3H]cyclic AMP (cAMP) binding, an indicator of the binding activity of particulate cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), were examined after 15 and 30 min of ischemia in the gerbil brain. Severe hemispheric cerebral ischemia was induced by occluding the right common carotid artery. Significant reductions in cAMP binding were noted only in the dendritic subfields of the hippocampus CA1 such as the strata oriens, radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare, on the ischemic side after 15 min of ischemia. After 30 min ischemia cAMP binding was significantly decreased not only in each dendritic subfield of the hippocampus CA1, but also in the layer of pyramidal cell bodies (stratum pyramidale) on the occluded side; other brain regions such as the hippocampus CA3, dentate gyrus and cerebral cortices revealed no significant changes in cAMP binding. These findings suggest that derangement of PKA may begin in the dendritic subfields of the hippocampus CA1 after as little as 15 min of severe ischemia, and proceed centrally to the neuronal cell bodies of the hippocampus CA1.",
