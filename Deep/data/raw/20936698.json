     "AB": "Scaffolding proteins play a critical role in the proper development and function of neural circuits. In contrast to the case for excitatory circuits, in which the role of several scaffolding proteins has been characterized, less is known about the scaffolding proteins that regulate inhibitory neurotransmission. The ankyrin repeat-rich membrane spanning (ARMS)/kinase D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa (Kidins220) scaffolding protein is expressed during the establishment of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission and is highly regulated by activity. To evaluate whether ARMS/Kidins220 expression affects GABAergic neurotransmission, we modified the ARMS/Kidins220 levels during the period of its maximum expression in culture (DIV 1-10). Whereas a decrease in ARMS/Kidins220 levels suppressed GABAergic neurotransmission, overexpression of ARMS/Kidins220 produced an increase in GABAergic neurotransmission in hippocampal neurons. In addition, we found that ARMS/Kidins220 regulates GABAergic neurotransmission by a presynaptic mechanism. Our results suggest that the ARMS/Kidins220 scaffold protein plays a critical role in the regulation of inhibitory transmission in hippocampal neurons.",
