Cognitive deterioration and motor impairments have been observed also in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected monkeys, an animal model for HIV infection. We found recently that choline acetyltransferase activity is markedly reduced in brains of SIV-infected monkeys. We report now that selegiline, completely restores the reduced choline acetyltransferase activity which encourages for a meaningful anti-dementia therapeutic strategy.",
