     "AB": "Adrenal steroid and stress effects were determined in hippocampus on levels of dynorphin (DYN) mRNA, expressed in dentate gyrus, and excitatory amino acid receptors, measured in Ammon's horn and dentate gyrus. Adrenalectomy (ADX) decreased DYN mRNA levels in dentate gyrus and replacement with aldosterone (ALDO), a specific type I adrenal steroid receptor agonist, prevented the decrease. Ru28362, a specific type II receptor agonist, had no effect. Likewise, kainate receptor binding to the stratum lucidum and hilus region of dorsal hippocampus was decreased after ADX and this decrease was prevented by ALDO but not by Ru28362 treatment. Similar though smaller effects were found for CNQX binding to AMPA receptors but only in the dentate gyrus molecular or infra- and supragranular layers. Although corticosterone (CORT) treatment of intact rats (40 mg/kg for 3 weeks) elevated DYN mRNA levels in dentate gyrus, up to 14 days of daily restraint stress (1 or 6 h/day) had no significant effect. Neither CORT treatment nor repeated restraint stress altered NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptors in hippocampus. The results of this study showing ADX-induced decreases of DYN mRNA and CNQX binding in dentate gyrus and decreased kainate binding in mossy fiber terminal regions are consistent with morphological evidence showing that adrenal steroids maintain normal integrity and structure of dentate gyrus neurons and do so via type I adrenal steroid receptors. These same parameters are apparently not sensitive to chronic restraint stress although the effects of other stressors must be examined.",
