     "AB": "The importance of several factors influencing the survival of cholinergic-rich embryonic tissue transplanted to the adult rat forebrain and the extent of acetylcholinesterase-positive fibre innervation of the host brain was investigated in 3 experiments. In the first two experiments, embryonic ventral forebrain tissue was grafted to the neocortex of rats in which the intrinsic cortical cholinergic innervation had been removed by nucleus basalis lesions. Housing the host rats in an enriched environment produced a temporary enhancement of fibre outgrowth 4 weeks after transplantation, but this was not maintained after 10 weeks. Fibre outgrowth was greater when the grafts were transplanted to the noradrenaline-depleted neocortex than to the intact neocortex. Neither environmental enrichment nor noradrenaline depletion influenced graft survival or size. In the third experiment, the embryonic donor tissue was dissected to separate regions containing precursors of the nucleus basalis cholinergic cells from regions containing precursors of the septal cholinergic cells, and transplanted to either the neocortex following nucleus basalis lesions or to the hippocampus following fimbria-fornix lesions. Nucleus basalis grafts showed greater growth in size than septal grafts, and grafts placed into the hippocampus showed greater growth in size than grafts placed into the neocortex. More interestingly, the extent of fibre outgrowth depended on the appropriateness of the donor tissue to the host transplantation site: nucleus basalis tissue showed greater acetylcholinesterase-positive outgrowth than septal tissue in the neocortex, whereas septal tissue showed greater outgrowth than nucleus basalis tissue in the hippocampus.",
