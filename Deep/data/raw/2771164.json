     "AB": "Glutathione (GSH) was measured in 6 regions of brain and liver of young adult, middle-aged and aged rats. GSH levels were significantly lower in cortex, cerebellum, striatum, thalamus and hippocampus of aged rats, while no changes were observed in liver as compared to young adult rats. On the other hand, lipid peroxidation as measured by thiobarbituric acid-reactive products increased significantly in all the regions of brain examined and in the liver of aged rats. Since GSH plays an important role as a cellular protectant against oxygen radical-mediated injury, decreased levels of GSH in aged rat brain are indicative of the vulnerability of the aged cerebral tissue to oxidative injury.",
