     "AB": "The complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has made it difficult to examine its underlying mechanisms. A gene microarray offers a solution to the complexity through parallel analysis of most of the genes expressed in the hippocampal tissues from AD-transgenic and age-matched control littermates. This study examined the potential effect of APPsw over-expression on the modulation of genes for AD. To accomplish this, an oligonucleotide array was used with the large-scale screening of the hippocampus mRNA from 12-month-old APPsw-transgenic and control mice. There was a total of 116 differentially expressed genes, 59 up-regulated and 57 down-regulated, in the hippocampal region of the transgenic mice compared with the control mice. Initially, two of each of the down-regulated (Xlr3b and Mup3) and up-regulated genes (Serpina9 and Ccr6) were chosen for further investigation if the magnitude of change in these genes on the oligonucleotide array would correspond to those in the RT-PCR analysis from APPsw-transgenic mice. We also found that the changes in the differentially expressed genes are reliable. Thus, these genes might associate with AD neuropathology in neurodegenerative process of AD, although relevance of long lists altered genes should be evaluated in a future study.",
