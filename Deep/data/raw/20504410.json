     "AB": "Marked age-related changes are noted in the neurotensin distribution of the human hippocampus. Different neuronal structures containing neurotensin are detected by immunohistochemistry during postnatal brain growth from birth to 4 years but no later. They are the neurotensin-immunoreactive pyramidal cells of the subiculum and presubiculum. Their axonal fibres are seen in the alveus and the fimbria. There are also the neurotensin-immunoreactive granular cells of the hilus. The varicosities of the mossy fibres are detected among the pyramidal cells of the CA3 and CA2 subfields of the Ammon's horn. After 4 years of age, only the varicosities are shown by immunohistochemistry, thus there is probably an important decrease in the neurotensin concentration in the cell bodies of the granular cells and also in the pyramidal neurons of the subiculum and presubiculum.",
