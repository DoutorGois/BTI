     "AB": "The present study investigated the effect of repeated treatment with the antidepressant drugs imipramine, amitryptyline, citalopram and mianserin (10 mg/kg PO, twice daily for 14 days) on levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in several brain structures (cerebral cortex, amygdala + pyriform cortex, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, striatum and hypothalamus) of the rat. Amitriptyline caused a marked increase in the TRH content in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. Citalopram and mianserin produced a smaller but significant increase in the TRH content in the striatum only, while imipramine did not significantly affect the TRH concentrations in any of the brain structures. None of the antidepressant drugs administered acutely significantly affected the TRH concentrations in the nucleus accumbens or the striatum. These results indicate that changes in brain TRH induced by antidepressant drugs are not related to their therapeutic activity.",
