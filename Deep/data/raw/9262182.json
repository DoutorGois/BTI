Ten minutes of forebrain ischemia followed by reperfusion induced the increase in DHBA in rat hippocampal perfusates. Postischemic treatment with a free radical scavenger, 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one (MCI-186), significantly reduced the increase in DHBA and suppressed delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region.",
