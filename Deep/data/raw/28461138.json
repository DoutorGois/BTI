     "AB": "Acid-sensing ion channel 4 (ASIC4) belongs to the ASIC gene family of neuronal proton-gated cation channels, and is the least understood subtype among the members. Previous studies of ASIC4 expression in the mammalian central nervous system have shown that ASIC4 is abundantly expressed in the spinal cord and in various brain regions, such as the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum. However, the detailed distribution of ASIC4 transcripts in mammalian brains still remains to be elucidated. In the present study, radioactive in situ hybridization histochemistry with an ASIC4-specific cRNA probe was performed on wild-type mouse brains, followed by X-gal staining experiments with Asic4-lacZ reporter mice Asic4(tm1a(KOMP)Mbp). It was found that ASIC4 mRNAs were widely expressed throughout the wild-type brain, but preferentially concentrated in the olfactory bulb, the piriform cortex, the caudate putamen, the preoptic area, the paraventricular nucleus, the medial habenular nucleus, the pretectal area, the lateral geniculate nucleus, the amygdaloid complex, the superior colliculus, the interpeduncular nucleus, and the granule cell layer of the ventral hippocampus, and these results were in agreement with the X-gal-positive reactions observed in the mutant brain. In addition, X-gal staining combined with immunohistochemistry identified intense signals for ASIC4 transcriptional activity in most of the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive principal neurons located in the basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei. Our data provide useful information to speculate possible roles of ASIC4 in diverse brain functions.",
