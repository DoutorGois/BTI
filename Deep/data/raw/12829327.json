     "AB": "FERM domain including Rho GEF (FIR) belongs to Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors and specifically activates biochemical pathways specific for Rac1. FIR was shown to regulate neurite remodeling of the embryonic neurons. Here we report a distribution of FIR mRNA in adult rat brain using in situ hybridization. The expression was found all throughout the brain with the most intensive signals in hippocampus, piriform cortex, red nucleus and nuclei of cranial nerves. The signal was predominantly localized in the neuronal cells.",
