     "AB": "The persistence of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus was compared for two tetanization protocols: 50 trains on one day, or 50 trains on 5 consecutive days. LTP induction was significantly greater in the 250 train condition, but the LTP decay rate over weeks was similar between conditions. The decay of LTP could not be accounted for by deterioration of the preparation. Successive days of stimulation caused repetitive induction of immediate early genes, but did not prolong LTP, suggesting that either the effects of gene expression on LTP stabilization had saturated, or that these genes play other roles in synaptic plasticity.",
