     "AB": "The present paper is concerned with the question whether dopamine-stimulated fucosylation of glycoproteins of the rat hippocampus in vitro is augmented by treating animals with methylglucamine orotate (MGO). Dopamine (DA) in concentrations between 0.1-0.5 mM resulted in a dose-dependent increase in L-fucose incorporation of up to about 130%. Neither the acute intraperitoneal application of 225 mg MGO/kg body mass nor the daily treatment of rats with 225 mg MGO/kg body mass over a 10-day period changed this dose-dependent relationship significantly. Even the in vitro substitution of nucleotides (1 mM) such as uridine 5'-monophosphate, cytidine 5'-monophosphate, guanosine 5'-monophosphate, and adenosine 5'-monophosphate did not alter dopamine-stimulated fucosylation of rat hippocampal proteins. These findings suggest that DA-stimulated fucosylation of brain proteins is not limited by the supply of nucleotides.",
