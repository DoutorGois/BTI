     "AB": "Hippocampal dentate granule cells normally express the calcium-binding protein calbindin-D28k and, in the adult, are the hippocampal neurons least vulnerable to an ischemic insult. We evaluated hippocampal structure 2-3 days after hypoxic/ischemic insult at postnatal day 7-10, and discovered that, unlike adult granule cells, developing granule cells were irreversibly injured. Localization of calbindin-D28k-like immunoreactivity (LI) revealed that the vulnerable cells were the immature granule cells at the base of the cell layer that were not yet calbindin-immunoreactive. Adjacent granule cells that did not die in response to the hypoxic/ischemic insult were calbindin-immunoreactive. Whether the lack of calbindin-LI in immature granule cells is causally related to their vulnerability, or is a coincidental reflection of cellular immaturity, remains to be determined.",
