     "AB": "Silibinin was reported to be effective in reversing the learning and memory deficits of several AD animal models. These improvements are thought to be regulated by various factors, including antioxidative stress, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity and Abeta aggregation. However, there are still no reports that demonstrate the effect of silibinin on microglia activation in vivo. Thus, in this study, we used the senescence-accelerated mouse (SAMP8) strain to test the effects of silibinin on behavioral impairments and microglia activation-induced neuroinflammation. Silibinin treatment significantly rescued memory deficits in novel object recognition test and Morris water maze test. Silibinin treatment significantly attenuated microglial activation; down-regulated the level of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4, and inflammation-associated proteins, iNOS and COX-2; and further modulated MAPK to protect neural cells. These results suggest that silibinin could be a potential candidate for the therapy of neurodegenerative disorders.",
