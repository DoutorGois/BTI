     "AB": "Whole-cell patch clamp technique was used to study the modulatory effect of Cholecystokin-8S (CCK-8S), a neuropeptide, on NMDA-activated current (I(NMDA)) in cultured rat hippocampal neurons under condition of normal and ethanol exposure. Our study showed that CCK-8S inhibited I(NMDA) in a non-concentration and non-competition dependent manner. Ethanol significantly inhibited I(NMDA), and CCK-8S further inhibited I(NMDA). Our results suggest that CCK-8S is an inhibitory modulator of NMDA receptors under normal and ethanol exposure conditions.",
