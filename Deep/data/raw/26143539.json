     "AB": "Currently, much attention is focused on the influence of mitochondrial disturbances at the onset of depression. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of prenatal stress (an animal model of depression) on the mitochondrial biogenesis proteins and mitoproteome profile in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of adult 3-month-old male rats following a prenatal stress procedure. Our results show that rats that were exposed to prenatal stress stimuli displayed depression-like behaviors based on the sucrose preference and elevated plus maze tests. It has been found that the level of the PGC-1alpha protein was reduced in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the adult offspring after the prenatal stress procedure. Moreover, in the frontal cortex, the level of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax was up-regulated. Two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry showed the statistically significant down-regulation of the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (Mrpl12) and mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein 2 (NDUFV2) as well as the up-regulation of the Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Proteins (Tppp/p25) in the frontal cortex. In contrast, in the hippocampus, the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit beta, the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 2 (VDAC2), and the GTP-binding nuclear protein RAN (RAN) were down-regulated and the expression of phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP-1) was enhanced. These findings provide new evidence that stress during pregnancy may lead not only to behavioral deficits, but also to disturbances in the brain mitoproteome profile in adult rat offspring.",
