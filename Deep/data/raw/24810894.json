     "AB": "DNA methylation is involved in tissue-specific and developmentally regulated gene expression. Here, we screened a novel methylation gene Sox30, whose methylation might contribute to its regulation and testis development in mice. Sox30 is a member of Sox transcription factors, and is considered to be involved in spermatogonial differentiation and spermatogenesis. However, the precise function and regulatory expression pattern remain unclear. In the present study, we found that Sox30 is highly expressed in adult testes but not in ovaries. Sox30 expression begins in early development, and in the testes, it is specifically increased coincidentally with development until adulthood. Moreover, Sox30 is expressed not only in testis germ cells, but also in sertoli cells. Sox30 is hypo-methylated in testis, epididymis and lung of adult mice, in which Sox30 is expressed. By contrast, Sox30 is hypermethylated in ovary, heart, brain, liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, muscle, intestine, pituitary gland, blood and hippocampus of adult mice, in which the Sox30 is absent. Importantly, decreased methylation at CpG islands of Sox30 is observed in mouse developmental testes after birth, which is associated with enhanced Sox30 expression. However, the hypermethylated status of Sox30 is maintained in ovaries that does not express Sox30 during this period. Further, following demethylation treatment using 5-aza-dC, Sox30 expression is restored in GC2, TM3 and TM4 cell lines. This observation convincingly confirms that methylation really contributes to Sox30 silencing. In summary, we show that Sox30 expression is under the control of DNA methylation status, and this expression pattern is associated with testis development in mice.",
