     "AB": "Sodium valproate (VPA) is widely used as an antiepileptic agent and mood stabilizer. In recent years, VPA has been increasingly used as a psychotherapeutic drug to treat depression. In this article, a possible antidepressant mechanism of VPA was investigated by studying the expression and therefore the involvement of tryptophan hydroxylase, serotonin transporter (5-HTT), monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) in rats exposed to chronic unpredicted stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: the vehicle-treated control group (CG), the VPA-treated control group (VPAC), the vehicle-treated model group (MG), and the VPA-treated model group (VPAM). VPA (300 mg/kg once daily) was administered to VPAC and VPAM rats by means of intragastric gavage while an equivalent volume of vehicle was given to vehicle-treated CG and MG rats. Rat behavior and expression of tryptophan hydroxylase, 5-HTT, MAO-A, and IDO in the hippocampus were determined. A significant reduction in depression-like behaviors was observed with an upregulation of 5-HTT expression and a downregulation of MAO-A and IDO expression in VPAM rats, compared with MG rats. The results may suggest that the antidepressant mechanism of VPA is partly related to elevated serotonin level and its reuse in the vesicles of presynaptic nerve endings.",
