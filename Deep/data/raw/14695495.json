     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to develop a quantitative and objective method for evaluating neurological deficits in mice with focal cerebral ischemia. After middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), the neurological deficits were evaluated 24 h later. We measured the mean angles, dominant angles and turns in a hanged test in which the mice were sticked on the wall, and the holding angles in an inclined plane test as well, Then we determined the cerebral infarct volumes, neuron density in hippocampus, cortex and subcortical areas 24 h after MCAO. The correlations among infarct volume, neuron density and neurological deficits were analyzed. We also compared the quantitative method with two typical complex methods of behavioral assessment. The effect of [pranlukast, 4-oxo-8-[p-(4-phenylbutyloxy) benzoylamino]-2-(tetrazol-5-yl)-4H-1-benzopyran hemihydrate] (ONO-1078), a neuroprotective agent, on ischemic injury was observed using this method. We found that the variables measured by both quantitative and typical behavioral methods significantly changed in the ischemic mice, and correlated with the infarct volumes and neuron densities. The quantitative variables well correlated with those of typical behavioral assessment, too. ONO-1078 inhibited ischemic injury and reduced the total scores of quantitative assessment. Thus, the quantitative method we developed is useful in evaluating neurological deficits of focal cerebral ischemia with the advantages of objectivity, quantification, simplicity and non-invasion, and can be used in the evaluation of neuroprotective effects of drugs.",
