     "AB": "The epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (apoE) is associated with increased risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), possibly due to interactions with the beta-amyloid (Abeta) protein. The mechanism by which these two proteins are linked to AD is still unclear. To further assess their potential relationship with the disease, we have determined levels of apoE and Abeta isoforms from three brain regions of neuropathologically confirmed AD and non-AD tissue. In two brain regions affected by AD neuropathology, the hippocampus and frontal cortex, apoE levels were found to be decreased while Abeta(1-40) levels were increased. Levels of apoE were unchanged in AD cerebellum. Furthermore, levels of apoE and Abeta(1-40) were found to be apoE genotype dependent, with lowest levels of apoE and highest levels of Abeta(1-40) occurring in epsilon4 allele carriers. These results suggest that reduction in apoE levels may give rise to increased deposition of amyloid peptides in AD brain.",
