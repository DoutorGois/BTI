     "AB": "Brain tissue contains multiple forms of intracellular phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activity that differ from each other in many ways including their response to specific inhibitors. The systemic administration of kainic acid to rats produces a marked increase in cPLA(2) activity in neurons and astrocytes. This is associated with increased lipid peroxidation as evidenced by accumulation of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) modified proteins. The present study describes the effect of specific inhibitors of Ca(2+)-dependent or Ca(2+)-independent PLA(2) on kainite-induced excitotoxic injury in rat hippocampal slices. Specific inhibitors of Ca(2+)-dependent PLA(2) prevented the decrease of a neuronal marker, GluR1, and increase in cPLA(2) and 4-HNE immunoreactivities in slices treated with kainate. This shows that cPLA(2) plays an important role in kainite-induced neurotoxicity and that cPLA(2) inhibitors can be used to protect hippocampal slices from damage induced by kainate.",
