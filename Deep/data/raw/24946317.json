     "AB": "Recollection, an effortful process relying on the integrity of a brain network including the hippocampus, is generally required to remember arbitrary associations whereas a simple familiarity signal arising in the perirhinal cortex is sufficient to recognize single items. However, the integration of separate items into a single configuration (unitization) leads to reduced involvement of recollection and greater reliance on familiarity. This seems to imply that unitized associations are processed similar to single items. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the effects of unitization as encoding strategy on retrieval processes in a between-group-design. A definition was provided that allows combining two unrelated words into a novel conceptual unit (e.g., milk taxi = a delivery service, which is directly dispatched from a farm). We compared this to an encoding strategy in which the words were studied as parts of a sentence. We included pairs in reversed order at test because reversing a unitized word pair is assumed to disrupt the unit while leaving item familiarity for the single constituents intact. This enabled us to compare recognition memory for novel units and single items. Sentence encoding led to a flexible recruitment of brain areas previously associated with recollection, irrespective of the order of the test pair. Unitization encoding reduced the involvement of the recollection network and specifically engaged regions within the parahippocampal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex for novel units. In contrast, recognition of reversed pairs involved activation of BA 45 in the left inferior frontal gyrus. This possibly suggests that familiarity for novel units and single items are associated with different brain networks.",
