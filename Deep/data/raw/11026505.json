     "AB": "Influence of the extract of Gingko biloba (EGB-761) and one of its constituent Gingkolide B (BN-52021) on hyperthermia induced cellular damage and heat shock protein (HSP 72kD) response was examined in a rat model. Rats subjected to 4h heat stress at 38 degrees C in a biological oxygen demand (BOD) incubator (relative humidity 50-55%, wind velocity 20-25cm/sec) resulted in profound edema and cell injury in many parts of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamus, hypothalamus and brain stem. Immunostaining of HSP 72 kD showed marked upregulation in the damaged and distorted neurons located within the edematous area. Pretreatment with EGB-761 (50mg/kg/day, p.o.) and BN-520 21 (2mg/kg, p.o.) per day for 5 days significantly reduced HSP expression and attenuated cell damage. Our results show that EGB-761 and its component Gingkolide B (BN-52021) has the capacity to reduce edema and cell injury following hyperthermia and this effect of the compound is somehow associated with a reduction in cellular stress response as evidenced with a reduction in HSP expression.",
