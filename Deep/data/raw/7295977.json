It was determined that the most considerable changes in excitability and brain blood circulation were recorded within the first 10 days of exercise. From the 20th day of the experiment, abnormalities in the function of the structures under study, except those in the hypothalamus, got stabilized, which is regarded as adaptive reaction. In the course of adaptation the periodicity of the function of the brain structures was defined.",
