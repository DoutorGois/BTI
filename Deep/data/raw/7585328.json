     "AB": "This study was conducted to investigate the inhibition of synaptosomal 45Ca uptake by desipramine and its major metabolite 2-hydroxydesipramine in the rat hippocampus and cingulate cortex, areas associated with emotional control. A concentration-dependent inhibition of net depolarization-induced 45Ca uptake was observed for desipramine (20-200 microM) in synaptosomes from both sites. However, 20 microM 2-hydroxydesipramine failed to inhibit calcium channel function in either of the two limbic sites; higher concentrations (60 or 200 microM) did produce a minor degree of inhibition in hippocampus synaptosomes. Others have shown that the clinically encountered plasma concentrations of 2-hydroxydesipramine are lower than those of desipramine, and the brain concentration of 2-hydroxydesipramine is therefore not expected to surpass or even reach 20 microM. In view of the previously observed clinical activity of 2-hydroxydesipramine, the present results indicate that calcium channel antagonism may not be the basis for the therapeutic effect of tricyclic antidepressants.",
