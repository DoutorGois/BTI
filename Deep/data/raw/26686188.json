     "AB": "The CNS of breast feeding infants and toddlers may be exposed to persistent organic pollutants via lactational transfer. Here, 10 days old mice were exposed to single oral doses of either PFOS, PBDE99 or vehicle control and were examined for changes in dopaminergic gene transcription in CNS tissue collected at 24h or 2 months post exposure.qPCR analyses of brain tissue from mice euthanized 24h post exposure revealed that PFOS affected transcription of Dopamine receptor-D5 (DRD5) in cerebral cortex and Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the hippocampus. At 2 months of age, mice neonatally exposed to PFOS displayed decreased transcription of Dopamine receptor-D2 (DRD2) and TH in hippocampus. No significant changes in any of the tested genes were observed in PBDE99 exposed mice. This indicates that PFOS, but not PBDE99, affects the developing cerebral dopaminergic system at gene transcriptional level in cortex and hippocampus, which may account for some of the mechanistic effects behind the aetiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.",
