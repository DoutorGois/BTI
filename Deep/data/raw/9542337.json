Binding of [3H]aldosterone to cytoplasmic corticosteroid receptors of the hippocampus, rather than the brain (without hippocampus and cerebellum), was shown to depend on the type of animal behavior. Stress was also shown to affect binding of this hormone to cytoplasmic corticosteroid receptors of the brain (without hippocampus and cerebellum), rather than hippocampus.",
