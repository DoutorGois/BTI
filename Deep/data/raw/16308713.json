     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of intraoperative electro-corticography (ECoG) in patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS) undergoing transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomy (sAHE). ECoG was recorded before and after resection in 22 patients with medication-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The sAHE was performed, regardless of ECoG findings. ECoG findings recorded from the mesiobasal temporal lobe (MTL) and lateral temporal lobe (LTL) before and after the sAHE were correlated with seizure outcome 12 months later. Ten patients had right-sided and 12 left-sided HS. Average age was 37.1 years. Pre-resection spikes were restricted to the MTL in 11 patients and to the LTL in one. In three patients spikes were recorded from MTL and LTL and in seven no spikes were recorded before the resection. Fifteen patients (68%) remained completely seizure-free and 19 (86%) were in Engel's class I post-operatively. Patients with pre-resection spikes restricted to the MTL (n = 11) remained seizure-free more frequently (9/11, 82%) compared with other patients (6/11, 55%; P = 0.36). Pre-resection ECoG may be helpful in the prediction of seizure outcome in patients undergoing sAHE for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. A larger study including more than 100 patients is needed to determine the predictive value of ECoG in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.",
