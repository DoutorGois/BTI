     "AB": "Pigeons were trained on a spatial discrimination task using a repeated acquisition procedure. In this procedure, the pigeons were trained to discriminate between the positions of three keys. One of them was designated the correct key. When the subjects reached the criterion, the discrimination task was changed, with one of two previously incorrect keys now being made the correct key. This procedure was repeated at least 15 times. Then, lesions to the whole hippocampus, the medial hippocampus or to the lateral hippocampus were made by injections of ibotenic acid (Experiment 1). Only the subjects with damage to the whole hippocampus showed deficits in learning after the lesions. The deficits were similar to those caused by aspiration lesions /37/. Knife cuts separating the medial and lateral hippocampi were made in Experiment 2. The subjects did not show deficits in the spatial discrimination task after the sections. Although studies of the connectivity in the avian hippocampus suggested functional differences between the medial and lateral hippocampi, the present results show that pigeons can learn spatial discrimination with the medial and lateral parts of hippocampus separated.",
