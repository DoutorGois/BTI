     "AB": "The hippocampus is often injured in neonatal stroke. We have investigated the effect of erythropoietin (EPO) on oxygen-glucose deprived hippocampal slices and hypoxic progenitor cells. EPO improved survival of the organotypic hippocampal slices with significantly less cell death in the dentate gyrus and an increased number of proliferating cells 4-5 days after insult. Significantly fewer markers of neurogenesis were seen after the insult but when EPO was added to the culture medium, neurogenesis was sustained. When hippocampal progenitor cultures were stimulated into differentiation, more cells chose a neuronal cell fate when treated with EPO. These findings support the hypothesis that EPO not only prevents ischemia induced cell death but promotes neuronal cell fate commitment in in vitro models of neonatal stroke.",
