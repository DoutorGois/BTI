     "AB": "There is increasing evidence that soluble amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) uptake into neurons is an early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identification of the early events leading to neuronal dysfunction is key to developing therapeutic strategies, but relative roles of receptors and factors modulating uptake are poorly understood. Studies have shown that transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), particularly TGFbeta2, can influence the targeting of Abeta to cells in vitro. TGFbeta2 can target Abeta to neurons in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSC). We examine a specific mechanism for TGFbeta2-mediated targeting of Abeta to neurons. The receptor-associated protein (RAP), a low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) antagonist, can attenuate the cellular targeting of Abeta both in vitro and in vivo and prevent Abeta/TGFbeta2-induced memory retention deficits. Using both in vitro and in vivo methods, we identify LRP as playing a role in TGFbeta2-mediated Abeta uptake, neurodegeneration, and spatial memory impairment.",
