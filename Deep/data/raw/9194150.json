     "AB": "1. The kava-pyrones kawain and dihydromethysticin are constituents of Piper methysticum which exert anticonvulsant, analgesic and anxiolytic properties. 2. In the present study the effect of these kava-pyrones were tested on field potential changes (fp) induced by omission of the extracellular Mg2+, recorded from the area CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampal slice preparation of guinea pigs. These fp are generated by an activation of NMDA receptors and voltage dependent calcium channels. 3. Kawain and dihydromethysticin reduced reversibly the frequency of occurrence of fp in a concentration range from 5 to 40 mumol/l and 10 to 40 mumol/l, respectively. 4. Reduction of the fp frequency after addition of subthreshold concentrations of 5 mumol/l kawain and 10 mumol/l dihydromethysticin indicated additive actions of both drugs. 5. Since the serotonin-1A agonist ipsapirone also exerts anxiolytic effects, subthreshold concentrations of kawain or dihydromethysticin were combined with a subthreshold concentration of ipsapirone in another set of experiments. Combining kawain and ipsapirone or dihydromethysticin and ipsapirone caused a reduction of the rate of fp to 0.76 and 0.81 of the baseline value, respectively. 6. The findings suggest that (i) single constituents of Piper methysticum may have additive actions, (ii) that the two components kawain and dihydromethysticin may enhance the effects of the anxiolytic serotonin-1A agonist ipsapirone and (iii) that activation of NMDA receptors and/or voltage dependent calcium channels may be involved in the elementary mechanism of action of some kava-pyrones.",
