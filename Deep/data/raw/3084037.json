     "AB": "The role that norepinephrine plays in regulating the concentration of different proteins in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum was assessed by investigating the effects of either a bilateral lesion of the locus coeruleus or neonatal administration of 6-hydroxydopamine. Two weeks after lesioning the locus coeruleus, the concentration of two different proteins was elevated in the hippocampus; a third protein was reduced in concentration in this brain area as a result of the lesion. Three proteins were affected in concentration in the cerebellum after the locus coeruleus lesion--two were elevated in concentration and one was reduced in concentration. No proteins were altered in concentration in the parietal cortex as a result of the lesion. Seventy days after neonatal treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine, a total of 6 proteins were found to be changed. Four of these (one in the hippocampus and 3 in the parietal cortex) were reduced in concentration while two proteins (both in the cerebellum) were elevated in concentration after neonatal treatment with the catecholamine neurotoxin. There was little overlap between those proteins affected in concentration by the bilateral lesion of the locus coeruleus and those changed by neonatal treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine. These results suggest that the concentration of a number of different proteins may, under normal physiological conditions, be regulated in vivo by norepinephrine in the brain.",
