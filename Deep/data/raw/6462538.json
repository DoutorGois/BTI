     "AB": "The topographic organization of cells containing choline-acetyltransferase (CAT) and located within the magnocellular nuclei of the basal forebrain was studied by correlating maximum CAT decrease in one or another cortical region with a given localization of the cell lesions. Lesions were made by using ibotenic acid. Lesions affecting the ventral pallidum decreased CAT activity in the antero-medial prefrontal cortex and lesions of the internal and ventral borders of the pallidum decreased CAT activity in sensori-motor and parieto-temporal cortices. None of these lesions produced a decrease of CAT activity in the hippocampus. These results suggest that it is possible to show the presence of a specific cholinergic projection from the basal forebrain to the medial-associative prefrontal cortex of the rat.",
