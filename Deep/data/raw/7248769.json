     "AB": "Intracellular activity was recorded from hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells maintained in vitro. Histamine (HA) produced a slow depolarization associated with minimal conductance changes. In addition, there was an increase in action potential discharge rates and the emergence of bursting firing patterns. EPSP size increased by about 50% and spontaneous dendritic spikes were observed. These effects were markedly reduced by tetrodotoxin. Extracellular recording of population spikes revealed a marked difference between CA1 and CA3 regions; in the former HA produced an increase in population spike size whereas in the latter this increase was larger and was associated with the appearance of secondary and tertiary population spikes. It is suggested that HA produces its effects by enhancing release of neurotransmitters from excitatory synapses on the recorded neurons.",
