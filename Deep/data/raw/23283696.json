     "AB": "The structural asymmetry of bilateral hippocampus in mammals has been well recognized. Recent findings highlighted the accompanying functional asymmetries, as well as the molecular differences of the hippocampus. The present paper summarized these recent advances in understanding the hippocampal asymmetries at molecular, circuit and functional levels. Additionally, the addition of new neurons to the hippocampal circuit during adulthood is asymmetrical. We conclude that these differences in molecules and structures of bilateral hippocampus determined the variances in functionality between the two sides.",
