     "AB": "Pharmacological depolarization by KCl or veratrine reduced [3H]diprenorphine binding to opioid receptors in the hippocampal slice in a transient, calcium-dependent, and peptide-sensitive manner. These results suggest that endogenous opioid peptides were released from synaptic terminals and competitively displaced [3H]diprenorphine binding to opioid receptors. [3H]diprenorphine binding was significantly reduced by calcium-dependent depolarization throughout the hippocampus as determined by subsequent receptor autoradiography and quantitative densitometry. Displacement of binding was evident at sites in the CA1 and CA3 regions, the dentate gyrus, and the subiculum. The most dramatic reduction was evident in stratum lacunosum moleculare of CA3. Correlating the sites of maximal [3H]diprenorphine displacement with the previously described distribution of the opioid peptides suggests that the perforant path fibers release enkephalins in stratum lacunosum moleculare of CA3 and stratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus, and that mossy fibers may release both dynorphins and enkephalins near stratum pyramidale of CA3 and stratum granulosum. The lack of complete overlap between the distribution of opioid terminals and the sites of displacement indicates that these peptides may diffuse a moderate distance to their sites of action. Radioligand displacement defines the sites of endogenous opioid binding, suggests the likely sources of peptide release, and thus predicts the sites of endogenous opioid action within the hippocampus.",
