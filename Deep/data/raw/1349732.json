     "AB": "Population spikes, population excitatory postsynaptic potentials and intracellular excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in the CA1 area of guinea-pig hippocampal slices in response to low frequency stimulation of the stratum radiatum. Tetanic stimulation of the same afferents during an application of saccharin (10 mM, 10 min) failed to induced a long-term potentiation of the population spike, population excitatory postsynaptic potential and intracellularly recorded excitatory postsynaptic potential. A post-tetanic application of saccharin did not prevent long-term potentiation of the population spike from developing. Saccharin did not change the input resistance, the membrane potential or the ability to induce action potentials in the CA1 neurons. The slope of the intracellular excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded in normal medium, in normal medium containing 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, or in Mg(2+)-free medium containing 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione was not significantly altered by saccharin. The depolarizations of CAI neurons produced by superfusion of N-methyl-D-aspartate or during a brief tetanic stimulation of the stratum radiation were also not altered by the drug. It therefore appears that saccharin blocks the induction of long-term potentiation by a mechanism that does not involve a blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Application of fluid samples collected from rabbit neocortical surface during a tetanic stimulation of the neocortex caused neurite growth in PC-12 cells, suggesting that growth-related substances were present in the collected samples. If these samples were superfused onto hippocampal slices, long-term potentiation developed. If however, the samples were co-applied with saccharin, neither neurite growth in PC-12 cells nor long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices was observed, raising the possibility that growth-related substances are involved in long-term potentiation.",
