     "AB": "The ability of activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) to induce depotentiation was investigated at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses of rat hippocampal slices. Brief bath application (5 min) of group I mGluR agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) (10 microm) induced a long-term depression of synaptic transmission or depotentiation (DEP) of previously established long-term potentiation (LTP), which was independent of NMDA or A(1) adenosine receptor activation. This DHPG-DEP was observed when DHPG was delivered 3 min after LTP induction. However, when DHPG was applied at 10 or 30 min after LTP induction, significantly less depotentiation was found. DHPG-DEP (1) is reversible and has the ability to unsaturate LTP, (2) is synapse specific, (3) does not require concurrent synaptic stimulation, (4) is mechanistically distinct from NMDA receptor-dependent depotentiation, (5) requires mGluR5 activation, (6) requires rapamycin-sensitive mRNA translation signaling, (7) does not require phospholipase C or protein phosphatase activation, and (8) is not associated with a change in paired-pulse (PP) facilitation. In addition, the ability of DHPG to reverse LTP was mimicked by a long train of low-frequency (1 Hz/15 min) PP stimulation. Moreover, the expression of DHPG-DEP is associated with a reduction in the increase of the surface expression of AMPA receptors seen with LTP. These results suggest that the activation of mGluR5 and in turn the triggering of a protein synthesis-dependent internalization of synaptic AMPA receptors may contribute to the DHPG-DEP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.",
