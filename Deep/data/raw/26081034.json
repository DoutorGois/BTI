     "AB": "Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE) is a well known natural antioxidant. In the present investigation, its ameliorative effects were tested against lead-induced oxidative stress in rat brain. Four groups of male Wistar rats (100 to 120 g) were used, consisting of eight rats per group. Rats in the control group received 500 ppm of sodium acetate through drinking water, and rats in the other three groups received 500 ppm of lead acetate through drinking water for 4 weeks. Rats in the third and fourth groups were administered (oral) 50 and 100 mg/kg of GbE, respectively, along with lead acetate. The rats were sacrificed after treatment and brains were isolated. Each brain was dissected on ice, and different regions, namely the cerebellum, hippocampus, frontal cortex, and brainstem, were separated. The results revealed a significant (P < .001) increase in reactive oxygen species, catalase, superoxide dismutase, lipid peroxidation products, and total protein carbonyl content, relative to their controls, in all four regions of the brain exposed to lead. These results indicate oxidative stress. Partial restoration was observed for all the parameters just mentioned in different brain regions on treatment with 50 mg/kg GbE. This amelioration was higher with 100 mg/kg GbE, showing dose-dependency. Overall the data suggest that GbE protects against lead-induced oxidative stress in specific regions of rat brain.",
