     "AB": "Prolonged neurotoxicity of the recreational drug, MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) on serotoninergic axon terminals has been suggested. The effect of a single (15 mg/kg) dose of intraperitoneally administered MDMA on serotoninergic fibre density, defined by tryptophan hydroxylase (TpH) and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) immunoreactivity, has been evaluated in the spinal cord and brain areas in Dark Agouti rats, 7 and 180 days after MDMA applications. Immunostaining for amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been performed to examine possible defects of the fast axonal transport, and 5-HTT mRNA expressions were quantified in neurones of medullary raphe nuclei. Seven days after MDMA treatment, a substantial decrease in the density of TpH-immunoreactive fibres was detectable in the frontal cortex, the caudate-putamen, the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and marked decreases were found in the spinal cord. These changes in TpH density showed a high correlation with 5-HTT densities. In contrast, APP-immunoreactive axonal bulbs were not detected in any of the brain regions studied. Seven days after MDMA administrations, significantly elevated 5-HTT mRNA expressions were found in the raphe pallidus and obscurus. Our results suggest that a single dose of MDMA elicits widespread depletion of TpH and 5-HTT immunoreactivity in serotoninergic axons without morphological sign of the blockage of the fast anterograde axonal transport. Our results do not support the notion of MDMA-induced axotomy of serotoninergic neurones. The up-regulation of 5-HTT mRNA expressions 1 week after MDMA injections might indicate the potential recovery of the serotonin system.",
