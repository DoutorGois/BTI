     "AB": "Evolving evidence suggests that brain inflammation and the buildup of proinflammatory cytokine increases the risk for cognitive decline and cognitive dysfunction. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), acting via poorly understood mechanisms, appears to be a key cytokine in causing these deleterious effects along with a presumably related loss of long-term potentiation (LTP)-type synaptic plasticity. We hypothesized that IL-1beta disrupts brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling cascades and thereby impairs the formation of filamentous actin (F-actin) in dendritic spines, an event that is essential for the stabilization of LTP. Actin polymerization in spines requires phosphorylation of the filament severing protein cofilin and is modulated by expression of the immediate early gene product Arc. Using rat organotypic hippocampal cultures, we found that IL-1beta suppressed BDNF-dependent regulation of Arc and phosphorylation of cofilin and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor regulating Arc expression. IL-1beta appears to act on BDNF signal transduction by impairing the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, a protein that couples activation of the BDNF receptor TrkB to downstream signaling pathways regulating CREB, Arc, and cofilin. IL-1beta upregulated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and inhibiting p38 MAPK prevented IL-1beta from disrupting BDNF signaling. IL-1beta also prevented the formation of F-actin in spines and impaired the consolidation, but not the induction, of BDNF-dependent LTP in acute hippocampal slices. The suppressive effect of IL-1beta on F-actin and LTP was prevented by inhibiting p38 MAPK. These findings define a new mechanism for the action of IL-1beta on LTP and point to a potential therapeutic target to restore synaptic plasticity.",
