     "AB": "Exposing 7-day-old rat pups to hypoxia, 8% oxygen/92% nitrogen, for 3 h alters glutamate (GLU), glutamine and glutamine synthetase (GS) activity in the striatum, frontal cortex and hippocampus. Immediately following the hypoxic insult there is a rapid transient elevation of GLU followed by a fall and then recovery to control values within 6 h. Glutamine content initially decreased after the termination of the insult, rose thereafter and approached control values within 6 h. GS activity was depressed after hypoxia and gradually returned to normal levels within 6 h. GS mRNA was increased in the three brain regions studied after hypoxia and returned to control values within 24 h. These results suggest that hypoxia alters GLU metabolism in the immature brain.",
