     "AB": "Although significant inconsistencies remain to be clarified, a role for neurogenesis in hippocampal functions, such as cognition, has been suggested by several reports. Yet, investigation in various species of mammals, including humans, revealed that rates of hippocampal neurogenesis are steadily declining with age. The very low levels of hippocampal neurogenesis persisting in the aged brain have been suspected to underlie the cognitive deficits observed in elderly. However, current evidence fails to support the hypothesis that decrease of neurogenesis along normal ageing leads to hippocampal dysfunction. Nevertheless, current studies are suggestive for a distinct role of hippocampal neurogenesis in young versus adult and old brain.",
