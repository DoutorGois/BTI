     "AB": "We have found that the density of synapses in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1 region in the adult female rat is sensitive to estradiol manipulation and fluctuates naturally as the levels of ovarian steroids vary during the 5 d estrous cycle. In both cases, low levels of estradiol are correlated with lower synapse density, while high estradiol levels are correlated with a higher density of synapses. These synaptic changes occur very rapidly in that within approximately 24 hr between the proestrus and estrus stages of the estrous cycle, we observe a 32% decrease in the density of hippocampal synapses. Synapse density then appears to cycle back to proestrus values over a period of several days. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of such short-term steroid-mediated synaptic plasticity occurring naturally in the adult mammalian brain.",
