     "AB": "Chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) is a well-established rodent model of depression that induces persistent social avoidance. CSDS triggers molecular adaptations throughout the mesocorticolimbic reward circuit, including changes in the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), that may also influence drug reward. One limitation of traditional, physical CSDS (PS) is that injury complicates the study of opiate drugs like morphine. Thus, we sought to characterize a variation of CSDS, termed emotional CSDS (ES), that eliminates this confound. We assessed the effect of PS and ES on mesocorticolimbic circuit activation, VTA gene expression, and morphine intake. We found that PS and ES similarly induced DeltaFosB in the hippocampus, but only PS significantly increased DeltaFosB expression in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. In contrast, cFos expression was similarly reduced by both PS and ES. Interestingly, we found that PS and ES similarly increased voluntary morphine consumption immediately following stress, despite differences in the magnitude of the depressive phenotype and striatal DeltaFosB expression at this time point. Combined, these data suggest that both stress paradigms may be useful for investigation of stress-induced changes in drug behavior.",
