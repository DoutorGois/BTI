     "AB": "Domoic acid, in increasing doses (10-300 pmol), was microinjected into the hippocampal CA3 region of rats. All rats consistently exhibited generalized bilateral electrical seizure discharge activity at 100 pmol of domoic acid. Seizure latency varied inversely with the dose of domoic acid in the range tested. Local hippocampal administration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) resulted in neuronal recovery from domoic acid-induced seizures. The seizure activity of domoic acid might be the result of decreased GABAergic inhibition.",
