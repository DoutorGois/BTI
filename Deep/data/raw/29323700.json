     "AB": "The cholinergic system plays a crucial role in modulating in the central nervous system physiological responses such as neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection. In a recent study, we showed that Oxotremorine-M, a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, is able to transactivate the fibroblast growth factor receptor and to produce a significant increase in the hippocampal primary neurite outgrowth. In the present study we aimed to explore in the rat hippocampus the possible effect of acute or chronic treatment with Oxotremorine-M on some heat shock proteins (Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsp90) and on activation of related transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Following single injection of Oxotremorine-M (0.4 mg/kg) all Hsps examined were significantly increased in at least one of the time points studied (24h, 48h and 72h). Treatment with Oxotremorine-M significantly increased the level of phosphorylated HSF1 in all time points studied, without change of protein levels. Similar pattern of Hsps changes was obtained following chronic Oxotremorine-M treatment (0.2 mg/kg) for 5 days. Surprisingly, following chronic treatment for 10 days no changes were observed in Hsps. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist scopolamine (1 mg/kg) was able to completely block Oxotremorine-M effects on Hsps. In conclusion, considering the function of Hsps in protecting neuronal cells from deleterious proteotoxic stress, e.g. protein mis-folding and aggregation, the results obtained indicate that muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation may have implications in potential treatment of neurodegenerative disorders linked to protein aggregation, such as Alzheimer disease.
