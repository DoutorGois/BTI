     "AB": "Simultaneous intracellular recordings from presynaptic Stratum pyramidale interneurons and postsynaptic pyramidal cells in adult rat hippocampal slices were performed to investigate the strength of the modulation of single-axon inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) by the GABAA receptor modulators pentobarbitone, diazepam and zinc. The processing of biocytin-filled interneurons for light microscopy revealed that these single-axon IPSPs were generated by basket cells (n = 33), bistratified cells (n = 18) and axo-axonic cells (n = 2). The IPSPs generated by these three groups of interneurons had amplitudes and widths at half amplitude with similar ranges, but when bistratified cell IPSPs were compared with basket cell IPSPs with similar half widths their rise times were slower. Pentobarbitone sodium (250 microM) powerfully enhanced 13 tested IPSPs generated by all three cell types. Amplitudes were enhanced by 82 +/- 56%, 10-90% rise times by 150 +/- 101% and the widths at half amplitude by 71 +/- 29%. Diazepam (1-2 microM) also increased all IPSPs tested, although the changes were more moderate in basket cell IPSPs (amplitudes increased by 19 +/- 11%, n = 8) than in bistratified cell IPSPs (amplitudes increased by 66 +/- 48%, n = 5). Basket cell IPSP 10-90% rise times and widths at half amplitude were not significantly increased. Bistratified cell IPSP 10-90% rise times were increased by 44 +/- 24% and the widths at half amplitude by 32 +/- 35%. The one tested IPSP generated by an axo-axonic cell was also diazepam-sensitive. Zinc, 250 microM, decreased four out of 10 IPSPs generated by basket cells and four out of five IPSPs generated by bistratified cells. The one tested axo-axonic cell IPSP was zinc-insensitive. These data suggest that IPSPs generated in CA1 pyramidal cells by basket and bistratified cells display different pharmacologies and may be mediated by different receptors or receptor combinations.",
