     "AB": "BACKGROUND: MR imaging is part of the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease through the evaluation of hippocampal atrophy. The objective of this study is to evaluate which sequence between T1 Weighted Imaging (T1WI) and T2 Weighted Imaging (T2WI) allows the best visual evaluation of hippocampal atrophy. METHODS: Visual qualitative ratings of the hippocampus of 100 MCI and 50 AD patients were made independently by four operators according to the Medial Temporal lobe Atrophy (MTA) score based either on T1WI or T2WI. These two evaluations were compared in terms of inter-observer reproducibility, concordance with a quantitative volumetric measure, discrimination power between AD and MCI groups, and correlation with several neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: MTA score evaluated on either T1WI or T2WI exhibit similar inter-observer variability and accordance with quantitative volumetric evaluation. Nonetheless, the visual evaluation on T2WI seems to provide a better discrimination power between AD vs MCI groups for both left (T1WI: p=0.0001 / T2WI: p=7.072x10(-5) ) and right hippocampus (T1WI: p=0.008 / T2WI: p=0.001), and a higher overall correlation with neuropsychological tests. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that T2W images provide a more adequate visual rating of hippocampal atrophy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",
