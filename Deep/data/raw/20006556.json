     "AB": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can coexist with epilepsy. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) are considered to model ADHD with overactivity, impulsiveness, deficient sustained attention, and alterations in circadian autonomic profiles. The present study explored spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) and behavioral diurnal activity rhythms in normotensive Wistar rats and SHRs in the kainate model of epilepsy. Rats were video monitored (24 h/3 months) to detect SRSs. SHRs manifested a lower seizure frequency during the light phase in the 8th and 10th weeks and a lower frequency of SRSs during the night phase accompanied by attenuated responses in hyperexcitability tests. Both epileptic strains were hyperactive, with lower anxiety levels, and their diurnal rhythms were abolished. Epileptic Wistar rats and SHRs exhibited less exploration during the dark phase. This study suggests that SHRs may be useful in modeling some aspects (particularly hypertension-related diurnal rhythm disturbance) of behavior associated with epilepsy.",
