     "AB": "Connexin43 (Cx43) is the predominant gap junction protein expressed in premitotic radial glial cells and mature astrocytes. It is thought to play a role in many aspects of brain development and physiology, including intercellular communication, the release of neuroactive substances, and neural and glial proliferation and migration. To investigate the role of Cx43 in brain physiology, we generated a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse expressing Cre recombinase driven by the human GFAP promoter and a floxed Cx43 gene. The removal of Cx43 from GFAP-expressing cells affects the behavior of the mice and the development of several brain structures; however, the severity of the phenotype varies depending on the mouse background. One mouse subline, hereafter termed Shuffler, exhibits cellular disorganization of the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, accompanied by ataxia and motor deficits. The Shuffler cerebellum is most affected and displays altered distribution and lamination of glia and neurons suggestive of cell migration defects. In all Shuffler mice by postnatal day two (P2), the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum are smaller. Disorganization of the ventricular and subventricular zone of the cortex is also evident. Given that these are sites of early progenitor cell proliferation, we suspect production and migration of neural progenitors may be altered. In conclusion, neurodevelopment of Shuffler/Cx43 cKO mice is abnormal, and the observed cellular phenotype may explain behavioral disturbances seen in these animals as well as in humans carrying Cx43 mutations.",
