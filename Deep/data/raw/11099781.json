     "AB": "The effect of TGF-beta1 on apoptosis varies depending on the cell type, the kind of stimulus and the experimental conditions. The present study attempted to identify whether TGF-beta1 can prevent neuronal apoptosis and interrupt caspase-3 activation in rat primary hippocampal cultures after staurosporine treatment. TGF-beta1 at the concentration of 1 and 10 ng/ml significantly reduced neuronal damage as detected by trypan blue exclusion. Nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258 and TUNEL-staining further demonstrated that TGF-beta1 at the same concentration range effectively diminished neuronal apoptosis 24 h after staurosporine treatment, whereas 0.1 ng/ml of TGF-beta1 did not. Furthermore, TGF-beta1 (1 and 10 ng/ml) markedly inhibited the activation of caspase-3 induced by staurosporine as demonstrated by both caspase-3 activity assay and Western blotting. This study provides evidence that TGF-beta1 is able to efficiently inhibit caspase-3 activation, and thereby protects cultured hippocampal neurons against apoptosis.",
