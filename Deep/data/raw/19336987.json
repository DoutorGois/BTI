     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Imaging diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, requires evaluation of the extent of hippocampal atrophy. Coronal magnetic resonance (MR) images of patients with AD often demonstrate outward rotation of the hippocampus that is altered from a long horizontal elliptical to a long vertical elliptical shape. Such rotation may be related to the disease process of AD. PURPOSE AND METHODS: To determine whether hippocampal rotation is associated with AD, we investigated MR images from 11 patients with AD and 11 normal controls, measuring the hippocampal angle (HA) and the volume of the left hippocampus on coronal T(1)-weighted MR images. The HA is the angle between a horizontal line orthogonal to the falx cerebri and the uncal sulcus line between the deepest point of the uncal sulcus and the point nearest to the side of the ambient cistern in the uncal gyrus facing the uncal sulcus. The HA is measured on the most rostral slice in which the uncal sulcus can be identified and increases with hippocampal rotation. RESULTS: We found correlation between the HA and standardized hippocampal volume in the AD group, but not in controls. CONCLUSION: Hippocampal rotation is a new marker associated with the pathology of AD.",
