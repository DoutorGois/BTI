     "AB": "Serotonergic neurons of the dorsal and median raphe nuclei are morphologically dissimilar. Recent results challenge previous evidence indicating a greater inhibition of dorsal raphe neurons after 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) autoreceptor activation. As both nuclei innervate different forebrain territories, this issue is critical to understanding the changes in brain function induced by anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs. Using microdialysis, we examined the modifications of 5-HT release induced by the selective 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone in both neuronal pathways. Maximal and minimal basal 5-HT values (in the presence of 1 microM citalopram) were 45.0 +/- 4.8 fmol/fraction in the median raphe nucleus and 8.4 +/- 0.4 fmol/fraction in the dorsal hippocampus. Ipsapirone (0.3, 3, and 10 mg/kg s.c.) reduced dose-dependently 5-HT in the two raphe nuclei and four forebrain areas. Maximal reductions (to approximately 25% of predrug values) were observed in cortex and striatum and in median raphe nucleus. The effects were more moderate in dorsal and ventral hippocampus (to 66 and 50% of baseline, respectively). These results are consistent with a higher sensitivity of dorsal raphe neurons to 5-HT1A autoreceptor activation. Yet the differential reduction of 5-HT release in the median raphe nucleus and hippocampus suggests the presence of complex mechanisms of control of 5-HT release in these neurons.",
