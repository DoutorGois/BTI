     "AB": "Neuronal apoptosis has been demonstrated to be a significant factor in neurological deficiencies associated with diabetes, and these deficiencies are exaggerated following ischemia. Diabetic rats have an increased basal level of apoptosis compared to non-diabetics and it has been previously demonstrated that infarct volumes were greater in diabetic animals following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) when compared to non-diabetics. In this study, we evaluated both the acute and chronic effects of insulin and/or C-peptide on CNS necrosis and apoptosis in non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats following MCAO with reperfusion. Two brain areas, the sensori-motor cortex (layers-5 and 6) and the CA1 and CA3 sectors (pyramidal cell layers) of the hippocampus, were analyzed for apoptosis using TUNEL and Caspase-3 immunoreactivity. The chronic administration of a low maintenance concentration of insulin (2 U/kg), or the acute administration of insulin (2 U/kg) with or without C-peptide, did not alter the lesion volume or basal levels of apoptosis or the apoptotic levels in animals subjected to 2-h MCAO followed by 24-h reperfusion. However, both the acute or chronic administration of a high concentration of insulin (12 U/kg) significantly decreased lesion volume and apoptosis subsequent to 2-h MCAO followed by 24-h reperfusion. High dose insulin treatment also decreased the basal level of apoptosis. We conclude that in diabetic rats subjected to ischemia and reperfusion chronic insulin treatment decreased the basal apoptotic level, and both acute and chronic insulin decreased the MCAO-induced lesion volume and apoptosis. Maintenance insulin concentrations with or without C-peptide were without effect.",
