     "AB": "Chronic developmental lead exposure is known to be associated with cognitive dysfunction in children. Impairment of the induction of long-term depression (LTD) has been reported in area CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) of rat hippocampus following chronic lead exposure. The present study was carried out to investigate age-related alterations of LTD in area CA1 and DG of rat hippocampus following developmental lead exposure in vitro. Neonatal Wistar rats were exposed to lead from parturition to weaning via milk of dams drinking 0.2% lead acetate solution. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded in hippocampal slices at various postnatal ages: postnatal day (PND) 17-23, 27-33, and 57-63. Following low-frequency stimulation (LFS, 900 pulses/1 Hz), the average magnitude of LTD is age related. In the controls, LTD magnitude in area CA1 decreased with age, whereas in DG it increased with age. In the lead-exposed groups, the magnitude of LTD declined during development in both area CA1 and DG. The differences of LTD magnitude between the control and lead-exposed rats were 27.26 +/- 9.15% (PND 17-23), 21.59 +/- 12.93% (PND 27-33), and 16.96 +/- 9.33% (PND 57-63) in area CA1, and were 6.95 +/- 9.26%, 17.60 +/- 3.91%, and 33.63 +/- 10.47% in DG, respectively. These results demonstrated that the lead-induced impairment of LTD magnitude was an age-related decline in area CA1 and an age-related increase in area DG of rat hippocampus.
