     "AB": "This study examined the effects of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors on N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced perturbation of neurotransmission and normal NMDA-receptor dependent function (long-term potentiation, LTP) in the CA1 field of hippocampus. During baseline recording, neurotransmission was unaffected by long-term bath perfusion with MAO inhibitors (selegiline, pargyline). After NMDA (100 microM) infusion, the presence of selegiline (1 microM) promoted the recovery rate and increased the size of recovered extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs). Selegiline (1 microM) also prevented the NMDA-induced increase in paired pulse facilitation (PPF). The induction and maintenance of LTP were normal with this same concentration of selegiline. The presence of lower concentration (10 nM) of selegiline or pargyline (1 microM) did not improve the recovery process. These results suggest that selegiline partially protects the function of CA3-CA1 hippocampal connections against overactivation of NMDA receptors. Further, the same concentration of selegiline does not interfere with the physiological function of NMDA receptors in the CA1 field of the hippocampus. The exact mechanism of action remains to be determined, but it is apparently downstream to the overactivation of NMDA receptors.",
