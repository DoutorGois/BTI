     "AB": "Tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor (TrkB) is a neurotrophin receptor important for the synaptic plasticity underlying hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Because this receptor is widely expressed in hippocampal neurons, the precise location of TrkB activation is likely important for its specific actions. The goal of this study was to identify the precise sites of TrkB activation in the mouse hippocampal formation and to determine any changes in the distribution of activated TrkB under conditions of enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and hippocampal excitability. Using electron microscopy, we localized TrkB phosphorylated at tyrosine 816 (pTrkB) in the hippocampal formation of male and female mice under conditions of naturally low circulating estradiol and naturally high circulating estradiol, when BDNF expression, TrkB signaling, and synaptic plasticity are enhanced. To compare relative amounts of pTrkB in each group, we counted profiles containing pTrkB-immunoreactivity (pTrkB-ir) in all hippocampal subregions. pTrkB-ir was in axons, axon terminals, dendrites, and dendritic spines of neurons in the hippocampal formation, but the majority of pTrkB-ir localized to presynaptic profiles. pTrkB-ir also was abundant in glial profiles, which were further identified as microglia using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Axonal and glial pTrkB-ir and pTrkB-ir in the CA1 stratum radiatum were more abundant in high-estradiol states (proestrus females) than low-estradiol states (estrus and diestrus females and males). These findings suggest that presynaptic TrkB is positioned to modulate estradiol-mediated and BDNF-dependent synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, they suggest a novel role for TrkB in microglial function in the neuroimmune system.",
