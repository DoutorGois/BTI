     "AB": "We had previously established a patch sensor system for detecting overflow of excitatory amino acids (EAA) from hippocampal slices induced by a single electric stimulus. We performed simultaneous recordings of patch sensor current and whole-cell current in rat hippocampal slices. Tetanus of mossy fibers produced long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) recorded from a CA3 pyramidal cell with an increase in single electric stimulus-evoked patch current amplitude recorded with a patch sensor positioned in the stratum lucidum. In Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, however, LTP of EPSC was accompanied by an increase in AMPA-evoked whole-cell current, but not with change in patch current in the stratum radiatum. These results indicate that EAA release is increased during mossy fiber LTP but not CA1 LTP.",
