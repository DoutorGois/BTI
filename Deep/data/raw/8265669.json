     "AB": "The mRNA levels of protein F1 (also known as GAP-43), and protein kinase C (PKC) subtypes were measured 3 days after the induction of long-term enhancement (also known as long-term potentiation) in the hippocampus of chronically prepared conscious rats by quantitative in situ hybridization. Altered mRNA levels correlated significantly with alternations in synaptic efficacy; such correlations have not been reported previously. Rats with greater synaptic enhancement had lower gene expression in the CA3 subfield of F1/GAP-43 and both beta-PKC and gamma-PKC, but not alpha-PKC. For microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), neurogranin, and the glutamate receptor subtype B-flip, no correlation was observed in any cell field between synaptic enhancement and hybridization to the mRNA. To our surprise, alterations in mRNA levels of F1/GAP-43 and gamma-PKC were highly correlated (r = +0.928, P < 0.001), suggesting coordinate regulation. Since F1/GAP-43 is associated with neurite growth, its lowered expression at 3 days would reduce potential growth, leading to synaptic stabilization. We propose that long-term synaptic change is mediated by gene expression of the very same proteins initially modified posttranslationally.",
