     "AB": "This paper presents evidence that galanin is a potent in vivo modulator of basal acetylcholine release in the rat brain with qualitatively and quantitatively differential effects in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Galanin perfused through the microdialysis probe decreased basal acetylcholine release in the ventral hippocampus, while it enhanced acetylcholine release in the dorsal hippocampus. Galanin (3 nmol/rat) infused into the ventral hippocampus impaired spatial learning acquisition, while it tended to facilitate acquisition when injected into the dorsal hippocampus. These effects appear to be related to activation of GAL-R1 (ventral hippocampus) and GAL-R2 (dorsal hippocampus) receptors, respectively. However, the effects of galanin on acetylcholine release and on spatial learning appear not to be directly related to cholinergic mechanisms, but they may also involve interactions with noradrenaline and/or glutamate transmission. Galanin administered into the lateral ventricle failed to affect acetylcholine release, while this route of administration produced a long-lasting reduction in 5-HT release in the ventral hippocampus, indicating that galanin is a potent inhibitor of mesencephalic 5-HT neurotransmission in vivo. Subsequent studies supported this hypothesis, showing that the effects on 5-HT release in vivo are most likely mediated by a galanin receptor in the dorsal raphe. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the role of acetylcholine in cognitive functions in the forebrain and the role of the raphe 5-HT neurons in affective disorders.",
