     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of \"Xiusanzhen\" [electroacupuncture (EA) of bilateral \"Yingxiang\" (LI 20) and \"Yintang\" (EX-HN 3)] on activities of hippocampal muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mAChR) and the involved neural path in Alzheimer Disease(AD)rats. METHODS: Forty Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal control, model, olfactory nerve severing (ONS)-EA of \"Xiusanzhen\" (ONS-EA) and EA of \"Xiusanzhen\" (EA) groups. AD model was established by intra-hippocampal injection (AP: 3.5 mm, L:2 mm, H: -2.8 mm) of Abeta(1-40) starch-like peptide (10 microg/2 microL) under the aid of a microsyringe installed in a brain stereotaxis instrument. For rats of the ONS-EA group, the olfactory nerve was severed by using a surgical knife after drilling a hole on the skull (5 mm anterior to the bregma, L, R: 2 mm). The mAChR density, and its maximum binding capacity (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) of the hippocampus tissue were measured by using radio-ligand binding analysis and Lowry's microamount protein assay. RESULTS: In comparison with the normal control group, the hippocampal mAChR density and its Bmax in the model group were decreased remarkably (P < 0.05), while the Kd of M-receptor in the model group was increased remarkably (P < 0.05). In comparison with the model group, hippocampal mAChR density and its Bmax in the EA group were up-regulated obviously (P < 0.05), while the Kd of mAChR in the EA group was down-regulated significantly (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between the model and ONS-EA groups in mAChR density and its Bmax and Kd (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: \"Xiusanzhen\"-EA can effectively up-regulate hippocampal mAChR density and Bmax and down-regulate Kd of M-receptor of hippocampus in AD rats, which is dependent on the intact olfactory nerve pathway.",
