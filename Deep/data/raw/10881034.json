     "AB": "Dopamine D(5) receptor localization has been difficult because even the most specific ligands cannot distinguish between molecular subtypes of the D(1)-like receptor subfamily. Antifusion protein rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against the C-terminus of human D(5) receptor were therefore developed for immunolocalization of the D(5) receptor protein in brain. The antibodies were characterized by immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation and used for light microscopic immunocytochemistry in rat and monkey brain. Affinity purified D(5) antibodies were specific for D(5) fusion protein as well as cloned and native D(5) receptor on Western blots, and D(5) antisera specifically immunoprecipitated solubilized, cloned D(5) receptor. Regional distribution of D(5) receptor immunoreactivity was consistent across species and correlated well with D(5) mRNA distribution previously reported in monkey brain. Immunoreactivity was widespread and tended to label perikarya and proximal dendrites of neurons in cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, basal forebrain, hippocampus, diencephalon, brainstem, and cerebellum. Neuropil was immunoreactive in olfactory bulb, islands of Calleja, cerebral cortex, superior colliculus, and molecular layer of cerebellum. The distribution of D(5) in brain was clearly different from that of other dopamine receptor subtypes, including D(1), the other member of the D(1)-like receptor subfamily. This unique distribution corroborates the idea that the D(5) receptor subtype has a distinct role in dopamine neurotransmission.",
