     "AB": "Long-term drug-induced alterations in CNS gene expression may be responsible for some therapeutic effects, such as antidepressant action, as well as for psychopathological conditions, such as drug addiction and abuse. Transcription factors called \"clock\" genes can be affected by psychotropic drugs and may modify the expression pattern of other genes. In this study in mice, we investigated the delayed effects of single and repeated (i.e. 14 days) administration of the antidepressant fluoxetine and the psychostimulant cocaine on the brain expression of clock genes Period1, Period2, Period3, Clock, Bmal1, Cryptochrome1, Cryptochrome2, and NPAS2 (neuronal PAS domain protein 2), and their putative target gene, serotonin N-acetyltransferase. Mice were treated at ZT05 (lights on at 5:00 am; ZT00). Brain samples (i.e. hippocampus, striatum, and prefrontal cortex) were processed for a semi-quantitative mRNA assay. Repeated but not single treatment with either drug increased serotonin N-acetyltransferase expression in all areas tested. On the other hand, the expression of clock genes was differentially affected depending on the drug (i.e. fluoxetine and cocaine), treatment schedule (i.e. single and repeated), and brain area (i.e. hippocampus and striatum) tested. More pronounced changes were induced by repeated rather than single administrations of fluoxetine or cocaine. We propose that the effects of psychoactive drugs on clock transcription factors may mediate long-term drug-induced changes, possibly by regulating the expression of a second set of genes (i.e. clock-controlled genes).",
