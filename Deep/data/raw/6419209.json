     "AB": "The first experiment was conducted in an attempt to ascertain the effects of hippocampal lesions on plasma levels of total T4, total T3, free T4, and TSH. Animals with hippocampal lesions had significantly lower levels of total T4, free T4 and TSH than cortical control and normal animals. There were no significant differences in total T3 among the three groups. Since these results indicated that animals with hippocampal lesions manifested a dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, a second experiment was undertaken to determine the site of mediation. A TRH injection test demonstrated that the dysfunction occurs at the level of the hypothalamus. It is hypothesized that in the normal animal the hippocampus exerts a facilitating effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.",
