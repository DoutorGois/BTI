     "AB": "The role of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe and median raphe in the pressor response to electrical stimulation of these areas, and the contribution of these neurons to the pressor response to serotonin (5-HT) in the anterior hypothalamus-preoptic area (AH/PO) have been studied by the use of local injections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), a neurotoxin selective for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). When blood pressure was recorded in urethane-anesthetized rats, selective lesions of 5-HT-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus reduced by 60% the pressor response to electrical stimulation (50 Hz, 100-150 microA, 0.3 msec pulse duration) of this nucleus. On the other hand, selective lesion of 5-HT-containing neurons in the median raphe nucleus had no effect on the pressor response to electrical stimulation of this area. Injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the anterior hypothalamus/preoptic area resulted in an increased pressor response to the injection of 5-HT (5 nmol) into the lesioned area 10 days later. Furthermore, the destruction of 5-HT-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus resulted in an enhanced pressor response to the injection of 5-HT (5 nmol) into the anterior hypothalamus/preoptic area, while the destruction of 5-HT-containing neurons in the median raphe nucleus had no effect on the pressor response to the injection of 5-HT (5 nmol) into the anterior hypothalamus/preoptic area. Therefore, it appears that 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus are important in the pressor response to electrical stimulation and are involved in a pressor mechanism in the anterior hypothalamus/preoptic area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
