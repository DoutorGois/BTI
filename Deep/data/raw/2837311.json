     "AB": "Phaclofen (0.5-1 mM) reversibly inhibited the late, bicuculline resistant, K+ dependent IPSP recorded in projection cells of the cat and rat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurones. At the same concentrations, phaclofen reversibly blocked the K+ dependent, bicuculline insensitive hyperpolarization evoked by GABA and baclofen but had no effect on the GABAA IPSP. These results represent conclusive evidence that GABAB receptors mediate the late K+ dependent IPSP in cortical and subcortical neurones.",
