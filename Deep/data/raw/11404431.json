     "AB": "Kindling produces enduring neural changes that are subsequently manifest in enhanced susceptibility to seizure-evoking stimuli and alterations in some types of behavior. The present study investigated the effects of dorsal hippocampal (dHPC) kindling on a variety of behaviors to clarify the nature of previously reported effects on spatial task performance. Rats were kindled twice daily with dHPC stimulation until three fully generalized seizures were evoked. Beginning 7 d later and on successive days, rats were tested in an elevated plus maze, a large circular open field, an open field object exploration task, and a delayed-match-to-place (DMTP) task in a water maze to assess anxiety-related and activity-related behavior (tasks 1 and 2), object recognition memory (task 3), and spatial cognition (task 4). Kindling disrupted performance on the DMTP task in a manner that was not delay dependent and produced a mild enhancement of activity-related behaviors in the open field task but not the elevated plus maze. All other aspects of testing were spared. These findings indicate that dHPC kindling produces enduring and selective effects on behavior that are consistent with a restricted disruption of hippocampally mediated functions. Possible bases for these effects are changes in local NMDA receptor function and/or changes in local inhibition, which might alter the optimal conditions for experience-dependent induction of intrahippocampal plasticity. This preparation may be useful for studying the mechanisms of mnemonic dysfunction associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and may offer unique insights into the mechanisms underlying normal hippocampal function.",
