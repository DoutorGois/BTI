     "AB": "Ionizing radiations can induce oxidative stress on target tissues, acting mainly through reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aim of this work was to investigate if 17-beta-estradiol (betaE) was able to prevent hippocampal-related behavioral and biochemical changes induced by neonatal ionizing radiation exposure and to elucidate a potential neuroprotective mechanism. Male Wistar rats were irradiated with 5 Gy of X-rays between 24 and 48 h after birth. A subset of rats was subcutaneously administered with successive injections of betaE or 17-alpha-estradiol (alphaE), prior and after irradiation. Rats were subjected to different behavioral tasks to evaluate habituation and associative memory as well as anxiety levels. Hippocampal ROS levels and protein kinase C (PKC) activity were also assessed. Results show that although betaE was unable to prevent radiation-induced hippocampal PKC activity changes, most behavioral abnormalities were reversed. Moreover, hippocampal ROS levels in betaE-treated irradiated rats approached control values. In addition, alphaE administered to irradiated animals was effective in preventing radiation-induced alterations. In conclusion, betaE was able to counteract behavioral and biochemical changes induced in irradiated animals, probably acting through an antioxidant mechanism.",
