     "AB": "The present study was focused to characterize the effects of intrahippocampal application of R-verapamil, a P-glycoprotein blocker, and High Frequency Electrical Stimulation (HFS) at 130 Hz, on seizure susceptibility and extracellular concentrations of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in hippocampus of kindled rats with drug-resistant seizures. Fully kindled rats classified in responsive and non-responsive to phenytoin were used for this purpose. In contrast with responsive animals, non-responsive rats showed lower afterdischarge threshold (ADT) values in pre-kindling conditions and required less number of kindling trials to achieve the kindled state. Once the animals attained the kindled state, both epileptic groups presented high glutamate and low GABA interictal release, effect more evident in non-responsive rats. In hippocampus of responsive animals, GABA levels demonstrated two increases at 120 and 240 min after the ictal event, a situation no detected for non-responsive rats. Kindled animals receiving hippocampal HFS showed augmented ADT, an effect associated with enhanced GABA release in responsive rats. Intrahippocampal perfusion of R-verapamil (5 mM) decreased the seizure susceptibility (high ADT values), enhanced the interictal GABA release and the postictal levels of glutamate and GABA in responsive and non-responsive rats. It is conclude that alterations of glutamate and GABA release in the epileptic hippocampus of non-responsive animals resemble those found in hippocampus of patients with refractory TLE. In addition, intrahippocampal application of HFS and R-verapamil modifies the amino acid release and reduces the seizure susceptibility of both, responsive and non-responsive rats.",
