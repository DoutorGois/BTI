     "AB": "Background: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a crucial signaling molecule with a wide range of physiological functions. Previously, we confirmed that stress-induced depression is accompanied with disturbance of H2S generation in hippocampus. The present work attempted to investigate the inhibitory effect of H2S on chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depressive-like behaviors and the underlying mechanism. Methods: We established the rat model of chronic unpredictable mild stress to simulate depression. Open field test, forced swim test, and tail suspension test were used to assess depressive-like behaviors. The expression of Sirt-1 and three marked proteins related to endoplasmic reticulum stress (GRP-78, CHOP, and cleaved caspase-12) were detected by western blot. Results: We found that chronic unpredictable mild stress-exposed rats exhibit depression-like behavior responses, including significantly increased immobility time in the forced swim test and tail suspension test, and decreased climbing time and swimming time in the forced swim test. In parallel, chronic unpredictable mild stress-exposed rats showed elevated levels of hippocampal endoplasmic reticulum stress and reduced levels of Sirt-1. However, NaHS (a donor of H2S) not only alleviated chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depressive-like behaviors and hippocampal endoplasmic reticulum stress, but it also increased the expression of hippocampal Sirt-1 in chronic unpredictable mild stress-exposed rats. Furthermore, Sirtinol, an inhibitor of Sirt-1, reversed the protective effects of H2S against chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depression-like behaviors and hippocampal endoplasmic reticulum stress. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that H2S has an antidepressant potential, and the underlying mechanism is involved in the inhibition of hippocampal endoplasmic reticulum stress by upregulation of Sirt-1 in hippocampus. These findings identify H2S as a novel therapeutic target for depression.",
