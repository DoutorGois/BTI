     "AB": "We studied 328 complex partial seizures (CPS) in 63 consecutive patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent scalp electroencephalography/video monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and surgery. The initial ictal discharge (IID), defined as the first sustained electrical seizure pattern localized to the surgical site, was determined. If the IID was rhythmic waves, the median frequency was measured. To determine if IID frequency correlates with hippocampal atrophy (HA) or sclerosis (HS), hippocampal volume ratios (HVRs) were measured (n = 52) or assessed visually (n = 11) on MRI, and mesial temporal histopathology specimens (n = 22) were graded for HS. Sixteen patients (25%) had no or mild HA (HVR = 0.78-1.02), and 47 patients (75%) had moderate-to-marked unilateral (HVR = 0.33-0.76), or bilateral, HA. Theta frequency IIDs were significantly more commonly associated with moderate-to-marked HA than were delta IIDs. Theta frequency IIDs occurred in 19% of patients with mild or no HA, and 79% of patients with moderate-to-marked HA; delta IIDs occurred in 63% of patients with little to no HA, and 13% of those with moderate-to-marked HA. In addition, the median IID frequency inversely correlated with HVR and directly correlated with HS severity. In conclusion, faster frequency rhythmic IIDs during temporal lobe CPS correlate with greater degrees of ipsilateral HA on MRI, and higher grades of HS.",
