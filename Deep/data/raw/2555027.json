     "AB": "Bath application of muscimol (10-20 microM) to hippocampal slices obtained from rats on postnatal days 10-15 produced epileptiform activity in the form of multiple population spikes in 20% of slices tested, concurrent with marked disinhibition. The disinhibition occurred in nearly 100% of cases tested at muscimol concentrations that produced epileptiform activity. Paired pulse analysis of GABAergic recurrent inhibition revealed a muscimol-induced disinhibitory effect involving a decrease in maximum possible inhibition. Spontaneous and antidromically elicited inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) recorded intracellularly were suppressed by muscimol. Current-voltage analysis of the recurrent IPSPs suggests that muscimol acted at a number of sites to produce disinhibition. The input conductance of the postsynaptic pyramidal cell increased due to muscimol, creating a current shunt which likely decreased the efficacy of synaptic currents. Muscimol also caused a decrease in the conductance due to the IPSP as well as a shift in the depolarizing direction of the equilibrium potential of the IPSP. The data indicate that muscimol, a GABAA agonist, can produce disinhibition resulting from the multiple consequences of its action. We conclude that the physiologic consequences of GABAA agonist treatment are complex. On the other hand, neurons are likely to be inhibited by a tonic increase in membrane conductance. However, since recurrent inhibition is simultaneously compromised, excitatory vollies of sufficient intensity may overcome the tonic inhibition and produce a hyperexcitable state. In some cases, this disinhibition may induce epileptiform activity. These observations are relevant in light of the proposed use of GABA agonists clinically to control seizures.",
