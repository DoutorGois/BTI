     "AB": "The effect of Abeta25-35 peptide, in its fibrillar and non-fibrillar forms, on ganglioside expression in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures was investigated. Gangliosides were endogenously labeled with D-[1-C(14)] galactose and results showed that Abeta25-35 affected ganglioside expression, depending on the peptide aggregation state, that is, fibrillar Abeta25-35 caused an increase in GM3 labeling and a reduction in GD1b labeling, whereas the non-fibrillar form was able to enhance GM1 expression. Interestingly, GM1 exhibited a neuroprotective effect in this organotypic model, since pre-treatment of the hippocampal slices with GM1 10 muM was able to prevent the toxicity triggered by the fibrillar Abeta25-35, when measured by propidium iodide uptake protocol. With the purpose of further investigating a possible mechanism of action, we analyzed the effect of GM1 treatment (1, 6, 12 and 24h) upon the Abeta-induced alterations on GSK3beta dephosphorylation/activation state. Results demonstrated an important effect after 24-h incubation, with GM1 preventing the Abeta-induced dephosphorylation (activation) of GSK3beta, a signaling pathway involved in apoptosis triggering and neuronal death in models of Alzheimer's disease. Taken together, present results provide a new and important support for ganglioside participation in development of Alzheimer's disease experimental models and suggest a protective role for GM1 in Abeta-induced toxicity. This may be useful for designing new therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's treatment.",
