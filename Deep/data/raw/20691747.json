     "AB": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is characterized by the progressive deterioration of intellectual/cognitive function following surgery. It has been suggested that the senile brain, which characteristically expresses higher levels of central proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, is more susceptible to additional insult following surgery. The authors of this study investigated the expression of central cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha and hippocampal glial cell activation in aged and adult rats following partial hepatectomy. Cognitive function was assessed in a reversal-learning version of the Morris water maze (MWM) before and after surgery. Hippocampal pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha and glial cell activation markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S100beta were measured at each time point; CD200 and CD200R were also measured to explore potential mechanisms of glial cell activation. Surgical trauma resulted in impairments in distance and latency only on postoperative day 1 (p<0.001, respectively) in adult rats. Aged rats exhibited impairments on day 1 (p<0.001) that persisted until postoperative day 3 (p=0.002 and p=0.001, respectively). All significant impairments paralleled upregulated cytokine IL-1beta and IL-6 expression. Immunohistochemistry assay further showed more hippocampal glial cell activation in aged rats compared to that in adults. Overall, these findings suggest that surgical trauma, rather than anesthesia, resulted in cognitive function impairment potentiated by aging. Hippocampal pro-inflammatory cytokines and glial cell activation might mediate trauma-induced POCD.",
