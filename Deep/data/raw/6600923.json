Ancestors were traced through eight generations, and 51 members were examined at the National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Md. The pedigree is consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. The effect of interrelatedness among some parents of affected individuals is unknown. In contrast to other studies, there was not an increased incidence of Down's syndrome, hematologic malignancy, or preponderance of affected females.",
