     "AB": "There has been direct evidence of gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor modification during status epilepticus. Neuropeptides galanin and neuropeptide Y were demonstrated to play a role in terminating status epilepticus. Many of the CA3 pyramidal neurons destined to die as a consequence of status epilepticus were demonstrated to diminish expression of the GluR2 subunit of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid receptors. It was demonstrated that the pattern of cell loss due to status epilepticus is distinct in immature pups compared with adult rats. The genetic basis for susceptibility to neuronal loss during status epilepticus was described. There was increasing evidence of unique receptors and ion channels in the epileptic brain. The molecular studies of epileptic gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors present on dentate granule cells of rats with temporal lobe epilepsy revealed altered gene and receptor expression before onset of recurrent spontaneous seizures. They also revealed insertion of new gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors in the inhibitory synapses present on soma and proximal dendrites of dentate granule cells.",
