     "AB": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the central nervous system neuroimmune and inflammatory responses during the prodromal phase of the acute irradiation syndrome in rat brains after partial-body exposure (head-protected) and to investigate the potential neural signalling pathways from the irradiated periphery to the non-irradiated brain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included four groups of rats: one irradiated group and one sham irradiated group, each containing non-vagotomized and vagotomized rats. In vagotomized rat groups, the subdiaphragmatic vagal section surgery was carried out 45 days before the irradiation exposure. The rats were partial-body irradiated with the head shielded with (60)Co gamma-rays to a dose of 15 Gy. They were sacrificed 6 h after the end of exposure. The hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus and cortex were then collected, and the concentrations of IL-1beta, TNFalpha and IL-6 in each were measured by ELISA assays. RESULTS: Six hours after irradiation, IL-1beta levels had increased in the hypothalamus, thalamus and hippocampus, and TNFalpha and IL-6 levels had increased significantly in the hypothalamus. Vagotomy before irradiation prevented these responses. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that the hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus and cortex react rapidly to peripheral irradiation by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators. The results also show that the vagus nerve is one of the major ascending pathways for rapid signalling to the brain with respect to partial body irradiation.",
