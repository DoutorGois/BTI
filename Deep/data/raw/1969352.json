     "AB": "Phosphorylation of the neuron-specific substrate of protein kinase C (PKC), B-50 (GAP-43), was studied parallel with noradrenaline release in rat brain synaptosomes. Both could be evoked by treating the synaptosomes with high K+ or veratridine. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate enhanced depolarization-induced B-50 phosphorylation and noradrenaline release. To investigate the involvement of PKC-mediated B-50 phosphorylation in noradrenaline release, we applied a variety of kinase inhibitors. Prior to measuring the effects of these inhibitors in intact synaptosomes, we determined their effectivity and specificity in a membrane phosphorylation assay. H-7 most specifically inhibited PKC-dependent phosphorylation, whereas calmidazolium inhibited calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation. Polymyxin B affected both protein kinase systems. Only polymyxin B effectively inhibited noradrenaline release in the intact synaptosomes. We conclude that PKC as well as calmodulin-dependent processes are important for the release event. Data are discussed in view of the presumed function of B-50 as a calmodulin-binding protein.",
