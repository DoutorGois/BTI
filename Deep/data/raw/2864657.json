     "AB": "Somatostatin receptor-binding sites have been visualized by autoradiography in the rat central nervous system and the pituitary using the [Tyr3] derivative of the stable octapeptide somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995, code named 204-090 (sequence in text), which has been shown to label specifically high-affinity somatostatin receptors in brain homogenates. Receptors are particularly concentrated in the deeper layers of the cerebral cortex and large areas of the limbic system are rich in somatostatin receptors, in particular the hippocampus (CA1, CA2, dentate gyrus), most amygdaloid nuclei, the medial habenula and the septum. Parts of the olfactory, visual and auditory, as well as visceral and somatic sensory systems are heavily labelled, in particular the anterior olfactory nucleus and tubercle, the superior and inferior colliculi, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord and the spinal trigeminal nucleus. It is of interest that the central grey and locus coeruleus are also substantially labelled with [125I]204-090. Striatum has moderate amounts of somatostatin receptors, distributed in a patchy and heterogeneous way. Cerebellum and substantia nigra are virtually devoid of somatostatin receptors. The described receptors are likely to represent the molecular target for a variety of pharmacological actions of somatostatin in the central nervous system and they emphasize the role played by somatostatin as a neuropeptide in this organ.",
