     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of acupuncture for delaying aging. METHODS: Using the senescence accelerated mouse pattern SAMP10 and the normal aging mice SAMR1 as models and applying RT-PCR and digoxin (DIG)-labeled Northern blot technique to observe expressions of NF-E2, YB-1, LRG47 genes in the forebrain, cortex and hippocampus in a 8-month old SAMR1 control group, a 8-month old SAMP10 control group, a 8-month old SAMP10 acupuncture group and a 8-month old SAMP10 non-point stimulation group. RESULTS: In the SAMP10 control group, the expressions of NF-E2, YB-1 and LRG47 were down-regulated in the forebrain, cortex and hippocampus, and after acupuncture they were up-regulated and tended to normal. CONCLUSION: The brain aging of the SAMP10 mice is related with abnormal expressions of NF-E2, YB-1 and LRG47 genes; and acupuncture can regulate the expressions of NF-E2, YB-1 and LRG47 genes, strengthening the functions of erythrocyte series, increasing the proliferation of cells and enhancing the cellular immune function in anti-bacteria, hence delaying aging.",
