     "AB": "Herein, we investigated the effect Salvia sahendica (S. sahenica) extract, an endemic plant of Iran on the improvement of learning and memory deficits in amyloid beta-(Abeta) injected rats. In order to test this hypothesis, we pretreated rats with S. sahendica 1 week prior to Abeta injection, then performed Morris water maze test. Besides, we studied the molecular factors involved in neuronal plasticity and apoptosis such as Ca(2+)/cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), c-fos, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3. Moreover, we used Terminal-Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) technique to detect apoptosis in the hippocampus of Abeta-injected rats. Results showed that S. sahendica could improve learning and memory in the behavioral test. The results of molecular section showed that CREB, c-fos and PGC-1alpha levels attenuated in the Abeta-injected rats in comparison with control group. These decreases were attenuated 58, 62, 57% respectively in S. sahendica-pretreated rats. This dietary supplementation could decrease apoptotic factors including caspase-3, PARP and TUNEL positive cells as well. Collectively, the present result from behavioral testing and biochemical analysis demonstrated that S. sahendica treatment for 1 week protected against apoptosis and memory deficits in Abeta-injected rats.",
