     "AB": "The influence of transient bilateral carotid artery occlusion time, core body temperature regulation and post-operative survival time was examined on delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal subregions of Mongolian gerbils. A simple and rapid histologically based scoring system was used. A carotid artery occlusion time of 5 min with stabile core body temperature at 37.5-38.0 degrees C and a post-operative survival time of 4 days was sufficient to induce a reproducible and almost total neuronal damage in the hippocampal subfields. Furthermore, the use of gerbils with ages varying from 50 to 100 days did not markedly influence the development of the neuronal damage although the variation in the severity of the damage seemed to decrease with age. The addition of a drop of room tempered (21-22 degrees C) isotonic water, to avoid adherence between the clips and the carotid artery, reduced neuronal damage in some animals.",
