     "AB": "Glucocorticoids (GCs), adrenal steroids released during stress, can damage the hippocampus outright and increase hippocampal vulnerability to metabolic insults. Changes in ATP levels were measured in response to aglycemia and to cyanide in cultured hippocampal neurons that had been exposed to high- and low-GC conditions. GCs did not depress baseline ATP levels but did accelerate the rate of the decline in ATP concentrations observed during the metabolic insults. These results support the hypothesis that GCs increase neuronal vulnerability by disrupting cellular metabolism and agree with similar findings in hippocampal astrocytes.",
