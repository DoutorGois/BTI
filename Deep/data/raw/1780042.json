     "AB": "Previous experiments have shown that anxiolytic drugs reduce the frequency of hippocampal rhythmic slow activity, induced by high frequency stimulation of the reticular formation and flatten the function relating threshold septal stimulation to the frequency of driven rhythmic slow activity. All of the drugs involved are known to augment GABAergic transmission. The present experiments investigated the effects of the novel anxiolytic compound buspirone which, unlike conventional anxiolytics, does not interact with GABA, yet is a clinically effective anxiolytic. Buspirone (0.156-40 mg/kg, i.p.) was found to reduce the frequency of reticular-elicited rhythmic slow activity, in a similar manner to chlordiazepoxide (0.019-20 mg/kg, i.p.). Buspirone did not change the linearity of the voltage-frequency function. Buspirone (10 mg/kg, i.p.) also altered the threshold for septal driving of rhythmic slow activity, in a similar manner to classical anxiolytics. The combination of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg, i.p.) with corticosterone (0.2 mg, s.c.) removed the minor differences between buspirone and chlordiazepoxide in both the septal and reticular tests. These results show that buspirone altered the control of rhythmic slow activity in the hippocampus, in a manner which appeared functionally equivalent to other anxiolytics but which depends on mechanisms which are likely to be neurally and pharmacologically distinct from those of other anxiolytic drugs.",
