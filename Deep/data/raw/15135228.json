     "AB": "ATF-3 is a member of the ATF superfamily of transcription factors and is strongly associated with episodes of cellular stress. We demonstrate an association between increases in ATF-3 protein and resistance to exitotoxic cell death in vivo. Intra-hippocampal injection of kainic acid elicited a robust increase in endogenous ATF-3 within kainate-resistant cells of the dentate gyrus, while overexpression of exogenous ATF-3 was found to protect vulnerable CA3 neurons from the same insult. These results suggest a positive contribution to neuronal survival in the context of stress-induced death, and support an anti-apoptotic role for ATF-3 in the brain.",
