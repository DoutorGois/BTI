     "AB": "Polyamines were implicated as either neurotoxic or neuroprotective in several models of stroke. Spermine augments the excitotoxicity mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor because this receptor is activated at micromolar spermine concentrations. However, at higher concentrations, spermine could be neuroprotective because it blocks the NMDA receptor and voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels. In this work, acute hippocampal slices were exposed to 1 mM spermine and either 10 min of anoxia or 0.5 mM NMDA. The percent recovery of population spikes was the measure of neuroprotection. One millimolar spermine was robustly neuroprotective; however, 0.1 mM spermine and 1 mM putrescine were not. The neuroprotective concentration of spermine was higher than the physiological concentration of free spermine. However, during an excitotoxic episode, extracellular Ca(2+) is decreased, enabling the inhibitory activity of lower spermine concentration. In addition, several noxious stimuli trigger the release of intracellular spermine and could raise local levels of spermine. Therefore, it is possible that spermine has a neuroprotective role in vivo.",
