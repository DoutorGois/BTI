     "AB": "Mossy fiber-derived giant spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents have been suggested to be large enough to generate action potentials in postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neurons. Here we report on the functional roles of presynaptic GABA(A) receptors on excitatory terminals in contributing to spontaneous glutamatergic transmission to CA3 neurons. In mechanically dissociated rat hippocampal CA3 neurons with adherent presynaptic nerve terminals, spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents were recorded using conventional whole-cell patch clamp recordings. In most recordings, unusually large spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents up to 500 pA were observed. These large spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents were highly sensitive to group II metabotropic glutamate receptor activation, and were still observed even after the blockade of voltage-dependent Na(+) or Ca(2+) channels. Exogenously applied muscimol (0.1-3 microM) significantly increased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents including the large ones. This facilitatory effect of muscimol was completely inhibited in the presence of 10 microM 6-imino-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1(6H)-pyridazinebutanoic acid HBr, a specific GABA(A) receptor antagonist. Pharmacological data suggest that activation of presynaptic GABA(A) receptors directly depolarizes glutamatergic terminals resulting in the facilitation of spontaneous glutamate release. In the current-clamp condition, a subset of large spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials triggered action potentials, and muscimol greatly increased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potential-triggered action potentials in postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neurons. The results suggest that presynaptic GABA(A) receptors on glutamatergic terminals play an important role in the excitability of CA3 neurons as well as in the presynaptic modulation of glutamatergic transmission onto hippocampal CA3 neurons.",
