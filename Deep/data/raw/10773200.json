     "AB": "Intracellular assessments of the physiological actions of cannabinoid receptor agonists and antagonists on adult hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in the in vitro slice preparation were performed using current clamp and conventional sharp-electrode intracellular recording procedures. Several manipulations were performed to delineate putative currents and conductance mechanisms affected by the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN-2). This compound produced a tonic hyperpolarization of the pyramidal cell membrane that was bicuculline sensitive, reversed by changing the chloride gradient, and abolished by the addition of TTX to the bathing medium. Instantaneous membrane input resistance, computed from hyperpolarizing current pulses (peak R(in)) was also reduced significantly in the presence of WIN-2 and was accompanied by enhancement of a superimposed slow depolarization that reduced steady-state R(in) (SSR(in)); both effects were resistant to barium. Intracellular perfusion of cesium acetate (CsAc) and the sodium/potassium channel blocker, QX314, each blocked the effect of WIN-2 on R(in) and SSR(in). WIN-2 also reduced input resistance calculated from depolarizing current injections (R(d)). This effect was also blocked by atropine, as well as media containing TTX or low Ca(2+). Each of the above effects of WIN-2 was blocked by the cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR141716A, showing a dependence on CB1 cannabinoid receptors. Several known pre- and postsynaptic processes in adult pyramidal cells are discussed which could be responsible for these cannabinoid-produced changes in membrane resistances.",
