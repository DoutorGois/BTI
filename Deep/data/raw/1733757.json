Pyramidal cell densities from five patients who died following status epilepticus were compared with five normal controls and five controls matched for age, hypoxia/ischemia, previous epilepsy, and alcohol abuse. Neuronal densities were greatest in the normal control group and least in patients with status epilepticus. Significant reductions were identified in Sommer's sector (prosubiculum and CA1) as well as in CA3 when compared to normal controls.",
