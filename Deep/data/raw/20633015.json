     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The present work aimed to investigate whether and through which mechanisms selective alpha7 and alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor (nAChR) agonists stimulate endogenous glutamate (GLU) and aspartate (ASP) release in rat hippocampus. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rat hippocampal synaptosomes were purified on Percoll gradients and superfused in vitro to study endogenous GLU and ASP release. The synaptosomes were superfused with selective alpha7 and alpha4beta2 nAChR agonists and antagonists. The excitatory amino acid (EAA) content of the samples of superfusate was determined by HPLC after pre-column derivatization and separation on a chromatographic column coupled with fluorimetric detection. KEY RESULTS: Choline (Ch), a selective alpha7 receptor agonist, elicited a significant release of both GLU and ASP which was blocked by the alpha7 receptor antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA), but was unaltered by the alpha4beta2 receptor antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE). The stimulant effect of Ch was strongly reduced in a Ca(2+) -free medium, was not inhibited by Cd(2+) and tetrodotoxin (TTX), but was antagonized by dantrolene, xestospongin C and thapsigargin. 5-Iodo-A-85380 dihydrochloride (5IA85380), a selective alpha4beta2 receptor agonist, elicited EAA release in a DHbetaE-sensitive, MLA-insensitive fashion. The 5IA85380-evoked release was dependent on extracellular Ca(2+) , blocked by Cd(2+) and TTX, but unaffected by dantrolene. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our study shows for the first time that rat hippocampal synaptosomes possess alpha7 and alpha4beta2 nAChR subtypes, which can enhance the release of endogenous GLU and ASP via two distinct mechanisms of action. These results extend our knowledge of the nicotinic modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus.",
