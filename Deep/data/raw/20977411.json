     "AB": "Amyloidbeta-protein (Abeta) assembly into toxic fibrillar structures is seminal in development of senile plaques, the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Blocking this process could have a therapeutic value. beta-sheet breaker peptides (betaSBP) decrease Abeta fibrillogenesis and neurotoxicity by preventing or dissolving misfolded Abeta aggregates. The present study investigated the effects of betaSBPs on Abeta40-related neuropathology, memory impairment in 8-armed radial maze and expression of Abeta40 in brain and serum. Abeta40 was injected into amygdaloid nucleus followed 8 days later by octapeptidebetaSBPs 15-22, 16-23 and 17-24. Abeta40 was detected not only in amygdala, but also in serum. Abeta40 induced cellular changes in amygdala and additionally in hippocampus. Abeta40 decreased correct choices, whereas increased errors (both number of arms revisited and total number of revisits) and latency of completing the maze test. The betaSBPs decreased Abeta40-induced pathological changes, memory impairment and Abeta40 expression in serum. The betaSBP15-22 distinctively decreased the total errors on day 14. The present results show that octapeptide betaSBPs corrected Abeta40-induced memory impairment, and support investigation of betaSBPs as a promising treatment of diseases characterized by neurodegeneration and memory impairment such as Alzheimer's disease.",
