     "AB": "The specific binding of [3H]hemicholinium-3 ([3H]HCh-3) and high-affinity [3H]choline uptake were measured in rats with status epilepticus induced by lithium and pilocarpine. The specific binding of [3H]HCh-3 in cortex and hippocampus from rats with status epilepticus increased to 2- to 3-fold of control while the striatal [3H]HCh-3 binding increased minimally. Scatchard analyses revealed that the observed changes resulted from an increase in Bmax of [3H]HCh-3 binding. High-affinity [3H]choline uptake remained unchanged. These results further implicate phospholipase A2 in the regulation of [3H]HCh-3 binding sites.",
