     "AB": "The effect of forskolin on the excitatory amino acid-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP was examined in hippocampal preparations of the guinea pig. Forskolin at concentrations of 0.1-10 microM remarkably enhanced the stimulatory effects of histamine and adenosine, whereas it markedly attenuated the stimulation induced by cysteine sulfinate, an excitatory amino acid. Forskolin reduced the maximal response to cysteine sulfinate without affecting the apparent ED50. At a concentration of 1 microM, forskolin also inhibited the stimulatory effects of glutamate, N-methyl-DL-aspartate, and veratridine without affecting those of kainate and quisqualate. Pretreatment of the slices with 0.1 mM N-ethylmaleimide partially prevented the attenuation by forskolin of cysteine sulfinate-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP without affecting the stimulation induced by cysteine sulfinate. Forskolin at concentrations of less than 1 microM did not affect GTP-stimulated activity and Cl- -dependent activity of adenylate cyclase of the hippocampal membranes.",
