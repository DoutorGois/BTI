     "AB": "Hippocampal theta activity, a high-amplitude, slow (4-12 Hz) oscillation that occurs in a variety of behavioral contexts, is thought to emerge in infant rats only after 1 week of age. However, we report here that unanesthetized 2- and 4-d-old rats with electrodes implanted in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and tested in thermoneutral conditions exhibit theta activity. Moreover, this infant theta is characterized by the same neuronal bursting pattern and power spectrum that characterize theta in adults. Simultaneous measures of behavior and neck muscle tone indicated that bouts of theta occurred predominantly during periods of muscle atonia (with or without concurrent myoclonic twitching), indicative of REM sleep. In contrast, sharp waves were accompanied by startles (i.e., simultaneous and vigorous movement of all four limbs). These findings underscore the need for comprehensive in vivo investigations of the pharmacology, neural substrates, and behavioral correlates of hippocampal field activity in neonates.",
