     "AB": "The aim of this study was to compare the seizure outcome of two different types of epilepsy surgery, selective amygdalohippocampectomy (AHE) and anterior temporal lobectomy (ATLE) in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. We included 114 patients who had mesio-temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis or gliosis on histology. Patients had ATLE if the non-dominant hemisphere was affected or if the whole temporal lobe was atrophic. Patients had AHE if the dominant hemisphere was affected. Standardized seizure outcome at 1 year following surgery was used. Overall 40% of the 114 patients who had temporal lobe epilepsy surgery were seizure-free at 1-year (Engel's class Ia). A good outcome (Engel's classes I and II) was significantly more frequent in ATLE than in AHE. (66% and 44%, respectively, P = 0.03). ATLE had a better seizure outcome than AHE.",
