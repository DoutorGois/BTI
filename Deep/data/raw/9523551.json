     "AB": "A human hippocampus cDNA library was screened with a probe obtained from degenerate RT-PCR aimed at P2Y-homologous sequences. A positive clone, designated hip4, was identified containing an open reading frame of 1,020 bp that had been previously detected in a published genomic clone called R12. Subsequent screening of a human fetal brain cDNA library yielded a splice variant with a 1,104-bp open reading frame, which was named fb1. Both variants display the seven-transmembrane topology that is typical for G protein-coupled receptors. Probing a human multitissue northern blot revealed two brain-specific transcripts of 2.3 and 6.3 kb, respectively. Northern blot analyses with specific fragments confirmed that the two transcripts are generated by alternative polyadenylation yielding two different 3' untranslated regions. A genomic clone from the corresponding gene was isolated and mapped to human chromosomal band 2q21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.",
