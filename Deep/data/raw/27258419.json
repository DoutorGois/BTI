     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The transgenic mice models overexpressing human p25 contribute greatly to the in vivo neurotoxic mechanism of p25 in neurodegenerative diseases. However, it is time-consuming to manipulate existing transgenic mice models. OBJECTIVE: Here we aim to establish a novel mouse model of neurodegeneration by overexpressing p25 mediated by recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV9). METHODS: AAV9-GFP-p25 encoding GFP-fused p25 driven by synapsin promoter, and the control, AAV9-GFP, were delivered in mice by tail-vein injection. Assessments of p25 expression, neurodegenerative pathology, and behavioral changes were performed. RESULTS: GFP expression was detected by in vivo imaging as early as one week after virus injection. Notably, widespread expression of p25 was obviously found in cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum in AAV9-GFP-p25 mice. Moreover, decreased hippocampus volumes in AAV9-GFP-p25 mice were detected by 7T MRI examination about one month after injection. Further, these AAV9-GFP-p25 mice exhibited progressive memory impairment from three-month to six-month after virus injection. At last, hyperphosphorylated tau, neurofibrillary tangles, activated astrocytes and microglia cells were elevated in these p25 mice at about six months after virus delivery. However, amyloid-beta plaques, overt neuronal loss, and apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex were not significantly induced by AAV9-mediated p25 overexpression. CONCLUSION: The AAV9-mediated p25 overexpression mouse model, which is a practical model exhibiting neurodegeneration-like pathological and behavioral changes, provides an easier and time-saving method to explore the functions of p25 in vivo, as well as an alternative tool for development of drugs against neurotoxic of p25.",
