     "AB": "Cultured neurons offer many advantages over a slice preparation for whole-cell patch-clamp studies, such as better control over the environment and space clamp control. However, heterogeneous cultures of neurons present problems in distinguishing the cell type from which recordings are made. The present study uses correlations with data obtained in the hippocampal slice preparation to determine the feasibility of \"identifying\" different neuronal subtypes in cultures obtained from the superior region of postnatal two- to 13-day-old rat hippocampus. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording in the current-clamp mode after 24-96 h in culture was used to determine if the action potential duration would be a useful criterion in distinguishing cell types. Single action potentials were elicited by a 0.1-0.2 ms, 2-4 nA depolarizing pulse. The average membrane potential and input resistance were -46.8+/-1.2 mV (n = 58) and 576+/-56 Mohms (n = 57), respectively. A frequency distribution of the action potential duration measured at half-maximal amplitude showed four distinct groups of neurons (group 1, 1.36+/-0.03 ms, n = 17; group 2, 2.19+/-0.05 ms, n = 20; group 3, 3.17+/-0.10 ms, n = 16; group 4, 4.36+/-0.13, n = 5). Based on correlations with previous studies using intracellular recording in identified cells in slices, the data suggest that group 1 represents basket cells, group 2 represents vertical cells, group 3 represents a combination of stellate cells and pyramidal cells, and group 4 represents another unidentified class of cells. Further analysis of the fast afterhyperpolarization allows distinction between pyramidal cells and stellate cells in group 3. In contrast to the interneurons in a slice preparation, these cells offer good voltage control and environmental control. Future studies will record from these cells in current-clamp mode to quickly characterize the action potential before switching to voltage-clamp recording to characterize the currents present in the different types of interneurons.",
