     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the characteristics of metabolic changes in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder through 1H-MRS in neuroanatomical circuit comparing with age-matches controls. METHODS: Fifty patients with post-traumatic stress disorder and 50 gender-and age-matched normal controls were involved. The neurochemical abnormalities including the levels of choline (Cho)/creatine(Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr were measured respectively in hippocampus and the anterior cingulate gyrus with three-dimension 1H-proton spectroscopy(3D 1H-MRS). RESULTS: The values of NAA/Cr ratios in hippocampus and the anterior cingulate gyrus were significant lower in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder(1.71+/-0.32, left 1.58+/-0.29, right 1.55+/-0.31) than that in controls(2.24+/-0.41, left 1.98+/-0.27, right 2.02+/-0.36)(P<0.05), but the values of Cho/Cr in hippocampus(left 1.64+/-0.23, right 1.66+/-0.34) were no significant with that of controls (left 1.48+/-0.29, right 1.54+/-0.38). Values of Cho/Cr in cingulate gyrus were significant higher in post-traumatic stress disorder patients (1.88+/-0.44) than that in controls (1.37.+/-0.32) (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate some special neurochemical and histological structure changes in post-traumatic stress disorder patients, which might occurre earlier in anterior cingulate gyrusthe than in hippocampus.",
