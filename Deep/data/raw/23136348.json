     "AB": "Addition of newly generated neurons into mature neural circuits in the adult CNS responds to changes in neurotransmitter levels and is tightly coupled to the activity of specific brain regions. This postnatal neurogenesis contributes to plasticity of the olfactory bulb and hippocampus and is thought to play a role in learning and memory, context and odor discrimination, as well as perceptual learning. While acetylcholine plays an important role in odor discrimination and perceptual learning, its role in adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb has not been elucidated. In this study, I have examined the functional expression of nAChRs in progenitor cells of the rostral migratory stream (RMS) in the adult olfactory bulb of mice. I show that most of these cells in the RMS exhibit large nAChR-mediated calcium transients upon application of acetylcholine (ACh). Unlike in the hippocampus, the predominant functional nAChRs on progenitor cells are of alpha3beta4 subtype. Interestingly, functional receptor expression is lost once progenitor cells mature, and are incorporated into the granule cell layer. Instead, nAChRs are now expressed on some presynaptic terminals and modulate glutamate release onto granule cells. My results imply that ACh is a part of the permissive niche and likely plays a role in development of progenitor cells.",
