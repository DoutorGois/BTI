     "AB": "Exposure of the fetus to corticosteroid during brain development has been suggested to cause permanent change in brain structure and has been associated with long term cognitive, behavioral and emotional impairment. We evaluated the effect of perinatal corticosteroid, at a dose similar to that which human fetuses are exposed, on cerebral cortex, corpus collosum, hippocampus, dentate gyrus and amygdala in a rat model. Rat pups were given betamethasone at day 1 (P1). Brain sections from the rat pups at postnatal day 45 (P45) were then analyzed. No differences were noted in the volumes of cerebral cortex, corpus collosum, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, or three nuclei of the amygdala compared to the control and sham groups. We concluded that a single course of betamethasone, at a comparable dose to that which the human fetus is exposed in clinical practice, had no effect on these regional brain volumes at this stage of development.",
