     "AB": "Central cholinergic structures within the CD-1 mouse were evaluated by immunohistochemical visualization of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) using the monoclonal antibody AB8. Rostrally, cholinergic neurons were seen within the neostriatum, medial septal nucleus (Ch1), ventral (Ch2) and horizontal (Ch3) limb nuclei and nucleus basalis-substantia innominata complex (Ch4). Caudally, cholinergic neurons were seen in the cuneiformis-pedunculopontine nuclei (Ch5), lateral dorsal tegmental (Ch6) and parabigeminal (Ch8) nuclei as well as the medial habenular nucleus and cranial motor nuclei. Additional cholinergic perikarya were found in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. ChAT stained fibers were observed in the cerebral cortex and in many fiber fascicles.",
