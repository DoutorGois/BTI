     "AB": "Six sporadic cases of dementia with lobar atrophy and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (Pick's disease) could be separated into two groups on the basis of the involvement of subcortical structures, the distribution and the histochemical, immunochemical, and ultrastructural characteristics of the inclusions, and possibly the age at onset. The first group (classic) was characterized by predominantly cortical atrophy and the presence in the hippocampus and neocortex of argyrophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that reacted with a monoclonal antibody against neurofilament proteins and antitubulin antisera. Ultrastructurally the bodies were composed of straight fibrils of variable diameter, averaging 15 nm, and long-period constricted fibrils. The second group (generalized) showed subcortical as well as antibodies against neurofilaments and microtubules. Ultrastructurally the straight fibrils composing the bodies were coated with granular material, presumed to be derived from ribosomes. The generalized cases occurred in younger patients than did the classic cases in this series.",
