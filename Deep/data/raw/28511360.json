     "AB": "Vehicle emission is becoming one of the most important pollution sources because of the increase in vehicle population and activity in China. A more reasonable and complete vehicle emission inventory in Zhengzhou for the year 2013 was developed in this study. This inventory is suitable for local emission factors and vehicle kilometers of travel. Estimates show that the total carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), nitrogen oxide (NOX), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions were 291Gg, 35Gg, 106Gg, 6Gg, 7Gg, and 3Gg, respectively. Approximately 55% of CO and HC emissions were from light duty gasoline vehicles and normal gasoline motorcycles, whereas approximately 60% of NOX, PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 were from heavy duty diesel vehicles, heavy duty diesel trucks, and medium duty diesel trucks. The spatial distribution of emissions was allocated in grid cells based on a road network and traffic flows with a resolution of 1kmx1km at different road types and locations, which shows that the six aforementioned air pollutants have similar characteristics in administrative districts. Emissions are mainly concentrated on the central grid cells of each part and in good agreement with line sources. The spatial characteristics were compared at a resolution of 3kmx3km and in a population-based approach. The network approach yields better level estimates in this study. Meanwhile, the preliminary temporal profiles were also established for on-road mobile source.",
