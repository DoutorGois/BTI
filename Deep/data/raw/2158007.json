     "AB": "Nerve growth factor receptor, as recognized by the monoclonal antibody 192-IgG, was localized to multiple regions of the adult rat forebrain. Immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers were seen in both sensory and motor regions which are known to contain cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons. Specifically, nerve growth factor receptor immunoreactivity was present in cells lining the olfactory ventricle, rostral portion of the lateral ventricle, in basal forebrain nuclei, caudate putamen, globus pallidus, zona incerta and hypothalamus. Immunoreactive cells which were situated subpially along the olfactory ventricle and anterior portions of the lateral ventricle, and in the arcuate nucleus resembled neuroglia but could not definitively identified at the light microscopic level. Animals pretreated with intracerebroventricular colchicine displayed significantly increased nerve growth factor receptor immunoreactivity in all previously positive neurons and particularly in the medial preoptic area and ventral premammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus. In such animals, receptor immunoreactivity also appeared in previously non-immunoreactive cells of the hippocampal CA3 region and polymorph layer of the dentate gyrus as well as in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb. Nerve growth factor receptor-immunoreactive fibers and varicosities were seen in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, neocortex, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, olivary pretectal nucleus and hypothalamus. In most regions, such fiber-like immunoreactive structures likely represented axon terminals, although in some areas, neuroglial or extracellular localizations could not be excluded. In this context, diffuse, non-fibrillar receptor immunoreactivity occurred in the lateral habenular nucleus and medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract. Furthermore, intense nerve growth factor receptor immunoreactivity occurred along certain regions of the pial surface on the ventral surface of the brain. The distribution of nerve growth factor receptor-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in multiple sensory and motor nuclei suggests wide-spread influences of nerve growth factor throughout the adult rat forebrain. There is a high degree of overlap with regions containing choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity. However, significant disparities exist suggesting that certain nerve growth factor receptor-containing non-cholinergic neurons of the rat forebrain may also be affected by nerve growth factor.",
