     "AB": "The aim of this study was to assess the effect of four organic solvents (toluene, mesitylene, pseudocumene and hemimellitine) on the central nervous system (NCS) on the basis of changes in spontaneous EEG of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus functions occurring under conditions of acute exposure. Electrophysiological experiments were performed on rats with electrodes chronically implanted in the selected brain structures. The peripheral blood solvent concentrations were determined in rats operated without using gas chromatography combined with head space technique. Electrophysiological examinations revealed statistically significant quantitative changes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus electroencephalograms after i.p. injections of equimolar solvents. The relationship between changes in spontaneous EEG and solvent concentrations in the blood was indicated. It was found that the central nervous system is mostly affected by the solvent whose concentration in blood is lowest (hemimellitine).",
