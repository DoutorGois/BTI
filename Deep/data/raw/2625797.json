     "AB": "It appeared certain that we can quantify the rate of hippocampal atrophy by utilizing the sagittal cuts in tomo-pneumoencephalography. This is a reliable method to infer the side of the epileptogenic focus in temporal lobe epilepsy since a close correlation was disclosed between the side with more atrophic features of the hippocampus and that of the epileptogenic focus explored by depth EEG, in particular, in the mesial temporal focus group. On the other hand, it seems to be plausible that the hippocampal atrophy could be secondarily induced by epileptic discharges in the lateral temporal group. Namely, controversies dealing with the casual relationship of hippocampal atrophy should be discussed based on the epileptogenic focus localization in temporal lobe epilepsy.",
