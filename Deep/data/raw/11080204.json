     "AB": "We have recently isolated a 2.2-kb cDNA clone (1C5) from a human spinal cord cDNA library with partial identity to the 14-3-3 protein mRNA encoding the theta protein (YWHAQ). 14-3-3 protein transcripts are highly expressed in large projection neurones of the hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord and have been found to be significantly up-regulated in rat motor neurones following hypoglossal nerve axotomy. In this study we investigated whether the 1C5 transcript (YWHAQ) isolated from spinal cord was involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We found a significant up-regulation of 1C5 (YWHAQ) in lumbar spinal cord from patients with sporadic ALS compared with controls, with the highest levels of expression being found in individuals with predominant lower motor neurone involvement. A 6-bp tandem repeat in the 5'-untranslated region of the gene was found to be polymorphic, but no significant association with disease was found following genomic analysis of this region. The localisation of 1C5 (YWHAQ) to chromosome 2 was determined and coincides with that reported for clone HS1 (EMBL accession no. X57347). These results show the marked up-regulation of the 14-3-3 isoform (YWHAQ) in ALS spinal cord and indicate the involvement of a potential 14-3-3-mediated survival pathway in the pathogenesis of ALS.",
