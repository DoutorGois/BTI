     "AB": "A study was performed to evaluate changes in serum prolactin levels after simple and complex partial seizures, and to identify which specific anatomical structures must be involved in seizures for postictal elevation of prolactin levels to occur. Seventy-eight seizures were studied in patients with electrodes implanted bilaterally into amygdala, hippocampus, hippocampal gyrus, and frontal sites. All 38 complex partial seizures had bilateral limbic ictal discharges, and each was followed by a significant increase in prolactin concentration (mean peak, 50.8 ng/ml; range, 16.0 to 150.0 ng/ml). Eight of 10 simple partial seizures with unilateral high-frequency regional limbic discharges were followed by prolactin elevation (mean peak, 28.2 ng/ml; range, 13.4 to 44 ng/ml). Thirty simple partial seizures with other ictal limbic discharges or without limbic discharges were not followed by an elevated prolactin level. The data indicate that serum prolactin levels always rise after complex partial seizures involving the temporal lobes, and rise after certain simple partial seizures involving limbic structures. Thus, measurement of the prolactin level can help identify which simple partial seizures involve mesial temporal lobe structures. Limbic structures serve to trigger prolactin release, which may depend upon spread of the seizure to subcortical structures.",
