     "AB": "Cytochemical and biochemical techniques have been used to assess the relationship of epitopes on the microtubule-associated protein, tau, to the cytoskeletal pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The main probes were Tau-1 and Alz-50, two monoclonal antibodies which recognize tau and a potentially related 68 kDa protein. Sequential treatment of tissue slices with combinations of the antibodies showed that each blocked the binding of the other to neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques but not to normal axons. Western blot analysis of tau proteins isolated from Alzheimer's disease brains did not reveal such blocking patterns. The issue of steric hindrance affecting antibody binding in tissue sections was addressed by using Alz-50 in combination with Tau-2, another monoclonal antibody recognizing tau on blots and in Alzheimer's disease pathology. Neither antibody blocked the binding of the other to neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques. These data suggest that the Alz-50 and Tau-1 epitopes are selectively organized in the tangles and plaques to be in close proximity which supports the hypothesis that in Alzheimer's disease pathology, tau is modified.",
