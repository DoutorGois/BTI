     "AB": "The entorhinal cortex (EC) plays a pivotal role in processing and conveying spatial information to the hippocampus. It has long been known that EC neurons are modulated by cholinergic input from the medial septum. However, little is known as to how synaptic release of acetylcholine affects the different cell types in EC. Here we combined optogenetics and patch-clamp recordings to study the effect of cholinergic axon stimulation on distinct neurons in EC. We found dense cholinergic innervations that terminate in layer I and II (LI and LII). Light-activated stimulation of septal cholinergic projections revealed differential responses in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in LI and LII of both medial and lateral EC. We observed depolarizing responses mediated by nicotinic and muscarinic receptors primarily in putative serotonin receptor (p5HT3R)-expressing interneurons. Hyperpolarizing muscarinic receptor-mediated responses were found predominantly in excitatory cells. Additionally, some excitatory as well as a higher fraction of inhibitory neurons received mono- and/or polysynaptic GABAergic inputs, revealing that medial septum cholinergic neurons have the capacity to corelease GABA alongside acetylcholine. Notably, the synaptic effects of acetylcholine were similar in neurons of both medial and lateral EC. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that EC activity may be differentially modulated via the activation or the suppression of distinct subsets of LI and LII neurons by the septal cholinergic system.",
