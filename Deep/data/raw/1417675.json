     "AB": "The blockers of glutamate receptors, aminophosphonovaleric acid (AP5) (5.0 micrograms) and cyano-nitroquinoxaline-dione (CNQX) (0.5 microgram), were infused bilaterally into the amygdala, dorsal hippocampus, or entorhinal cortex of rats through indwelling cannulae 0, 90, 180, or 360 min after step-down inhibitory avoidance training. Animals were tested for retention 24 h after training. In the amygdala or hippocampus, AP5 was amnestic when given 0 min after training and CNQX was amnestic when given 0, 90, or 180 min after training. In the entorhinal cortex, AP5 was amnestic when given 90 or 180 min after training and CNQX had no effect. The results suggest that a phenomenon sensitive first to AP5 and then to CNQX in the amygdala and hippocampus, probably long-term potentiation (LTP), is crucial to post-training memory processing. LTP in these two structures could underlie their role in memory consolidation and could explain the late involvement of the entorhinal cortex in post-training memory processing.",
