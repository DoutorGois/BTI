     "AB": "Perfusion of the 1S,3R isomer of trans-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD, 50 microM), or arachidonic acid (10 microM), for 5 min produced only depression of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential recorded in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices from which the CA3 region had been removed. However, perfusion of t-ACPD and arachidonic acid in combination induced a rapid potentiation of the response which in 4/6 slices was maintained for at least 90 min.",
