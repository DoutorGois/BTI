     "AB": "Intra-cranial electroencephalograms (EEG) from two patients diagnosed with epilepsy are sampled at 1 kHz, enabling analysis and feature extraction at frequency bands above the gamma range. This study focuses on the extraction of linear features (including autoregressive, autoregressive-moving average and Fourier coefficients) obtained at both low (below 100 Hz) and high (100-500 Hz) bands of the signal spectrum. Comparisons of the performance of each feature are made based on a binary hypothesis test of statistical distributions from inter-ictal and pre-ictal epochs. Results are obtained from pre-ictal time periods as assessed by an expert epileptologist.",
