     "AB": "Although the literature recognises the involvement of neuropeptide structures in the genesis of epilepsy, only tentative preliminary data are available at present. Experiments indicate that neuropeptides primarily involved in the genesis of epilepsy are leuencephalin, metencephalin and beta-endorphin. Their convulsion properties are apparently related to the specific levels, locations and convulsive potential of the individual substances. A qualitative and/or quantitative change to the GABA-neuropeptide balance may also be involved in convulsive disorders; decreased GABA fluid levels have been identified in both severely epileptic patients and infants with febrile convulsions. Neuropeptide modulation and GABAergic neurotransmission clearly therefore play a major role in the regulation of cortical bioelectrical activity. It is therefore likely that their interaction is involved in the genesis of epilepsy.",
