     "AB": "Transmitter release at the nerve terminal is mediated by the influx of Ca2+ through voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs). Many types of VSCCs have been found in neurons (T, N, L, and P), but uncertainty remains about which ones are involved in neuronal excitation-secretion coupling. Specific ligands for the L- and N-type VSCCs were used to determine which of these subtypes might be involved in the K(+)-evoked [3H]noradrenaline release from superfused rat brain cortical and hippocampal synaptosomes. In cortical presynaptic terminals the 1,4-dihydropyridine agonist Bay K8644 enhanced the K+ (15 mM)-evoked [3H]noradrenaline release. This effect was reversed by the 1,4-dihydropyridine antagonists nimodipine and nitrendipine. The L-type VSCC ligands had no effect on hippocampal synaptosomes. In contrast, the N-type VSCC blocker omega-conotoxin markedly reduced the K(+)-evoked [3H]noradrenaline release in nerve terminals from both regions. Inhibition was greater in hippocampal synaptosomes. When applied together the inhibitory actions of nimodipine and omega-conotoxin were approximately additive. These findings indicate that both L- and N-type VSCCs participate in noradrenaline release in rat brain cortex and suggest that noradrenergic terminals in the two regions examined may have distinct populations of VSCCs: L type in cortex and N type in hippocampus.",
