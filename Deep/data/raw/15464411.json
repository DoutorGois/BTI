     "AB": "The discovery of multiple memory systems supported by discrete brain regions has been one of the most important advances in behavioral neuroscience. A wealth of studies have investigated the role of the hippocampus and related structures in supporting various types of memory classifications. While the exact classification that best describes hippocampal function is often debated, a specific subset of cognitive function that is focused on the use of spatial information to form hippocampal cognitive maps has received extensive investigation. These studies frequently employ a variety of experimental manipulations including brain lesions, temporary neural blockade due to cooling or discrete injections of specific drugs. While these studies have provided important insights into the function of the hippocampus, they are limited due to the invasive nature of the manipulation. Ethanol is a drug that is easily administered in a non-invasive fashion, is rapidly absorbed and produces effects only in specific brain regions. The hippocampus is one brain region affected by acute ethanol administration. The following review summarizes research from the last 20 years investigating the effects of acute ethanol administration on one specific type of hippocampal cognitive function, namely spatial memory. It is proposed that among its many effects, one specific action of acute ethanol administration is to produce similar cognitive and neurophysiological effects as lesions of the hippocampus. Based on these similarities and the ease of its use, it is concluded that acute ethanol administration is a valuable tool in studying hippocampal function and multiple memory systems.",
