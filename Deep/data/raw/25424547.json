     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Bilirubin encephalopathy (BE) is a severe neurologic sequelae induced by hyperbilirubinemia in newborns. However, the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the clinical syndromes of BE remain ambiguous. Ex vivo (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to measure changes in the concentrations of cerebral metabolites in various brain areas of newborn 9-day-old rats subjected to bilirubin to explore the related mechanisms of BE. RESULTS: When measured 0.5 hr after injection of bilirubin, levels of the amino acid neurotransmitters glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in hippocampus and occipital cortex significantly decreased, by contrast, levels of aspartate (Asp) considerably increased. In the cerebellum, Glu and Gln levels significantly decreased, while GABA, and Asp levels showed no significant differences. In BE 24 hr rats, all of the metabolic changes observed returned to normal in the hippocampus and occipital cortex; however, levels of Glu, Gln, GABA, and glycine significantly increased in the cerebellum. CONCLUSIONS: These metabolic changes for the neurotransmitters are mostly likely the result of a shift in the steady-state equilibrium of the Gln-Glu-GABA metabolic cycle between astrocytes and neurons, in a region-specific manner. Changes in energy metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle may also be involved in the pathogenesis of BE.",
