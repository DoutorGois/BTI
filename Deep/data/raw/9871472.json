     "AB": "The kynurenine pathway intermediate 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HANA) is converted by 3-HANA 3,4-dioxygenase (3-HAO) to the putative neuropathogen quinolinic acid (QUIN). In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of the 3-HANA analogue and 3-HAO inhibitor NCR-631 was investigated using organotypic cultures of rat hippocampus. An anoxic lesion was induced by exposing the cultures to 100% N2 for 150 min, resulting in a pronounced loss of pyramidal neurons, as identified using NMDA-R1 receptor subunit immunohistochemistry. NCR-631 provided a concentration-dependent protective effect against the anoxia. NCR-631 was also found to counteract the loss of pyramidal neurons in two models of neuroinflammatory-related damage; incubation with either LPS (10 ng/ml) or IL-1 beta (10 IU/ml). The findings suggest that NCR-631 has neuroprotective properties and that it may be a useful tool to study the role of kynurenines in neurodegeneration.",
