     "AB": "Regulator of G-protein signaling-10 (RGS10) is a GTPase activating protein for Galphai/q/z subunits that is highly expressed in the immune system and in a broad range of brain regions including the hippocampus, striatum, dorsal raphe, and ventral midbrain. Previously, we reported that RGS10-null mice display increased vulnerability to chronic systemic inflammation-induced degeneration of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Given that RGS10 is expressed in DA neurons, we investigated the extent to which RGS10 regulates cell survival under conditions of inflammatory stress. Because of the inherent limitations associated with use of primary DA neurons for biochemical analyses, we employed a well-characterized ventral mesencephalon DA neuroblastoma cell line (MN9D) for our studies. We found that stable over-expression of RGS10 rendered them resistant to TNF-induced cytotoxicity; whereas MN9D cells expressing mutant RGS10-S168A (which is resistant to phosphorylation by protein kinase A at a serine residue that promotes its nuclear translocation) showed similar sensitivity to TNF as the parental MN9D cells. Using biochemical and pharmacologic approaches, we identified protein kinase A and the downstream phospho-cAMP response element-binding signaling pathway (and ruled out ERK 1/2, JNK, and NFkB) as key mediators of the neuroprotective effect of RGS10 against inflammatory stress.",
