     "AB": "Changes in NMDA receptor function following early postnatal exposure to ethanol may be related to the expression of NMDA receptor subunits. Following early postnatal exposure to ethanol, the expression of NMDA receptor subunits was examined. In cortex from ethanol-exposed rat pups at postnatal day 21, NR2A was significantly increased. There was no change in NR2B, thus suggesting that ethanol exposure during the third-trimester equivalent produces distinct effects on the NMDA receptor.",
