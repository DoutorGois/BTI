     "AB": "Intracerebral administration of L-alpha-aminoadipic acid (L-AAA) at 500 mg/kg body weight to rats caused a complex behavioral change with sporadic wet-dog shakes. Animals developed severe limbic seizures between 1 and 6 h after L-AAA injection, characterized by generalized convulsions. Twenty days after L-AAA injection kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) activity measured in hippocampal brain tissue slices prepared with a McIlwain chopper at 30 microns showed a significant 43% decrease. Subcutaneous injection of kynurenine at 500 mg/kg showed a 63% increase in KAT activity twenty days later. This increase was offset by a concomitant administration of 500 mg/kg L-AAA stereotaxically on day one. In astrocyte culture kynurenic acid synthesis is inhibited by L-AAA and L-pipecolic acid. The possible involvement of kynurenic acid in the modulation of neuronal degeneration is discussed.",
