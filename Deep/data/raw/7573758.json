     "AB": "To clarify the preventive effects of glucocorticoid on perinatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain damage, an experiment was carried out on 4-day-old rats pretreated for 4 consecutive days with 3 different regimens; namely, a low dose dexamethasone (Dex) (0.1 mg/kg/day), a high dose Dex (0.5mg/kg/day), and a saline administration. On the 7th postnatal day, after ligation of the left common carotid artery, the rats were exposed to 8% oxygen and decapitated on the 10th, 14th, 21st and 28th postnatal days. Ligated side brain damage was observed in 75, 7 and 3% of the rats in the saline, low and high dose Dex groups, respectively. However, a high mortality rate (42%) was noted in the high dose Dex group. The cumulative number of animals with poor outcome (death or brain damage) was 49 (80%), 13 (33%) and 24 (44%) in the saline, low and high dose Dex groups, respectively. On the 10th and 14th postnatal days, the rats in both the Dex groups showed delayed neuronal maturation and myelination in the non-ligated side motor cortex, however, these maturational differences disappeared on the 21st postnatal days. Otherwise, the number of cortical cells in both the Dex groups were significantly lower than that in the saline group on the 28th postnatal days (P < 0.05 in each). These findings suggest that the pretreatment with Dex protects the developing brain from HI injury through the suppression of the neuronal maturation. However, a decreased number of cortical cells may give rise to psychomotor retardation later.",
