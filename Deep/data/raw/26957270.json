     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of procyanidins on the impairment of memory. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty male C57bl/6 mice were divided into five groups: low, middle, and high concentration, model, and control groups. Intracerebroventricular injection of beta-amyloid25-35 in C57bl/6 mice caused an impairment of learning and memory. Next day, intragastric administration of procyanidins in the treatment group mice: (lower, middle and high concentration). Hoechst staining observed apoptosis of neuronal nuclei in the hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry determined synaptic remodeling reaction and the expression level of glial inflammatory response. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, the proportion of neuronal apoptosis decreased in the hippocampal CA1 region of the treatment group. The Synaptic (SYN) density was increased, and the level of activated astrocytes and microglia expression in the hippocampus was decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Procyanidins have a protective influence on Abeta25-35 mice hippocampus neuron, reducing nerve cell damage and eases learning and memory deficit.",
