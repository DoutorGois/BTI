     "AB": "Phosphorylation of GluA1, a subunit of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), is critical for AMPAR synaptic trafficking and control of synaptic transmission. cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (cGKII) mediates this phosphorylation, and cGKII knockout (KO) affects GluA1 phosphorylation and alters animal behavior. Notably, GluA1 phosphorylation in the KO hippocampus is increased as a functional compensation for gene deletion, while such compensation is absent in the prefrontal cortex. Thus, there are brain region-specific effects of cGKII KO on AMPAR trafficking, which could affect animal behavior. Here, we show that GluA1 phosphorylation levels differ in various brain regions, and specific behaviors are altered according to region-specific changes in GluA1 phosphorylation. Moreover, we identified distinct regulations of phosphatases in different brain regions, leading to regional heterogeneity of GluA1 phosphorylation in the KO brain. Our work demonstrates region-specific changes in GluA1 phosphorylation in cGKII KO mice and corresponding effects on cognitive performance. We also reveal distinct regulation of phosphatases in different brain region in which region-specific effects of kinase gene KO arise and can selectively alter animal behavior.",
