     "AB": "The development of cholinergic neurons in the mouse forebrain was studied by immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal antibody to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the rate-limiting enzyme for acetylcholine synthesis. Since this antibody stained dividing cells in ventricular germinal zones as well as differentiating neurons, likely routes of migration could be inferred on the basis of the location of immunoreactive (IR) cells at different gestational ages. Germinal zones for cholinergic cells were observed in all ventricular zones of the forebrain with the ventral zones generating the earliest cells by gestational day 13.5 (GD13.5). On GD14, ChAT IR cells were visible in the germinal zones of the eye, olfactory ventricle, anterior horn, and dorsolateral aspect of the lateral ventricle, lateral ganglionic eminence, ventro- and dorsolateral third ventricle, and in the pineal anlage (epiphysis). ChAT IR neurons continued to develop in these and additional germinal zones on GD15, including the medial, dorsal, and dorsomedial walls of the lateral ventricle, and the medial and dorsal ganglionic eminence. On GD16, ChAT IR neurons were located in the prelimbic, pyriform, and parietal cortices and the lamina terminalis, and a cluster of IR cells was observed in the ventricular zone of the caudatopallial angle. On GD17-18, neurons in the anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, horizontal and vertical nucleus of the diagonal band, and medial septal nucleus stained more darkly and were multipolar, whereas immature bipolar neurons appeared to continue their migration into the hippocampus and along major fiber tracts, such as the corpus callosum, external capsule, fornix and anterior commissure. This study provides a comprehensive view of the zones of origin, probable routes of migration, and final destination of cholinergic neurons in the mouse forebrain.",
