     "AB": "Methyleugenol (ME) is a natural constituent isolated from many plant essential oils having multiple biological effects including anticonvulsant and anesthetic activities, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identify ME as a novel agonist of ionotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. At lower concentrations ( approximately 30 muM), ME significantly sensitized GABA-induced, but not glutamate- or glycine-induced, currents in cultured hippocampal neurons, indicative of a preferentially modulatory role of this compound for A type GABA receptors (GABAARs). In addition, ME at higher concentrations (>/=100 muM) induced a concentration-dependent, Cl(-)-permeable current in hippocampal neurons, which was inhibited by a GABAAR channel blocker, picrotoxin, and a competitive GABAAR antagonist, bicuculline, but not a specific glycine receptor inhibitor, strychnine. Moreover, ME activated a similar current mediated by recombinant alpha1-beta2-gamma2 or alpha5-beta2-gamma2 GABAARs in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Consequently, ME produced a strong inhibition of synaptically driven neuronal excitation in hippocampal neurons. Together, these results suggest that ME represents a novel agonist of GABAARs, shedding additional light on future development of new therapeutics targeting GABAARs. The present study also adds GABAAR activation to the list of molecular targets of ME that probably account for its biological activities.",
