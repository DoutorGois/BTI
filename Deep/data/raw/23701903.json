     "AB": "We previously demonstrated that Cyanobacteria-derived microcystin-LR (MCLR) is able to induce cognitive dysfunction, but the mechanism is not understood. Long-term potential (LTP) in hippocampus is regarded as an important cellular mechanism of learning and memory. Here, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of MCLR in LTP of hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) by in vivo electrophysiological recording. We found that MCLR could suppress the induction of LTP in rat hippocampus, whereas simultaneous inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) by LiCl or SB216763 attenuated the LTP impairments by MCLR. Furthermore, a decrease of the phosphorylated level at Ser9 of GSK-3beta was observed by western blotting after intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of MCLR, indicating GSK-3beta was activated by MCLR. In addition, we showed that ICV administration of MCLR slightly stimulated activity of protein phosphatases (PPs) in the brain, which might activate GSK-3beta via dephosphorylation of Ser9 site. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that GSK-3beta plays a crucial role in regulating MCLR-induced cognitive deficit.",
