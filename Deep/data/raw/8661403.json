     "AB": "Neurons have a restricted expression of MHC heavy chain molecules which prevents presentation of antigens of infecting viruses. As a result, such infected cells escape immune surveillance and allow the establishment of noncytolytic persistent infection. Here we show that a chronic noncytolytic viral infection both in vitro and in vivo selectively perturbed the expression of GAP-43, a protein that plays a central role in neuronal plasticity processes accompanying learning and memory. GAP-43 expression was greatly decreased in the hippocampus, an area of heightened viral replication, while synaptic density was preserved. Concurrently, the ability to learn tasks was significantly impaired in these persistently infected mice. Yet, infected neurons remained free from structural injury.",
