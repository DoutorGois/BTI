     "PG": "647-52",
     "AB": "Adult male albino rats were given a treatment that produced hypothermia after the induction of limbic seizures by a single subcutaneous injection of lithium and pilocarpine. When housed in groups, these rats exhibited marked hypersexuality (for at least two months), defined as repeated mounting of another male, pelvic thrusting, and persistent genital licking; while the male was mounted, female postures were assumed. There were also periods of physical submission. During active periods three of the four rats were mounted and thrusting in tandem. Possible relevance to the Kluver-Bucy syndrome and to bisexuality and homosexuality in males who report elevated complex partial epileptic-like signs is discussed.",
