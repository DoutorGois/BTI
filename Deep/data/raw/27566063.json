     "AB": "Many patients with diabetes are at increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. Resveratrol, a polyphenol found mainly in grapes and red wine, has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities. Studies demonstrated that resveratrol could prevent memory deficits and the increase in acetylcholinesterase activity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. However, whether administration of resveratrol could modulate the structural synaptic plasticity in diabetic rats remains unknown. Therefore, we tested its influence against cognitive dysfunction as well as on hippocampal structural synaptic plasticity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Our results showed that the cognitive performances in diabetic group were markedly deteriorated, accompanied by noticeable alterations in oxidative as well as inflammation parameters, SYN and GAP-43 expression were reduced in the hippocampus. In contrast, chronic treatment with resveratrol (10, 20mg/kg) improved neuronal injury and cognitive performance by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation as well as inhibiting synapse loss in diabetic rats. In conclusion, the present study suggested that oral supplementation of resveratrol might be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment and/or prevention of diabetic encephalopathy.",
