     "AB": "Protein kinases are considered essential for the processing and storage of information in the brain. However, the dynamics of protein kinase activation in the hippocampus during spatial learning are poorly understood. In this study, rats were trained to learn a holeboard spatial discrinmination task and the activity profiles for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Ca2+/ phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) in the hippocampus were examined. Hippocampal PKA activity increased rapidly on Day 1 of spatial learning and remained moderately high at later stages of acquisition. In contrast, PKC activity increased in particulate fractions compared with cytosolic fractions after habituation training and was maximal at Day 3 of spatial acquisition. The results establish a temporal dissociation between PKA and PKC during acquisition of spatial discrimination learning.",
