     "AB": "The stress-induced changes in peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) can be observed in a number of different tissues, depending upon the nature and chronicity of the aversive experience. In addition, virtually all stress procedures that cause rapid changes in PBR simultaneously increase the physical activity or metabolic rate of the subjects. The present study analyzed the contributions of rapid alterations in activity or metabolic rate with and without aversive stimulation and their subsequent impact on PBR. Mechanically induced increases in activity by forced running stress results in a significant reduction in [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to PBR in olfactory bulb, opposite to the PBR changes in this tissue following forced cold-water swim stress. Pharmacological induction of increased locomotor activity as well as metabolic rate by d-amphetamine causes a significant increase in cardiac PBR binding, again, opposite to the response typically observed following inescapable shock stress. Finally, administration of the anxiogenic beta-carboline, FG-7142, causes increases in both hippocampus and adrenal gland PBR binding reminiscent of acute noise stress exposure. These experiments demonstrate that increased locomotor activity or metabolic rate alone is not a necessary and sufficient condition for previous stress-induced changes in PBR. Conversely, increased metabolic rate coupled with an aversive stimulus appears to be an important factor for inducing stress-like changes in PBR. This data, coupled with previous reports, suggests that rapid alterations in these sites are stressor and tissue dependent. Finally, we propose that the PBR may be involved in many aspects of the stress response including: a) a blowarning system in adrenal gland, b) participation in stress-induced hypertension via renal PBR, and c) a modulator of stress-induced immunosuppression and subsequent recovery of function or recuperation by actions on immune cells.",
