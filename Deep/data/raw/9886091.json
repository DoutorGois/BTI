     "AB": "Altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function (increased plasma cortisol level) has been shown to be associated with mood and behavior. Protein kinase C (PKC), an important component of the phosphatidyl-inositol signal transduction system, plays a major role in mediating various physiological functions. The present study investigates the effects of acute (single) and repeated (10-day) administrations of 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg doses of dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid, on Bmax and KD of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3H]PDBu) binding, PKC activity, and protein expression of PKC isozymes alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon in the membrane and the cytosolic fractions of rat cortex and hippocampus. It was observed that repeated administration of 1.0 mg/kg DEX for 10 days caused a significant increase in Bmax of [3H]PDBu binding to PKC, in PKC activity, and in expressed protein levels of the gamma and epsilon isozymes in both the cytosolic and the membrane fractions of the cortex and the hippocampus, whereas a lower dose of DEX (0.5 mg/kg for 10 days) caused these changes only in the hippocampus. On the other hand, a single administration of DEX (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg) had no significant effect on PKC in the cortex or in the hippocampus. These results suggest that alterations in HPA function from repeated administration of glucocorticoids may modulate PKC-mediated functions.",
