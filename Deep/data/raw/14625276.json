     "AB": "Mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and III have been shown to produce superoxide but the exact contribution and localization of individual sites have remained unclear. We approached this question investigating the effects of oxygen, substrates, inhibitors, and of the NAD+/NADH redox couple on H2O2 and superoxide production of isolated mitochondria from rat and human brain. Although rat brain mitochondria in the presence of glutamate+malate alone do generate only small amounts of H2O2 (0.04 +/- 0.02 nmol H2O2/min/mg), a substantial production is observed after the addition of the complex I inhibitor rotenone (0.68 +/- 0.25 nmol H2O2/min/mg) or in the presence of the respiratory substrate succinate alone (0.80 +/- 0.27 nmol H2O2/min/mg). The maximal rate of H2O2 generation by respiratory chain complex III observed in the presence of antimycin A was considerably lower (0.14 +/- 0.07 nmol H2O2/min/mg). Similar observations were made for mitochondria isolated from human parahippocampal gyrus. This is an indication that most of the superoxide radicals are produced at complex I and that high rates of production of reactive oxygen species are features of respiratory chain-inhibited mitochondria and of reversed electron flow, respectively. We determined the redox potential of the superoxide production site at complex I to be equal to -295 mV. This and the sensitivity to inhibitors suggest that the site of superoxide generation at complex I is most likely the flavine mononucleotide moiety. Because short-term incubation of rat brain mitochondria with H2O2 induced increased H2O2 production at this site we propose that reactive oxygen species can activate a self-accelerating vicious cycle causing mitochondrial damage and neuronal cell death.",
