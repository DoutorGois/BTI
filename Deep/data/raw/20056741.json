     "AB": "The effects of manganese on the activities of GS, PAG, SDH and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase were investigated and the impact of MK-801, Tau and DM on manganese-induced neurotoxicity were observed in rats. Seventy Wistar rats were divided into seven groups, 10 animals for each group. The first group was the control group, the second to fourth groups were 8, 40 and 200 micromol/kg MnCl(2) groups, the fifth to seventh groups were 0.3 micromol/kg MK-801, 1 micromol/kg Tau and 13.5 micromol/kg DM pretreatment groups. The animals were injected with manganese chloride for 25 days and pretreated for every other day. Manganese resulted in the reduction of GS, SDH and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activities, and the increase of PAG activity. The percentage of positive area and integral optical density of glutamate immunocreative cell were significantly increased in the group given 200 micromol/kg MnCl(2) alone. Pretreatment with MK-801, Tau and DM can antagonize neurotoxicity induced by manganese in the certain extent.",
