     "AB": "The inhibitory effects of bicuculline (BIC) and strychnine (STR) on GABA- and glycine-induced responses were studied in the rat dissociated hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in whole-cell mode by using the conventional patch-clamp technique. Both GABA and glycine elicited inward Cl- currents in a dose-dependent manner and had almost the same maximal responses. The half-maximum dose (Ka) and Hill coefficient were 6.4 microM and 1.1 for the GABA response, and 74 microM and 1.5 for the glycine response. BIC and STR antagonized both GABA and glycine responses in a competitive manner. The blocking potency of BIC and STR on the GABA response was comparable. The half inhibition dose (IC50) was 2.7 microM for BIC and 6.7 microM for STR. STR blocked the glycine response about 3,000 x more effectively than BIC. The IC50 was 28 nM for STR and 100 microM for BIC. The BIC and STR did not have voltage-dependent blocking effects on either GABA or glycine responses. Neither GABA nor glycine showed outward rectification in their current-voltage relationships. The functional role of glycine in the rat hippocampal CA1 region is discussed.",
