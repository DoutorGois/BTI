     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is a leading cause of various diseases, including ischemia and inflammation. Peroxiredoxin2 (PRX2) is one of six mammalian isoenzymes (PRX1-6) that can reduce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and organic hydroperoxides to water and alcohols. METHODS: We produced PEP-1-PRX2 transduction domain (PTD)-fused protein and investigated the effect of PEP-1-PRX2 on oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, Western blot, immunofluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Our data showed that PEP-1-PRX2, which can effectively transduce into various types of cells and brain tissues, could be implicated in suppressing generation of reactive oxygen species, preventing depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, and inhibiting the apoptosis pathway in H2O2-stimulated HT22, murine hippocampal neuronal cells, likely resulting in protection of HT22 cells against H2O2-induced toxicity. In addition, we found that in a transient forebrain ischemia model, PEP-1-PRX2 inhibited the activation of astrocytes and microglia in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and lipid peroxidation and also prevented neuronal cell death against ischemic damage. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the transduced PEP-1-PRX2 has neuroprotective functions against oxidative stress-induced cell death in vitro and in vivo. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: PEP-1-PRX2 could be a potential therapeutic agent for oxidative stress-induced brain diseases such as ischemia.",
