     "AB": "The Alzheimer's disease-related beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) is metabolized to a number of potentially amyloidogenic peptides that are believed to be pathogenic. Application of relatively low concentrations of the soluble forms of these peptides has previously been shown to block high-frequency stimulation-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus. The present experiments examined how these peptides affect low-frequency stimulation-induced long-term depression (LTD) and the reversal of LTP (depotentiation). We discovered that beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta1-42) and the Abeta-containing C -terminus of beta-APP (CT) facilitate the induction of LTD in the CA1 area of the intact rat hippocampus. The LTD was frequency- and NMDA receptor-dependent. Thus, although low-frequency stimulation alone was ineffective, after intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta1-42, it induced an LTD that was blocked by d-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid. Furthermore, an NMDA receptor-dependent depotentiation was induced in a time-dependent manner, being evoked by injection of CT 10 min, but not 1 hr, after LTP induction. These use- and time-dependent effects of the amyloidogenic peptides on synaptic plasticity promote long-lasting reductions in synaptic strength and oppose activity-dependent strengthening of transmission in the hippocampus. This will result in a profound disruption of information processing dependent on hippocampal synaptic plasticity.",
