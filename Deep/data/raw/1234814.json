     "AB": "The influence of Desmethylimipramin (PertofranR) on the regional uptake of 3H-leucine in different areas of rat brains has been investigated with autoradiographic methods. Male rats were injected 10 m/kg Desmethylimipramin (DMI, PertofranR) i.m. and 1 hr later 8,33 mCi 3H-leucine i.p.. 1 and 7 hrs after application 3H-leucine the animals were sacrificed. Concentrations of silvergrains of 3H-leucine activity were countered under surface illumination in varions brain areas by means of strippingfilmautoradiograms. DMI markedly depressed the concentrations of 3H-leucine-activity in all layers of the parietal cortex after 8 hrs and the depression was greater with the increase of nerv- and gliacellvolumendensity of the layers. Within 2 hrs such an influence of DMI on 3H-leucine uptake could not be found. There was a smaller decrease of 3H-leucine incorporation after DMI applications in some layers of ammon's horn, dentate gyrus and cerebellum. Some further effects of DMI and IP (Imipramine) on components concerned with protein metabolism are discussed.",
