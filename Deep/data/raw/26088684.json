     "AB": "Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in grapes and wine, exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-aging and antitumor activities. Resveratrol also protects neurons and astrocytes in several neurological disease models. Astrocytes are responsible for modulating neurotransmitter systems, synaptic information, ionic homeostasis, energy metabolism, antioxidant defense and inflammatory response. In previous work, we showed that resveratrol modulates important glial functions, including glutamate uptake, glutamine synthetase activity, glutathione (GSH) levels and inflammatory response. Furthermore, astrocytes express toll-like receptors that specifically recognize lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which has been widely used to study experimentally inflammatory response. In this sense, LPS may stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines release and oxidative stress. Moreover, there is interplay between these signals through signaling pathways such as NFkappaB, HO-1 and MAPK. Thus, here, we evaluated the effects of resveratrol on LPS-stimulated inflammatory response in hippocampal primary astrocyte cultures and the putative role of HO-1, p38 and ERK pathways in the protective effect of resveratrol. LPS increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-18 and resveratrol prevented these effects. Resveratrol also prevented the oxidative and nitrosative stress induced by LPS as well as the decrease in GSH content. Additionally, we demonstrated the involvement of NFkappaB, HO-1, p38 and ERK signaling pathways in the protective effect of resveratrol, providing the first mechanistic explanation for these effects in hippocampal astrocytes. Our findings reinforce the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol, which are mainly associated with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities.",
