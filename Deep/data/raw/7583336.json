     "AB": "The effect of selective lesion of cholinergic inputs to the hippocampus on the function of hippocampal cholinergic receptors was examined. Hippocampal cholinergic neurons were lesioned in the rat by administration of the selective cholinergic neurotoxin AF64A (ethylcholine mustard aziridinium). Cholinergic receptor function was examined by assessing the ability of cholinergic agonists and antagonists to modulate the evoked release of radiolabelled acetylcholine (ACh) from hippocampal slices. Nicotine enhanced release, with a bell-shaped dose-response curve. The dose-response curve and EC50 for nicotine was shifted 10-fold to the left in lesioned rats, suggesting an increased sensitivity to nicotine. However, there were no differences in either the number of affinity of nicotinic receptors as determined with binding studies. The muscarinic agonist oxotremorine inhibited the evoked release of ACh in control tissues, but had much less effect in AF64A-lesioned tissues. Binding to the M1 receptor subtype was not changed. However, the Kd for binding to the high affinity subtype of the M2 receptor was increased 10-fold, suggesting that the receptor has become less sensitive to stimulation. Loss of M2 function may allow an increase in the effect of stimulating nicotinic receptors that modulate ACh release.",
