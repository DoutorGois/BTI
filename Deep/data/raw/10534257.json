     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To determine CSF eicosanoid concentrations and brain cyclo-oxygenase activity in AD patients and age-matched control subjects. BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may benefit AD patients by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenases and thereby reducing prostaglandin (PG) production or oxidant stress in the CNS. METHODS: CSF eicosanoid and F2-isoprostane (IsoP) levels were determined in seven probable AD patients and seven age-matched control subjects. Cyclo-oxygenase activity was determined in microsomes prepared from the hippocampus of 10 definite AD patients and 8 age-matched control subjects. All measurements were made using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: CSF concentrations of prostaglandin (PG) E2 were increased fivefold (p < 0.01) and 6-keto-PGF1alpha was decreased fourfold (p < 0.01) in probable AD patients. There was no change in total CSF eicosanoid concentration in probable AD patients. CSF F2-IsoP, a quantitative marker of lipid peroxidation in vivo, was increased in probable AD patients (p < 0.05). Cyclo-oxygenase activity in the hippocampus from definite AD patients was not different from age-matched control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that cyclo-oxygenase activity may not contribute significantly to CNS oxidative damage in AD. Increased CSF PGE2 concentration in probable AD patients suggest that cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors may benefit AD patients by limiting PG production.",
