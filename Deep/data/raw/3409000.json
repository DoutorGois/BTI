Subsequently, the compound isolated from postmortem human brain tissue was unequivocally identified as KYNA by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometric analyses. Regional distribution analyses revealed the highest concentration of KYNA (1.58 +/- 0.43 pmol/mg tissue) in the caudate nucleus with lower levels in the thalamus, globus pallidus, hippocampus, parietal cortex and frontal cortex. Of the brain structures examined, the lowest concentration of KYNA (0.14 +/- 0.02 pmol/mg tissue) was found in the cerebellum.",
