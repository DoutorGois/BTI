     "AB": "We investigated the efficiency of nasal drug administration as a new non-invasive treatment strategy for MS. Glatiramer Acetate (GA) and GA-Cannabidiol (CBD) combination administered in nasal delivery system (NDS) resulted in a statistically significant decrease of clinical scores and inflammatory cytokine expression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. Even a suboptimal dose of Prednisolone in NDS was effective in preventing the clinical signs of the disease. Neuron regeneration was observed in the hippocampus of EAE mice treated with GA-CBD in NDS. This work shows that nasal administration improved drug efficiency and stimulates further research for a non-invasive strategy for MS.",
