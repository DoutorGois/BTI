     "AB": "In rat hippocampal slices, neurons in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 were stimulated orthodromically and antidromically while the resultant extracellular population spikes were monitored. Hypoxic conditions were then induced. After disappearance of the orthodromic population spike, a second orthodromic population spike appeared. We have titled this the hypoxic injury potential since it reflects the onset of permanent injury to neurons in area CA1 of the hippocampus.",
