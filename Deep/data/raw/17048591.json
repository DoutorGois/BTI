     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the improvement effects of puerarin on glycated brain damages in rat model induced by D-galactose. METHOD: The model rats of protein glycation were induced by intraperitoneal administration of D-galactose (150 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) for 8 weeks, and all rats were treated with puerarin (high dose 300 mg x kg(-1), middle dose 150 mg x kg(-1), low dose 75 mg x kg(-1)) for 6 weeks. The activity of aldose reductase in red blood cells, the amount of glycated products (fructosamine in serum, glycohaemoglobin, advanced glycation end-products) and AGEs in brain tissue, calcium ion in brain cells were measured. Moreover, mitochondria in brain hippocampus cells were observed under electronic microscope. RESULT: High dose and middle dose of puerarin can decrease the activity of aldose reductase in red blood cells (P < 0.01), and inhibit the formation of glycation products significantly in model rats induced by D-galactose (P < 0.01). Also, puerarin can decrease the content of AGEs in brain and the level of calcium ions in brain cells (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), and decrease lesions degree in mitochondria in brain hippocampus cells. CONCLUSION: Puerarin can produce the protective effects on glycated brain damages through inhibiting the glycation reaction in rats induced by D-galactose.",
