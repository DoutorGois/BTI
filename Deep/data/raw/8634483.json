     "AB": "The T1-weighted volumetric magnetic resonance images of 31 patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy, and 13 control subjects matched for age and sex, were subjected to semiautomated threshold analysis. The method used proved to be relatively fast and reliable. An index of temporal lobe interhemispheric asymmetry was extracted by thresholding high-signal (white matter) pixels. Patients had significantly more asymmetrical indices for white matter and hippocampal volumes that did control subjects, and the two indices were significantly correlated, providing evidence for the validity of the white matter index. Differences in both indices were consistent with decreased tissue on the side of the focus. In classification analyses a combination of these two indices correctly predicted the side of focus at a greater rate than did either used alone. Findings provide support for the hypothesis that seizure activity is associated with atrophy in both mesial and lateral temporal lobe structures.",
