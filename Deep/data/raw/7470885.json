     "AB": "The specific activities of N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.5) were examined in several regions of rat brain of both sexes at various times after birth. The enzyme activity increased with development in whole brain, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebellum and the remainder of brain, peaking around 36 days of age. Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated linear kinetics for N-acetyltransferase in dialyzed supernatant and ammonium sulfate precipitates from the newborn rat brain, whereas enzyme preparation further purified by Bio Gel yielded biphasic kinetics. These data remain consistent with the possibility that there are two forms of N-acetyltransferase in rat brain even from birth.",
