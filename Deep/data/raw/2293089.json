Acute increase of intracellular free calcium was detected 80-170 s after the beginning of hypoxia. Large calcium accumulations were seen in the stratum radiatum, stratum lacunosum and stratum oriens of CA1 region and in the inner portions of the dentate gyrus molecular layer, and moderate accumulations were seen in the other laminae of CA1 region, other portions of dentate gyrus and the CA3 region.",
