     "AB": "Immunohistochemistry using anti-human neuron-specific enolase (NSE) mouse monoclonal antibody was performed in human brains from autopsy cases, which enabled us to assess the neuronal damage besides hematoxylin and eosin or Kluver-Barrera stain. Neurons in cerebral neocortex which showed necrotic changes such as prominent cytoplasmic vacuolization or cellular shrinkage with nuclear pyknosis showed a tendency to be less stained by anti-NSE antibody. Anti-NSE immunostaining was statistically significantly less in the neocortex from CO intoxication than from other causes of death, although morphological necrotic changes were less observed in CO intoxication. Hippocampal CA1 neurons clearly lost NSE immunoreactivity with the progression of necrotic changes. Neurons in CA2 were statistically significantly better stained by anti-NSE antibody than in CA1, 3, and 4. Cerebellar Purkinje cells were poorly stained by anti-NSE antibody, whereas neurons in cerebellar dentate nucleus and inferior olive in medulla oblongata were better stained. Anti-NSE immunostaining was lost in the injured areas of the cerebral neocortex while neurons in the intact areas were better stained in brain injury. These results indicate that anti-NSE immunostaining of neurons could reflect vital reaction and could be useful in evaluating neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA1 region or brain injury.",
