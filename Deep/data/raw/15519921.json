Ictal bradycardia and cardiac asystole are rare, and maybe underestimated. The physiological mechanism is poorly understood. We report a patient with left temporal lobe seizures who developed ictal bradycardia and cardiac asystole during a complex partial seizure and required a subsequent placement of a pacemaker.",
