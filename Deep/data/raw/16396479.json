     "AB": "Activity of caspase-3 and content of DNA fragments with sizes 0.2-0.6 kbp and more than 4.0 kbp in the worm of the cerebellum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of the adult rat brain were estimated in 4 and 24 hours after the procedure of acoustic startle habituation and fear conditioning. Heterochronic changes in apoptotic markers in the examined brain structures were observed after training. Caspase-3 activity was decreased in the worm of the cerebellum and hippocampus, and DNA fragmentation was suppressed in the hippocampus and brain cortex. At the same time, both caspase activity and DNA fragmentation were increased in the hypothalamus. These results provide evidence for the involvement of apoptosis in the mechanisms of learning and memory in adult brain.",
