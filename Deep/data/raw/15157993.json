     "AB": "In this study we examined the timecourse of induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and protein after 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 28 days of exercise in the rat. To measure the expression of mRNA for individual BDNF exons we utilized a semi-quantitative RT-PCR technique, while BDNF protein was assessed using commercial ELISA kits. We demonstrated that the distance run by animals increased significantly (P<0.05) after 4 weeks. BDNF protein was significantly (P<0.05) increased after 4 weeks of exercise, while the mRNA for individual BDNF exons increased significantly (P<0.05) over the timecourse (exon I after 1 and 28 days and exons II and V after 28 days). The Morris water maze was then utilized to demonstrate that 3 weeks of prior exercise enhanced the rate of learning on this task. Exercise, therefore, was shown to modulate BDNF induction in a time-dependent manner, and this may translate to improvements in neurotrophin-mediated tasks within the CNS.",
