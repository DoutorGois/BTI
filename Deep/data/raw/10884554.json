     "AB": "Morphine-dependent rats were allowed to undergo withdrawal by abrupt discontinuation of the drug. The regional expression of brain M1 muscarinic receptors was measured directly by autoradiographic determination with [(3)H] pirenzepine, and indirectly by quantifying the relative levels of M1 mRNA encoding the receptor protein. Patterns of receptor changes after morphine treatment were in general agreement using the two methods. Frontal cortical samples derived from morphine-dependent rats exhibited a 28% increase in M1 receptor mRNA measured at the end of the infusion. At the peak of the withdrawal, M1 mRNA levels for dependent rats were much lower (33.4%) than those for control rats. Hippocampal samples derived from morphine-dependent rats exhibited no changes in M1 mRNA levels after the morphine infusion. During the peak of withdrawal, however, hippocampal M1 mRNA levels were reduced (57%) compared with levels for controls. The M1 mRNA levels remained at this reduced degree of expression even after withdrawal symptoms had subsided. Addition of diisopropylflurophophate (DFP) to the morphine infusion schedule inhibited the adaptive changes in M1 mRNA levels induced by morphine. During the peak period of withdrawal, M1 mRNA levels in the hippocampus declined by only 18% as compared with 57% for the morphine control group. The adaptive decrease in hippocampal M1 receptors after withdrawal subsided may reflect prolonged heightened cholinergic activity in an area where such cholinergic innervation plays an important role in memory.",
