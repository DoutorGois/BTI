     "AB": "BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) have frequently been associated with lower executive function performance. Little is known, however, about the effects of hippocampal atrophy on executive control in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study focused on the association of hippocampal atrophy with executive function in AD patients and examined whether a threshold effect is present, indicating that a certain amount of brain damage must be present before cognitive function becomes impaired. Finally, we examined the combined effect of hippocampal atrophy and WMH on cognitive task performance. METHODS: We retrospectively collected neuropsychological and neuroimaging data of 94 AD patients. These patients completed tasks of general cognitive function, executive function, memory, and processing speed. With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hippocampal atrophy was rated as medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) and cerebrovascular disease was rated as WMH using validated visual rating scales. RESULTS: Medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) was associated with lower executive function, general cognitive function, and episodic memory performance. A threshold effect was present, indicating that severe to very severe, but not moderate, MTA was associated with lower executive function. WMH were significantly associated with a single executive test only, whereas the interaction between WMH and MTA was not significantly related to any of the cognitive tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that AD neuropathology in itself may be responsible for executive dysfunction. Potential explanations for these findings are discussed, focusing on the role of the hippocampus in executive function tests and reduced frontal-posterior connectivity in this patient sample.",
