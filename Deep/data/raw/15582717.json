     "AB": "Neuropeptide Y inhibits neuronal excitability and seizures in various experimental models. This peptide delays kindling epileptogenesis but the receptors involved in this action are unknown. We have studied the role of Y5 receptors in kindling using the selective antagonist GW438014A (IC50=210 nM), a small heterocycle molecule that crosses the blood-brain barrier, and the selective peptide agonist Ala31Aib34 NPY (IC50=6.0 nM). Intraperitoneal injection of GW438014A (10 mg/kg), 30 min before the beginning of a rapid-kindling protocol, significantly accelerated the rate of kindling acquisition as compared to vehicle-injected rats. Thus, the number of electrical stimuli required to reach stages 3 and 4-5 of kindling were reduced by 50% and 25%, respectively. The average afterdischarge duration in the stimulated hippocampus was prolonged by 2-fold. Conversely, kindling rate was delayed by intracerebroventricular administration of 24 nmol Ala31Aib32 NPY. Thus, the number of stimuli necessary to reach stages 2 and 3 of kindling was increased by 3- and 4-fold, respectively. During the stimulation protocol (40 stimuli) none of the rats treated with the Y5 agonist showed stages 4-5 seizures. Twenty-four hours after the last kindling stimulation, thus during the re-test session, Y5 agonist- or antagonist-treated rats had stages 4-5 seizures as their controls. In rats treated with both the antagonist and the agonist, kindling rate was similar to vehicle-injected rats. These data indicate that Y5 receptors mediate inhibitory effects of NPY in kindling and display anticonvulsant rather then antiepileptogenic effects upon agonist stimulation.",
