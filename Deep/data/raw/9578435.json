     "AB": "Using a T-maze, the influence of transient global cerebral ischemia on working memory in gerbils was investigated. Furthermore, it was examined whether a correlation exists between impairment in choice accuracy in the T-maze and neuron loss in the hippocampus. In two experiments, male Mongolian gerbils were tested in a previously learned delayed alternation T-maze task 1 week after a 4 min occlusion of the common carotid arteries. In both experiments memory was significantly impaired and in the second experiment, where the design allowed a separation between working and reference memory deficits, a selective impairment in working memory was seen. The results suggest that ischemia-induced disruption of delayed alternation in the T-maze in gerbils is a model which is relevant to the clinical manifestations of vascular dementia.",
