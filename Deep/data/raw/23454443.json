     "AB": "AIMS: A high fat diet (HFD) has been found to affect neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex, but the effects of this dietary regime upon the endocannabinoid system has not been studied in this brain region. In consequence, in the present study, we have investigated the effect of HFD for up to 20 weeks upon the endocannabinoid system in the prefrontal cortex of female rats. MAIN METHODS: CB1 receptor functionality was measured using CP55,940-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS autoradiography. Fatty acid amide hydrolase and monoacylglycerol lipase activities were analysed in brain regions by assessing rates of [(3)H]anandamide and JZL184-sensitive [(3)H]2-oleoylglycerol hydrolysis, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: In the prefrontal cortex, a significantly greater stimulation of [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding by CP55,940 was seen following 4-12, but not 16-20 weeks of HFD. No significant changes were seen for the caudate-putamen, CA1-CA3 region of the hippocampus or the dentate gyrus. The increased response for the 12 week animals was not accompanied by a significant change in the receptor density, measured with [(3)H]CP55,940 autoradiography. No significant changes in the activity of the endocannabinoid hydrolytic enzymes fatty acid amide or monoacylglycerol lipase were seen in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala or hypothalamus following either 12 or 20 weeks of HFD. SIGNIFICANCE: It is concluded that HFD produces an increased CB1 receptor functionality in the prefrontal cortex of female rats. Given that the endocannabinoid system regulates neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex, the present data would implicate this system in the disturbed prefrontal cortical activity in this region following a high fat diet.",
