     "AB": "Experiments on white rats were made to study the time-course of the electric activity in the limbic structures and Locus Coeruleus (LC) under ligation of the coronary artery, and the effect of the coagulation of these structures on heart rhythm disorders in acute myocardial ischemia. It was established that during the period that preceded the development of heart rhythm disorders, the most conspicuous changes were seen in the electric activity of the anterior amygdaline nucleus and LC, whereas the coagulation of the amygdalae prevented to a considerable measure development of different forms of arrhythmia. The authors suggest that in acute myocardial ischemia, these structures are directly related to heart rhythm disorders, while the LC is likely to play a role of the hyperactive determinant structure.",
