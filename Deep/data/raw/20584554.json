     "AB": "The association between anti-triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) antibodies and MRL/MpJ-Fas(lpr) (MRL/lpr) mice was examined. We found that serum anti-TPI antibody levels in MRL/lpr mice, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were significantly higher than that of age-matched Balb/c mice and NZB/WF1 mice. Anti-TPI antibodies were detected in serum and cerebrospinal fluid in MRL/lpr mice by Western blotting. Inoculation of anti-TPI monoclonal antibody-producing hybridoma into the brain of Balb/c mice resulted in immunoglobulin deposition in the regions near the ventricles, hippocampus, and choroid plexus. Anti-TPI antibodies may play a role in the etiology of brain damage and behavioral deficits in MRL/lpr mice.",
