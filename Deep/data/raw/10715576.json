     "AB": "The Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM) serves as a temporally and spatially regulated modulator of a variety of cell-cell interactions. This review summarizes recent results of studies aimed at understanding its regulation of expression and biological function, thereby focussing on its polysialylated isoforms (PSA-NCAM). The detailed analysis of the expression of PSA and NCAM in the hippocampal mossy fiber system and the morphological consequences of PSA-NCAM deficiency in mice support the notion that the levels of expression of NCAM are important not only for the regulation and maintenance of structural changes, such as migration, axonal growth and fasciculation, but also for activity-induced plasticity. There is evidence that PSA-NCAM can specifically contribute to a presynaptic form of plasticity, namely long-term potentiation at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. This is consistent with previous observations that NCAM-deficient mice show deficits in spatial learning and exploratory behavior. Furthermore, our data points to an important role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which is the principle adaptive response of the organism to environmental challenges, in the control of PSA-NCAM expression in the hippocampal formation. In particular, we evidence an inhibitory influence of corticosterone on PSA-NCAM expression.",
