     "AB": "We examined the effect of kindling on serotonergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus by measuring serotonin (5-HT) release and uptake in hippocampal synaptosomes and 5-HT1A and 5-HT4 receptor subtypes during and at different times after electrical kindling of the dentate gyrus. Using quantitative receptor autoradiography, we found that binding of 8-[3H]hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([3H]8-OH-DPAT) to 5-HT1A receptors was selectively increased by 20% on average (p < 0.05) in the dentate gyrus of the stimulated and contralateral hippocampus 2 days after stage 2 (stereotypes and occasional retraction of a forelimb) and by 100% on average (p < 0.05) 1 week after stage 5 (tonic-clonic seizures) compared with sham-stimulated rats. A 20% increase (p < 0.05) was observed 1 month after the last generalized seizure. No changes were found after a single afterdischarge. 5-HT4 receptors, which colocalize with 5-HT1A receptors on hippocampal neurons, were not modified in kindled tissue. [3H]5-HT uptake and its release as well as the 5-HT1B autoreceptor function did not differ from shams in hippocampal synaptosomes at stages 2 and 5. Systemic administration of 100 and 1,000 microg kg(-1) 8-OH-DPAT or 1,000 microg kg(-1) WAY-100,635, 30 min before each electrical stimulation, did not significantly alter kindling progression or the occurrence of stage 5 seizures in fully kindled rats. The changes in 5-HT1A receptor density in the dentate gyrus are part of the plastic modifications occurring during kindling and may contribute to modulating tissue hyperexcitability.",
