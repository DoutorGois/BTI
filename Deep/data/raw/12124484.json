     "AB": "The Mini-Mental State examination (MMSE) is frequently used to assess the cognitive function of neurological patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and MMSE scores in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and localization of cognitive functions. Fifty-nine patients with probable AD (21 males and 38 females; mean age 74 years) and 12 normal volunteers (five males and seven females; mean age 73 years) were studied. CBF was measured by SPECT using the N-isopropyl-p-[(123)I]iodoamphetamine autoradiography method. The CBF images were reconstructed in parallel with the orbitomeatal line and parallel to the long axis of the temporal cortex. Regions of interest were set in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex. Multivariate analysis was performed by the step-wise method, using each section of the MMSE as the dependent variable and the rCBF ratio as the independent variable. The decline in rCBF in the parietal cortex and hippocampus reflected disorientation, and the most significant cortex affecting scores on each section of the MMSE were found to be the anterior temporal cortex for registration, the frontal cortex for attention and calculation, the medial temporal cortex for recall, and the posterior temporal cortex for language.",
