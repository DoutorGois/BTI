     "AB": "Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of the 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel agonist, Bay K8644 (30 micrograms/kg) increased mean blood pressure and the K+-evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine ([3H]ACh) from hippocampal slices in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The Bay K8644-induced hypertension was inhibited by a pretreatment with methylatropine (80 micrograms/kg i.c.v.). In SHR, nicardipine, a DHP calcium channel antagonist, reduced mean blood pressure when i.c.v. injected (10 micrograms/kg). The nicardipine-induced hypotension was reduced by a pretreatment with hemicholinium-3 (20 micrograms, i.c.v.). Nicardipine (1 microM) did not modify, in SHR, the K+-evoked release of [3H]ACh, but inhibited the Bay K8644-induced increase in the ACh release. In normotensive rats, neither Bay K8644 nor nicardipine modify blood pressure, when centrally injected, or the stimulated release of [3H]ACh from hippocampal slices. The participation of central DHP sites in the cholinergic transmission in genetic hypertension is discussed.",
