     "AB": "In this study, we demonstrated the c-myb mRNA expression in the adult rat brain using an in situ hybridization technique. We found c-myb mRNA signals in the various regions of the forebrain and midbrain including the cerebral cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, hypothalamus, superior and inferior colliculi and central gray. In the cerebellum, a diffuse signal was found in the granular layer while some positive cells were detected in the molecular layer as well. In addition, a number of cells showed intense signals in many nuclei of the medulla oblongata. The constitutive expression of c-myb mRNA in the different kinds of neural cells suggests that this gene might be involved in the normal function of these neurons.",
