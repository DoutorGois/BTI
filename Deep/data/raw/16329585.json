     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the role of POU-domain proteins in the neurotoxic mechanism of lead. Methods The pregnant rats were randomly divided into 4 groups, which were provided with distilled water, 0.5g/L, 1.0 g/L and 2.0 g/L lead actate solution via drinking water, respectively, the lead-exposure period for exposure groups was limited from the 15th day after pregnancy to the 21st day when the offspring began to weaned, the expression of Oct-2 and Brn-3a proteins in neural cells from cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum were measured by immunohistochemistry methods. RESULTS: The immununohistochemistry results showed that Oct-2 increased significantly and Brn-3a decreased significantly in lead poisoning groups compared with that of the control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The results indicateded that POU-domain proteins, as a transcription regular factor, may participate in the neurological toxicity damaging the learning and memory ability induced by lead. The study provided experimental basis for revealing the molecular neurotoxic mechanism of lead.",
