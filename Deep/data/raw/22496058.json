     "AB": "Our previous study has shown that an extremely low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) induces nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by Ca(2+) -dependent NO synthase (NOS) in rat brain. The present study was designed to confirm that ELF-MF affects neuronal NOS (nNOS) in several brain regions and to investigate the correlation between NO and nNOS activation. The exposure of rats to a 2 mT, 60 Hz ELF-MF for 5 days resulted in increases of NO levels in parallel with cGMP elevations in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. Cresyl violet staining and electron microscopic evaluation revealed that there were no significant differences in the morphology and number of neurons in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. Differently, the numbers of nNOS-immunoreactive (IR) neurons were significantly increased in those cerebral areas in ELF-MF-exposed rats. These data suggest that the increase in NO could be due to the increased expression and activation of nNOS in cells. Based on NO signaling in physiological and pathological states, ELF-MF created by electric power systems may induce various physiological changes in modern life.",
