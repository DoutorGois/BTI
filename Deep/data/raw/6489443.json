     "AB": "Corticosterone modulation of the noradrenaline-responsive cyclic AMP generating system was examined in rat hippocampus. Adrenalectomy was found to produce a small but significant elevation in the rate of cyclic AMP formation in response to noradrenaline. Implantation of corticosterone pellets 5 days prior to sacrifice prevented this adrenalectomy-induced increase. Metopirone, an inhibitor of corticosterone synthesis, was also observed to increase cyclic AMP formation. This elevation was seen 2 h following a 50 mg/kg i.p. injection and was completely prevented by corticosterone pellet implantation. Metopirone had no significant effect on cyclic AMP production after 1 h, while a slight but statistically non-significant elevation remained at 4 h. These observations parallel the inhibitory effect of Metopirone on corticosterone synthesis as determined by serum corticosterone levels.",
