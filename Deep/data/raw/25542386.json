     "AB": "Fluctuations in circulating levels of ovarian hormones have been shown to regulate cognition (Sherwin and Grigorova, 2011. Fertil. Steril. 96, 399-403; Shumaker et al., 2004. JAMA. 291, 2947-2958), but increases in estradiol on the day of proestrus yield diverse outcomes: In vivo induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), a model of learning, is reduced in the morning, but optimal in the afternoon (Warren et al., 1995. Brain Res. 703, 26-30). The mechanism underlying this discrepancy is not known. Here, we show that impairments in both CA1 hippocampal LTP and spatial learning observed on the morning of proestrus are due to increased dendritic expression of alpha4betadelta GABAA receptors (GABARs) on CA1 pyramidal cells, as assessed by electron microscopic (EM) techniques, compared with estrus and diestrus. LTP induction and spatial learning were robust, however, when assessed on the morning of proestrus in alpha4-/- mice, implicating these receptors in mediating impaired plasticity. Although alpha4betadelta expression remained elevated on the afternoon of proestrus, increases in 3alpha-OH-THP (3alpha-OH-5alpha-pregnan-20-one) decreased inhibition by reducing outward current through alpha4betadelta GABARs (Shen et al., 2007. Nat. Neurosci. 10, 469-477), in contrast to the usual effect of this steroid to enhance inhibition. Proestrous levels of 3alpha-OH-THP reversed the deficits in LTP and spatial learning, an effect prevented by the inactive metabolite 3beta-OH-THP (10 mg/kg, i.p.), which antagonizes actions of 3alpha-OH-THP. In contrast, administration of 3alpha-OH-THP (10 mg/kg, i.p.) on the morning of proestrus improved spatial learning scores 150-300%. These findings suggest that cyclic fluctuations in ovarian steroids can induce changes in cognition via alpha4betadelta GABARs that are dependent upon 3alpha-OH-THP.
