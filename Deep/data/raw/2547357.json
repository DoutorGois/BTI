     "AB": "The activity of cytochrome c oxidase was studied in aging brain on non-synaptic and intra-synaptic mitochondria from frontal cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 month-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Specific activities of cytochrome oxidase were significantly higher in light synaptic mitochondria than in non-synaptic or heavy ones at all the ages examined. However, enzyme activity in light mitochondria from cerebral cortex remains unchanged during aging, being increased in hippocampus and striatum. These results indicate that aging affected not only the various cerebral area (macroheterogeneity), but also the different mitochondrial populations (subcellular heterogeneity).",
