     "AB": "An unusual case of encephalomyeloneuritis associated with germ cell tumor with mature and immature teratoma arising int he mediastinum is presented. There was an unusually long interval from the onset of neurologic symptoms to the development of malignancy. The histopathology, characterized by limbic encephalitis, brain stem encephalitis, cortical cerebellar degeneration and myeloneuritis, was similar to that of paraneoplastic encephalomyeloneuritis previously described in the literature. Virological and immunological studies failed to demonstrate any causative agents or autoantibodies reacting with brain tissue. The causal relationship between the malignant neoplasm and encephalomyeloneuritis thus seems to be very complex.",
