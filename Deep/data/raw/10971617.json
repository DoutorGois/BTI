     "AB": "Slices from rat hippocampus in organotypic culture were used to study the biosynthesis regulation of chromogranins A and B and secretogranin II. Additionally, we investigated the proteolytic conversion of secretogranin II and the levels of prohormone convertases putatively involved. Forskolin treatment and depolarization with potassium plus BayK 8644 led to significant increases in secretogranin II mRNA in the principal cells of the hippocampus. Enhanced expression of secretogranin II was also reflected by a rise in peptide levels. Despite this induction of biosynthesis the extensive processing to secretoneurin normally observed in brain was maintained. Both forskolin and depolarization upregulated the prohormone convertase (PC)1, but not PC2, indicating that PC1 levels are critical for secretoneurin production under stimulating conditions. Results obtained for chromogranins A and B were less consistent. For chromogranin A mRNA, changes were restricted to granule cells; for chromogranin B, a response in granule cells was observed to depolarization but not to forskolin, and effects in pyramidal neurons were weak. Accordingly, we were unable to detect alterations in chromogranin A and B protein levels. Furthermore, we tested several neurotrophic growth factors and found that only basic fibroblast growth factor raised secretogranin II expression without affecting chromogranins A and B. The hippocampal slice preparation allowed well controlled treatment with identification of neuronal subpopulations and yielded data largely matching experiments in vivo and in cell culture. The pronounced regulation of secretogranin II and its effective processing underlines the importance of the resulting peptide secretoneurin as an active neuropeptide in the nervous system.",
