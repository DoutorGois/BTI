     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the changes of excitatory amino acid (EAA) in patients with cerebral ischemia. METHODS: We observed dynamic changes of EAA in extracellular fluid by intracerebral microdialysis inserted in hippocampus through stereotaxic method with modified Pulsinelli's model of four vessels occlusion. RESULTS: The concentration of Glu was 5.88 +/- 1.40 and 11.2 +/- 1.5 micromol/L in patients with incomplete cerebral ischemia after 30 minutes and 60 minutes, and the concentration of Asp was 2.72 +/- 0.24 and 4.4 +/- 0.6 micromol/L. The concentration of Glu was 15.1 +/- 1.6 micromol/L and 17.9 +/- 1.6 micromol/L in patients with complete cerebral ischemia after 30 minutes and 60 minutes, and the concentration of Asp was 8.2 +/- 1.0 and 12.1 +/- 1.1 micromol/L. The concentration of Glu and Asp was 1.75 +/- 0.88 micromol/L and 0.24 +/- 0.09 micromol/L in the controls. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the concentration of Glu and Asp in patients with cerebral ischemia was significantly increased than in the controls, and the more serious ischemia was, the more release of EAA. It is suggested that Dansen injection can reduce the release of EAA by cerebral cells in case of ischemia.",
