     "AB": "A rapid, sensitive, and reproducible assay is described for the quantitative determination of the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin, their metabolites, and the internal standard 3,4-dihydroxybenzlyamine hydro-bromide in mouse brain homogenate using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The method was validated in the following brain areas: frontal cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. Biogenic amines and relevant metabolites were extracted from discrete brain regions using a simple protein precipitation procedure, and the chromatography was achieved using a C18 column. The method was accurate over the linear range of 0.300-30 ng/mL (r = 0.999) for dopamine and 0.300-15 ng/mL (r = 0.999) for norepinephrine, 3,4-dihydroxybenzlyamine hydro-bromide, homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid, with detection limits of ~0.125 ng/mL (5 pg on column) for each of these analytes. Accuracy and linearity for serotonin were observed throughout the concentration range of 0.625-30 ng/mL (r = 0.998) with an analytical detection limit of ~0.300 ng/mL (12 pg on column). Relative recoveries for all analytes were approximately >/=90% and the analytical run time was <10 min. The described method utilized minimal sample preparation procedures and was optimized to provide the sensitivity limits required for simultaneous monoamine and metabolite analysis in small, discrete brain tissue samples.",
