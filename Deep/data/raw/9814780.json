     "AB": "Hippocampal metabolite concentrations were determined by localized in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) in eleven patients suffering from refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), as well as in eleven age-matched healthy volunteers, and compared with patient history, postoperative outcome and histopathology. Main results are: 1) In patients, the decrease in N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentrations was highly significant ipsilateral, and less but still significant contralateral to the electroencephalogram-defined focus, as compared to controls. 2) The decrease in ipsilateral NAA measured preoperatively correlates with the degree of hippocampal sclerosis but 3) does not reliably predict postoperative outcome, although there is a trend toward better outcome in patients with a marked decrease of NAA. 4) Hippocampal NAA decrease (ipsi- and contralateral) is highly correlated with early onset age of epileptic seizures. 5) Among patients with similar onset age in early childhood, there is a strong association between duration of the disease and contralateral (and, though less clear-cut, ipsilateral) NAA loss. These results are concordant with the notion of a generally progressive worsening and complicating course of symptoms in poorly controlled MTLE.",
