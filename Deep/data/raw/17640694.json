     "AB": "Several natural isomers of the seizurogenic neurotoxin domoic acid (DA) have been found to occur at up to mg/kg levels in shellfish. The aim of the current study was to assess the neurotoxic potency of isodomoic acids A and C (Iso-A and Iso-C), recently isolated from commercial shellfish. Hippocampal slices were obtained from young adult rats and maintained in a tissue recording chamber. Synaptically evoked population spikes were recorded in region CA1 before and after exposure to DA or its isomers. Both Iso-A and Iso-C produced transient neuronal hyperexcitability followed by a dose-dependent suppression of population spikes, but were, respectively, 4- and 20-fold less potent than DA (spike area: EC50 DA=237 nM; Iso-A=939 nM; Iso-C=4.6 microM). In the hippocampus, DA preconditioning induces tolerance to subsequent DA toxicity. However, in the present study neither Iso-A nor Iso-C were effective as preconditioning agents. Competitive binding studies using homomeric GluR6 kainate (kainic acid, KA) receptors showed the affinity of Iso-A to be 40-fold lower than DA (Ki DA=3.35 nM; Iso-A=130 nM). Together with earlier work showing Iso-C affinity at GluR6 receptors to be 240-fold lower than DA, our results suggest that neuroexcitatory effects of Iso-A in CA1 may involve both alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and KA receptors, while Iso-C likely involves the activation of AMPA receptors alone.",
