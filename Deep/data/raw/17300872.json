     "AB": "Kainic acid (KA) induced oxidative stress is associated with hippocampal cell death. Recent studies suggest that curcumin, a potent antioxidant, may provide protection for KA-induced oxidative stress. We investigated the effects of curcumin treatment on hippocampal reactive astrocytes in mice with KA-induced seizures. Eighteen hours after curcumin treatment, mice were treated with KA (30 mg/kg, i.p.), and then sacrificed after a further 48 h. Using cresyl violet staining and TUNEL analysis, histological evaluation revealed cell death in the KA-treated hippocampus. However, marked cell death was not observed in mice treated with curcumin. In addition, curcumin treatment reduced the KA-induced immunoreactivity of caspase-3. Similarly, immunoreactivity analyses indicated that KA causes upregulation of hippocampal GFAP, eNOS, and HO-1 levels, all of which were reduced in animals those received the curcumin treatment. Our findings indicate that curcumin is a potent inhibitor of reactive astrocyte expression and thus, prevents hippocampal cell death. These results also support its potential for use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",
