     "AB": "The postsynaptic density (PSD) protein complex has long been a major target of proteomics in neuroscience. As the number of glutamate receptors on a synapse is one of the main determinants of synaptic efficacy, determining the absolute numbers of receptors in the PSD is necessary for estimating the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) in individual synapses. Moreover, as the receptor molecules are embedded in a macromolecular complex within the PSD, stoichiometry between the receptors and other PSD proteins could help explain the functional and regional specialization of the synapses and their possible roles in synaptic plasticity. Here, I review various studies concerned with the quantification of PSD proteins.",
