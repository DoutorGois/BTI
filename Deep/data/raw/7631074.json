In 22 patients, < 2.0 cm of hippocampus was removed. Postoperatively, 16 (72.7%) were class I (seizure-free), 3 (13.6%) were class II (rare seizures) and 3 (13.6%) were class IV (no worthwhile improvement). In 30 patients, > or = 2.0 cm of hippocampus was removed, and the results were as follows: 21 (70%) were class I, 4 (13.3%) were class II, 1 (3.3%) was class III (worthwhile improvement) and 4 (13.3%) were class IV. Statistically significant differences were not present.",
