     "AB": "Adaptations at the cellular and molecular levels in response to stress and antidepressant treatment could represent a form of neural plasticity that contributes to the pathophysiology and treatment of depression. At the cellular level, atrophy and death of stress-vulnerable neurons in the hippocampus, as well as decreased neurogenesis of hippocampal neurons, has been reported in preclinical studies. Clinical studies also provide evidence for atrophy and cell death in the hippocampus, as well as the prefrontal cortex. It is possible that antidepressant treatment could oppose these adverse cellular effects, which may be regarded as a loss of neural plasticity, by blocking or reversing the atrophy of hippocampal neurons and by increasing cell survival and function. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are discussed, including the role of the cAMP signal transduction cascade and neurotrophic factors.",
