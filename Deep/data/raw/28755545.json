     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To describe the hippocampal stereo-electroencephalogram during sleep according to sleep stages (including N2 sleep) and cycles, together with the hippocampal spindles. METHODS: All patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy undergoing intra-hippocampal implantation between August 2012 and June 2013 at Nancy University Hospital were screened. Six patients with explored hippocampus devoid of pathological features were analyzed. During one night, we identified continuous periods of successive N2, N3 and REM sleep for two full cycles. We performed a spectral analysis of the hippocampal signal for each labeled sleep period. RESULTS: N2, N3 and REM sleeps were individualized according to their spectral powers, for each frequency band and sleep cycle. Hippocampal spindles showed dynamic intrinsic properties, the 11.5-16Hz frequency band being mainly dominant, whereas the 9-11.5Hz frequency band heightening during the beginning and the end of the transient. For N3 and REM sleep stages, the power of the hippocampal signal was significantly decreased between the first and the second sleep cycle. CONCLUSION: Distinct N2 sleep, fast spindles and homeostatic profile are all common properties shared by hippocampus and cortex during sleep. SIGNIFICANCE: The close functional link between hippocampus and cortex may have various sleep-related substrates.",
