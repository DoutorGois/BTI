     "AB": "We investigated the effects of repeated electroconvulsive shock or imipramine treatment on inositol phosphate accumulation and on the reactivity of neurons to metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor agonists in rat hippocampal slices. (1S,3R)-1-carboxycyclopentane-3-acetic acid (1S,3R-ACPD), a nonselective mGlu receptor agonist, caused a concentration-dependent increase in inositol phosphate in slices from the CA1 region of the hippocampus, an effect that was not modified by imipramine or electroconvulsive shock treatment. 1S,3R-ACPD or the selective agonist of the I group of mGlu receptor, (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ((R,S)-3,5-DHPG), produced a concentration-dependent increase of the population spike recorded in the CA1 cell layer. This effect of 1S,3R-ACPD was markedly attenuated by both repeated imipramine and electroconvulsive shock treatment, and the action of (R,S)-3,5-DHPG was markedly attenuated by prolonged imipramine treatment (electroconvulsive shock was not tested). Our results indicate that antidepressant treatment may induce a subsensitivity of group I mGlu receptors when assessed by electrophysiological but not biochemical measures.",
