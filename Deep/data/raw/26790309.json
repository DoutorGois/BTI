     "AB": "Tongluo Xingnao effervescent tablet (TLXNET) is a patented prescription, which comes from modified Xionggui decoction and can improve cognitive function. However, its effect on the urine metabolites and anti-dementia mechanism in the dementia model rats induced by hippocampal injection with Abeta25-35 remains unclear. The experiment focused on the changes in trajectory and inter-relationship among the urinary metabolite of rats in the blank group, Abeta25-35 hippocampal injection dementia model group and the TLXNET intervention group, in order to determine theirs characteristic metabolic markers and explain the anti-dementia effect of TLX-NET base on the change of metabolic trajectory of these bio-markers. According to the experimental results, 5, 6-indolequinone, 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvic acid (4-HPPA), cortisol and 3-thiosulfate lactic were preliminarily identified as the characteristic metabolic markers. They mainly participate in dopamine system, glucocorticoids and energy metabolic pathways. TLXNET can apparently downregulate the disturbances of metabolic trajectory of the four bio-markers. The experiment indicates that the dementia model induced by injecting Abeta25-3 into hippocampus has its characteristic endogenous metabolic markers in urine, and ELXNET can ameliorate dementia by down-regulating the disturbances of metabolic trajectory.",
