     "AB": "Affinities and densities of binding sites for the 5HT1A receptor ligand [3H]8-hydroxy(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([3H]8-OH-DPAT) and the 5HT2 receptor ligand [3H]ketanserin were measured using a rapid filtration assay in crude membrane preparations from frontal cortex and hippocampus of nine cirrhotic patients who died in hepatic encephalopathy and from an equal number of age-matched subjects free from hepatic, neurological or psychiatric disorders. Binding site densities (Bmax) obtained by Scatchard analysis of saturation binding isotherms for [3H]8-OH-DPAT were decreased in frontal cortex (by 56%, P < 0.05) and hippocampus (by 30%, P < 0.05). [3H]ketanserin binding sites were concomitantly increased (by 55%, P < 0.05) in hippocampus of cirrhotic patients. Ligand binding affinities were within normal ranges in all cases. Previous reports have described the accumulation of the 5HT metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and increased activities of the 5HT-metabolizing enzyme MAOA in this same material from patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Taken together, these findings suggest that alterations of serotoninergic function in brain could be responsible for some of the neuropsychiatric symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy observed in humans with chronic liver disease.",
