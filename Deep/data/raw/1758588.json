     "AB": "We investigated the relationship between the hyperglycemia induced by the administration of neostigmine into the hippocampus and the hypothalamus. Prior to the injection of neostigmine (5 x 10(-8) mol) into the hippocampus, 1 microliter each of atropine or hexamethonium (5 x 10(-11)-5 x 10(-8) mol) was injected into the bilateral ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Atropine suppressed in a dose-dependent manner the hyperglycemia induced by hippocampal administration of neostigmine, whereas hexamethonium had no significant effect. These observations suggest that the pathway for this experimental hyperglycemia involves, at least in part, the muscarinic cholinergic neurons in the VMH.",
