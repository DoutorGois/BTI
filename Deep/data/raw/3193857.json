     "AB": "The effects of vinpocetine on hippocampal cell damage and local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) were measured in a rat model of forebrain ischemia (2-vessel occlusion and hypotension). Duration of ischemia was 10 min. LCBF was determined after 2 min of recirculation using the 14C-iodoantipyrine technique. Hippocampal cell loss was quantified histologically 7 days post-ischemia. Intraperitoneal application of vinpocetine (10 mg/kg) 15 min prior to ischemia significantly reduced neuronal cell loss in hippocampal CA 1 sector from 60% to 28%. The drug led to a marked increase in blood flow in cortical areas, whereas LCBF remained unchanged in hippocampus and all other structures measured. It is suggested that the protective effect of vinpocetine does not depend on increased postischemic blood flow.",
