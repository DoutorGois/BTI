     "AB": "Choline alfoscerate (alpha-GPC) is a common choline compound and acetylcholine precursor in the brain, which has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. alpha-GPC has been shown to enhance memory and cognitive function in stroke and Alzheimer's patients but currently remains untested in patients suffering from epilepsy. This study aimed to evaluate whether alpha-GPC treatment after seizure can ameliorate seizure-induced cognitive impairment and neuronal injury. The potential therapeutic effects of alpha-GPC on seizure-induced cognitive impairment were tested in an animal model of pilocarpine-induced seizure. Seizures were induced by intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine (25mg/kg) in male rats. alpha-GPC (250mg/kg) was injected into the intramuscular space once daily for one or three weeks from immediately after seizure, or from 3 weeks after the seizure onset for 3 weeks. Here we found that immediate 1-week treatment of alpha-GPC showed no neuroprotective effects and neurogenesis. Immediate 3-week treatment of alpha-GPC showed neuroprotective effect but no effect on neurogenesis. To evaluate the effect of late treatment of alpha-GPC on cognitive impairment following seizure, rats were injected alpha-GPC from 3 weeks after seizure for 3 weeks and subjected to a water maze test. In the present study, we found that administration of alpha-GPC starting at 3 weeks after seizure improved cognitive function through reduced neuronal death and BBB disruption, and increased neurogenesis. Therefore, alpha-GPC injection may serve as a beneficial treatment for improvement of cognitive function in epilepsy patients.",
