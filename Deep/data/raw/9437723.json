     "AB": "The effects of chronic administration of [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin and [D-Ala2, Glu4]deltorphin II, the selective agonists of the delta 1- and delta 2-opioid receptors, on the binding of [3H]MK-801, a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, were determined in several brain regions of the mouse. Male Swiss-Webster mice were injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin or [D-Ala2, Glu4]deltorphin II (20 micrograms/mouse) twice a day for 4 days. Vehicle injected mice served as controls. Previously we have shown that the above treatment results in the development of tolerance to their analgesic activity. The binding of [3H]MK-801 was determined in brain regions (cortex, midbrain, pons and medulla, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus and amygdala). At 5 nM-concentration, the binding of [3H]MK-801 was increased in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and pons and medulla of [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin treated mice. In [D-Ala2, Glu4]deltorphin II treated mice, the binding of [3H]MK-801 was increased in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The changes in the binding were due to increases in the Bmax value of [3H]MK-801. It is concluded that tolerance to delta 1- and delta 2-opioid receptor agonists is associated with up-regulation of brain N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, however, some brain areas affected differ with the two treatments. The results are consistent with the recent observation from this laboratory that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors antagonists block tolerance to the analgesic action of delta 1- and delta 2-opioid receptor agonists.",
