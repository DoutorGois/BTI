     "AB": "The neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia, which was established 30 years ago and discussed controversially for a long time, postulates that pre- and perinatally acting cerebral noxae cause disturbances of corticogenesis in the developing neuronal fibre systems which are essential for later onset of the disease. During recent years the cerebral alterations of schizophrenic patients could be further characterized as area-, layer-, and cell type-specific changes in temporolimbic and frontal regions leading to specific abnormalities of intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity. Animal models allowed for realistic imitations of these structural lesions and for elucidating their functional consequences concerning transmitter systems and behaviour. With modern neuroimaging techniques microstructural changes and alterations in cerebral activation can be exactly demonstrated and related to the specific psychopathologic features of schizophrenia.",
