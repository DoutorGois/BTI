     "AB": "A variety of extracellular signals are transduced across the cell membrane by the enzyme phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-beta (PLC-beta) coupled with guanine-nucleotide-binding G proteins. There are four isoenzymes of PLC-beta, beta1-beta4, but their functions in vivo are not known. Here we investigate the role of PLC-beta1 and PLC-beta4 in the brain by generating null mutations in mice: we found that PLCbeta1-/- mice developed epilepsy and PLCbeta4-/- mice showed ataxia. We determined the molecular basis of these phenotypes and show that PLC-beta1 is involved in signal transduction in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus by coupling predominantly to the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, whereas PLC-beta4 works through the metabotropic glutamate receptor in the cerebellum, illustrating how PLC-beta isoenzymes are used to generate different functions in the brain.",
