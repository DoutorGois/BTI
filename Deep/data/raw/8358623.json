     "AB": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) may mediate some of the neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to cocaine. In this study, the distribution of CRF-like immunoreactivity (CRF-LI) was determined in the hypothalamus and in several extrahypothalamic brain regions after acute cocaine administration in handled rats. CRF-LI decreased dose-dependently with cocaine administration in the hypothalamus and in the basal-forebrain structures. A small dose of cocaine (7.5 mg/kg) decreased CRF-LI in the hippocampus and in the frontal cortex. A significant, selective, dose-dependent increase in CRF-LI was found in the amygdala after cocaine injection. None of the investigated doses of cocaine altered CRF-LI in the striatum. These results suggest that acute cocaine administration alters brain CRF systems to contribute behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to cocaine.",
