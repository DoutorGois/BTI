     "AB": "In the present study, the protective effects of puerarin (Pur) on learning and memory in ovariectomized mice were investigated. One week after ovariectomy (Ovx) or sham operation, female mice were given a 4-week treatment of Pur (50 or 100 mg/kg,i.p.) or estradiol benzoate (EB, I or 5 pg/day, i.p.). The results showed that, following treatment with 50 or 100 mg/kg Pur in Ovx mice, the training times for achieved learning criterion in aY-maze declined by 11.8 % and 17.8 % (P > 0.05 and P < 0.05), and that memory retention increased by 23.3 % and 28.3 % (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05), respectively. In addition, the prolonged escape latency of platform finding in a water maze was shortened by 15.5% and 23.8% (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05). After a behavior test,the levels of glutamate (Glu) and GABA in the frontal cortex and hippocampus were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that 100 mg/kg Pur normalized the levels of Glu and GABA in the hippocampus of Ovx mice, while the Glu level was significantly elevated from 24.1+/- 4.5 to 27.9+/- 3.5 mg/g protein (P < 0.05), and GABA was decreased from 5.64+/- 1.06 to 4.73+/- 0.85 mg/g protein (P < 0.05). The results indicated that Pur possessed phytoestrogen activity,and long-term treatment of Pur ameliorated learning and memory deficits of Ovx mice through affecting the activity of the glutamatergic/GABAergic system in the hippocampus.",
