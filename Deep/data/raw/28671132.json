     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive cognitive impairment in the aged. The aggregation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is a hallmark of AD and is linked to synapse loss and cognitive impairment. Capsaicin, a specific agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), has been proven to ameliorate stress-induced AD-like pathological and cognitive impairments, but it is unclear whether TRPV1 activation can affect cognitive and synaptic functions in Abeta-induced mouse model of AD. In this study, we investigated the effects of TRPV1 activation on spatial memory and synaptic plasticity in mice treated with Abeta. To induce AD-like pathological and cognitive impairments, adult C57Bl/6 mice were microinjected with Abeta42 (100 muM, 2.5 mul/mouse, i.c.v.). Two weeks after Abeta42 microinjection, spatial learning and memory as well as hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) were examined. The results showed that Abeta42 microinjection significantly impaired spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests compared with controls. These behavioral changes were accompanied by synapse loss and impaired LTP in the CA1 area of hippocampus. More importantly, daily capsaicin (1 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment throughout the experiment dramatically improved spatial learning and memory and synaptic function, as reflected by enhanced hippocampal LTP and reduced synapse loss, whereas the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment had no effects on cognitive and synaptic function in Abeta42-treated mice. These results indicate that TRPV1 activation by capsaicin rescues cognitive deficit in the Abeta42-induced mouse model of AD both structurely and functionally.",
