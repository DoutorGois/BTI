     "AB": "The distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT)-containing nerve fibers and terminals in the septal area of the rat was studied by using immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies to 5-HT in combination with fluorescent retrograde tracing methods. The 5-HT innervation of the septum is heterogeneous with regard to both the morphology of individual processes and the density of distribution in different parts of the septum. Three major classes of 5-HT like immunoreactive processes can be distinguished: 1) thin, convoluted fibers with small, round or elongated varicosities; 2) thick and relatively straight fibers with few varicosities; and 3) pericellular plexuses with large varicosities in close association with perikarya in the lateral septum. Three areas of the septum receive a prominent innervation by 5-HT processes: the diagonal band of Broca, the ventral part of the lateral septum, and an area bordering the medial edge of the islands of Calleja (insula magna). Whereas the two latter areas contain dense terminal networks, the diagonal band of Broca is occupied primarily by 5-HT fibers en route to other parts of the septum. Intraseptal injections of HRP or fluorescent dyes (granular blue, propidium iodide) resulted in retrograde labeling of neuronal cell bodies in several nuclei of the brainstem which are known to contain 5-HT neurons: the dorsal raphe, the median raphe, the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, the raphe pontis, and the raphe magnus. Where fluorescent retrograde tracing was performed with 5-HT immunohistochemistry on the same tissue section, a prominent 5-HT containing pathway and a non-5-HT-containing pathway from the raphe nuclei to the septum were revealed. Finally, double retrograde fluorescent labeling after injections of granular blue or propidium iodide into the septum and entorhinal area respectively of the same rat revealed extensive branching of the raphe efferents. Thus, individual raphe neurons may simultaneously connect with septum and the entorhinal area, two structures essential for normal hippocampal function.",
