     "AB": "In present study, we investigated voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC) expressions in the hippocampus of the Mongolian gerbil and its association with different sequelae of spontaneous seizures, in an effort to identify the epileptogenesis in this animal. In the hippocampus of pre-seizure seizure sensitive (SS) gerbils, VGCC subunit expressions were significantly elevated, as compared with seizure-resistant (SR) gerbils. In 3 h postictal group, the alteration of VGCC expressions showed regional- and neuronal-specific manners; VGCC immunoreactivities in principal neurons were markedly decreased; however, their immunoreactivities in interneurons were significantly elevated. These results are the first comprehensive description of the distribution of VGCC immunoreactivities in the normal and epileptic hippocampus of gerbils, and suggest that these alterations in the hippocampus of the SS gerbil may be related with tissue excitability and have a role in modulating recurrent excitation following seizures.",
