     "AB": "It is not clear how different spatial compartments in the neuron are affected during epileptiform activity. In the present study we have examined the spatial and temporal profiles of depolarization induced changes in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in the dendrites of cultured autaptic hippocampal pyramidal neurons rendered epileptic experimentally by treatment with kynurenate (2 mM) and Mg(2+) (11.3 mM) in culture (treated neurons). This was examined with simultaneous somatic patch-pipette recording and Ca(2+) imaging experiments using the Ca(2+) indicator Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1. Neurons stimulated by depolarization under whole-cell voltage clamp conditions revealed Ca(2+) entry at localized sites in the dendrites. Ca(2+) transients were observed even in the presence of NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists suggesting that the opening of voltage gated calcium channels primarily triggered the local Ca(2+) changes. Peak Ca(2+) transients in the dendrites of treated neurons were larger compared to the signals recorded from the control neurons. Dendritic Ca(2+) transients in treated neurons showed a distance dependent scaling. Estimation of dendritic local Ca(2+) diffusion coefficients indicated higher values in the treated neurons and a higher availability of free Ca(2+). Simulation studies of Ca(2+) dynamics in these localized dendritic compartments indicate that local Ca(2+) buffering and removal mechanisms may be affected in treated neurons. Our studies indicate that small dendritic compartments are rendered more vulnerable to changes in intracellular Ca(2+) following induction of epileptiform activity. This can have important cellular consequences including local membrane excitability through mechanisms that remain to be elucidated.",
