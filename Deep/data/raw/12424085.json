     "AB": "The temporopolar region is not clearly defined from an anatomical point of view. A line going through the rostral area of the inferior temporal, occipito temporal and superior temporal sulci is considered to represent its posterior limit on the lateral and inferior sides. On the internal side, this posterior limit corresponds to the rhinal sulcus, an anterior and internal extention of the collateral sulcus. From a cyto-architectonic point of view, the temporopolar region is caracterized by a dysgranular paralimbic cortex which ensures the transition between allo- and isocortical areas. The temporal pole is mainly connected with the amygadala, the hippocampus, the superior temporal gyrus, and the occipitobasal cortex, but also with the orbitary gyrus and the insula with which it forms the insulo-orbito-polar-temporo-complex. The temporal pole occupies the most rostral part of the temporal lobe and can only be accurately defined once the anatomy of the temporal lobe as a whole has been outlined. The architectonic configuration of this region as well as its connections with the limbic system, and the superior, orbital and insular temporal cortices make it a discrete temporal structure. Understanding the anatomical and functional organization of the temporal pole enables us to hypothesize about the role played by this structure in the pathogenesis of the forms of epilepsy originating in mesial temporal lobe structures.",
