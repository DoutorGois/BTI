     "AB": "Astrocytes function as spatial K(+) buffers by expressing a rich repertoire of K(+) channels. Earlier studies suggest that acid-sensitive tandem-pore K(+) channels, mainly TWIK-related acid-sensitive K(+) (TASK) channels, mediate part of the passive astroglial membrane conductance. Here, using a combination of electrophysiology and pharmacology, we investigated the presence of TASK-like conductance in hippocampal astrocytes of rat brain slices. Extracellular pH shifts to below 7.4 (or above 7.4) induced a prominent inward (or outward) current in astrocytes in the presence of tetrodotoxin, a Na(+) channel blocker, and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, a co-transporter blocker. The pH-sensitive current was insensitive to quinine, a potent blocker of tandem-pore K(+) channels including TWIK-1 and TREK-1 channels. Voltage-clamp analysis revealed that the pH-sensitive current exhibited weak outward rectification with a reversal potential of -112 mV, close to the Nernst equilibrium potential for K(+) . Furthermore, the current-voltage relationship was well fitted with the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equation for the classical open-rectifier 'leak' K(+) channel. The pH-sensitive K(+) current was potentiated by TASK channel modulators such as the volatile anesthetic isoflurane but depressed by the local anesthetic bupivacaine. However, unlike TASK channels, the pH-sensitive current was insensitive to Ba(2+) and quinine. Thus, the molecular identity of the pH-sensitive leak K(+) channel is unlikely to be attributable to TASK channels. Taken together, our results suggest a novel yet unknown leak K(+) channel underlying the pH- and anesthetic-sensitive background conductance in hippocampal astrocytes.",
