     "AB": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was produced in Sprague Dawley rats by injection of 0.30 mL of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna. Tissue lipid peroxide, quantified as thiobarbituric acid reactive material (TBAR), and Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity were assayed in three different rat brain areas (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and brain stem) of sham-operated rats and in four hemorrhagic rat groups at 30 min, 1 h, 6 h, and 2 d after SAH. Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity decreased in the cerebral cortex at 30 min, 1 h, and 6 h and in the brain stem at 1 h after SAH induction, whereas enzymatic activity was unchanged in the hippocampus. There was no evident difference in lipid peroxide content between sham-operated animals and hemorrhagic animals. These results indicate that little modifications in lipid peroxidative process (as expressed in TBAR) are not responsible for changes in the ATPase activity.",
