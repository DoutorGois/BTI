     "AB": "In models of focal cerebral ischemia, adenoviral gene transfer is often attenuated or delayed versus naive. After controlled cortical impact (CCI)-induced traumatic brain injury in mice, CA1 and CA3 hippocampus exhibit delayed neuronal death by 3 days, with subsequent near complete loss of hippocampus by 21 days. We hypothesized that adenoviral-mediated expression of the reporter gene beta-Galactosidase (beta-Gal) in hippocampus would be attenuated after CCI in mice. C57BL6 mice (n = 16) were subjected to either CCI to left parietal cortex or sham (burr hole). Adenovirus carrying the beta-Gal gene (AdlacZ; 1 x 10(9) plaque-forming units [pfu]/mL) was then injected into left dorsal hippocampus. At 24 or 72 h, beta-Gal expression was quantified (mU/mg protein). Separate mice (n = 10) were used to study beta-Gal spatial distribution in brain sections. Beta-Gal expression in left hippocampus was similar in shams at 24 h (48.4 +/- 4.1) versus 72 h (68.8 +/- 8.8, not significant). CCI did not reduce beta-Gal expression in left hippocampus (68.8 +/- 8.8 versus 88.1 +/- 7.0 at 72 h, sham versus CCI, not significant). In contrast, CCI reduced beta-Gal expression in right (contralateral) hippocampus versus sham (p < 0.05 at both 24 and 72 h). Beta-Gal was seen in many cell types in ipsilateral hippocampus, including CA3 neurons. Despite eventual loss of ipsilateral hippocampus, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was surprisingly robust early after CCI providing an opportunity to test novel genes targeting delayed hippocampal neuronal death.",
