     "AB": "Neuromedin U (NMU) is a family of peptides found in the gut and the central nervous system [Neuroscience 25 (1988) 797; Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 130 (1985) 1078]. While several peripheral activities such as uterus stimulating and hypertensive effects have been described for NMU [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 130 (1985) 1078], its role in the CNS remains poorly understood. Recently, we reported the identification of two receptors for NMU (NMU1R and NMU2R), and demonstrated that NMU may play a role in regulating feeding behavior. The central effect of NMU is likely mediated primarily via NMU2R, since NMU1R is detectable only in the periphery, but not in the brain [Nature 406 (2000) 70]. In this report, we describe detailed mapping of NMU2R mRNA expression in the rat brain by in situ hybridization. The most intense signals were observed in the ependymal cell layer along the wall of the third ventricle in the hypothalamus, CA1 region of the hippocampus, indusium griseum and septohippocampal nucleus. Moderate expression was detected in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus as well as a number of other brain structures. The presence of NMU2R in the hypothalamus is consistent with its role in energy balance. Significant levels of expression of NMU2R elsewhere in the brain may suggest additional physiological functions for this neuropeptide.",
