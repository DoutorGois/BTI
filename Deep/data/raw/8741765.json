     "AB": "It is generally believed that neuronal growth cone collapsing factors are proteins that interact with membrane-bound receptors. Platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PAF) - a phospholipid autocoid, also interacts with a membrane-bound neuronal receptor which is similar in nature to collapsing factor receptors. We report that PAF and the nonhydrolyzable PAF agonist, methyl carbamyl PAF (1-O-hexadecyl-2N-methylcarbamyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, mc-PAF), evoke a dose-dependent neuronal growth cone collapse. This collapse is specifically attenuated by the PAF receptor antagonist BN-52021. These data point to a PAF receptor-mediated growth cone collapse. Therefore, PAF must be added to the list of collapsing factors which potentially guide axons to their proper targets in the developing nervous system.",
