     "AB": "The induction in the animal brain of immediate early genes (IEGs) is known to be age-dependent, and it was suggested that, during neonatal period, signaling pathways for the induction of IEGs are immature. In this study, we investigated the induction of various IEGs in neonatal rat hippocampus after electroconvulsive shock (ECS). ECS did not induce c-fos and junB in the hippocampus of 7-day-old rat, but these genes were weakly induced at postnatal 14 days and to an adult level at postnatal 21 days; two other IEGs, TIS1 (NGFI-B, nur77) and TIS8 (zif-268, Egr-1, Krox-24, NGFI-A), were induced at postnatal 7 days, however. Our results suggested that during the neonatal period, signaling pathways for TIS1 and TIS8 induction in rat hippocampus after ECS are complete, while those for c-fos and junB are immature.",
