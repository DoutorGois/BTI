     "AB": "It is difficult to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 of hippocampal slices from 120-day-old rats when a single 100 Hz, 1 s tetanus is administered in extracellular solution containing 2.0 mM calcium and 2.0 mM magnesium. However, in the presence of 2.5 mM calcium and 1.3 mM magnesium LTP is reliably induced by this same stimulus. Although the amplitude of LTP is similar to that observed in slices from 30-day-old rats, LTP in slices from mature rats is not inhibited by MK-801 but is blocked by nifedipine. These results suggest that factors contributing to LTP in slices from mature rats require careful consideration under different experimental paradigms.",
