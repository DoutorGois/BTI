     "AB": "Effects of centrally (intracerebro-ventricularly) administered synthetic substance P on the metabolism of cAMP in 19 brain areas were investigated. Substance P administration increased cAMP levels considerably in the frontal cortex, the central gray matter and in the nucleus of the solitary tract, and to a lesser extent in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus. Cyclic AMP levels were decreased in the globus pallidus, the habenula, the posterior hypothalamic nucleus and in the locus coeruleus while other brain areas showed no changes in cAMP levels.",
