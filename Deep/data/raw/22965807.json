     "AB": "We present the design, analysis, construction, and culture results of a microfluidic device for the segregation and chemical stimulation of primary rat hippocampal neurons. Our device is designed to achieve spatio-temporal solute delivery to discrete sections of neurons with mitigated mechanical stress. We implement a geometric guidance technique to direct axonal processes of the neurons into specific areas of the device to achieve solute segregation along routed cells. Using physicochemical modeling, we predict flows, concentration profiles, and mechanical stresses within pertiment sections of the device. We demonstrate cell viability and growth within the closed device over a period of 11 days. Additionally, our modeling methodology may be generalized and applied to other device geometries.",
