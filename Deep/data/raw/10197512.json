     "AB": "Although stroke in humans usually afflicts the elderly, most experimental studies on the nature of cerebral ischemia have used young animals. This is especially important when studying restorative processes that are age dependent. To explore the potential of older animals to initiate regenerative processes after cerebral ischemia, the authors studied the expression of the juvenile-specific cytoskeletal protein, microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1B, and the adult-specific protein, MAP2, in male Sprague-Dawley rats at 3 months and 20 months of age. The levels of MAP1B and MAP2 transcripts and the corresponding proteins declined with increasing age in the hippocampus. In the cortex, the levels of the transcripts did not change significantly with age, but the morphologic features of immunostained fibers were clearly affected by age; that is, cortical MAP1B fibers became thicker, and MAP2 fibers, more diffuse, in aged rats. Focal cerebral ischemia, produced by reversible occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, resulted in a large decrease in the expression of both MAP1B and MAP2 in the infarct core at the messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels. However, at 1 week after the stroke, there was vigorous expression of MAP1B and its messenger ribonucleic acid, as well as MAP2 protein, in the border zone adjacent to the infarct of 3-month-old and 20 month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. The upregulation of these key cytologic elements generally was diminished in aged rats compared with young animals, although the morphologic features of fibers in the infarct border zone were similar in both age groups. These results suggest that the regenerative potential of the aged rat brain appears to be competent, although attenuated, at least with respect to MAP1B and MAP2 expression up to 20 months of age.",
