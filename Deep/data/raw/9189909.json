     "AB": "We carried out multi-dipole estimation and pursued spatio-temporal brain activity on a time scale of several milliseconds during an auditory discrimination task using a whole-cortex type SQUID system. Neuronal activities were estimated in the medial (hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, etc.) and lateral temporal cortices (superior and middle temporal gyri, etc.), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (middle and inferior frontal gyri, etc.) and the parietal cortex (supramarginal gyrus, etc.) in the 280-400 ms latency range. The activity in the posterior hippocampal region was the most prominent and long-lasting in parallel with the activities in the other regions. Therefore, the posterior hippocampal region is a central structure engaged in auditory discrimination. The whole-cortex neuromagnetic measurements provided the possibility of imaging the time-varying activities of the human cortico-hippocampal neural networks.",
