     "AB": "This study utilized Timm histochemistry and immunocytochemistry to determine the prolonged effects of kainic acid on the distribution of dynorphin- and enkephalin-containing mossy fibers in the rat dentate gyrus at progressive time points following kainic acid injection. Beginning 1-2 weeks after kainic acid administration, a progressive increase in the distribution and intensity of staining for supragranular zinc, dynorphin and enkephalin was observed in the dentate gyrus. The kainic acid-induced sprouting of mossy fibers containing dynorphin and enkephalin strongly resembles the pattern observed in the dentate gyrus of humans with temporal lobe epilepsy.",
