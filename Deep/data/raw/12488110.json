     "AB": "Stressful events during gestation and in the neonatal period have important effects on the later physical and mental health of the offspring. The present study tested the hypothesis that pre- and/or postnatal stress would affect seizure susceptibility in infant and adult rats, using the hippocampal kindling model. Prenatal stress consisted of daily restraint of the dam under bright light (for 45 min, 3 x / day) during either early gestation or mid/late gestation. Pups were compared to pups born to unstressed dams. Postnatal stress (administered on Days 4 and 5 after birth) consisted of either separation from the dam and placement in the bedding of a strange male for 1 h or injection of dexamethasone. Pups were compared to nonstressed siblings of the same litter. Both early and mid/late-gestation prenatal stress significantly lowered the after-discharge threshold (ADT) in infant, 14-day-old rat offspring, as compared to nonstressed control offspring. This effect on ADT was lost by adulthood. Mid/late-gestation stress increased the rate of kindled seizure development in infant rats and in their adult male, but not female, siblings. Postnatal stress had no significant effect on ADT or kindling rate. These findings indicate that prenatal stress, particularly during the latter half of pregnancy, may play an important role in increasing seizure vulnerability in the unborn offspring. These effects are more pronounced in infancy, but can also extend to adulthood.",
