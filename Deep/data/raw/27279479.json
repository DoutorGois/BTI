     "AB": "Dan-zhi-xiao-yao-san is a Traditional Chinese Medicinal formulation widely used for the treatment of neuropsychological disorders. The present study examined the anxiolytic and neuroprotective effects of Dan-zhi-xiao-yao-san in a rat model of chronic stress. The results of an elevated plus maze test showed that Danzhixiaoyaosan significantly attenuated the levels of anxiety-induced stress as evidenced by increases in the time spent in the open arm region, as well as the percentage of entries into this area. In addition, Dan-zhi-xiao-yao-san alleviated stressinduced neuronal death, as indicated by histological examination. Furthermore, mechanistic studies suggested that the anxiolytic and neuroprotective effects of Dan-zhi-xiao-yao-san may be mediated via attenuation of chronic stressinduced upregulation of alphasynuclein and corticosterone, and downregulation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in the hippocampal region of the brain at the mRNA and protein level. In addition, Danzhixiaoyaosan decreased the serum levels of stressinduced corticosterone in the model animals. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that Danzhixiaoyaosan exerted anxiolytic and neuroprotective effects in a rat model of chronic stress via attenuation of stressinduced upregulation of alphasynuclein and corticosterone, and downregulation of PP2A in the hippocampus.",
