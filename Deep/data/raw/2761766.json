     "AB": "Embryonic mouse hippocampi (E17) were placed in the anterior eye chamber of young adult rats. The transplants were photographed twice a week. Initially the transplants increased in size, thereafter focal bleeding occurred and later regression of the transplants was seen. Regression continued until the transplants were no longer macroscopically visible. At this time the eyes were prepared for histological examination. Comparison of these transplants with immature rat hippocampi transplanted to the anterior eye chamber of rats, and with mouse-rat in vitro co-cultures suggests that the regression is a result of an immunological response.",
