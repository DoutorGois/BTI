     "AB": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) containing different GluN2 subunits play distinct roles in synaptic plasticity. Such differences may not only be determined by the channel properties, but also by differential surface distribution and synaptic localization.In the present study, using a Cy3-conjugated Fab fragment of the GFP antibody to label surface-located GluN2 subunits tagged with GFP at the N-terminus,we observed the membrane distribution patterns of GluN2A- or GluN2B-containing NMDARs in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We found that surface NMDARs containing GluN2A, but not those containing GluN2B,were inclined to cluster at DIV7. Swapping the carboxyl termini of the GluN2 subunits completely reversed these distribution patterns. In addition, surface NMDARs containing GluN2A were preferentially associated with PSD-95. Taken together, the results of our study suggest that the clustering distribution of GluN2A containing NMDARs is determined by the GluN2AC-terminus, and its interaction with PSD-95 plays animportant role in this process.",
