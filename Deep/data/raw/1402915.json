     "AB": "The effects of sodium valproate (VPA; 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, i.p.) on ventral hippocampal and anterior caudate putamen extracellular levels of dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were examined using in vivo microdialysis. VPA induced dose-related increases in dialysate DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 5-HT in the ventral hippocampus. Anterior caudate putamen dialysate 5-HT was also dose dependently elevated by the drug, whereas DA levels tended to decrease with increasing VPA dose. In contrast, VPA (200, 400, and 800 mg/kg, i.p.) produced no significant elevation of DA in posterior caudate putamen dialysates, although 5-HT levels were significantly elevated at the 400- and 800-mg/kg doses. In all three regions studied, dialysate concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and homovanillic acid remained at basal levels following VPA treatments. The results are discussed with regard to the possible anticonvulsant mode of action of VPA.",
