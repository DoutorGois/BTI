     "AB": "A protein fraction purified from bovine brain myelin, previously called arretin because of its ability to inhibit neurite outgrowth, has been identified as consisting predominantly of oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp). We show that it is a potent inhibitor of neurite outgrowth from rat cerebellar granule and hippocampal cells; from dorsal root ganglion explants in which growth cone collapse was observed; from rat retinal ganglion neurons; and from NG108 and PC12 cells. OMgp purified by a different procedure from both mouse and human myelin behaves identically in all bioassays tested.",
