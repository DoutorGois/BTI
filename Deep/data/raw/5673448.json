     "AB": "Radioactivity was found in cell bodies of neurons and glial cells throughout brains of male and female rats that had been injected with either testosterone-H(3) or estradiol-H(3). Uptake by limbic and hypothalamic structures was higher and longer lasting than that in nonlimbic structures. In all brains, the preoptic area, prepiriform cortex, olfactory tubercle, and septum had particularly high, long-lasting uptake of both hormones.",
