     "AB": "It is well known that nitric oxide (NO) acts downstream of NMDA receptor activation, which regulates the neural plasticity in the brain. In the present study, the effect of L-NAME, a non-selective nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, on neural plasticity in the hippocampus was investigated. L-NAME increased the expression of PSA-NCAM and pCREB in the adult rat hippocampus. The co-localization of PSA-NCAM and pCREB indicates a possible relationship between the two in the granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus. Our results demonstrate that NO, as a subsignal of NMDA receptors, could be involved in the structural plasticity of the granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus by regulating the expression of PSA-NCAM and pCREB in the hippocampus.",
