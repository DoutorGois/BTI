     "PG": "1346-51",
     "AB": "HA-966 (1-hydroxy-3-aminopyrrolidone-2) is an antagonist at the glycine allosteric site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ionophore complex. Unlike presently known glycine antagonists, HA-966 is chiral. We report stereoselectivity for the (R)-enantiomer at the glycine antagonist site. In [3H]glycine binding, the (R)-enantiomer has an IC50 of 4.1 +/- 0.6 microM. The racemic mixture has an IC50 of 11.2 +/- 0.5 microM, whereas (S)-HA-966 has an IC50 greater than 900 microM. In glycine-stimulated [3H]1-[1-(2- thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine binding, the (R)-enantiomer inhibits with an IC50 of 121 +/- 61 microM, whereas the racemic mixture has an IC50 of 216 +/- 113 microM and (S)-HA-966 is inactive. The inhibition by (R)-HA-966 can be prevented by the addition of glycine. (R)-HA-966 and racemic HA-966, but not (S)-HA-966, also prevent N-methyl-D-aspartate cytotoxicity in cortical cultures. The (R)-enantiomer and, less potently, the (S)-enantiomer inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release from rat hippocampal slices (IC50 values of about 0.3 mM and 1.6 mM, respectively), but only the inhibition by (R)-HA-966 is reversed by added glycine. In glutamate-evoked contractions of the guinea pig ileum, (R)-HA-966 causes a glycine-reversible inhibition (IC50 of about 150 microM), whereas (S)-HA-966 is much less potent (IC50 of greater than 1 mM). These results demonstrate stereoselectivity of the glycine antagonist site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex in a variety of tissues and assays. The stereoselectivity also confirms the specificity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in glutamate-evoked contractions of the guinea pig ileum, and supports their similarity to central N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.",
