     "AB": "Neuronal activity elicits a rapid increase in the expression of several immediate early genes (IEGs). To clarify a role for IEG response in activity-dependent development, we examined the contribution of the egr1/zif268 gene during visual cortical processing and plasticity in mice. We first analyzed the expression of egr1 mRNA in wild-type (WT) mice using Northern blot hybridization. In the visual cortex, expression of egr1 mRNA increased dramatically after eye opening, systemic injection of kainate, or 30 min of photostimulation after a brief (5 d) period of dark adaptation. Thus, the expression of egr1 is regulated by synaptic activity in the mouse visual cortex, as it is in other species (e.g., monkeys, cats, and rats). To evaluate whether this transcription factor is directly involved in activity-dependent plasticity, mice lacking Egr1 were deprived of the use of one eye during the developmental critical period [postnatal day 24 (P24)-P34]. Extracellular in vivo single-unit recordings from the binocular zone of the visual cortex revealed that visual responses developed normally in egr1 knock-out (KO) mice. Moreover, a similarly significant shift of responsiveness in favor of the open eye was produced in both KO and WT mice by either brief (4 d) or long-term (>2 weeks) occlusion of one eye. There was no apparent compensation among egr2, egr3, or c-fos mRNA and protein expression in the visual cortex of egr1 KO mice. Taken together, these results indicate that egr1 is a useful marker of sensory input in mice but is not intrinsically necessary for the experience-dependent plasticity of the visual cortex. Our findings underscore a mechanistic distinction between sensory plasticity and long-lasting forms of synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus, for which egr1/zif268 was recently found to be essential.",
