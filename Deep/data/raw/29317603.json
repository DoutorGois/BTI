     "AB": "Memory performance is severely impaired in individuals with schizophrenia. Although several studies have reported a relationship between memory performance and hippocampal volume, only a few structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have investigated the relationship between memory performance and subcortical structures other than hippocampus in patients with schizophrenia. We investigated the relationship between memory performance and subcortical regional volumes in a large sample of patients with schizophrenia. Participants included 174 patients with schizophrenia and 638 healthy comparison subjects (HCS). The Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) has three memory indices (verbal immediate recall, visual immediate recall, and delayed recall (verbal plus visual)) and one control neurocognitive index (attention/concentration). We obtained T1-weighted MRI data and measured the bilateral volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, nucleus accumbens (NA), caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus. Patients with schizophrenia had significantly lower scores for all of the indices of the WMS-R than the HCS. They had more severe impairments in verbal immediate recall and delayed recall than in visual immediate recall and attention/concentration. Verbal immediate recall/delayed recall scores in patients with schizophrenia were significantly correlated not only with hippocampal volume (left: r = 0.34; right: r = 0.28/left: r = 0.33; right: r = 0.31), but also with NA volume (left: r = 0.24; right: r = 0.25/left: r = 0.26; right: r = 0.27). The present investigation with a large sample size did not only replicate hippocampal volume and memory association, but also found that NA volume is associated with memory performances in schizophrenia.",
