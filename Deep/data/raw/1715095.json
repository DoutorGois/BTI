     "AB": "The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a subtype of glutamate receptors, plays a key role in synaptic plasticity in the nervous system. After NMDA receptor activation, calcium entry into the postsynaptic neuron is a critical initial event. However, the subsequent mechanisms by which the NMDA receptor signal is processed are incompletely understood. Stimulation of cultured rat hippocampal cells with glutamate resulted in the rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of a 39-kilodalton protein (p39). Tyrosine phosphorylation of p39 was triggered by the NMDA receptor and required an influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium. Because p39 was found to be highly related or identical to the microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase, the NMDA receptor signal may be processed by a sequential activation of protein kinases.",
