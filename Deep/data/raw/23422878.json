     "AB": "Chronic alcohol intake is known to induce permanent cognitive deficits along with enhanced oxidative-nitrosative stress and activation of neuroinflammatory cascade. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic phytoalexin against chronic alcohol-induced cognitive dysfunction and neuroiflammatory cascade in the brain of adult rats chronically administered ethanol. Male Wistar rats were adminstered ethanol (10g/kg; oral gavage) for ten weeks and treated with resveratrol (5, 10 and 20mg/kg) for the same duration. Ethanol-exposed rats showed impaired spatial navigation in the Morris water maze test and poor retention in the elevated plus maze task which was coupled with enhanced acetylcholinesterase activity, increased oxidative-nitrosative stress, cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta), NF-kappa beta and caspase-3 levels in different brain regions (cerebral cortex and hippocampus) of ethanol-treated rats. Co-administration with resveratrol significantly and dose-dependently prevented all the behavioral, biochemical and molecular deficits. Correlatively, the results of the present study revealed that treatment with resveratrol significantly prevented cognitive deficits induced by chronic ethanol exposure not only by modulating oxido-nitrosative stress but also by attenuating the enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta), NF-kbeta and caspase-3 in different brain regions of ethanol treated rats. Therefore, mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol observed in our study may be due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuromodulating activities.",
