     "AB": "It has been proposed that lithium is effective in bipolar disorder (BD) by inhibiting glutamatergic neurotransmission, particularly via N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). To test this hypothesis and to see if the neurotransmission could involve the NMDAR-mediated activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), to release arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipid, we administered subconvulsant doses of NMDA to unanesthetized rats fed a chronic control or LiCl diet. We used quantitative autoradiography following the intravenous injection of radiolabeled AA to measure regional brain incorporation coefficients k* for AA, which reflect receptor-mediated activation of PLA2. In control diet rats, NMDA (25 and 50 mg/kg i.p.) compared with i.p. saline increased k* significantly in 49 and 67 regions, respectively, of the 83 brain regions examined. The regions affected were those with reported NMDARs, including the neocortex, hippocampus, caudate-putamen, thalamus, substantia nigra, and nucleus accumbens. The increases could be blocked by pretreatment with the specific noncompetitive NMDA antagonist MK-801 ((5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate) (0.3 mg/kg i.p.), as well by a 6-week LiCl diet sufficient to produce plasma and brain lithium concentrations known to be effective in BD. MK-801 alone reduced baseline values for k* in many brain regions. The results show that it is possible to image NMDA signaling via PLA2 activation and AA release in vivo, and that chronic lithium blocks this signaling, consistent with its suggested mechanism of action in BD.",
