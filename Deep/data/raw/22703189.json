     "AB": "It is well known that astrocytic and neuronal transmitter release processes are important for signalling, and that activity-dependent release of adenosine nucleotides and transmitters occurs after stimulation. Neurons and astrocytes can account for the source of ATP efflux. In this issue of the BJP, Heinrich et al. characterized K(+) depolarization-evoked release of ATP, adenosine and glutamate in hippocampal slices, utilizing microelectrode biosensors for simultaneous real-time recordings of multiple transmitter effluxes. They demonstrated efflux of ATP, adenosine and glutamate from hippocampus slices, in response to K(+) -depolarization, with distinct kinetics and mechanisms, suggesting a coordinated pattern of transmitter release. Surprisingly, it turned out that a considerable amount of the transmitter efflux measured under these conditions had a glial origin. For a long time, it was believed that the glial cell did not play a major role in neurotransmission, but the latter results somewhat change this view. The release of ATP and glutamate from glial cells under these conditions involved P2X7 receptors, and a source of adenosine accumulation independent of the metabolism of extracellular ATP was identified. This study also highlighted a novel use of multi-enzymatic microelectrode biosensors, which enabled a better characterization of transmitter release processes with higher temporal and spatial resolution than obtained previously. This technique was originally developed and used for the detection of purine release. In the present study, it was modified to identify the interplay between different transmitters, measured simultaneously in hippocampal slices.",
