     "AB": "The intracellular signaling pathways associated with neuronal injury after perforant pathway stimulation of the rodent hippocampus have not been examined. To determine whether activation of the p42/p44 (Erk1/2) MAP kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation cascade is linked to neuronal injury after perforant pathway stimulation (PPS), we stained for phosphorylated Erk1/2 (P-Erk1/2) and for DNA fragmentation, a marker of cell death after PPS. Eighteen Sprague-Dawley rats underwent PPS for 6 (n=6), 12 (n=6), or 24 (n=6) h and were sacrificed either immediately (n=9) or 48 h (n=9) after stimulation. Sham-operated non-stimulated control animals (n=2) and control animals receiving low frequency stimulation only (n=4) were also examined. Brain sections were stained for DNA fragmentation and P-Erk1/2. DNA fragmentation was evident only in granule cells and CA3 pyramidal cells of the stimulated side 48 h after 24 h of PPS. PPS resulted in robust phosphorylation of Erk1/2 that displayed a stereotyped timecourse, appearing first in hilar neurons on the ipsilateral side and later in hilar neurons, granule cells, hippocampal pyramidal and non-neuronal cell populations on both the stimulated and contralateral sides. Both Erk1/2 phosphorylation and DNA fragmentation show definite and reproducible staining patterns after PPS that vary based on duration of stimulation. Populations displaying Erk1/2 activation appeared to differ from those showing DNA fragmentation and neuronal injury.",
