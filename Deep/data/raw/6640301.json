     "AB": "In thin sections of the rat dentate gyrus, neuronal gap junctions were observed in the polymorph layer. Gap junctions were seen on dendritic stems, on smooth and/or varicose dendrites, on spine-like appendages, and in one case on a soma. Somata of gap junction-bearing neurons showed indented nuclei with intranuclear inclusions, and received many asymmetrical and a few symmetrical synapses.",
