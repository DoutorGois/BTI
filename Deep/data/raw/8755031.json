     "AB": "[3H]Aldosterone (AS) binding to cytoplasmic corticosteroid receptors (CR) of the hippocampus and brain (without cerebellum and hippocampus) was studied in rats of two behavioral types under normal conditions and within two weeks after electric-pain stress. No asymmetry was shown in the distribution of CRs that bound [3H]AS in the rats of both groups. A relationship was established between the hormone binding by CRs of the hippocampus, rather than the rest of the brain, and type of animal behavior. The action of the stress factor led to decreased binding of [3H]AS to CRs of both hippocampus and brain. Thus, a relationship between the state of CRs of the hippocampus and individual behavior of animals was first established. The results obtained agree with the published data on relationship between the emotional reactivity of the animals and state of CRs in the limbic structures of the brain.",
