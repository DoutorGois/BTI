     "AB": "We studied the effects of KATP channel blockers on [3H]GABA release in the absence of glucose in rat hippocampal slices. The omission of glucose induced a marked increase in the efflux of [3H]GABA, which was antagonized by TTX (1 microM), but not by MK 801 (1 microM) or DNQX (100 microM). Glibenclamide (10-100 microM) increased dose-dependently the release of [3H]GABA evoked in the absence of glucose. An increase in [3H]GABA release was also observed with gliquidone (100-300 microM), another sulfonylurea. The potentiation of [3H]GABA release induced by glibenclamide (100 microM) was antagonized by DNQX but not by MK 801. Thus, in the absence of glucose, KATP channel blockers enhance the release of GABA from rat hippocampal slices; this effect seems to be mediated by an overstimulation of non-NMDA glutamate receptors. On the basis of results reported in the present paper, we suggest that KATP channels may play a role in the regulation of GABAergic activity during hypoglycemia.",
