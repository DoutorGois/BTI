     "AB": "Synaptic connections of 26 pairs of hippocampal neurons were studied in nonanesthetized rabbits by spike-triggered averaging of intracellularly recorded activity. Synchronized activity was detected in 5 pairs and considered to represent common inputs to the neurons recorded. Hyperpolarizing or depolarizing potentials with 3--4 ms latency were revealed in 3 additional pairs. These potentials are considered to be individual postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) evoked in the target neuron by spikes of the adjacent (0.5--2 mm apart) neuron. A quantum analysis of the individual PSPs was performed. The mean quantum content (0.27--0.65) and quantum size (35--200 mkV) were found to be of the same order as those of the excitatory PSPs previously recorded after intracerebral stimulation. It is concluded that most hippocampal synapses are of low efficacy.",
