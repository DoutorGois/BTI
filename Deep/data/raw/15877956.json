     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the change in Fas antigen expression and apoptosis of neurons, to provide an experimental evidence of loss of neurons in craniocerebral injury, and to provide experimental evidence for clarifying multi-approach of the lost neuron after damage. METHODS: Brain impact injury was reproduced in SD rat with a free falling impacting device. Using immunohistochemistry method the Fas protein expression was assessed and apoptotic cells were detected with electron microscopy. RESULTS: Apoptotic cells were found near the contused area, and Fas-positive cells appeared around the injured and hippocampus areas at about 4 hours, peaked at 24 hours after injury and then reduced in number. CONCLUSION: Apoptosis and necrosis are two forms of cell death in brain tissue following experimental brain contusion. Moreover, the results imply that the Fas-FasL pathway plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of post-traumatic neuronal apoptosis.",
