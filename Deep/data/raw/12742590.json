     "AB": "Post-stroke seizures occur in 5-20% of patients. Modeling of stroke-induced seizures in animals provides a useful tool for investigating the molecular basis of epileptogenesis and for developing therapies for stroke patients at increased risk for epileptogenesis. The questions addressed in the study were: (1) Do rats develop spontaneous seizures after transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO)? (2) Is epileptogenesis associated with impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory? (3) Are the functional abnormalities linked to axonal plasticity in the dentate gyrus? (4) Does the sensorimotor impairment induced by MCAO predict the risk of epileptogenesis? Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to MCAO for 120 min. Development of spontaneous seizures was monitored by 1 week of continuous video-electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings at 3, 7, and 12 months after MCAO. Spontaneous seizures were not detected during 1-year follow-up in ischemic rats. Animals were, however, impaired in the spatial memory task (P<0.001), which was not associated with altered hippocampal LTP or abnormal mossy fiber sprouting (Timm staining). Animals also had a long-lasting sensorimotor deficit (P<0.05). The present study indicates that MCAO causes long-lasting sensorimotor and spatial memory impairment, but does not induce epileptogenesis or spontaneous seizures.",
