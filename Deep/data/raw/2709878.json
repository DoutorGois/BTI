     "AB": "The role of the noradrenergic system in the cholinotoxicity of ethylcholine aziridinium ion (AF64A) was studied in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with the noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP-4 (N-(2-chloroethyl)-n-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine; 50 mg/kg i.p.) in the presence of the serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine, 14 days prior to bilateral intracerebroventricular injection of AF64A (2 nmol/lateral ventricle). In rats in which noradrenaline (NA) was depleted by 94%, the loss of acetylcholine (ACh) in hippocampus induced by AF64A was significantly attenuated (p less than 0.02). However, when there was only a partial depletion of NA (50% reduction), the AF64A-induced loss of ACh was a pronounced as in rats with intact noradrenergic function. These findings indicate that the noradrenergic lesion has to be complete before a protective effect is apparent. Moreover, they imply that noradrenergic input is involved in AF64A-induced cholinergic damage in the hippocampus.",
