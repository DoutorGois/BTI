     "AB": "To investigate the mechanism of chronic cell death following postischemic hypothermia, the change of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) were examined by immunohistochemistry of NMDAR1 and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 subfield of the gerbil hippocampus. At 1 week following postischemic hypothermia (32 degrees Cx4 h), all CA1 neurons survived; however, immunoreactivity of NMDAR1 increased in neuronal perikarya whereas decreased in dendrites in the CA1 neurons. The abnormality was still observed in remaining CA1 neurons at 1 month after hypothermia. LTP was also significantly depressed at 1 week after hypothermia. These results suggest that some abnormalities in the glutamate receptor may be caused by ischemia; such abnormality would persist in spite of hypothermia treatment, resulting in the depression of LTP.",
