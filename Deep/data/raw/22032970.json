     "AB": "Lycopene is a potent free radicals scavenger with demonstrated protective efficacy in several experimental models of oxidative damage. Trimethyltin (TMT) is an organotin compound with neurotoxic effects on the hippocampus and other limbic structures and is used to model neurodegenerative diseases targeting these brain areas. Oxidative stress is widely accepted as a central pathogenic mechanism of TMT-mediated neurotoxicity. The present study investigated whether the plant carotene lycopene protects against TMT-induced neurotoxicity in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Lycopene pretreatment improved cell viability in TMT-treated hippocampal neurons and inhibited neuronal apoptosis. Microfluorometric imaging revealed that lycopene inhibited the accumulation of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) during TMT exposure. Moreover, lycopene ameliorated TMT-induced activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and the concomitant depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)). Consequently, cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and ensuing caspase-3 activation were markedly reduced. These findings reveal that lycopene protects against TMT-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The anti-apoptotic effect of lycopene on hippocampal neurons highlights the therapeutic potential of plant-derived antioxidants against neurodegenerative diseases.",
