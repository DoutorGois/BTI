     "AB": "The present study is designed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of a kind of phlorotannins, diphlorethohydroxycarmalol (DPHC) isolated from Ishige okamurae against hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced oxidative stress in murine hippocampal neuronal cells, HT22. H(2)O(2) treatment induced neurotoxicity, whereas DPHC prevented cells from H(2)O(2)-induced damage then restoring cell viability was significantly increased. DPHC slightly reduced the expression of Bax induced by H(2)O(2) but recovered the expression of Bcl-xL as well as caspase-9 and -3 mediated PARP cleavage by H(2)O(2). Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation was overproduced as the result of the addition of H(2)O(2); however, these ROS generations and lipid peroxidation were effectively inhibited by addition of DPHC in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, DPHC suppressed the elevation of H(2)O(2)-induced Ca(2+) release. These findings indicate that DPHC has neuroprotective effects against H(2)O(2)-induced damage in neuronal cells, and that an inhibitory effect on ROS production may contribute to the underlying mechanisms.",
