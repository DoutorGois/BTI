     "AB": "The effects of trimethyl tin on passive and active avoidance behavior, hippocampal muscarinic receptors and hippocampal cell destruction were examined in male rats. The animals were intubated with 18 mumoles/kg (3.5 mg/kg) of TMT hydrochloride or vehicle. When tested two weeks later treated animals exhibited marked deficits in retention of passive avoidance and extinction of active avoidance tasks. Receptor binding analysis, using 3H-QNB, revealed a significant decrease (21%) in muscarinic receptor density in the hippocampus. Histological examination of the hippocampus revealed a concomitant loss in pyramidal cells in these animals. These results suggest that muscarinic receptors reside on the hippocampal pyramidal cells and that these cells and receptors may be involved in retention of passive avoidance behavior.",
