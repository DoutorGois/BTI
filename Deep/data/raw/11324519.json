The viability, intracellular calcium concentration and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression of the two kinds of neurons after anoxia were observed in the counting in the confocal microscopic field and in situ hybridization. It is found that DG neurons are not only more resistant to anoxia, but also have a stronger ability to keep calcium homeostasis and to express BDNF mRNA than CA1 neurons.",
