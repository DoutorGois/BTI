     "AB": "Immunocytochemical techniques were employed in order to examine the distribution and relative intensity of immunolabeling of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoaxolepropionate (AMPA) receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR2/3 within the hippocampal formation of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Within sectors of the hippocampus that are particularly vulnerable to AD pathology (i.e., CA1, subiculum), we observed a variable loss of GluR1 and GluR2/3 immunolabeling correlating with the extent of cell loss and neurofibrillary pathology. In contrast, in less vulnerable sectors of the hippocampus (i.e., CA2/3, dentate gyrus), the intensity of immunolabeling was markedly increased in AD cases, particularly in the molecular and polymorphic layers of the dentate gyrus. Importantly, these latter regions correspond to termination zones of glutamatergic perforant pathway axons and mossy fiber collaterals, respectively. The increase in immunolabeling within these projection fields is hypothesized to occur in response to the deafferentation of selected glutamatergic pathways, and suggests a critical role for AMPA receptor subunits in hippocampal plasticity.",
