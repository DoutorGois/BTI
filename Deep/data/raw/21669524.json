     "AB": "Increasing evidence supports that OS plays important roles in diabetes mellitus and cerebral ischemia. This suggests that recovering an impaired endogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme system induced by OS with a mimetic would be beneficial and protective for these diseases. In present study, one nonpeptidyl small molecular weight compound (D34) was synthesized. Its SOD mimetic activity and the potential therapeutic actions were also evaluated both in vivo and in vitro. The in vitro nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) assay indicated that D34 presents an SOD mimetic activity. D34 (20mumol/kg) exhibited significant antihyperglycemic activity in alloxan-diabetic mice. D34 could also ameliorate the cerebral neuronal death in hippocampus of global cerebral ischemia mice. Furthermore, the D34 treatment significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and increased SOD activities in brains or livers of diabetes mice or cerebral ischemic mice. In conclusion, these preliminary findings support that D34 exhibits SOD mimetic activity and possesses significant antihyperglycemic and neuroprotective effects.",
