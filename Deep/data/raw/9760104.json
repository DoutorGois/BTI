     "AB": "It has been shown recently in rat hippocampus that the synapse specificity of Hebbian long-term potentiation breaks down at short distances (< 100 microm). Using a neural network model we show that this unspecific component of long-term potentiation can be responsible for the robust formation and maintainance of cortical organization during activity-driven development. When the model is applied to the formation of orientation and ocular dominance in visual cortex, addition of an unspecific component to standard Hebbian learning, in combination with a tendency of left-eye and right-eye driven synapses to initially group together on the postsynaptic neuron, induces the simultaneous emergence and stabilization of ocular dominance and of segregated, oriented ON/OFF subfields. Since standard Hebbian learning cannot account for the simultaneous stabilization of both structures, unspecific LTP thus induces a qualitatively new behaviour. Since unspecific LTP only acts between synapses which are locally clustered in space, our results imply that details of the local grouping of synapses on the dendritic arbors of postsynaptic cells can considerably influence the formation of the cortical functional organization at the systems level.",
