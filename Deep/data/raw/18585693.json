     "AB": "Loss of neurons in the hippocampus and other brain regions is, besides the occurrence of plaques and tangles, a neuropathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years a plethora of transgenic mouse models overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been developed, which represent valuable research tools. Whereas extracellular plaque pathology is a common feature of these models, neuronal loss is a rather rare characteristic. In the present study, we quantified the number of neurons in the dentate gyrus granule layer (GCL) in 2- and 12-month-old APP/PS1KI mice, a mouse model that has been previously shown to have significant loss of neurons in the CA1 layer of the hippocampus. Stereological analysis revealed a strongly significant decrease of GCLs in aged APP/PS1KI mice, compared to age-matched PS1KI control animals (-44%), however, the volume of the GCL was not different.",
