     "AB": "Single-unit recording studies of monkeys have shown that neurons in perirhinal and entorhinal cortex exhibit activity reductions following stimulus repetition, and some have suggested that these \"repetition suppression\" effects may represent neural signals that support recognition memory. Critically, repetition suppression effects are most pronounced at short intervals between stimulus repetitions. Here, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify repetition suppression effects in the human medial temporal lobe and determine whether these effects are sensitive to the length of the interval between repetitions. Twenty-one participants were scanned while performing a continuous recognition memory task in which the interval between item repetitions was parametrically varied from 2 to 32 intervening items. We found evidence of repetition suppression in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus, but only when the repetition interval was relatively short. Moreover, bilateral hippocampal regions showed lag-sensitive repetition effects. Our results demonstrate that activity in the human medial temporal cortex, like that of monkeys, exhibits repetition suppression effects that are sensitive to the length of the interval between repetitions.",
