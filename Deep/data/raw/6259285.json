     "AB": "Seventy-one regions of mouse brain, and many subdivisions of some of these, were analyzed for cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. The samples were dissected from lyophilized frozen sections. Since the average sample weighed only 25 ng (20 X 75 X 75 mu3), regions as small as the locus ceruleus could be analyzed. Activities in gray areas ranged 40-fold from a high in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra to a low in the deep cerebellar nuclei. The activity in fiber tracts also varied about 40-fold, and on a lipid-free dry weight basis was similar to the activity in the gray matter where the fibers originated. The rank order for gray regions was basal ganglia, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, most of the diencephalic nuclei, nuclei of the pons, cerebellum, and nuclei of the medulla.",
