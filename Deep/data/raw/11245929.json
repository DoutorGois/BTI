     "AB": "DNA damage has been documented in neurodegenerative conditions ranging from Alzheimer's disease to stroke. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is involved in V(D)J recombination and DNA double strand break repair, and may play a role in cell death induced by DNA damage. We now report that cultured hippocampal neurons from severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice which lack DNA-PK activity are hypersensitive to apoptosis induced by exposure to topoisomerase inhibitors, amyloid beta peptide (A beta) and glutamate. A similar increased vulnerability of hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons was observed in adult scid mice after kainate-induced seizures. Our results suggest that DNA-PK activity is important for neuron survival under conditions that may occur in neurological disorders.",
