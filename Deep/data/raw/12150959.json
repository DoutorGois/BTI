     "AB": "The glutamate transporter inhibitor, L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (PDC) reversibly enhanced hippocampal neuronal activity in the rat and mouse dentate gyrus. The PDC action was still found in mice lacking the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1. PDC did not influence the rate of spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents, ionotropic glutamate receptor currents, or GABA-evoked currents in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. PDC increased glutamate released from cultured hippocampal astrocytes from normal rats, normal mice, and GLT-1 knock-out mice, that is not inhibited by deleting extracellular Na(+), while the drug had no effect on the release from cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The results of the present study thus suggest that PDC stimulates glial glutamate release by a mechanism independent of inhibiting glutamate transporters, which perhaps causes an increase in synaptic glutamate concentrations, in part responsible for the enhancement in hippocampal neuronal activity.",
