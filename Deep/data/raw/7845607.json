     "AB": "The formation of the abnormal phospholipid phosphatidylethanol (PEth) was studied in hippocampus, cerebellum and cerebrum of rat brain after intraperitoneal ethanol administration. Prior to analysis by high performance thin layer chromatography PEth was purified. After one injection, PEth levels reached a maximum after 2 h and remained detectable for 14-24 h in all three regions. Repeated injections led to additional accumulation. Maximum in vivo levels of 30-50 nmol/g wet wt. were reached.",
