     "AB": "Follistatin-like 1 (Fstl1), also named TSC-36 (TGF-beta-stimulated clone 36), was first cloned from the mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell line and can be up-regulated by TGF-beta. To better study the function of Fstl1 during the development of the mouse central nervous system (CNS), we examined Fstl1 expression in the developing mouse CNS, in detail, by in situ hybridization. Our results show that Fstl1 is strongly expressed in the telencephalon, diencephalon, brainstem, limbic system and spinal cord. In the telencephalon, Fstl1 positive cells are mainly located in the ventricular zone (VZ) and the subventricular zone (SVZ); a relatively weak signal was observed in layers II and III of the neocortex at postnatal stages. Fstl1 expression is robust in the developing hippocampus and persists to P20. In the developing diencephalon and hindbrain, abundant Fstl1 signals were also detected in nuclei including the medial habenular nucleus, the medial dorsal nucleus, the cochlear nuclei and so on. In addition, a strong expression of Fstl1 was detected in the thalamencephalic signal center, as well as in the olfactory cortex from E14.5 to P0. Meanwhile, Fstl1 was expressed in the septal area and the cingulate gyrus of the limbic system after birth. A high level of expression was also observed in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. These results indicate that Fstl1 may play an important role during CNS development in the mouse.",
