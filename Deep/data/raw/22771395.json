     "AB": "Gap junctions between inhibitory neurones in cortical regions have been well documented over the years. However, although the presence of electrical coupling between pyramidal cells has been supported by dye-coupling and recordings of fast prepotentials called 'spikelets', direct evidence for such coupling remains sparse. Electrical coupling between pyramids has however been shown to play a significant role in oscillatory network activity, spatial exploration and learning and memory and full characterization of these synapses are overdue. In this review, an overview of the known properties of these electrical synapses is given, focusing on a study in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Electrical Synapses.",
