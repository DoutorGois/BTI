     "AB": "Hippocampal primordia taken from one day old postnatal rats and grown for 1 month in the hippocampus of adult rat hosts developed hippocampal pyramids, dentate granule cells, and specific patterns of mossy fibres. In 26 cases where certain boundary conditions were precisely met, the transplant mossy fibres crossed into the host and ramified for a distance of from 0.5 mm to no more than 1 mm in the stratum oriens of the host field CA1. They formed a layer 35 micron thick adjacent to the host CA1 pyramidal cell layer. The necessary boundary conditions were: (1) direct (and \"unscarred\") contact between the neuropil of the transplant and the host field CA1, (2) that the hilar (and not the molecular) aspect of the transplanted dentate granule cell lamina faced the host CA1 pyramids, and (3) that some of the interface was devoid of transplant hilar cells or CA3-type pyramids interposed between the transplant dentate granules and the host CA1 pyramids. In 3 cases a converse connection was found--viz. the host mossy fibres entered the transplant. In these cases the transplants consisted entirely of pyramidal cells (with no dentate granule cells of their own), and the part of the transplant receiving the host mossy fibres was embedded directly in the host mossy fibre pathway. For the dentato-hippocampal mossy fibre system, therefore, it is shown that postsynaptic targets in the adult mammalian brain can receive specific patterns of innervation from growing axons derived from a transplant, and that cut central axons of the same type can grow and form target-specific terminal arborizations in a transplant.",
