     "AB": "Arsenic (As) in drinking water is a toxicant causing several health problems including nervous system disturbance. Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a tissue globin in nervous system playing protective role against oxidative stress in many injuries. This study was to investigate how long arsenite exposure (sodium arsenite 7.5 mg/kg/day) could induce oxidative stress in blood and brain of rats and to determine whether Ngb expression in rat brain changed due to oxidative stress. Results showed that superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in serum and brain homogenates and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in red blood cells (RBCs) did not change in the rats exposed to arsenite for 8 weeks. In the rats exposed to arsenite for 16 weeks, SOD activity decreased (serum: P < 0.05; brain homogenates: P < 0.01) and MDA level increased (P < 0.01) in serum and brain homogenates; ROS production increased (P < 0.01) in RBC. When oxidative stress occurred, Ngb mRNA expression did not change in whole brain, cerebral cortex, midbrain, and hippocampus; however, Ngb mRNA expression increased significantly (P < 0.05) in cerebellum compared to the control group. This study suggests that arsenite exposure for 16 weeks can lead to oxidative stress of blood and brain of rats. Ngb may play a protective role in cerebellum when oxidative stress occurs due to arsenite exposure.",
