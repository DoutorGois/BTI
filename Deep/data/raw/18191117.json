     "AB": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes the survival and differentiation of hippocampal, cortical, and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. However, the efficacy of BDNF via peripheral (i.v.) administration is limited by the lack of transport of the neurotrophin through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vivo. The present study describes that the i.v. administered recombinant human BDNF (rhBDNF) conjugated with a protein transduction domain (PTD ) is able to survive and promote the growth of hippocampal neurons impaired by Abeta25-35 (10 microM) in vitro and transport through the BBB in vivo. The Morris water maze test indicated that the i.v. PTD-rhBDNF improved the spatial learning and memory of mice impaired by the aggregated Abeta25-35. The peripherally administered PTD-rhBDNF exhibited neuroprotective effects in brain and raise the possibility of delivery of the exogenous rhBDNF in treatment of the brain diseases.",
