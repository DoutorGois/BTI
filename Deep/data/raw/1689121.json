     "AB": "The pattern of capillary perfusion was studied in the brain of anesthetized rats. Two plasma labels were used to demonstrate the density of capillaries perfused during a 10-min period [fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) globulin], as well as during a 10-, 3-, or 1-s period [lissamine-rhodamine B 200 (RB200) globulin, infused into the left heart chamber], respectively. A special biopsy cutting-freezing system was used to withdraw brain tissue via a cranial window for histological analysis of dye distribution at the end of the infusion period. Complete labeling of all capillaries was already found after 10 s of dye circulation. However, intra-arterial dye infusion for 3 and 1 s led to reduced filling of capillaries: cortex 86.6 +/- 5.2 and 6.8 +/- 1.8%, hippocampus 95.0 +/- 1.6 and 9.9 +/- 2.1%, and thalamus 97.9 +/- 1.0 and 11.7 +/- 1.8%, respectively. The period of 1 s was found to be the circulation time from left heart chamber to brain capillaries. It can thus be concluded that in the studied brain areas greater than 85% of capillaries are reached by a plasma flow within 2 s and that the remaining small fraction completely fills within 10 s.",
