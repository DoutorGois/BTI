     "AB": "Brain tissue sections from control male and female Fischer 344 (F344) rats from ten National Toxicology Program (NTP) Bioassays were histomorphologically reviewed for non-neoplastic lesions of the hippocampus. Unilateral segmental hippocampal neuronal necrosis, which has not been reported in normal rats, was observed in 9 of 433 (2.1 per cent) males and 1 of 454 (0.2 per cent) females. Significant coexisting lesions were left-sided atrial and/or valvular thrombosis, metastatic mesothelioma, and large lymphocyte leukaemia. These data suggest that this naturally occurring lesion of predominantly aged male rats may result from an impairment of cerebral perfusion secondary to vascular obstruction by thrombotic emboli or leukaemic cells and haemolytic anaemia concomitant with large lymphocyte leukaemia, which commonly occurs in F344 rats.",
