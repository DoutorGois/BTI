     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease for which there is currently no effective treatment. This study investigated whether treatment with the herbal formula PM012 would improve the cognitive function and the pathological features of AD in 3xTg-AD mice. The cognitive function of 3xTg-AD mice was assessed using the Morris water maze test and positron-emission tomography (PET) with 18 F-2 fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([F-18] FDG) neuroimaging. The levels of the amyloid beta (Abeta) deposits in the hippocampus were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Neurogenesis was assessed by quantitative labeling with the DNA marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and the newborn neuron marker doublecortin (DCX). PM012 treatment significantly ameliorated memory deficit in AD mice, as shown by shortened escape latencies and increased time spent in the target zone during probe tests. In addition, PM012 significantly decreased Abeta deposits, up-regulated the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), increased neurogenesis, and improved brain glucose metabolism in the 3xTg-AD mice. These results suggest that PM012 could be a promising treatment for AD.",
