     "AB": "1. Monoamine turnover and neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels were investigated in the central and peripheral nervous systems in adult male rats chronically treated with morphine. 2. The well-recognized biochemical alterations (serotoninergic turnover increased in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and striatum; dopaminergic turnover increased in the striatum and cortex; adrenaline levels decreased in the adrenal glands) were observed. 3. In addition, we observed a significant decrease of the NPY levels in the hypothalamus, the striatum and the adrenal glands. The observed changes were not reflected in plasma. 4. Our results contribute to the evidence that brain and adrenal monoamines and NPY could be involved in the mechanism of morphine tolerance and/or dependence.",
