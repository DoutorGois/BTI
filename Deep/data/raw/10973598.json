     "AB": "Temporary replacement of glucose by 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) induces a long-term potentiation (2-DG-LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices. We therefore examined the effects of 2-DG on monosynaptic field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in slices of somatosensory cortex from rats. Monosynaptic fEPSPs were elicited in layer I by stimulating horizontal projections in the same layer. Replacement of glucose (10 mM) in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid with 10 mM 2-DG for 15-17 min produced a minor reduction (by 10-30%), followed by a sustained increase (by approximately 150%) in synaptic responses that could last for over 2 hours. Equimolar replacement of glucose with sucrose did not induce potentiation. The addition of 5 or even 2.5 mM glucose to 10 mM 2-DG largely suppressed the effects of 2-DG; but topically-applied GABA antagonists bicuculline and CGP 35348 did not prevent 2-DG-LTP. Unlike hippocampal 2-DG-LTP, neocortical 2-DG-LTP was: (1) not sensitive to 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5); and (2) usually not depotentiated by stimulation at 1 Hz. We conclude that 2-DG produces a robust and sustained increase in synaptic transmission in the neocortex through mechanisms that are independent of NMDA receptor activation.",
