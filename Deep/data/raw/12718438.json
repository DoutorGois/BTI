     "AB": "Neuron-specific aminopeptidase (NAP) and the ubiquitous puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA) were compared in the rat hippocampus during early development. Hippocampus contains the highest amount of NAP determined by a fast-protein liquid chromatography-aminopeptidase analyzer using Leu beta-naphthylamide as substrate. Both enzymes were found in the hippocampus in all ages. NAP was lower in immature rat; the 19th embryonic-day fetus contained the least. It increased steeply during the prenatal through the early postnatal period, 9-fold by the first month. The rate of increase diminished subsequently, increasing 20% in the second month and 13% in the third. The age-dependent increase in NAP activity was parallel to its protein expression as determined by Western blot. The specific molecular activity (hydrolytic activity/ NAP antigenicity) in newborn, 15-day-old, and 30-day-old rats were 1.00, 0.88, and 1.00, respectively. The PSA developmental profile without linear increase in activity was distinct from NAP. PSA activity was higher than NAP in decreasing order, 100-4 times, during the same development span. Similarly, different growth profiles for NAP and PSA were also found in the primary culture of developing cerebellar granule cells. Puromycin (1-5 microM) blocked neurite outgrowth and caused apoptosis by nonantibiotic effects. Our data suggest that the synaptosome-enriched NAP plays a role in neuron growth, differentiation, and information programming.",
