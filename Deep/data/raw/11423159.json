     "AB": "The current meta-analysis included 27 studies on spatial-memory dysfunction in patients with hippocampal damage. Each study was classified on the basis of the task that was used, i.e., maze learning, working memory, object-location memory, or positional memory. The overall results demonstrated impairments on all spatial-memory tasks. Clear differences in effect size were found between positional memory on the one hand and maze learning, object-location memory, and working memory on the other hand. Lateralization was found only on maze learning and object-location memory. These findings clearly indicate that specific aspects of spatial memory can be affected in various degrees in patients with hippocampal lesions. Moreover, these results strongly support the notion that the hippocampus is important in the processing of metric positional information, probably in the form of an allocentric cognitive map.",
