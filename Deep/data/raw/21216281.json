     "AB": "Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition is assumed to play a pathogenic role in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. To date, the precise mechanisms underlying Abeta toxicity are not fully understood. A recent hypothesis suggesting that the Receptor-for-Advanced-Glycation-End-Products (RAGE)-a trans-membrane protein signaling for oxidative stress-is involved in Abeta toxicity is gaining attention. Early Abeta toxicity could indeed help to explain the deleterious events further produced by this molecule in the brain. In this work, we evaluated the pattern of early expression of RAGE in the toxic model induced by Ass(2)(5)(-)(3)(5) in rat CA1 region. Intrahippocampal injections of Abeta(2)(5)(-)(3)(5) in rats increased the RAGE expression at 24 h post-injection; this event was accompanied by increased components of RAGE downstream signaling in hippocampal cells, such as enhanced expression of the pro-apoptotic factor NF-kappaB, increased nitric oxide production, LDH leakage, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased TNF-alpha expression, antioxidant genes down-regulation, and augmented neurodegeneration. Our findings support an active role of RAGE during the early stages of Abeta(2)(5)(-)(3)(5) toxicity in the hippocampus.",
