     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in hippocampal CA 1 area and cerebral cortex in APP 695 V717 I transgenic mice, so as to investigate its underlying mechanism in improving Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: APP 695 V 717 I transgenic mice were randomly divided into model and EA groups, with 6 cases in each. The other 6 negatively-transgenic mice (C 57 BL/6 J) were used as the normal control group. EA (2 Hz/100 Hz, 3 mA) was applied to \"Baihui\" (GV 20) and \"Yongquan\" (KI 1) for 15 min, once every other day for 3 months. The learning-memory ability of mice was measured by Y-type maze test and the expression levels of APP, Abeta, and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the cerebral cotex and hippocampal CA 1 area were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In comparison with control group, the times of training for gaining correct reaction and the expression levels of Abeta and APP in both cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA 1 area in model group increased significantly (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), while the expression level of ChAT of cerebral cortex in model group decreased considerably (P < 0.05). Compared to model group, +he times of training for gaining correct reaction and the expression levels of APP in both cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA 1 area, and Abeta in CA 1 area of EA group lowered remarkably (P < 0.05), while those of ChAT in cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA 1 area of EA group increased evidently (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture can improve the learning-memory capacity of the APP transgenic mice, which may be related to its effects in increasing the production of acetylcholine and lowering the levels of APP and Abeta in the brain.",
