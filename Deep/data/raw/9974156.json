     "AB": "We examined the expression of full-length TrkB (TrkBTK+) and truncated TrkB (TrkBTK-) in the central nervous system (CNS) of the macaque monkey (Macaca fascicularis) using a western blot analysis. At the adult stage, the levels of TrkBTK+ in cerebral cortices were higher than those in other structures of CNS and the expressions of TrkBTK+ in the association cortices (except area PE) were relatively lower than those in the primary cortices. In contrast, TrkBTK- in the hippocampus and the cerebellum was significantly higher than in other structures. In various developing cerebral cortices, TrkBTK+ was detected at the same levels from embryonic day 120 (E120) to the adult period. In contrast, the expression of TrkBTK- increased remarkably after the newborn stage (NB), reached the maximum level at postnatal day 60 (P60) and maintained the same level into adulthood. The peaks of TrkBTK- in the association cortices were more delayed than in the primary cortices. The expression of TrkBTK- occurred at a time that correlates with the elimination of axons and the down-regulation of neuropeptides. The present study suggests that TrkBTK- plays an important role in the axonal remodelling and that it may act as a negative effector of TrkBTK+ in the primate CNS, reducing responsiveness to BDNF and/or NT-4/5.",
