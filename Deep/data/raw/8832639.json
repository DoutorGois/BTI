     "AB": "Distinct patterns of age-related alterations in NMDA (MK801 binding) and non-NMDA, AMPA (CNQX), and kainate binding have been identified in human hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus in normal individuals with no evidence of degenerative brain disease ranging in age from 24 gestational weeks to 94 years. Whereas MK801 binding did not alter substantially over this age range, CNQX binding rose from low levels in the fetus to maximum levels between neonate and middle age, and kainate binding declined extensively from the perinatal to adult stage. Following maturity, there were no significant changes in kainate binding, although MK801 binding increased in CA1 and CA3 and CNQX binding declined in several regions, particularly CA2 and subiculum. For each receptor binding the timing of these fluctuations ocurring during development and aging varied within different regions of the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, subicular complex, and entorhinal cortex examined. The transient peaks of receptor binding are likely to reflect processes of synaptogenesis and pruning and may provide clues regarding the role of the different glutamate receptor subtypes in various pathologies of the hippocampus and adjacent cortex associated with developmental disorders (of genetic origin or due to perinatal trauma or insult). The absence of substantial changes in any subtype examined from middle to old age suggests alterations in transmitter binding to these glutamate receptors are not involved in senescent neurodegeneration.",
