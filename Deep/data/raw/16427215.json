     "AB": "In this study, we examined event-related potentials (ERPs) in rats performing a timing task. The ERPs were recorded during a timing task and a control task from five regions (frontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum) that are related to time perception. In the timing task, the rats were required to judge the interval between two tones. This interval could be either 500 or 2000 ms. In the control task, only the 500 ms interval between tones was presented and only one lever was available for responses. Any difference in ERPs between the two tasks was considered to reflect the processes that are related to temporal discrimination. The frontal cortex, striatum, and thalamus yielded concurrent differences in ERPs between the two tasks. The results suggest that these regions might play an important role in temporal discrimination.",
