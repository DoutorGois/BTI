     "AB": "On the basis of the results obtained in previous series of AMPA potentiators belonging to 3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo- and 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrido-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides, the present work focuses on the design of original isosteric 3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxides. Owing to the sulfur position, three series of compounds were developed and their activity as AMPA potentiators was characterized. In each of the developed series, potent compounds were discovered. After screening the selected active compounds on a safety in vivo test, 6-chloro-4-ethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno[2,3-e]-1,2,4-thiadiazine 1,1-dioxide (24) appeared as the most promising compound and was further evaluated. Its effects on long-term potentiation in vivo and on AMPA-mediated noradrenaline release were measured to predict its potential cognitive enhancing properties. Finally, an object recognition test performed in mice revealed that 24 was able to significantly enhance cognition, after oral administration, at doses as low as 0.3 mg/kg. This study validates the interest of the isosteric replacement of the benzene or pyridine nuclei by the thiophene nucleus in the ring-fused thiadiazine dioxides class of AMPA potentiators.",
