     "AB": "The effects of prenatal protein malnutrition on kindling-induced changes in inhibitory modulation of dentate granule cell activity were examined by analysis of extracellular field potentials recorded from the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus in response to paired-pulse stimulation of the perforant pathway in freely-moving rats. Since we have shown that kindling results in enhanced synaptic transmission at the level of the perforant path/granule cell synapse (see preceding paper), we sought to determine if the kindling process might induce changes in inhibitory modulation of granule cell excitability which could be involved in the slower acquisition of the kindled state we have previously reported in malnourished animals. Beginning at 120-150 days of age, the response of dentate granule cells to paired-pulse stimulation of the perforant path was examined at interpulse intervals (IPIs) ranging from 20-1000 ms. A paired-pulse index (PPI) was constructed based on the mean percent change in population spike amplitudes of the two responses resulting from application of the pulse pair. PPI measures obtained during the kindling process were compared with individual prekindling measures to determine the mean percent change in excitatory/inhibitory modulation of granule cell activity. Significant inhibition of the second population response was apparent at all IPIs tested for both diet groups following the first kindled afterdischarge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
