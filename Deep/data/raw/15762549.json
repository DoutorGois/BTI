     "AB": "Long-term exposure to depleted uranium (DU) has been shown to increase brain uranium and alter hippocampal function; however, little is known about the short-term kinetics of DU in the brain. To address this issue, temporal and regional distribution of brain uranium was investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg uranium/kg as uranyl acetate. Due to the inherent stress of combat and the potential for stress to alter blood-brain barrier permeability, the impact of forced swim stress on brain uranium distribution was also examined in this model. Uranium in serum, hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum, and frontal cortex was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) at 8 h, 24 h, 7 d, and 30 d after exposure. Uranium entered the brain rapidly and was initially concentrated in hippocampus and striatum. While multiple phases of uranium clearance were observed, overall clearance was relatively slow and the uranium content of hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex remained elevated for more than 7 d after a single exposure. Prior exposure to stress significantly reduced hippocampal and cerebellar uranium 24 h post-exposure and tended to reduce uranium in all brain regions 7 d after exposure. The application of stress appeared to increase brain uranium clearance, as initial tissue levels were similar in stressed and unstressed rats.",
