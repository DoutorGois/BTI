     "AB": "There are opposing results in the literature concerning the influence of (1S,3R)-ACPD [(1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylate: group I/II metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist) on neurodegeneration, showing both enhancement and reduction of damage. We examined the effects of (1S,3R)-ACPD, given in various application schedules, on global ischaemia in gerbils. The most pronounced effect was a significant increase of hippocampal damage when the drug was applied at 20 mg/kg i.p. pre ischaemia. All other experiments with lower concentrations (0.02-2 mg/kg), other time schedules (post-ischaemic application) or co-application of a selective group I metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (4-CPG: (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine), had no influence on neuronal density.",
