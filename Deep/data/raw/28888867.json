     "AB": "Overstimulation of glutamate receptors resulting in excessive intracellular calcium concentrations is a major cause of neuronal cell death in epilepsy. The main source of increased calcium concentration during this excitotoxicity is an influx through NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors. The GluR2 (GluA2) hypothesis states that following a neurological insult such as an epileptic seizure, the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 protein is downregulated. This increases the likelihood of the formation of GluR2-lacking, calcium-permeable AMPA receptor which might further enhance the toxicity of the neurotransmitter, glutamate. The cytosolic protein, PICK1, facilitates the removal of GluA2 subunits from the synaptic plasma membrane. High calcium concentrations may cause PICK1 to bind to the GluA2 subunit of calcium-impermeable AMPARs, leading to an increased internalization of these receptor subunits and a relative increase of GluA2-lacking, calcium-permeable AMPARs. This further escalates the cytosolic calcium concentration. In order to test this hypothesis, we have used kainic acid to induce epilepsy in rats. Using semi-quantitative western blotting combined with univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, we found that both GluA2 and PICK1 were down-regulated in kainate-treated rats for as long as eight weeks after induction of epilepsy. An interesting finding was that statistical analysis indicates that the functional role of PICK1 in our material is to increase GluA2 concentrations in the cells. The observed reduction in PICK1 concentration may thus be an independent contributor to the observed GluA2 reduction. This reduction may possibly be an adaptive mechanism, serving to prevent further loss of GluA2 from the synapses.",
