     "AB": "In order to elucidate the roles of hippocampal nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in working and reference memory performance of rats, the effects of intrahippocampal injections of the NO synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), on this behavior were examined with a three-panel runway task. In the working memory task, L-NAME, injected bilaterally at 10 and 32 micrograms/side into the dorsal hippocampus, significantly increased the number of errors (attempts to pass through two incorrect panels of the three panel-gates at four choice points). This effect of intrahippocampal L-NAME (32 micrograms/side) on working memory was attenuated by concurrent injection of 100 micrograms/side L-arginine, the precursor of NO. Intrahippocampal injection of the inactive isomer D-NAME at doses up to 32 micrograms/side had no effect on the number of working memory errors. In the reference memory task, neither L-NAME nor D-NAME affected the number of errors when injected into the hippocampus at doses up to 32 micrograms/side. These results suggest that processes mediated by NO synthesis in the hippocampus are involved in working memory, but not in reference memory.",
