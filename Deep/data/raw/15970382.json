     "AB": "Our previous investigation has shown that postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) is critical for the Src family kinases-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 2A (NR2A) in the postischemic hippocampus. To clarify the roles of PSD-95 in the ischemic brain damage, histological method was performed to examine the effects of PSD-95 antisense oligonucleotides (AS) on the postischemic delayed cell death in rat hippocampus. Transient (15 min) brain ischemia was induced by the four-vessel occlusion method in Sprague-Dawley rats. Five days of reperfusion following brain ischemia (I/R5d) led to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell death upward of 90%. Intracerebroventricular infusion of AS (every 24 h for 3 days before ischemia) not only decreased the PSD-95 expression but also increased the number of surviving pyramidal neurons, while missense oligonucleotides (MS) had no effects. To further investigate the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotection of PSD-95 deficiency, the interaction of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) with NR2A as well as autophosphorylation (Tyr402) of Pyk2 were detected. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis showed that preischemic treatment with AS, but not MS or vehicle, attenuated the I/R6h-induced increases in Pyk2-NR2A association and Pyk2 autophosphorylation. The protein levels of NR2A and Pyk2 had no differences under the above conditions. Our data suggest that the recruitments of ion channels and signaling molecules may be involved in the PSD-95 neurotoxicity in the postischemic hippocampus.",
