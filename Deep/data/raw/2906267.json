     "AB": "The effects of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), and the novel anxiolytics buspirone, 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-[N,N-dipropylamino]-tetralin) and ipsapirone (TVXQ 7821, 2-[4-[4-[2-pyrimidinyl]-1-piperazinyl] butyl]-1,2-benzisothiazol-3[2H]one-1,1-dioxide-hydrochloride) on fiber excitability were studied in three axon systems; hippocampal Schaffer collateral fibers, cerebellar parallel fibers, and sciatic nerves. In the hippocampus, application of buspirone, 8-OH-DPAT and ipsapirone resulted in reversible, dose-dependent reductions in the amplitude and conduction velocity of action potentials recorded from presynaptic afferent fibers. Although these agents bind to 5-HT1A receptors, 5-HT application, even at very high (1 mM) concentrations, did not alter axonal responses. This suggests that buspirone, 8-OH-DPAT and ipsapirone exert an action independent of a serotonergic mechanism. Similar effects were observed on the cerebellar parallel fibers although the cerebellum does not have an appreciable number of 5-HT1A receptors. To examine the generalized effects of these agents on nerve excitability, rat sciatic compound action potentials were studied with sucrose gap recordings. Whereas 5-HT, 8-OH-DPAT and ipsapirone had no effects even at high concentrations (1 mM), application of buspirone led to reversible decrement of the responses without appreciable change in membrane potential. These results indicate that buspirone, 8-OH-DPAT and ipsapirone have actions on the excitability of hippocampal and cerebellar neurons independent of serotonergic mechanisms. Moreover, buspirone, but not 8-OH-DPAT or ipsapirone, produces decreased sciatic nerve excitability. NS 20393",
