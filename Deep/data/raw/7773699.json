     "AB": "Intrahippocampal injections of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) leads to neurodegeneration in a dose-dependent manner. Chronic administration of ethanol to animals leads to CNS tolerance and dependence. Hyperexcitability following ethanol withdrawal is thought to be related to increased sensitivity of the NMDA receptors. The purpose of this study was to investigate this predisposition to hyperexcitability by intrahippocampal injection of low dose of NMDA. Using control and ethanol-withdrawn male Wistar rats, behavioural indices were determined immediately after injection and morphological damage was assessed after a period of recovery. There was significantly increased hyperactivity in the ethanol-treated rats immediately after injection. Morphological damage resulting from 5 nmol of NMDA was significantly greater in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in these animals. These data support the hypothesis that ethanol dependence and subsequent withdrawal is associated with increased sensitivity to NMDA which may underlie ethanol withdrawal-associated brain damage.",
