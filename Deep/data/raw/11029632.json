     "AB": "This study aimed at evaluating changes in expression of immediate early genes in a new photothrombotic focal ischemia model that exhibits late spontaneous reperfusion and morphological restoration in the region-at-risk within the cerebral cortex. Gene expression was studied with Northern blots, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. At early time points (1-4 h), nerve growth factor-induced gene A and B, and c-fos mRNAs, were quickly induced throughout the ipsilateral cortex, with no obvious differences between the region-at-risk and remote cortical areas. High concentrations of nerve growth factor-induced gene A and c-Fos proteins were present within the region-at-risk even when cortical cerebral blood flow was as low as 40% of control values. At 4 h the nerve growth factor-induced gene A mRNA and protein expression was significantly decreased in the hippocampus vs. naive controls. However, a small decrease was also found in sham-operated and anaesthetized controls. A late induction, at 5 days, of c-fos and nerve growth factor-induced gene B mRNAs was seen bilaterally in the hippocampus and also, in the case of nerve growth factor induced-gene B, in the contralateral cortex. A complex pattern of changes in immediate early gene expression occurs after reversible focal cortical ischemia. This may be important for tissue recovery as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms after stroke.",
