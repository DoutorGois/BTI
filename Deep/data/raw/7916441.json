     "AB": "A significantly lower level of preprodynorphin mRNA hybridization signal was found in hippocampal dentate granule cells of spontaneously hypertensive rats at 4 and 16 weeks old, before and after hypertension development respectively, when compared with preprodynorphin (PPD) mRNA level in the hippocampus of age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats. The possible implications of disturbed PPD mRNA and dynorphin expression in the hippocampus are discussed with regard to pathophysiology of hypertension and central control of cardiovascular function.",
