     "AB": "The prefrontal cortex is critical to working memory processes. Current theories of prefrontal function are largely based on primate behavioural and electrophysiological data. As molecular genetic techniques advance in mice, so investigations into the rodent prefrontal cortex should expand, such that rodent models of prefrontal function during working memory may be used to study the synaptic and molecular basis of the phenomenon. This review attempts to summarize aspects of published data that pertain to working memory and suggest directions that will allow a coherent comparison of prefrontal function and interaction in monkey, rat and mouse.",
