This suggests that the excitatory amino-acid-stimulated metabotropic receptors and/or their coupling are ontogenically regulated. In this, cerebellum differs from other CNS regions where only efficacy changes were described. Differently from hippocampus, the t-ACPD effect, at all ages, is independent of the activation of the NMDA receptor.",
