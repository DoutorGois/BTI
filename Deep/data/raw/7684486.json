     "AB": "The effects of brief repeated swim stress on the expression of GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit mRNAs was investigated in the mouse. Adult male mice were exposed to repeated brief (10 min) swim-stress once daily for 7 or 14 days and the levels of GABAA receptor alpha subunit mRNAs were quantified in the hippocampus 24 h after the last session by Northern analysis. Repeated swim stress for 14 days resulted in a 47.3% +/- 6.5 and 39.8% +/- 7.6 decrease in the levels of the 4.8 kb and 4.4 kb GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit mRNAs, respectively. While there was a trend toward a reduction in the level of GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit mRNAs following 7 days of repeated swim stress, the latter did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, no significant alterations in the levels of glutamic acid decarboxylase or beta-actin mRNAs were observed at either time point. The reduction in GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit mRNAs following repeated swim stress may underlie similar alteration(s) in hippocampal GABAA receptor density previously observed following repeated swim stress.",
