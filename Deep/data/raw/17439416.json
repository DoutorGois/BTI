     "AB": "1. 5-Hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptors have attracted increasing attention as a promising target for antipsychotic therapy. Although many atypical antipsychotic drugs, including the prototype clozapine, have been reported to be partial agonists at 5-HT1A receptors, these results are often fragmental and derived mainly from experiments that used cultured cells. 2. In the present study, [35S]guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) ([35S]GTPgammaS) binding assay in rat hippocampal membranes was applied to a series of antipsychotic drugs, especially atypical antipsychotics. 3. Most, but not all, of atypical antipsychotic drugs and the classical antipsychotic drug nemonapride behaved as partial agonists at 5-HT1A receptors with varied potencies and relative efficacies. The most potent compound was perospirone with a mean EC50 of 27 nmol/L, followed by aripiprazole (45 nmol/L) > ziprasidone (480 nmol/L) > nemonapride (790 nmol/L) > clozapine (3900 nmol/L) > quetiapine (26,000 nmol/L). The maximal percentage increases over the basal binding (%Emax) for these antipsychotic drugs were 30-50%, with the exception of perospirone (approximately 15%), whereas 5-HT stimulated the binding to a mean %Emax of 105%. 4. Increasing concentrations of the selective and neutral 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100635 shifted the concentration-response curve of nemonapride-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding to the right and in parallel. 5. The relative efficacy or intrinsic activity of a compound was affected differently by the differing concentrations of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) in the assay buffer, which should be taken into consideration when determining the relative efficacies of these antipsychotics as 5-HT1A receptor agonists. 6. These results provide important information concerning the relevance of 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist properties in the treatment for schizophrenic patients with most, if not all, of atypical antipsychotic drugs.",
