     "AB": "We studied the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) implantation in male Wistar rats to elucidate the site of action of morphine-induced prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (B) secretion. DEX or cholesterol was implanted in the close vicinity of the paraventricular (PVN), or the arcuate nuclei (ARN) of the hypothalamus or into the hippocampus. Five days after implantation blood samples were taken 30 min after i.p. morphine by decapitation or through an indwelling cannula 15, 30, 60 min after i.v. injection. DEX implanted near the PVN resulted in a blockade of morphine-induced ACTH and B secretion. In contrast, GH response to morphine was enhanced, while that of PRL was unchanged. DEX implanted near the ARN significantly inhibited the PRL-releasing effect of morphine, but was without any influence on the PRL secretion induced by haloperidol. There was a partial reduction in the B response to morphine, and GH secretion was unchanged. Dorsal hippocampal implants were without any effect on the morphine-induced GH, PRL or B secretion. We suggest that the site of glucocorticoid inhibitory action in the hypothalamus is the PVN for the opiate-induced ACTH/B secretion, and the ARN for the morphine-induced PRL release. The enhanced GH response to morphine observed in DEX-PVN implanted rats might be due to a decreased somatostatin tone.",
