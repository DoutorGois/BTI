     "AB": "Some evidences have demonstrated the participation of estrogen receptors (ERs) in rapid, non-genomic actions of estrogen to promote neuroprotection against different toxic agents. However, there is still very little information about the structural nature of these receptors and the manner these proteins may be integrated into the plasma membrane. One of the plausible possibilities is that they may be localized in lipid rafts microstructures where they would be associated with other, still unknown, molecules which may modulate their physiological activities related to cell survival. In this work, we have identified in caveolar fractions of murine septal and hippocampal neurons a membrane-related ER shown to physically interact with, both, a voltage-dependent anion channel and scaffold protein caveolin-1.",
