     "AB": "ES-242-1 approximately 5 are novel microbial bioxanthracenes which do not contain nitrogen. The ES-242s inhibited the binding of [3H]TCP and [3H]CGS19755 to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex. They had no effect on the binding of the specific ligands for the non-NMDA receptor. The biochemical and pharmacological properties of ES-242-1 were fully examined since it is the most potent of the five compounds. ES-242-1 is highly specific for the NMDA receptor; it has no effect on other receptors. Kinetic analyses indicated that ES-242-1 inhibited the binding of [3H]TCP and [3H]CGS19755 in a competitive manner, respectively, suggesting that ES-242-1 interacts with both the transmitter recognition site and the channel domain. ES-242-1 selectively inhibited NMDA-induced Ca2+ influx in primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons. ES-242-1 also specifically blocked the increase in cyclic GMP accumulation induced by NMDA or L-glutamate in rat cerebellar slices. In a concentration range of 0.1-1.0 microM, ES-242-1 was as potent as MK-801 in preventing glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons. These results show that ES-242-1 is a potent and specific antagonist for the NMDA receptor. The antagonistic properties of the ES-242s appear to be due to a novel mechanism of action at the NMDA receptor.",
