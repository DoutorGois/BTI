     "AB": "PURPOSE: To report a novel malformation in a male subject with refractory partial seizures. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and data reformatting in a subject referred for management of partial seizures. RESULTS: The patient had four distinct partial seizure types, without learning disability. MRI demonstrated the novel association of bilateral laminar subcortical heterotopia, bilateral temporal periventricular heterotopia, and hippocampal malformation. CONCLUSIONS: This previously unreported complex bilateral neocortical and archicortical malformation in a male patient cannot be explained by known genetic causes of heterotopia, raising the possibility of a novel gene involved in brain formation.",
