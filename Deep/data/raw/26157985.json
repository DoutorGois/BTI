     "AB": "Axonal injury and stress have long been thought to play a pathogenic role in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. However, a model for studying single-cell axonal injury in mammalian cells and the processes of repair has not been established. The purpose of this study was to examine the response of neuronal growth cones to laser-induced axonal damage in cultures of embryonic rat hippocampal neurons and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived human neurons. A 532-nm pulsed [Formula: see text] picosecond laser was focused to a diffraction limited spot at a precise location on an axon using a laser energy/power that did not rupture the cell membrane (subaxotomy). Subsequent time series images were taken to follow axonal recovery and growth cone dynamics. After laser subaxotomy, axons thinned at the damage site and initiated a dynamic cytoskeletal remodeling process to restore axonal thickness. The growth cone was observed to play a role in the repair process in both hippocampal and iPSC-derived neurons. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed structural tubulin damage and revealed initial phases of actin-based cytoskeletal remodeling at the damage site. The results of this study indicate that there is a repeatable and cross-species repair response of axons and growth cones after laser-induced damage.",
