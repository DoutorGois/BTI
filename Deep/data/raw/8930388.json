     "AB": "Intracerebroventricular administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; 100 nmol) to rats increased oxygen tension and blood flow of the caudate putamen and the ventral hippocampus. The regional differences in the increase in oxygen tension could not be explained in terms of those in the blood flow. NMDA also increased the temperature of the two brain regions to a similar extent, and these increases preceded that in the rectum. These findings suggest that NMDA receptor stimulation leads to exposure of the brain to a higher oxygen level and higher temperature, which might be involved in NMDA neurotoxicity.",
