     "AB": "Various opioid agonists and antagonists were examined for their ability to alter extracellularly and intracellularly recorded CA1 pyramidal cell activity. All opioid agonists tested, with the exception of [D-ala2]deltorphin II, increased primary population spike amplitude. Of these active agonists, all except DPDPE and p-Cl-DPDPE produced secondary population spikes. DSLET and DAMGO, but not DPDPE, reduced the amplitude of the orthodromically stimulated IPSP. Naltrexone antagonized the actions of all agonists tested. The actions of DPDPE and p-Cl-DPDPE, but not those of DSLET, DAMGO or morphine, were antagonized by the delta antagonist naltrindole. Similarly, the delta antagonist ICI-174,864 blocked the actions of DPDPE, but not DSLET or DAMGO. Based on the inactivity of [D-ala2]deltorphin II and the lack of delta antagonist-sensitive actions of DSLET, the data suggest that the delta 1 subtype is the predominant delta subtype in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.",
