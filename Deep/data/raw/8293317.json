     "AB": "The distribution of androgen receptor-like (AR) immunoreactivity was mapped in brains of (a) intact, sham-castrated and (b) castrated male hamsters. The pattern of AR-immunoreactive (AR-ir) staining was, in general, similar to that reported for gonadal steroid autoradiography of the male hamster brain. Moreover, with one exception, AR-like staining was similar in intact and castrated males, and occurred in the medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and several hypothalamic nuclei including the periventricular, supraoptic, and ventromedial nuclei, and median eminence. However, while AR-ir labeling was virtually absent in the lateral septum of intact males, it was clearly present in the lateral septum of castrated males. The view that androgen receptors in brain generally decline after castration received no support from this study.",
