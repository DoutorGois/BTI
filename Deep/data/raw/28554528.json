     "AB": "Evidence indicates that the brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) ligand lobeline reduces depression-like behaviors, ethanol drinking, and nicotine withdrawal-induced depression-like behaviors. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of lobeline on ethanol abstinence-induced depression-like behavior and associated neuroadaptive changes in mice. Adult C57BL/6J male mice were allowed to drink 10% ethanol for 4 weeks using a two-bottle choice procedure. Mice were tested after 24 h and 14 days of ethanol abstinence in a forced swim test (FST), a measure for depression-like behavior. Acute lobeline treatment (1 mg/kg) significantly reduced immobility time compared to controls after 24 h and 14 days of abstinence. In addition, abstinence from chronic ethanol exposure reduced serotonin levels in the hippocampus, which was reversed by acute lobeline treatment. Repeated lobeline treatment (1 mg/kg, once daily) for 14 days during ethanol abstinence also significantly reduced FST immobility in mice exposed to ethanol. Chronic ethanol exposure significantly reduced the number of 5-bromo 2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, indicating decreased hippocampal cell proliferation. Abstinence from chronic ethanol exposure also decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the dentate gyrus and CA3 region of the hippocampus. In contrast, repeated lobeline treatment significantly increased both BrdU- and BDNF-positive cells. Taken together, our results indicate that lobeline produced antidepressant-like effects, likely by targeting brain beta2-containing nAChRs, serotonergic neurotransmission, and/or hippocampal cell proliferation. Therefore, lobeline may have therapeutic utility to treat alcohol abstinence-induced depression.",
