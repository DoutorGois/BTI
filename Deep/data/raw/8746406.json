     "AB": "A computational model of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus is presented. The model assumes the existence of retrograde signals, is in good agreement with several experimental data on LTP, LTD, and their pharmacological manipulations, and shows how a simple kinetic scheme can capture the essential characteristics of the processes involved in LTP and LTD. We propose that LTP and LTD could be two different but conceptually similar processes, induced by the same class of retrograde signals, and maintained by two distinct mechanisms. An interpretation of a number of experiments in terms of the molecular processes involved in LTP and LTD induction and maintenance, and the roles of a retrograde signal are presented and discussed.",
