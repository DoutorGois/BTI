     "AB": "In order to develop a model of persistent sensorimotor gating that did not require acute NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor blockade, adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were pre-treated with N-methyl-scopolamine (1 mg/kg s.c.), then administered MK-801 (dizocilpine, 5 mg/kg i.p.) along with two separate doses (5 mg/kg) of pilocarpine. The drug regimen was repeated four and eight days later. Controls received saline in lieu of any drug. Ten days after the last neurotoxic treatment, rats had a significant impairment (reduction) in pre-pulse inhibition (PPI). Each treatment group (neurotoxic treated and control) was then divided into two groups for treatment with saline or 0.5 mg/kg nicotine, administered s.c. twice daily from days 10 to 23. The rats were tested for sensorimotor gating on days 17 and 22 shortly after the morning nicotine administration. Nicotine did not affect the PPI in control animals. On day 17, PPI impairment was sustained in neurotoxically treated rats, regardless of saline or nicotine treatment. On day 22, however, the effect of neurotoxic treatment on PPI was totally absent in saline treated rats, whereas in nicotine treated rats, PPI impairment was still evident. Combination of nicotine and neurotoxic treatment also caused an up-regulation of high affinity nicotinic receptors in the cortex and the thalamus and apparent normalization of low affinity nicotinic receptors in the hippocampus. The findings indicate that muscarinic activation, in conjunction with neurotoxic NMDA receptor antagonism, produces relatively long-term impairment in auditory gating, a result relevant to modeling clinical observations of schizophrenia-associated symptoms. Contrary to expectation, nicotine administration in this model resulted in further impairment rather than amelioration of PPI. The results suggest a sustainable model of PPI impairment and possible role of nicotinic receptors in selective brain regions in this behavior.",
