     "AB": "Severe forebrain ischemia induces a large increase in expression of NMDA receptor subunits in rat brain. One week after ischemia, levels of NMDA-R1 mRNAs in the CA1 pyramidal cells of hippocampus are 7 times higher than those observed in control rats. At 7 days postischemia, an enhanced immunostaining of the NMDA-R1 subunit was observed in all hippocampal structures indicating that changes in mRNA levels are accompanied by changes in receptor protein level. Riluzole, a potent inhibitor of glutamate release and CNQX, a selective AMPA/kainate antagonist, drastically reduced the ischemia-induced expression of mRNAs for the three NMDA receptor subunits while D-AP5, a selective NMDA antagonist, had essentially no effect. Therefore ischemia-induced expression of NMDA receptor subunits is associated with glutamate release and proceeds via an AMPA/kainate pathway. These results together with those of other groups concerning ischemia effects on AMPA and GABAA receptor levels, suggest an important role of the induced expression of NMDA receptor subunits in the deleterious effects of ischemia.",
