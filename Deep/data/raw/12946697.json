     "AB": "Clathrin adaptor protein (AP)180 is a synaptic protein that regulates the assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles. Several endocytic proteins including AP2, CALM, and epsin 1 have functions or molecular structures similar to AP180. We determined if AP180 associates with functional synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons. We also compared the expression pattern of AP180 with the other endocytic proteins. The distribution of AP180 corresponded with the synaptic vesicle-associated protein synapsin I, and with functional presynaptic terminals labeled with the styryl dye FM1-43. Synaptic AP2 colocalized with AP180, but the distribution of AP2 was not limited to synapses of neurons and it was also expressed in glia. CLAM and epsin 1 immunoreactivities were also detected in both neurons and glia. Unlike AP180, the neuronal immunoreactivity of CALM was not intense in the synaptic puncta. Epsin 1 immunoreactivity was found in both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites, and its synaptic distribution only partially overlapped with that of AP180. These results support roles for AP180 in synaptic function in neurons. The findings also provide information on the distribution of AP2, CALM, and epsin 1 in cells of the nervous system that suggest different roles for these endocytic proteins in the biology of these cells.",
