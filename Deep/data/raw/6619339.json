     "AB": "The morphology and connections of the indusium griseum (IG) and anterior hippocampal continuation (AHC) suggest that this cortex contains analogues to several portions of the hippocampal formation. Whereas the outer neuronal layer of this cortex is made up of cells which are similar in structure to the neurons of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, the three successively deeper layers contain morphological analogues to the neurons of the dentate hilus, Ammon's horn, and the subiculum, respectively. The neurons within each of these four layers of the AHC and IG have afferent and efferent connections which are quite similar to the connections of their hippocampal counterparts. Thus, the granule cells of the IG and AHC receive laminar inputs from the entorhinal cortex, the IG-AHC itself, and the supramammillary region. Each of these three classes of inputs ends at successively more proximal positions on the dendritic tree of these granule cells. Other inputs to this region include those from the septal nuclei and the olfactory bulb. The deeper layers of the IG and AHC receive several inputs, including those from the thalamic and septal nuclei and the entorhinal cortex. The efferent cell bodies of the IG and AHC are segregated in such a way that the granule cells appear to give rise to only short connections, while the hilar cells project to the granule cells, the intermediate pyramidal neurons project to other portions of the IG and AHC and to the olfactory bulb, and the deep pyramidal neurons project to the diencephalon. These results demonstrate that the IG-AHC is a continuation of the hippocampal formation.",
