     "AB": "The family of neuronal Ca2+ sensor (NCS) proteins is known to influence a variety of physiological and pathological processes by affecting signalling of different receptors and ion channels. Recently, it has been shown that the NCS protein VILIP-1 influences the activity of the receptor guanylyl cyclase GC-B. In transfected cell lines, VILIP-1 performs a Ca2+-dependent membrane association, the reversible Ca2+-myristoyl switch of VILIP-1, which leads to an increase in natriuretic peptide-stimulated cGMP levels. In this study, we have investigated the effect of VILIP-1 on cGMP signalling in C6 cells and in primary hippocampal neurons, where VILIP-1 and GC-B are co-expressed in many but not all neurons and partially co-localize in the soma and in dendrites. Our data indicate that VILIP-1 modulates GC-B activity by influencing clathrin-dependent receptor recycling. These data support a general physiological role for VILIP-1 in membrane trafficking in the intact hippocampus, where the NCS protein may affect processes, such as neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity e.g. by influencing cGMP-signalling.",
