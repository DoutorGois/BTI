     "AB": "Long-term treatment of rats with clinically effective tricyclic antidepressant drugs induced a selective increase in the inhibitory response of forebrain neurons to serotonin applied by microiontophoresis. Long-term administration of some related drugs which lack antidepressant efficacy failed to induce such a change. The enhanced response to serotonin induced by the clinically active tricyclic drugs took 1 to 2 weeks to develop, a time course which correlates with the delayed onset of therapeutic effects in humans.",
