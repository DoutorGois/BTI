     "AB": "The temporal expression pattern of jun genes was studied in the hippocampal slice preparation. Slices were kept either in a physiological Ringer solution or a modified medium, substituting calcium (Ca2+) by magnesium (Mg2+). All three jun genes were expressed in a circumscribed, independent fashion with respect to distribution, intensity and time course. c-jun and junD were expressed strongly throughout the hippocampus with a shift from DG to CA1 to CA3. junB expression was confined to DG and CA1, but substitution of Ca2+ by Mg2+ led to profound changes: the signal rose earlier, was prolonged, strongly enhanced and more widespread. Our findings suggest, that changes in differential expression of jun gene transcripts are important for parallel processing of non-convergent stimuli.",
