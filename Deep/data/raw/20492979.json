     "AB": "In vitro labeling of tissue sections with [(3)H]sulpiride has been utilized in the present study to autoradiographically localize D(2)-dopamine receptors in the rat brain. Preliminary biochemical studies, using slide-mounted tissue sections, were performed to define the optimal labeling conditions for this binding. Autoradiograms were generated by apposition of the labeled tissue sections to tritium-sensitive film. Specific binding sites for [(3)H]sulpiride were localized to the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, pituitary, laminae I and III of the entorhinal cortex, substantia nigra, lateral mammillary nucleus and the stratum-lacunosum moleculare of the hippocampus. The high selectivity of [(3)H]sulpiride for the D(2)-dopamine receptor indicates that it is a valuable tool for the autoradiographic localization and quantitation of neuroleptic receptors.",
