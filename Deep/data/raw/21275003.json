     "AB": "The role of caspases in the regulation of apoptosis of neurons during development is well established. An emerging body of evidence indicates that caspases may also play significant roles which are nonapoptotic. We have demonstrated previously that the executor caspase-3 exhibited a unique pattern of spatiotemporal expression in the postnatal rat hippocampal subregions, and the activation of caspase-3 in different hippocampal neurons appeared to have distinct roles during postnatal development. In the present study, we examined the expressions of initiator caspases in the hippocampus, using immunofluorescent staining for caspase-8 and caspase-9, and Hoechst 33342 staining for nuclear chromatin to assess caspase-8 and -9 expression in the CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus (DG) on postnatal days (P) 0, P2, P4, P7, P14, P21, P28, P56. The results indicate that caspase-8 and caspase-9 were expressed in pyramidal neurons of CA1 and CA3 fields, and granular neurons of the DG during development. Caspase-8 was expressed in a general upward trend while caspase-9 showed a slight downward pattern, but still remained at high levels in the adult hippocampus. The expression profiles of caspases-8 and -9 are distinct from that of the apoptotic cells. These data indicate that caspase-8 may be involved not only in the classical apoptotic function, but also in the cell death of necrosis, and in response to different insults and other nonapoptotic functions. Caspase-9 plays a role in apoptosis during postnatal development, but it may have other functions as well.",
