Comparison of the radiolabelled products of a novel tributylstannyl precursor with those of the established triazene and exchange methods.",

     "AB": "Radioiodinated (R,S)-IQNB and (R,R)-IQNB are prepared either from a triazene precursor or using an exchange reaction. In both cases the radiochemical yield is low. The product of the exchange reaction also suffers from having a fairly low specific activity. A new method for preparing radioiodinated (R,S)-IQNB and (R,R)-IQNB from a tributylstannyl precursor has recently been developed. This method is more convenient and much faster than the triazene and exchange methods, and it reliably results in a high radiochemical yield of a high specific activity product. In rat brain, the in vivo properties of the radioiodinated products of the tributylstannyl method are identical to those of the corresponding radioiodinated (R,S)-IQNB and (R,R)-IQNB prepared using the triazene and exchange methods. Dissection studies of selected brain regions show that at 3 h post injection (R,S)-[125I]IQNB prepared by all three methods have indistinguishable % dose g-1 values in all brain regions studied. Autoradiographic comparison of coronal slices through the anteroventral nucleus of the thalamus, through the hippocampus and through the pons at 2 h post injection shows that (R,S)-[125I]IQNB prepared by the triazene and tributylstannyl methods have indistinguishable patterns of binding.",
