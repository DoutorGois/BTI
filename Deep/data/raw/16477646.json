     "AB": "Sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters (SVCTs) is known to transport the reduced form of ascorbic acid into the cell, whereas the oxidized form of vitamin C (VC) is moved through a facilitative sugar transporter, such as glucose transporter (GLUT). With regard to the distribution of SVCT1 and -2 within the various organs, they were reported to be expressed in different types of cells. Especially in the central nervous system, only SVCT2 mRNA was expressed mainly in neurons and some types of neuroglial cells. However, data on the expression of SVCT proteins in the brain are scant. Therefore, we tried to develop comprehensive data on the distribution of SVCT proteins in adult rat brain by using immunohistochemical techniques for the first time. In our study, SVCT2 immunoreactivities (IRs) were intensely localized in the neurons of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and Purkinje cells of cerebellum, and much weaker SVCT2 IRs were found in the other brain regions. Judging from double-immunohistochemical data, most of the cells expressing SVCT2 IRs were likely to be neurons or microglia, even though the cells in choroids plexus or ependymal cells around the ventricles also exhibited SVCT2 IRs. Complete mapping of the distribution of SVCT2 IRs was available by using a semiquantitative method. The subcellular localization of SVCT proteins is necessary for understanding the exact role of the protein, so the current overall mapping of SVCT IRs in the rat brain could be the basis for further studies on related subjects.",
