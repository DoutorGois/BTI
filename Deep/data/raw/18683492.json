     "AB": "We studied behavioral reactions of rats after injection of subconvulsive dose of kainic acid into the frontal cortex and mitochondrial respiration in the hippocampus and frontal and temporal cortex 17-20 days after administration of kainic acid. Retention of acquired habit and the dynamics of its extinction in experimental rats were close to those in the control group. Changes in mitochondrial function were observed only in the region of kainic acid injection: activation of phosphorylating respiration during oxidation of succinate. Presumably, the detected activation of energy metabolism in the frontal cortex indicates functional restructuring in mitochondria, aimed at compensation of disorders caused by the neurotoxin.",
