The obtained results indicate: 1. C-terminal fragment of SP (SP6-11) in 10 microM concentration stimulates the Ca2+,Mg2(+)-ATPase activities from cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Na+,K(+)-ATPase from cerebral cortex is hardly sensitive to the action of this fragment. 2. N-terminal fragment of SP (SP1-5) in 10 microM concentration increases Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity from cerebral cortex and hippocampus. 3. N-terminal tetrapeptide (SP1-4) exerts no influence on ATPases independently from their brain localization. 4. The activity of monoamine oxidase after use of C- and N-terminal fragments is unchanged.",
