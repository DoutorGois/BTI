     "AB": "In previous studies we have suggested that the dorsal hippocampus is involved in spatial consolidation by showing that rats with electrolytic hippocampal lesions exhibit a profound deficit in the retention of an allocentric task 24 days after the acquisition. However, in various hippocampal-dependent tasks, several studies have shown an overestimation of the behavioral deficit when electrolytic versus axon-sparing cytotoxic lesions has been used. For this reason, in this report we compare the effects on spatial retention of electrolytic and neurotoxic lesions to the dorsal hippocampus. Results showed a similar deficit in spatial retention in both groups 24 days after acquisition. Thus, the hippocampus proper and not fibers of passage or extrahippocampal damage is directly responsible for the deficit in spatial retention seen in rats with electrolytic lesions.",
