     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of sorphoridine (SR) on electroencephalograph (EEG) and ethological changes as well as neurons ultrastructure alterations in CA3 of hippocampus in rats. METHODS: Tiny electrodes were embedded into hippocampus of male SD rats. The EEG and behavior changes were observed simultaneously and ultrastructure of morphological deformation of neurons in CA3 of hippocampus were observed with electron microscope at 0.5, 1.5, 8 hours after SR were injected intraperitoneally on freely moving rats. RESULTS: There were no epileptiform discharges and seizure activities observed in control group. There was no abnormality seen on neuron in hippocampus of CA3 in control group. While there were epileptiform discharges and convulsions observed simultaneously when SR were administrated at the dose of 55 mg/kg intraperitoneally. 0.5, 1.5, 8 hours after SR, mitochondrion showed swelling cristae and ruptured membrane. Organelle burst and degeneration of synapses were seen with electromicroscope in CA3 of hippocampus ,especially at 1.5 hours after SR administration. CONCLUSION: Sophoridine can induce acute seizure activity on rats and cause mitochondrion ultrastructural damage. The ultrastructural damage of mitochondrion occurs in the early period after SR administration. It indicates that the injury of mitochondria could be critical in neuron damage caused by sorphoridine.",
