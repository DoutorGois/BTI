     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features of autopsy-proven corticobasal degeneration (CBD). METHODS: We evaluated symptoms, signs, and neuropsychological deficits longitudinally in 15 patients with autopsy-proven CBD and related these observations directly to the neuroanatomic distribution of disease. RESULTS: At presentation, a specific pattern of cognitive impairment was evident, whereas an extrapyramidal motor abnormality was present in less than half of the patients. Follow-up examination revealed persistent impairment of apraxia and executive functioning, worsening language performance, and preserved memory. The motor disorder emerged and worsened as the condition progressed. Statistical analysis associated cognitive deficits with tau-immunoreactive pathology that is significantly more prominent in frontal and parietal cortices and the basal ganglia than temporal neocortex and the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: The clinical diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration should depend on a specific pattern of impaired cognition as well as an extrapyramidal motor disorder, reflecting the neuroanatomic distribution of disease in frontal and parietal cortices and the basal ganglia.",
