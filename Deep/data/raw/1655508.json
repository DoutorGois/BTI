     "AB": "Nerve cells that lack the cytoplasmic Ca2+ binding protein Calbindin-D28K (CaBP) appear to be selectively vulnerable to Ca(2+)-related injury consistent with a postulated intraneuronal Ca(2+)-buffering role of CaBP. We have confirmed the selective loss of CaBP from the dentate gyrus during kindling-induced epilepsy in acutely dissociated granule cells (GCs) from kindled rats. Immunohistochemically stained kindled neurons showed a significant loss of CaBP when compared to controls (p less than 0.001; ANOVA). The Ca(2+)-buffering role of CaBP was assessed in acutely dissociated control and kindled GCs by examining a physiological process highly sensitive to intracellular Ca(2+)-buffering: the Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of high-voltage activated (HVA or L-type) Ca2+ currents in the absence (or presence) of exogenous Ca(2+)-chelators. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings in kindled GCs demonstrated a markedly enhanced Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of Ca(2+)-currents. After brief conditioning Ca2+ currents, in the absence of an exogenous intraneuronal Ca(2+)-chelator, subsequent test Ca2+ currents were inactivated by 58.3% in kindled GCs, a significant increase from the 37.4% inactivation observed in control GCs (p less than 0.005; ANOVA). The differential Ca2+ current decay and Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation were prevented in both control and kindled GCs upon loading the neurons with the exogenous Ca(2+)-chelator BAPTA. These experiments demonstrate a high correlation between the loss of CaBP and changes in Ca2+ current inactivation and are consistent with the hypothesis that CaBP contributes to the physiological Ca(2+)-buffering in mammalian neurons.",
