     "AB": "Essential metals are differentially accumulated within the brain and have been related to normal neurotransmitter metabolism. Hippocampal glutaminergic pathways have the highest zinc levels in the brain, and lesions to these pathways disrupt behaviors with a spatial component. Zinc distribution may thus reflect glutaminergic activity or innervation and may have functional consequences for spatial behavior. The present data support this hypothesis, indicating that the lateral distribution of zinc between the right and left hippocampus is strongly correlated with the spatial preference of the animal (r = + 0.72). Other parameters tested but shown not to be significantly correlated with spatial preference were zinc in corpus striatum and cortex, and copper in hippocampus corpus striatum and cortex.",
