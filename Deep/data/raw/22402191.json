     "AB": "Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic (H-I) is a major cause of brain injury in the newborn. The hippocampus is more sensitive to H-I injury than the other brain regions. It is believed that H-I brain damage causes a loss of neurons in the central nervous system. The patterns of neuronal death include apoptosis and necrosis. With regard to the responses of neurons, the neural functional changes should be earlier than the morphologic changes. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the electrophysiological characteristics and the synaptic transmission functions. Seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups were randomly divided into sham operation and H-I groups. The patch clamp, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting techniques were used to achieve this objective. The results of the study showed a decrease in neuronal excitability and a significant increase in the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents and the duration of EPSCs in the CA1 pyramidal cells of H-I brain damage rats. The glutamate transporter subtype 1 (GLT-1) expression level of the hippocampal CA1 area in the H-I group was decreased compared with the control. There was no difference in the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents and should be no difference in the expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and synaptophysin between the control and H-I brain injury group. These results revealed that changes of electrophysiological characteristics and synaptic functions occur instantly after H-I brain damage in the hippocampal pyramidal cells of neonatal rats. The failure to eliminate glutamate should be one of the important factors of excitotoxicity injury on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, while neuronal excitation was not increased in the H-I brain injury model.",
