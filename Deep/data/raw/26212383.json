     "AB": "Metabotropic GABA(B) receptors are known to modulate the activity of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Previously, we have shown that GABA(B) receptors couple to a non-Gi/o G-protein to enhance calcium influx through L-type calcium channels by activating protein kinase C in neonatal rat hippocampal neurons. In this study, the components of this signaling pathway were investigated further. Galphaq was knocked down using morpholino oligonucleotides prior to examining GABA(B) -mediated enhancement of calcium influx. When Galphaq G-proteins were eliminated using morpholino-mediated knockdown, the enhancing effects of the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen (10 muM) on calcium current or entry were eliminated. These data suggest that GABA(B) receptors couple to Galphaq to regulate calcium influx. Confocal imaging analysis illustrating colocalization of GABA(B) receptors with Galphaq supports this hypothesis. Furthermore, baclofen treatment caused translocation of PKCalpha (protein kinase C alpha) but not PKCbeta or PKCepsilon, suggesting that it is the alpha isoform of PKC that mediates calcium current enhancement. Inhibition of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II did not affect the baclofen-mediated enhancement of calcium levels. In summary, activation of GABA(B) receptors during development leads to increased calcium in a subset of neurons through Galphaq signaling and PKCalpha activation without the involvement of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II. Activation of GABA(B) receptors in the neonatal rat hippocampus enhances voltage-dependent calcium currents independently of Gi/o . In this study, knockdown of Galphaq with morpholino oligonucleotides abolished enhancement of calcium influx and protein kinase Calpha was activated by GABA(B) receptors. Therefore, we hypothesize that GABA(B) receptors couple to Gq to activate PKCalpha leading to enhancement of L-type calcium current.",
