     "AB": "The coactivation of prefrontal and hippocampal networks in oscillatory rhythms is critical for precise information flow in mnemonic and executive tasks, yet the mechanisms governing its development are still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that already in neonatal rats, patterns of discontinuous oscillatory activity precisely entrain the firing of prefrontal neurons and have distinct spatial and temporal organization over cingulate and prelimbic cortices. Moreover, we show that hippocampal theta bursts drive the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations by phase-locking the neuronal firing via axonal pathways. Consequently, functional impairment of the hippocampus reduces the prefrontal activity. With ongoing maturation continuous theta-gamma oscillations emerge and mutually entrain the prejuvenile prefrontal-hippocampal networks. Thus, theta-modulated communication within developing prefrontal-hippocampal networks may be relevant for circuitry refinement and maturation of functional units underlying information storage at adulthood.",
