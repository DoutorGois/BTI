     "AB": "Intraperitoneal administration of thymopentin, a thymopentin II-derived pentapeptide, had no stable and evident effect in the two anxiety models (elevated plus-maze and licking-conflict test) studied. However, in the elevated plus-maze test thymopentin antagonized the behavioral effects of DMCM, a beta-carboline derivative with anxiogenic properties. Further, it was demonstrated that the licking-conflict test procedure itself produced a significant elevation of plasma corticosterone levels, increased the number of [3H]flunitrazepam and decreased the number of [3H]muscimol binding sites in rat hippocampus. The forced-swimming stress similarly to the licking-conflict test also caused an increase in hippocampal [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites. Although ineffective behaviorally in the tests for anxiety, thymopentin pretreatment effectively reversed the changes in corticosterone levels caused by the licking-conflict test. Moreover, it normalized the changed number of benzodiazepine and GABA receptors after stressful stimuli. It is well known that not all anxiolytic drugs (i.e. buspirone) are equally active in behavioral tests for anxiety. According to our data we propose that thymopentin has stress-protective activity. As in vivo and in vitro thymopentin did not change [3H]-flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol binding, the direct effect of this peptide on the GABA-benzodiazepine-Cl- ionophore receptor complex is unlikely. The action of this peptide on GABA release and/or metabolism can be suggested.",
