     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to examine the physiologic changes caused by 10 minutes of umbilical cord occlusion in fetal sheep and to determine the correlation between fetal acidemia or cerebral ischemia and hippocampal neuronal damage. STUDY DESIGN: Thirteen fetal sheep were instrumented and catheterized. Carotid artery blood flow (CaF), fetal mean arterial blood pressure (FMABP), pH, PCO (2), base excess, oxygen saturation (SatO(2)), and PO (2) were monitored throughout the occlusion study. Brain sections were examined for the hippocampal neuronal damage. RESULTS: Our data showed severe ischemia (CaF: 10 +/- 7 mL/min; FMABP: 29 +/- 8 mm Hg) and acidemia (pH: 7.0 +/- 0.05; base excess: -9.9 +/- 2.4 mEq/L) at the end of occlusion. The neuronal damage score had significant correlations with ischemia and also with reperfusion, but not with the acidemic or hypoxic parameters. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the degree of hippocampal damage was correlated with the degree of ischemia and reperfusion.",
