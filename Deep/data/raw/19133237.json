     "AB": "As humans age, cognitive performance decreases differentially across individuals. This age-related decline in otherwise healthy individuals is likely due to the interaction of multiple factors including genetics and environment. We hypothesized that altered spatial memory performance in genetically similar mice could be in part due to differential gene expression patterns in the hippocampus. To investigate this we utilized Morris water maze (MWM) testing in a group of young (3 months) and aged (24 months) C57BL/J male mice. Two sub-groups were identified in the aged animals; one in which MWM performance was not significantly different when compared to the young animals (aged-unimpaired; \"AU\") and one in which performance was significantly different by 1.5 standard deviations from the mean (aged-impaired; \"AI\"). One week after testing was completed the entire hippocampus was collected from six each of AU, AI and young mice and their gene expression profiles were compared using Affymetrix microarrays. Benjamini and Hochberg FDR correction at p<0.05 identified 18 genes differentially expressed between the AI and AU mice. The correlation between behavioral deficits and gene expression patterning allows a better understanding of how altered gene expression in the hippocampus contributes to accelerated age-related cognitive decline and delineates between gene expression changes associated with normal aging vs. memory performance.",
