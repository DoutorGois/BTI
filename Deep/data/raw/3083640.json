     "AB": "VM mice were inoculated by intracerebral and intraperitoneal routes with brain homogenates containing the 87V strain of scrapie. The distribution and numbers of plaques were found for the parietal cortex, cingulate cortex, corpus callosum and hippocampus/dentate in coronal sections cut at the level of the thalamus and stained with Masson's trichrome. For the intracerebrally injected animals, the greatest numbers were seen on the side of the brain that had been injected. In the four regions, they were most numerous in the corpus callosum and least numerous in the parietal cortex and hippocampus/dentate. Following an intraperitoneal injection, plaques were absent from the corpus callosum and, in the remaining three regions, they were less numerous than in intracerebrally injected animals, although their relative numbers were similar. The distribution of the plaques was suggestive of an initial passive spread of inoculum following intracerebral injection and a tendency for plaques to be associated with myelinated axon tracts.",
