     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether dexamethasone (DXM) regulate the expression of Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), Endothelin (ET), Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), Angiotensin II (AII) in brain injury induced by endotoxin in rabbit. METHODS: Sixty-five New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into 3 subgroups: endotoxin group (A group), endotoxin + DXM group (B group) and normal saline group (C group). 100 microg/kg endotoxin was intracerebroventricularly injected in A group, endotoxin 100 microg/kg + DXM 1 mg/kg in B group and same volume of normal saline in C group as control. Neuropeptide level were detected by radioimmunoassay in variable periods (3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h after injection) in the plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue (hippocampus area), and brain water content was measured by dry method. RESULTS: CGRP, ET, ANP, AII concentrations in plasma, CSF and brain tissue changed in variable periods after injection. The higher or the lower neuropeptide levels were emerged on 12 - 24 hours after injection (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), and changed remarkably in A group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Brain water content were significantly higher and reached to peak level on 24 hours after injection. But there was a significantly increasing in A group compared to that of B group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The timely changes of CGRP, ET, ANP, AII were related to brain injury and brain edema induced by endotoxin, and DXM regulated the expression of neuropeptides and lighten brain edema.",
