     "AB": "The role of the human amygdala in cross-modal associations was investigated in two subjects: SM-046, who had bilateral damage circumscribed to the amygdala; and the patient known as Boswell, whose damage in both temporal lobes includes the amygdala and surrounding cortices. Neither subject was impaired on Tactile-Visual or Visual-Tactile cross-modal tasks using the Arc-Circle test, suggesting that the amygdala is not involved in cross-modal associations involving perceptually \"equivalent\" basic stimulus properties. On the other hand, the results are compatible with the amygdala's involvement in higher-order associations between exteroceptive sensory data and interoceptive data concerned with correlated somatic states.",
