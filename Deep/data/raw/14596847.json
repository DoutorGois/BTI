     "AB": "Acid-base transporters, such as the sodium-hydrogen exchangers (NHEs) and bicarbonate-dependent transporters, play an important role in the regulation of intracellular pH (pH(i)) in the CNS. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the absence of the major NHE isoform 1 (NHE1) reduced the steady-state pH(i) and recovery rate from an acid load in the hippocampal neurons not only in HEPES but also in HCO(3)(-) solutions (Yao et al., 1999). The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the NHE1 null mutation affects the expression of pH-regulatory transporters in the mouse CNS. Immunoblotting and semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed to examine the protein and mRNA levels of NHE1-4, electrogenic sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter 1 variants (NBCe1), and brain-specific anion exchanger 3 (AE3) in four brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and brainstem-diencephalon). NHE1 null mutant mice were compared with their wild type controls at the average age of approximately 4 weeks. Our results revealed that the NHE1 null mutation caused a significant increase in NHE3 in the cerebellum (84% for protein, 105% for mRNA), an increase in NBCe1 expression in the brainstem-diencephalon (approximately 40-50% for protein, 9-15% for mRNA), as well as a decrease in AE3 in the hippocampus (approximately 60% for protein, 24% for mRNA). We conclude that the NHE1 null mutation does alter the expression of other membrane transporters at both protein and mRNA levels. The alteration is region-specific. An increase in acid extruders (e.g. NHE3) and a decrease in acid loaders (e.g. AE3) suggest that there are some compensatory mechanisms that occur in NHE1 null mutant mice.",
