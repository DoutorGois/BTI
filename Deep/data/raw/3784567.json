     "AB": "A simple organ bath was designed for the rapid screening of drugs using electrically stimulated brain slices. Control parameters for the release of 3H-5-HT from rat caudate slices using a simple pulse sequence were developed. Field-stimulated release of serotonin was shown to be calcium dependent and was not inhibited by tetrodotoxin. Preliminary experiments into the inhibition of 3H-5-HT release by lysergic acid diethylamide showed moderate inhibition of electrically stimulated overflow from rat caudate at low concentrations. The ratio of postdrug tritium overflow (S2) to predrug tritium overflow (S1) was determined and used as the measure of inhibition in these experiments. An investigation into drug-stimulated 3H-5-HT release from rat hippocampal slices by methylenedioxyamphetamine revealed significant stimulation of tritium overflow. Overall the new organ bath has fulfilled our need for a rapid central nervous system screening procedure by demonstrating experimental versatility and reproducible results.",
