     "AB": "Despite very extensive investigations on molecular processes underlying memory formation, there are very few studies examining potential differences in the brain biochemistry between \"good\" and \"poor\" learners belonging to a random population of young animals. In the present study, an attempt was made to correlate individual variation in spatial learning in young-adult Long-Evans rats with hippocampal levels of protein kinase A (PKA), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKIIalpha), and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Additionally, in order to indirectly estimate the activity of CaMKIIalpha and PKA, hippocampal levels of their phosphorylated forms (pCaMKIIalpha and pPKA) were assessed using Western blot technique. Rats were classified as \"good\" and \"poor\" learners on the basis of their performance in a partially baited 12-arm radial maze. The biochemical assays did not reveal a significant difference in the basal hippocampal levels of the CaMKIIalpha, however, the level of pCaMKIIalpha, was significantly higher in \"good\" learners. Also, hippocampal levels of both PKA and pPKA, as well as that of ChAT, were significantly higher in \"good\" as compared to \"poor\" learners. Our results suggest that the differences in the expression level of PKA and ChAT (but not of CaMKIIalpha), as well as the differences in the activation of both PKA and CaMKIIalpha, may contribute to the individual variation in learning skills and episodic-like memory in a random population of young-adult subjects.",
