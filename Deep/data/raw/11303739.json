     "AB": "L-Serine has been suggested by in vitro studies to be an important neurotrophic factor which supports survival and neurite outgrowth of neurons. It is also a precursor of D-serine, a putative neurotransmitter. In the present study, we raised antibodies against L-serine in a rabbit and examined immunohistochemical distribution of the amino acid in the rat brain. In the hippocampus and the cerebellar cortex, where neurotrophic effects of L-serine have been indicated, L-serine immunoreactivity was found primarily in astrocytes. In the brain stem, where neuronal distribution of D-serine was reported, positive staining for L-serine was located primarily in neurons. Regional differences of cellular distribution of L-serine were indicated.",
