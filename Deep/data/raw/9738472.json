     "AB": "A new member of the two transmembrane domain potassium (K+) channel family was identified and isolated from a human brain cDNA library. The cDNA clone contains an open reading frame which encodes a 360 amino acid sequence with a characteristic P domain flanked by two hydrophobic regions representing the membrane spanning segments. The closest homologue of this gene product is the inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit, Kir1.2 (identity approximately 42%). Northern blot analysis of human tissues with a selective cDNA probe for this new K+ subunit showed a single major transcript of 3.4 kb predominantly expressed at high levels in small intestine, with lower levels in stomach, kidney and brain. The main regions of expression in the central nervous system were medulla, hippocampus and corpus callosum. cRNA-injected oocytes and transiently transfected HEK293 cells expressed a K+ conductance which displays an inward rectification. This conductance is blocked by cesium and barium but is insensitive to tolbutamide and diazoxide even upon co-transfection of this novel subunit with the plasmid encoding the sulfonylurea receptor SUR1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that we have isolated and characterized a novel K+ channel subunit belonging to the inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channel family to which, upon homology classification, we have given the nomenclature Kir7.1.",
