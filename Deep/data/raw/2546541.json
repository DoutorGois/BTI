     "AB": "As determined by the HPLC technique, injection of 1.85 mmoles/kg D-galactosamine caused strong alterations in the plasma level of cytidime. Thus, 2 h and 4 h after application of the amino sugar only 54% and 61%, respectively, of the normal values were measured, while an increase to 135% of controls was observed 24 h later. In contrast, intraperitoneal application of D-galactosamine had no influence on the plasma level of uridine. The activity of the enzyme, uridine kinase, in the hippocampal area of the rat brain was increased 2 h and 4 h after D-galactosamine treatment. The results are discussed in the light of behavioural findings in which intraperitoneally applied D-galactosamine at this dosage improves the retention performance of an acquired behaviour in the rat.",
