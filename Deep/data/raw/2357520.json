     "AB": "To determine whether the cytokine, interleukin-1 beta, is present in the rat brain as has been reported in human brain, immunocytochemical studies were performed using an antiserum that recognizes recombinant, rat IL-1 beta. Immunoreaction product was present in the periventricular and medial hypothalamus, mossy fiber distribution in the hippocampus and olfactory tubercle. These studies demonstrate that IL-1 beta is part of a diffuse intrinsic neural system in the rat central nervous system, associated with regions involved with hypophysiotropic, autonomic, limbic and extrapyramidal functions.",
