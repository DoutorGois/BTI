     "AB": "Cyclic GMP depresses Ba2+ current through high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (ICa) in acutely isolated hippocampal neurons. The effect is produced by intra-, but not extracellular, cGMP or by 5' GMP. The membrane-permeant derivative, 8-Br-cGMP, produces a reversible suppression. The effect of 8-Br-cGMP is similar to phorbol ester-induced ICa depression, except that ICa depression due to 8-Br-cGMP is not blocked by protein kinase inhibitors H-8 or H-7, whereas phorbol ester effects are. The data suggest that cGMP depresses ICa by a cGMP-kinase- and protein kinase C (PKC)-independent mechanism. Cyclic AMP, which enhances ICa, and the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX, both antagonize ICa depression induced by 8-Br-cGMP, but not that due to phorbol esters. Cyclic IMP, a more potent activator of phosphodiesterase than of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, is also a powerful depressant of ICa. We conclude that cGMP-induced depression of ICa is mediated by activation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase with consequent reduction of intracellular cAMP.",
