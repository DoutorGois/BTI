     "AB": "The effect of platelet-activating factor (PAF) on neurotransmitter release from rat brain slices prelabeled with [3H]acetylcholine ([3H]ACh), [3H]norepinephrine ([3H]NE), or [3H]serotonin ([3H]5-HT) was studied. PAF inhibited K+ depolarization-induced [3H]ACh release in slices of brain cortex and hippocampus by up to 59% at 10 nM but did not inhibit [3H]ACh release in striatal slices. PAF did not affect 5-HT or NE release from cortical brain slices. The inhibition of K(+)-evoked [3H]ACh release induced by PAF was prevented by pretreating tissues with several structurally different PAF receptor antagonists. The effect of PAF was reversible and was not affected by pretreating brain slices with tetrodotoxin. PAF-induced inhibition of [3H]ACh release was blocked 90 +/- 3 and 86 +/- 2% by pertussis toxin and by anti-G alpha i1/2 antiserum incorporated into cortical synaptosomes, respectively. The results suggest that PAF inhibits depolarization-induced ACh release in brain slices via a G alpha i1/2 protein-mediated action and that PAF may serve as a neuromodulator of brain cholinergic system.",
