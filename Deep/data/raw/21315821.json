     "AB": "Ionizing radiation results in damage to neural stem cells and reduced neurogenesis. The aim of the present study was to determine intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence neural stem cell survival following irradiation, using qPCR. Gene expression of hippocampal and SVZ neurospheres were analyzed following irradiation, and results demonstrated that irradiated hippocampal and SVZ stem cells displayed similar gene expression profiles for intrinsic genes. Irradiated microglia (extrinsic factor) isolated from the SVZ exhibited increased gene expression of growth factors involved in stem cell maintenance, proliferation, and survival. However, microglial genes in the irradiated hippocampus responded less favorably with respect to stem cell recovery. This might explain the superior recovery of SVZ compared to hippocampal stem cells following in vivo irradiation. In addition, our results show that a combination of growth factors, which were upregulated in SVZ microglia, increased the proliferation and decreased cell death of irradiated neurospheres in vitro.",
