     "AB": "Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine-disrupting chemical, is widely used in the manufacture of polycarbonated plastics and epoxy resins and line metal beverage cans. Growing evidence suggests that BPA acts directly on neuronal functions as it is lipophilic and could accumulate in the brain. The present study aims to investigate the effect of two doses of BPA (10 mg/kg for 6 and 10 weeks and 25 mg/kg for 6 weeks) on excitatory (glutamate and aspartate) and inhibitory (gamma-aminobutyric acid, glycine, and taurine) amino acid neurotransmitter levels in the cortex and hippocampus. This study extends to investigate the effect of BPA on acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity and some oxidative stress parameters in the two regions. In the cortex, a significant increase in the excitatory and a significant decrease in the inhibitory amino acids occurred after BPA (10 mg/kg for 10 weeks and 25 mg/kg for 6 weeks). This was accompanied by a significant increase in lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, and reduced glutathione after 6 weeks of BPA (25 mg/kg). In the hippocampus, a significant increase in the excitatory and inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters occurred after 6 weeks of BPA. Hippocampal lipid peroxidation increased significantly after BPA exposure and hippocampal reduced glutathione increased significantly after 6 weeks of BPA exposure (10 mg/kg). BPA induced a significant increase in cortical and hippocampal AchE activity. The present neurochemical changes in the cortex and hippocampus suggest that BPA induced a state of excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. This may raise concerns about the exposure of humans to BPA due to its wide applications in industry.",
