     "AB": "Norepinephrine (NE)-induced potentiation of the perforant path-evoked potential is blocked by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism in vitro. Does this occur in vivo? A saline and a ketamine micropipette monitored perforant path-evoked potentials in the dentate gyrus of urethane-anesthetized rats. Activation of locus coeruleus (LC) produced short- and long-term potentiation of the perforant path-evoked potential on both pipettes. Spike amplitude potentiation was enhanced on the ketamine pipette. In contrast high frequency-induced potentiation on the ketamine pipette was attenuated. LC-NE potentiation may not require NMDA channel activation in vivo.",
