     "AB": "Identified entorhino-hippocampal projection neurons were investigated for their ultrastructure. Spinous projection neurons (pyramidal and spiny stellate cells) display common features such as symmetric axosomatic terminals on their somata, asymmetric synapses on the spines, and both types of synapses on the dendritic shafts. Their axons descend towards the white matter, branching occasionally via collaterals which establish contact with local spines and rarely on dendritic shafts and somata. The sparsely spinous projection neurons (multipolar and horizontal-bipolar) typically show deep nuclear infolds and symmetric and asymmetric synapses on their somata and dendritic shafts. Axons also collateralize in the soma vicinity and form local synapses. It is concluded that the entorhino-hippocampal projection neurons (both spiny and sparsely spinous) act locally and distally thus performing simultaneously as local-circuit and as projection neurons. In accordance with other morphological and electrophysiological reports it appears likely that the generation, modulation, and suppression of entorhinal excitation waves is mediated by these neurons through direct excitation, feed-forward and feed-back inhibition, and disinhibition.",
