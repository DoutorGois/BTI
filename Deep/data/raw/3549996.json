     "AB": "Mouse brain contains at least 2 distinct spectrin subtypes: brain spectrin(240/235) and brain spectrin(240/235E) (Riederer et al., 1986). In this study, we demonstrate that these subtypes are differentially expressed during mouse brain development. Brain spectrin(240/235) can be detected in fetal tissue and increases 2-fold during brain development. This subtype is enriched in the cortical cytoplasm of germinative neural cells and is also found in fibers resembling axons as early as fetal life. Brain spectrin(240/235E), which is specifically detected with antibodies to red blood cell spectrin, is below the limits of detection in fetal and neonatal brain but rapidly increases in concentration during the second postnatal week. Brain spectrin(240/235E) is confined to the cell body and dendrites of differentiating neurons and to glial cells but is not expressed in mitotic cells. This subtype is most prominent in granule cells of the cerebellum and dentate gyrus in the hippocampus.",
