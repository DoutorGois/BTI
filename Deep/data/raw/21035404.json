     "AB": "In addition to the hippocampus, the entorhinal/perirhinal cortices are often involved in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). It has been proposed that these anterior parahippocampal structures play a key role in recognition memory. We studied the voxel-based PET correlation between number of correctly recognized targets in a new recognition memory paradigm and interictal cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, in 15 patients with TLE with hippocampal sclerosis. In comparison to healthy subjects, patients had decreased recognition of targets (P<0.001) and ipsilateral hypometabolism (relative to side of hippocampal sclerosis) of the hippocampus, entorhinal/perirhinal cortices, medial temporal pole, and middle temporal gyrus (P<0.05, corrected by false discovery rate method). Performance correlated with interictal metabolism of ipsilateral entorhinal/perirhinal cortices (P<0.005, Spearman's rank test), but this relationship was not significant in the hippocampus itself (P>0.18, Spearman's rank test). These findings highlight the preferential involvement of entorhinal/perirhinal cortices in recognition memory in patients with TLE, and suggest that recognition memory paradigms may be useful in assessing anterior parahippocampal functional status in TLE.",
