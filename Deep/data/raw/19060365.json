     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of polygonum multiflorum on the fluidity of mitochondria membrane and activity of cytochrome oxidase (COX) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model rats. METHODS: Forty-five SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: an AD model group, a control group, and a treatment group (n=15). AD model was established by injecting beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) 1-40 into the hippocampus of rats. The learning and memory abilities of rats were tested with the Y-electrical maze. The coefficient of viscosity of the hippocampal mitochondria membrane was determined by a spectrofluorometer, and the activity of COX was measured by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the learning and memory ability of the AD model group was significantly lower (P<0.01), while the coefficient of viscosity of the hippocampal mitochondria membrane of the AD model group rats was significantly higher (P<0.01), and COX activity was lower (P<0.01). Compared with the AD model group rats, the coefficient of viscosity of the hippocampal mitochondria membrane of the treatment group was significantly lower (P<0.05), and COX activity was significantly improved (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Polygonum multiflorum could improve the fluidity of mitochondria membrane and the activity of mitochondrial COX in the model of Alzheimer's disease.",
