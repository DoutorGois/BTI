     "AB": "Assessment was made of the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of ethylcholine mustard aziridinium (AF64A) and of the monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor L-deprenyl on the acetylcholine (ACh) biosynthetic enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), on the ACh catabolic enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and on the density of ACh muscarinic M-1 and M-2 receptor sites. In addition, the effect of AF64A and of L-deprenyl treatment on the localization of AChE activity in the CA-1 and CA-3 fields of the hippocampus was evaluated by combined enzyme histochemistry and microdensitometry techniques. I.c.v. injection of AF64A induced, 4 weeks after administration of the neurotoxin, a remarkable increase of MAO-B activity, and a significant reduction of ChAT and AChE activities in the hippocampus but not in the neostriatum which was used as a reference tissue. Hippocampal muscarinic M-1 receptors were unaffected by AF64A administration, whereas M-2 sites were reduced after neurotoxin injection. Enzyme histochemistry analysis showed that the loss of AChE induced by AF64A was more pronounced in the CA-3 than in the CA-1 field of the hippocampus. Treatment with L-deprenyl induced, from a dose of 11.17 microM/kg/day, a significant reduction of MAO-B activity in the hippocampus. The expression of ChAT and AChE, as well as the density of M-2 receptors, was increased after L-deprenyl administration in the hippocampus but not in the neostriatum. An increase in AChE reactivity was noticeable in the CA-1 and CA-3 fields of the hippocampus of AF64A-injected rats treated with L-deprenyl.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
