     "AB": "Acute injection of imipramine to NPK mice hereditary predisposed to pinching catalepsy reduced immobility in the forced swimming test, but had no effect on catalepsy. Chronic treatment with imipramine reduced the severity of catalepsy and functional activity of 5-HT1A serotonin receptors, but did not modify their expression in the hippocampus. NPK mice can be a convenient model for studies of the effects of antidepressant.",
