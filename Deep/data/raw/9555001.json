     "AB": "Hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP) is a novel undecapeptide purified from the hippocampus of young rats. The peptide stimulates cholinergic phenotype development in the rat medial septal nucleus in vitro. Here, we have focused on the mechanism of release of the peptide from the hippocampus, by applying tissue culture techniques. Quantitation of HCNP in the culture supernatant after chemical stimulation was carried out by RIA, and by a combination of HPLC and RIA. We found that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor specifically mediates release of the deacetylated form of HCNP from the culture. Our results suggest that during the early development of hippocampal neurons, the peptide is released by NMDA receptor activation, and that it may be involved in mediating the effect of activity-dependent cues on developing septal cholinergic neurons.",
