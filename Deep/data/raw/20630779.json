     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the localization and progressive changes of cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase (cPKA) in the mouse hippocampus at acute stages during and after pilocarpine induced status epilepticus. METHODS: Pilocarpine induced status epilepticus mice were sacrificed 30 min, 2 h or 1 day after the start of a approximately 7 h lasting status as assessed by video-electroencephalography. Brains were processed for quantitative immunohistochemistry of hippocampal cPKAbeta and cPKAgamma, and immunohistochemical co-localization of cPKAbeta and cPKAgamma with calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR), and parvalbumin (PV). RESULTS: Based on anatomical and morphological assessment, cPKAbeta was primarily expressed by principal cells and cPKAgamma by interneurons. In CA1, cPKAbeta co-localized with 76% of CB, 41% of CR, and 95% of PV-immunopositive cells, while cPKAgamma co-localized with 50% of CB, 29% of CR, and 80% of PV-immunopositive cells. Upon induction of status epilepticus, cPKAbeta expression was transiently reduced in CA1, whereas cPKAgamma expression was sustainably reduced. CONCLUSION: cPKA may play an important role in neuronal hyperexcitability, death and epileptogenesis during and after pilocarpine induced status epilepticus.",
