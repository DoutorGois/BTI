     "AB": "Bradykinin is considered an important mediator of the inflammatory response in both the peripheral and the central nervous system and it has attracted recent interest as a potential mediator of brain injury following stroke. Bradykinin is recognized to play an important role in ischemic brain. We investigated the effect of bradykinin postconditioning on ischemic damage after 8 min of ischemia (four-vessel occlusion) and 3 days of reperfusion. Bradykinin was administered after 2 days of reperfusion at a dose of 150 microg/kg (i.p.). Catalase (CAT) activity was significantly increased in all examined regions (cortex, hippocampus and striatum) 3 days after 8 min of ischemia, but postconditioning decreased this activity below the control values. The total activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) 3 days after ischemia was at control level with or without postconditioning. However, the analysis of individual SODs separately revealed interesting differences; while the activity of CuZnSOD was significantly decreased 3 days after ischemia, the activity of MnSOD was significantly increased compared to control levels. In both cases, postconditioning returned SOD activity to control levels. These findings are interesting because MnSOD is a mitochondrial enzyme and its activity in the cytosol suggests that a possible mechanism of protection provided by postconditioning could include prevention of release of mitochondrial proteins to the cytoplasm, resulting in protection against the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. 8 min of ischemia alone caused the degeneration of 52.37% neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region 3 days later. Bradykinin used as postconditioning 2 days after the same interval of ischemia enabled the survival of more than 97% of CA1 neurons. This study demonstrated that bradykinin postconditioning induces protection against ischemic brain injury and promotes neuronal survival.",
