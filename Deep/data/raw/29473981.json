     "AB": "Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by focal, recurrent spontaneous seizures, sclerosis and granule cell dispersion in the hippocampal formation. Changes in theta rhythm properties have been correlated with the severity of hippocampal restructuring and were suggested as a cause of memory deficits accompanying epilepsy. For severe sclerosis, it has even been questioned whether theta band oscillations persists. We asked how theta oscillations change with graded restructuring along the longitudinal hippocampal axis and whether these changes correlate with the overall severity of temporal lobe epilepsy. We recorded local field potentials in the medial entorhinal cortex and along the septo-temporal axis of the dentate gyrus at sites with different degrees of granule cell dispersion in freely behaving epileptic mice. Theta frequency was decreased at all recording positions throughout the dentate gyrus and in the medial entorhinal cortex, irrespective of the extent of granule cell dispersion or the rate of severe epileptic events. The frequency reduction by up to 1.7 Hz, corresponding to 1/3 octaves within the theta range, was present during rest, exploration and running. Despite the frequency reduction, theta oscillations remained coherent across the hippocampal formation and were modulated by running speed as in controls. The reduction in theta frequency thus is likely not a consequence of the local restructuring but rather a global phenomenon affecting the hippocampal formation as a whole.
