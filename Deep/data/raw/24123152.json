     "AB": "Striatal-enriched phosphatase 61 (STEP61 ) plays an essential role in synaptic plasticity and has recently been implicated in neurodegenerative disease. Here we characterized a possible role of STEP61 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology using a mouse model of AD (Tg-APPswe/PSEN1dE9, APP/PS1 mice) and an in vitro model of AD [cortical neurons treated with amyloid beta (Abeta)1-42 peptides]. Our data indicate age-related elevation of STEP61 levels and the proportion of dephosphorylated STEP61 (active STEP61 ) in wild-type mice, which was enhanced in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, the increased STEP61 levels and active STEP61 were observed in the hippocampus and cortex from 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice and in Abeta1-42 -treated cortical neurons. An alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) antagonist, alpha-bungarotoxin (BTX), inhibited the Abeta1-42 -induced increase of STEP61 expression and activation. In addition, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and cAMP response element binding (CREB) were impaired in Abeta1-42 -treated cortical neurons, and knockdown of STEP61 enhanced the activation of ERK1/2 and CREB. Collectively, these findings indicate two alternate pathological pathways effecting STEP61 regulation in AD. First, Abeta regulating STEP61 activity is mediated by Abeta binding to alpha7 nAChRs. Second, STEP61 negatively regulates Abeta-mediated ERK/CREB pathway, an important signaling cascade involved in memory formation.",
