     "AB": "Changes in the neuron metabolism in the hippocampal slices following stimulation and potentiation (induction of increase of the evoked extracellular potential) of Schaffer collaterals-pyramidal cell synapses were tested with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) technique. 2DG uptake was used as an index of glucose utilization. Stimulation evoked calcium- and frequency-dependent increase in [3H]2DG uptake. Potentiation of the synaptic response increased [3H]2DG accumulation but only when potentiated synapses were pressed to be active. It is suggested that stimulation-dependent increase in [3H]2DG uptake is mainly related to neurotransmission. Potentiation-dependent increase of [3H]2DG uptake is probably due to phosphorylation (inhibition) of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PHD). Inactivation of PDH may partially change the nerve endings metabolism from the aerobic pathway into anaerobic. To get the same amount of energy after potentiation as before, the nerve endings have to increase the rate of metabolism.",
