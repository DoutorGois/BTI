     "AB": "NMDA receptor dependent synaptic plasticity was examined in hippocampal slices using a novel pharmacological pairing procedure. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded from the CA1 area of slices maintained in a low Mg(2+) solution using a stimulus rate of 0.1-0.2 Hz. The NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (AP5) was initially included in the perfusion solution to establish baseline recording of isolated AMPA EPSPs. Washing out AP5 led to the expression of composite EPSPs, containing both AMPA and NMDA receptor mediated components. Following an initial, transient potentiation of the AMPA component, the composite responses gradually decayed for several hours, involving AMPA and NMDA components to a similar extent. This decay was input specific and could be terminated at any stage by reapplication of AP5. Subsequent long-term potentiation (LTP) reversed the effect to an extent inversely related to the degree of depression. Experiments to test the interaction with long-term depression (LTD) revealed a significant but incomplete overlap between the two depression processes. In conclusion, pairing synaptic activation at test stimulus frequency with pharmacological unblocking of NMDA receptors allows for expression of composite EPSPs that decay substantially, due to an active mechanism. The underlying process appears to be at least partly distinct from those involved in homosynaptic LTP and LTD.",
