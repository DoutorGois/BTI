     "AB": "The Naples high- (NHE) and low-excitability (NLE) are two rat lines, selectively bred for high and low activity levels in a Lat-maze, respectively. Because the activity level in a novel environment depends mainly on the integrity of the hippocampal formation, and NLE and NHE rats differ with a similar background of emotionality, arterial blood pressure, and learning ability, they have been proposed as animal model to study hippocampal functions. Our aim is to prove evidence in favor and against this hypothesis. The evidence in favor indicates that NLE/NHE rats have a defective spatial processing, and pertains to (a) Differential activity in a spatial novelty situation (selection trait), proportional to the stimulus complexity rats are exposed to (NHE are hyper- and NLE-rats hypoactive); and (b) Impaired working memory in a six-arm non-reinforced tunnel maze in both lines compared to random-bred rats, that was reversed by the introduction of a reinforcer. In addition, multiple evidence of (i) lower intra- + infrapyramidal mossy fiber terminals in both NLE/NHE vs. controls; (ii) increased sensitivity of hippocampal elements to microinjections of vasopressin (but not oxytocin) and of \"delta\" (but not \"mu\") opioids; (iii) lower number of high-affinity glucocorticoid receptors; (iv) lower number of alpha- but not beta-adrenergic receptors in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of NHE rats only; and (v) the genotype-dependent behavior of a DNA fraction with fast turnover, suggest that both NHE/NLE are \"disintegrated\" at the hippocampal interface. Further, neurobehavioral covariations among individual differences reveal nonlinear, complex relationships, an evidence apparently against the hypothesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
