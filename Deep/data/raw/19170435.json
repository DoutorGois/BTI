     "AB": "The hippocampus (HC) has been suggested to play a role in transitive inference (TI) on an ordered sequence of stimuli. However, it has remained unclear whether HC is involved in the expression of TI, or rather contributes to TI through its role in the acquisition of the sequence of elements (Frank, Rudy, & O'Reilly, 2003). Presently, the authors compared the effects of excitotoxic dorsal HC lesions in C57BL mice that received surgery before or after they were trained to discriminate between pairs of visual stimuli. Performance on a subsequent TI task was worse in mice with pretraining lesions than in those with posttraining lesions, which showed similar performance to shams without lesions. This indicates that HC is not involved in the expression of TI, but may merely help to acquire the underlying representations required for TI.",
