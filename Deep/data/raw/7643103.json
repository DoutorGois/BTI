     "AB": "The tissue content and the interstitial fluid levels of glutamate, aspartate, GABA, glutamine, glycine, and serine were studied in amygdaloid-kindled rat brain. Interstitial levels were studied in vivo before and during stage 5 full limbic seizures using microdialysis. Slices of amygdala from kindled and sham-operated animals were used to study baseline and KCl-evoked release in vitro. The contents of these amino acids were measured in slices of amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex from kindled and sham-operated animals. Kindled brains showed two- to threefold higher levels of glutamate, aspartate, and GABA and 12-fold higher levels of glutamine than sham-operated controls. Correlating with this, interstitial fluid levels of glutamate were two- to threefold higher from kindled amygdala than from control both in vivo (microdialysis) and in vitro (superfusion). GABA levels in interstitial fluid from kindled amygdala were reduced by 67% compared with control amygdala.",
