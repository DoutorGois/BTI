     "AB": "The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) participate in numerous signaling pathways and are abundantly expressed in the CNS. It has been proposed that ERK activation promotes survival in models of neuronal injury. Inhibition of MEK, the upstream kinase that activates ERK, however, leads to neuroprotection in models of cerebral ischemia and trauma, suggesting that in this context ERK activation contributes to cellular damage. The effect of ischemia and reperfusion on activity and expression of ERK was investigated using a reversible model of rabbit spinal cord ischemia. Active ERK was observed in nai;ve animals, which decreased during 15 to 60 min of ischemia. Upon reperfusion, a robust activation of ERK was observed in animals occluded for 60 min that remained permanently paraplegic. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed increased staining of phosphorylated ERK (pERK) in glial cells and faint nuclear staining in motor neurons of animals occluded for 60 min and reperfused for 18 h. In contrast ERK activity did not increase in animals occluded for 15 min that regained motor function. No evidence of increased pERK immunoreactivity in motor neurons or nuclear translocation was noted in these animals. ERK1 was demonstrated to be identical to a p46 c-Jun/ATF-2 kinase previously shown to be activated by reperfusion after a 60-min occlusion. The results suggest that activation of ERK during reperfusion of ischemic spinal cord participates in the cellular pathways leading to neuronal damage.",
