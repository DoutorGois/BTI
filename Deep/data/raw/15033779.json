     "AB": "We measured the effect of chronic ethanol administration on the expression of Glut3 in the cerebellum and hippocampus of adult and old rats. Glut3 expression significantly decreased in aging, in ethanol-treated rats vs. age-matched controls, and in adult- vs. old ethanol-treated rats. These findings lend consistent support to the hypothesis that disturbances of glucose metabolism due to ethanol may constitute an unfavorable condition predisposing to neuronal death.",
