     "AB": "While descriptions of the subiculum often emphasize its role as a recipient of hippocampal inputs, the area also has particular importance as a source of hippocampal projections. The extrinsic projections from the subiculum not only parallel those from hippocampal fields CA1-4 but also terminate in sites that do not receive direct inputs from the rest of the hippocampus. Both electrophysiological and lesion studies reveal how, despite its very dense CA1 inputs, the subiculum has functional properties seemingly independent from the rest of the hippocampus. In understanding the subiculum, it is necessary to appreciate that its connections are topographically organized along all three planes (longitudinal, transverse, and depth). These topographies may enable the subiculum to separate multiple information types and, hence, support multiple functions. The particular significance of the subiculum for learning and memory is underlined by its importance as a source of hippocampal projections to nuclei in the medial diencephalon, which are themselves vital for human memory and rodent spatial learning. Of particular note are its reciprocal connections with the anterior thalamic nuclei, which are not shared by the rest of the hippocampus (CA1-4). These thalamosubiculum connections may be of especial significance for resolving memory problems that suffer high interference and require the flexible use of stimulus representations.",
