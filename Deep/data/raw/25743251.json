     "AB": "Calcium ion accumulation into the cytosol of the hippocampus and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are main reasons in etiology of epilepsy. Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel is a cation-permeable calcium channel found in the DRG and hippocampus. Although previous studies implicate TRPV1 channels in the generation of epilepsy, suppression of ongoing seizures by TRPV1 antagonists has not yet been investigated. We tested the effects of TRPV1-specific antagonists, capsazepine (CPZ) and 5'-iodoresiniferatoxin (IRTX) on the modulation of calcium accumulation, apoptosis and anticonvulsant properties in the hippocampus and DRG of pentylentetrazol (PTZ) and capsaicin (CAP) administrated rats. Forty rats were divided into five groups as follows; control, PTZ, CAP+PTZ, IRTX, and IRTX+PTZ. Fura-2 and patch-clamp experiments were performed on neurons dissected from treated animals by CAP and CPZ. PTZ and CAP+PTZ administrations increased intracellular free Ca(2+) concentrations, TRPV1 current densities, apoptosis, caspase 3 and 9 values although the values were reduced by IRTX and CPZ treatments. Latency time was extended by application CPZ and IRTX although CAP produced acceleration of epileptic seizures. Taken together, these results support a role for TRPV1 channels in the inhibition of apoptosis, epileptic seizures and calcium accumulation, indicating that TRPV1 inhibition may possibly be a novel target in the DRG and hippocampus for prevention of epileptic seizures and peripheral pain.",
