     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Black ginseng has a more potent biological activity than non-steamed ginseng. We investigated the effects of long-term intake of dietary black ginseng extract (BG) on antioxidant activity in aged mice. We also compared the effects of BG on cognitive deficits with those of white ginseng extract (WG) and red ginseng extract (RG). METHODS: Ten-month-old mice were fed an AIN-93G-based diet containing 10 g/kg (low dose, L) or 30 g/kg (high dose, H) WG powder, RG powder, or BG powder for 24 wk. We measured serum lipids, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and malondialdehyde levels. Additionally, the protein expression levels of choline acetyltransferase and vesicular acetylcholine transporter, which are presynaptic cholinergic markers in the cortex and hippocampus of the brain, were measured by western blotting. RESULTS: Triglyceride levels were reduced in all the extract-treated mice, except those in the LBG group. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the HBG group were higher than those in the control group. Total cholesterol levels were reduced in the LBG group. Additionally, glucose levels in the HBG group were significantly reduced by 41.2%. There were lower levels of malondialdehyde in the LBG group than in the control group. Furthermore, glutathione reductase activity increased in the HWG group and the HRG group. The protein expression levels of choline acetyltransferase and vesicular acetylcholine transporter significantly increased in all the ginseng-treated groups. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that supplementation with the tested ginseng extracts may suppress the cognitive decline associated with aging, via regulation of the cholinergic and antioxidant defense systems.",
