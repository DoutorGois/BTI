     "AB": "Local perfusion of pGlu-Glu-Pro-NH2, an endogenous peptide structurally related to thyrotropine-releasing hormone (TRH), via in vivo microdialysis into the rat hippocampus did not change the basal level of extracellular acetylcholine. However, co-perfusion of pGlu-Glu-Pro-NH2 with TRH in equimolar concentrations yielded a significant attenuation of TRH-induced acetylcholine release. The results have supported the study's hypothesis that pGlu-Glu-Pro-NH2 opposes the cholinergic effect of TRH in the mammalian central nervous system. The enantiomer pGlu-d-Glu-Pro-NH2 affected neither basal extracellular nor TRH-induced increase of acetylcholine levels.",
