     "AB": "Excitatory synapses were studied in the hippocampal dentate gyrus ipsilateral to the stimulated entorhinal cortex in fully kindled rats 2 weeks after the last (3rd) stage 5 seizure. No change was observed in the absolute number of synaptic vesicles. On the other hand, marked redistribution of the vesicles in the synaptic apparatus was found, with a shift to a strategic position in the vicinity of the synaptic cleft. This redistribution evidently makes it possible to increase the supply of neurotransmitter needed for hyperfunction of the synaptic apparatus in kindling.",
