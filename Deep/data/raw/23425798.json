     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of chronic noise exposure on expression of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor 2B (NR2B) and tau phosphorylation in hippocampus of rats. METHODS: Twenty-four male SD rats were divided in control group and chronic noise exposure group. NR2B expression and tau phosphorylation in hippocampus of rats were detected after chronic noise exposure (100 dB SPL white noise, 4 h/dx30d) and their mechanisms underlying neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus of rats with TUNEL staining. RESULTS: The NR2B expression decreased significantly after chronic noise exposure which resulted in tau hyperphosphorylation and neural apoptosis in hippocampus of rats. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tau hyperphosphorylation was most prominent in dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 region of rat hippocampus. CONCLUSION: The abnormality of neurotransmitter system, especially Glu and NR2B containing NMDA receptor, and tau hyperphosphorylation in hippocampus of rats, may play a role in chronic noise-induced neural apoptosis and cognition impairment.",
