     "AB": "Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder with fairly high level of heritability. Dystrobrevin binding protein 1, a gene encoding dysbindin protein, is a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia that was identified by family-based association analysis. Recent studies revealed that dysbindin is involved in the exocytosis and/or formation of synaptic vesicles. However, the molecular function of dysbindin in synaptic transmission is largely unknown. To investigate the signaling pathway in which dysbindin is involved, we isolated dysbindin-interacting molecules from rat brain lysate by combining ammonium sulfate precipitation and dysbindin-affinity column chromatography, and identified dysbindin-interacting proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Proteins involved in protein localization process, including Munc18-1, were identified as dysbindin-interacting proteins. Munc18-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with dysbindin from rat brain lysate, and directly interacted with dysbindin in vitro. In primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons, a part of dysbindin was co-localized with Munc18-1 at pre-synaptic terminals. Our result suggests a role for dysbindin in synaptic vesicle exocytosis via interaction with Munc18-1.",
