     "AB": "This study was designed to determine the effect of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in hippocampal cholinergic system-mediated activation of the hypothalamo--pituitary--adrenocortical (HPA) axis in the rat. Neurons in the BNST were lesioned by bilateral injection of the cell-selective neurotoxin, ibotenic acid (1.5 microg/microl of solution per side). Two weeks later, neostigmine was microinjected into the rats' hippocampus. Rats in which ibotenic acid had been injected into the BNST showed attenuated expression of c-Fos in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and blunted elevation of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) after microinjection of neostigmine into the hippocampus compared with rats in which saline had been injected into the BNST. The results of this study indicate that the BNST relays signals of hippocampal cholinergic system-mediated activation of the HPA axis in rats.",
