     "AB": "The efficacy of aspirin and mefenamic acid to counteract soman-induced brain damage was investigated in mice. Neuronal damage was evaluated in the hippocampus and amygdala by performing omega3 receptor density measurements and hemalun-phloxin staining. The effect of both drugs on the proliferation of neural progenitors after soman exposure was also assessed. Mefenamic acid aggravated the soman-induced hippocampal neuropathology. On the other hand, aspirin recorded a weak neuroprotective effect in the amygdala. However, this drug also diminished the proliferation of neural precursor cells. The possible neurochemical mechanisms underlying such differences in the efficacy of the two drugs are also reviewed.",
