     "AB": "Serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptors (5HT3R) are Ca2+-permeant, non-selective cation channels that have been localized to presynaptic terminals and demonstrated to modulate neurotransmitter release. In the present study the effect of 5-HT on GABA release in the hippocampus was characterized using both electrophysiological and biochemical techniques. 5-HT elicited a burst-like, 6- to 10-fold increase in the frequency of GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) measured with whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices. When tetrodotoxin was used to block action potential propagation, the 5-HT-induced burst of IPSCs was still observed. Stimulation of hippocampal synaptosomes with 5-HT resulted in a significant increase in the amount of [3H]GABA released by hyperosmotic saline. In both preparations, the 5-HT effect was shown to be mediated by 5HT3Rs, as it was mimicked by the selective 5HT3R agonist m-chlorophenyl biguanide and blocked by the selective 5HT3R antagonist 3-tropanylindole-3-carboxylate hydrochloride. The 5HT3R-mediated increase in GABA release was blocked by 100 microM cadmium or by omitting Ca2+ in external solutions, indicating the Ca2+-dependence of the effect. The high voltage-activated Ca2+ channel blockers omega-conotoxin GVIA and omega-conotoxin MVIIC and 10 microM cadmium had no significant effect on the 5-HT3R-mediated enhancement of GABA release, indicating that Ca2+ influx through the 5-HT3R facilitates GABA release. Taken together, these data provide direct evidence that Ca2+ entry via presynaptic 5HT3Rs facilitates the release of GABA from hippocampal interneurons.",
