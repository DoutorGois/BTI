     "AB": "After studying the vascularization and the angioarchitecture of the pes hippocampi by means of selective arteriograms, the authors suggest a number of modifications to the classical concepts of arteriolar penetration into this area. Their most striking finding was the typical stratification of the paraventricular area as compared with the gyrus dentatus which is more monomorphically vascularized. The stratum granulosum appeared not to represent a vascular barrier between these two zones. The authors emphasize the remarkable correlation between the fibrillar and cytological construction of the various layers on one hand and their angioarchitectural characteristics on the other.",
