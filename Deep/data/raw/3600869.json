     "AB": "EEGs of motor and visual cortical zones, hippocampus, caudate nucleus and intralaminal-thalamic nuclei were recorded in two rat strains in \"awake-immobility\" state and subjected to visual and spectral analyses. KM rats genetically predisposed to audiogenic seizures were shown to differ from unpredisposed Wistar rats in weakening of the relative power of theta rhythm and intensification of the large-amplitude irregular activity in hippocampus and neocortex as well as in reinforcement of the generalized spindle activity. As a result of prolonged application of gradually increasing camphor doses seizure susceptibility reduction in KM rats correlated with EEG spectral density changing to Wistar rats EEG characteristics. The probable role of the brain stem reticular formation mechanisms in the enhanced convulsibility and accompanying EEG pattern are discussed.",
