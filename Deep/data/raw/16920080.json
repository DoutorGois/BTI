     "AB": "To identify whether altered expressions of voltage gated Ca(2+) channel (VGCC) are linked to inhibitory transmission abnormalities in the gerbil hippocampus, we investigated the effects of GABA receptor or somatostatin receptor (SST) antagonists/agonists on VGCC immunoreactivity in vivo. VGCC immunoreactivities in the hippocampus were significantly higher in seizure sensitive (SS) gerbils than in seizure resistant (SR) gerbils. P/Q-type VGCC immunoreactivity in the gerbil hippocampus was reduced by enhancement in GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor-mediated transmission, but not by SST-mediated transmission. N-type VGCC immunoreactivity was reduced only by a SST agonist, whereas L-type (alpha1C) VGCC immunoreactivity was reduced only by a GABA(A) receptor agonist, and L-type (alpha1D) VGCC immunoreactivity was modulated by the GABA(B) receptor acting drugs. These findings provide a comprehensive description of the differential responses of VGCC subunits to alteration in GABAergic or somatostatinergic transmission. These findings also suggest that up-regulated VGCC immunoreactivity may be consequence of the neuronal excitability caused by a reduction in inhibitory neurotransmission in the gerbil hippocampus.",
