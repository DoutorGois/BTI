     "AB": "Topographical disorientation is a frequent deficit among patients suffering from brain injury. Spatial navigation can be explored in this population using virtual reality environments, even in the presence of motor or sensory disorders. Furthermore, the positive or negative impact of specific stimuli can be investigated. We studied how auditory stimuli influence the performance of brain-injured patients in a navigational task, using the Virtual Action Planning-Supermarket (VAP-S) with the addition of contextual (\"sonar effect\" and \"name of product\") and non-contextual (\"periodic randomised noises\") auditory stimuli. The study included 22 patients with a first unilateral hemispheric brain lesion and 17 healthy age-matched control subjects. After a software familiarisation, all subjects were tested without auditory stimuli, with a sonar effect or periodic random sounds in a random order, and with the stimulus \"name of product\". Contextual auditory stimuli improved patient performance more than control group performance. Contextual stimuli benefited most patients with severe executive dysfunction or with severe unilateral neglect. These results indicate that contextual auditory stimuli are useful in the assessment of navigational abilities in brain-damaged patients and that they should be used in rehabilitation paradigms.",
