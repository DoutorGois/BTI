     "AB": "Psychological stress can upregulate basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) expression. Because glucocorticoids can also upregulate FGF-2 expression, the present studies investigated whether stress-induced glucocorticoids mediate the effects of stress on FGF-2. FGF-2 is regulated by an FGF-2 antisense (AS) molecular mechanism and so the present experiments also, for the first time, assessed the effects of stress on FGF-2-AS mRNA, as well as the mediating role of glucocorticoids. The effects of either escapable shock (ES) or yoked-inescapable tail shock (IS) on FGF-2 and FGF-2-AS were determined. To test whether glucocorticoids mediate the effect of stress on FGF-2 and FGF-2-AS, animals were pretreated with temporary corticosterone (CORT) synthesis inhibitors and exposed to IS. To test whether glucocorticoids are sufficient to modulate FGF-2 and FGF-2-AS mRNA, animals were injected with CORT and mRNA measured. ES and IS similarly downregulated FGF-2-AS mRNA at 0 h post-stress and upregulated FGF-2 mRNA 2 h post-stress. Inhibition of CORT synthesis abrogated the effect of IS on both FGF-2-AS and FGF-2 mRNA. Exogenous CORT mimicked the effects of ES and IS on FGF-2, but not FGF-2-AS mRNA. The present study demonstrates that glucocorticoids mediate the effects of stress on FGF-2 and FGF-2-AS.",
