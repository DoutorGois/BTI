     "AB": "In recent decades neuroscience research show the negative consequences of poverty in cognitive development. Environmental factors, such as material deprivation, exposure to stressful situations, violence, nutritional deprivation, environmental toxins may shape the developing brain. The changes of the structure and function of the brain since prenatal stages and their consequences can remain stable throughout the life cycle except early interventions are made. Research investigating have found significant link between child poverty and function and structural brain focusing on prefrontal cortex (i.e., executive functions), hippocampus (learning and memory), amygdala (i.e., fear and emotional processing) and Left Occipitotemporal and Perisylvian Regions (Language and Reading) In recent years, international studies show a growing population with intellectual disabilities in prisons. However, in criminal justice, people with mild intellectual disabilities suffer a normalization process. A lack of access to adequate diagnosis operate as an omission this vulnerable group, as a result the State deprive access to support systems guaranteed in international declarations of Human Rights. Furthermore neglect, discrimination, lack of access to comprehensive health and appropriate social interventions deepen in prison. It is for this reason that from a current human rights perspective a person with disability in jail becomes a doubly vulnerable subject.",
