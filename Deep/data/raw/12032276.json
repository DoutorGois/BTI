     "AB": "The effects of cerebral ischemia on white matter changes in ovine fetuses were examined after exposure to bilateral carotid artery occlusion. Fetal sheep were exposed to 30 min of ischemia followed by 48 (I/R-48, n = 8) or 72 (I/R-72, n = 10) h of reperfusion or control sham treatment (control, n = 4). Serial coronal sections stained with Luxol fast blue/hematoxylin and eosin were scored for white matter, cerebral cortical, and hippocampal lesions. All areas received graded pathologic scores of 0 to 5, reflecting the degree of injury where 0 = 0%, 1 = 1% to 25%, 2 = 26% to 50%, 3 = 51% to 75%, 4 = 76% to 95%, and 5 = 96% to 100% of the area damaged. Dual-label immunofluorescence using antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) were used to characterize white matter lesions. Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) was measured in the frontal cortex by ELISA. Results of the pathologic scores showed that the white matter of the I/R-72 (2.74 +/- 0.53, mean +/- SEM) was more (p < 0.05) damaged when compared with the control (0.80 +/- 0.33) group. Cortical lesions were greater (p < 0.05) in the I/R-48 (2.12 +/- 0.35) than the control (0.93 +/- 0.09) group. White matter lesions were characterized by reactive GFAP-positive astrocytes and a loss of MBP in oligodendrocytes. The ratio of MBP to GFAP decreased (p < 0.05) as a function of ischemia, indicative of a proportionally greater loss of MBP than GFAP. FGF-2 concentrations were higher (p < 0.05) in the I/R-72 than the control group and there was a direct correlation between the pathologic scores (PS) and FGF-2 concentrations (FGF-2 = e((1.6 PS-0.90)) + 743, n = 17, r = 0.73, p < 0.001). We conclude that carotid artery occlusion results in quantifiable white matter lesions that are associated with a loss of MBP from myelin, and that FGF-2, a purported mediator of recovery from brain injury in adult subjects, increases in concentration in proportion to the severity of brain damage in the fetus.",
