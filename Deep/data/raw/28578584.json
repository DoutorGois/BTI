     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by multiple histopathological changes in the brain and by impairments in memory and cognitive function. Currently, there is no effective treatment that can halt or reverse the progression of this disease. Here, we explored the effects of 3 months of treatment with selenium-enriched yeast (Se-yeast), which is commonly used as a source of organic selenium (Se) for nutrition, on cognitive dysfunction and neuropathology in the triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD mice). As the results revealed that Se-yeast significantly improved the spatial learning and memory retention of 3xTg-AD mice, promoted neuronal activity, attenuated the activation of astrocytes and microglia, mitigated synaptic deficits, and reduced the levels of total tau and phosphorylated tau though inhibiting the activity of GSK-3beta, dietary supplementation with Se-yeast exerted multiple beneficial effects on the prevention or treatment of AD. These findings provide evidence of a potentially viable compound for AD treatment.",
