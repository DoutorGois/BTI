     "AB": "We compared the effects of modulating the postsynaptic histamine receptor subtype 2 (H2) and inhibitory presynaptic autoreceptor subtype 3 (H3) on memory processing in the septum. Mice were partially trained on footshock avoidance in a T-maze. Immediately after training, saline or a drug solution was infused into the septum. One week later, retention was tested by continuing training until the mice made five avoidance responses in six consecutive trials. The results indicate that dimaprit, an H2 agonist, facilitated retention (25 and 50 pg) with a U-shaped dose-response curve typical of drugs acting at postsynaptic receptors. Cimetidine, an H2 antagonist, impaired retention (15-50 ng). The H3 agonist. imetit, impaired retention (25-200 ng), while the H3 antagonist, thioperamide, facilitated retention (10-400 ng). An unusual feature of the dose-response curve for thioperamide was that it did not appeal to yield a U-shaped curve as occurs with drugs acting postsynaptically, but facilitated retention to approximately the same degree from 50 to 400 ng. As histamine neurons project to various limbic system structures involved in memory processing, it may play an important role in regulating the activity of structures such as the septum, hippocampus and amygdala.",
