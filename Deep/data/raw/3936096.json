     "AB": "Awake Sprague-Dawley rats were depleted of brain serotonin (5HT) by intraventricular injections of 50 micrograms 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) through chronically implanted cannulae. Oral pretreatment with 25 mg/kg desmethylimipramine was used to protect brain noradrenergic neurons from 5,7-DHT. In a separate set of animals, liquid chromatographic assays revealed that this treatment did not significantly alter catecholamine levels but depleted hippocampal 5HT by 80-90% and caudate 5HT by 30-42% as early as 24 h after administration of 5,7-DHT. One or 3 days after lesioning, locomotor and exploratory behavior was characterized with a Behavioral Pattern Monitor (BPM). Relative to controls, lesioned rats exhibited a decreased rate of habituation of both locomotor activity and investigatory holepokes. Although the amount of locomotor activity elicited by amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg) was unchanged by the 5HT depletion, lesioned animals exhibited highly stereotyped patterns of locomotion during the last 30-min test session, in contrast to the relatively random patterns characteristic of control animals given amphetamine. These results show that central serotonergic pathways play an important role in modulating both spontaneous and amphetamine-elicited activity in rats.",
