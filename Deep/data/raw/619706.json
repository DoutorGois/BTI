     "AB": "Acetylcholine and choline concentrations in brain structures of rats during anesthesia with halothane (0.7-1.0 per cent inspired), enflurane (2.7-3.0 per cent, inspired) and ketamine (40 mg/kg, iv) were measured by gas chromatography. The turnover rate (biosynthesis) of acetylcholine in vivo was estimated by infusing phosphoryl(Me-14C)choline intravenously, determining specific activities of choline and acetylcholine, and applying principles of steady-state kinetics to compute the fractional rate constant of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine concentrations in brain structures did not change during anesthesia. Halothane decreased the acetylcholine turnover rates in all parts of the brain. Enflurane decreased the acetylcholine turnover rate in the cerebral cortex only, but not in the caudate nucleus, the hippocampus, and the hypothalamic and thalamic regions. During anesthesia with ketamine, acetylcholine turnover rates were reduced in the caudate nucleus and the hippocampus, but not in the cerebral cortex and the hypothalamic and thalamic regions. The results suggest that acetylcholine turnover rate and utilization are related to anesthetic induced electrophysiologic changes in cortical and subcortical structures.",
