     "AB": "We have shown that ecto-apyrase protein is expressed in primary neurons and astrocytes in cell culture (T.-F. Wang, P.A. Rosenberg, G. Guidotti, 1997. Mol. Brain Res. 1997, 47: 295-302). Here we present immunohistochemical studies showing that ecto-apyrase protein is widely distributed in rat brain, as it is present in neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum as well as in glial cells and endothelial cells. Ecto-apyrase is enriched in brain postsynaptic density membrane fractions and is localized in proximity to synaptophysin, the marker of synaptic vesicles. These results together with the observation that P2 purinergic receptors are present throughout the brain suggest that ecto-apyrase is involved in regulating synaptic transmission mediated by extracellular ATP.",
