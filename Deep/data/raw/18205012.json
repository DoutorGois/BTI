     "AB": "The human neonate is at a higher risk for hypoglycemia-induced neuronal injury than other pediatric and adult patients. Repetitive and profound neonatal hypoglycemia can result in severe neurologic sequelae, of which the mechanisms was not elucidated by hitherto. Moreover, no reliable animal model of brain injury induced by neonatal hypoglycemia is available in order to carry out more research. Therefore, we tried to induce neonatal hypoglycemia in newborn rats by fasting and insulin injection, and then examined the neuronal degeneration after repetitive hypoglycemic insults by Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) staining. Experimental animals were randomly divided into four groups: insulin-treated rats with short hypoglycemia, insulin-treated rats with prolonged hypoglycemia, fasted rats, and control rats. Insulin injection and fasting both could induce consistent hypoglycemia in newborn rats. But from FJB staining results, only in insulin-treated rats with prolonged hypoglycemia could extensive neurodegeneration be detected. We can conclude that FJB staining is a useful method of marking neuronal degeneration in neonatal rats following hypoglycemic brain damage. Repetitive and profound neonatal hypoglycemia can result in extensive neurodegeneration, and it seems that neurons of the cortex, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the thalamus, and the hypothalamus are more vulnerable to hypoglycemic insult in newborn rats. Repetitive and profound insulin-induced hypoglycemia in newborn rats can establish a reliable animal model of brain injury resulting from neonatal hypoglycemia.",
