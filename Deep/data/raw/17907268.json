     "AB": "Limited information is currently available on molecular events that underlie schizophrenia-like behaviors in animal models. Accordingly, we developed an organelle proteomic approach enabling the study of neurotransmission-related proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of postpubertal (postnatal day 60 (PD60)) neonatally ventral hippocampal (nVH) lesioned rats, an extensively used neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia-like behaviors. The PFC was chosen because of its purported role in the etiology of the disease. Statistical analysis of 392 reproducible spots on 2-D organelle proteomic patterns revealed significant changes in intensity of 18 proteinous spots in plasma membrane-enriched fractions obtained from postpubertal nVH lesioned rats compared to controls. Mass spectrometric analysis and database searching allowed the identification of a single protein in each of the nine differential spots, including proteins of low abundance, such as neurocalcin delta. Most of the identified dysregulated proteins, including clathrin light chain B, syntaxin binding protein 1b and visinin-like protein 1 are known to be linked to various neurotransmitter systems and to play key roles in plasma membrane receptor expression and recycling as well as synaptic vesicle exocytosis/recycling. Organelle proteomic approaches have hence proved to be most useful to identify key proteins linked to a given behavior in animal models of brain diseases.",
