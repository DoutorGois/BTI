     "AB": "This paper details the construction of an improved version of a direct-drive, nonrotating microdrive described previously. The improved version had virtually no electrical noise while being lowered, included a tension adjustment on the drive shaft and weighed only 4.5 g. The assembly allowed a workable electrode penetration distance of 16 mm. One complete rotation moved the electrode 400 microns.",
