High densities occurred in the substantia nigra pars compacta and cerebellum. Pineal and pituitary levels were moderate. In neocortex, binding was high in laminae II-IVA and much lower in the midzone. Moderate binding occurred over hippocampal dentate granular cells and in the striatum. These results differ from those reported for the rodent.",
