     "AB": "Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) can spontaneously differentiate into neurons and glial cells in the absence of mitogen fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) in medium and the spontaneous differentiation of NSCs is mediated partially by endogenous ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). This study examined the relationship of FGF-2 and CNTF in the spontaneous differentiation of adult hippocampal progenitor cells (AHPs). AHPs were cultured in the medium containing different concentration of FGF-2 (1-100 ng/mL). Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were applied to detect the expression of the astrocytic marker GFAP, the neuronal marker Tuj1, the oligodendrocytic marker CNPase and, Nestin, the marker of AHPs. The expression of endogenous CNTF in AHPs at early (passage 4) and late stage (passage 22) was also measured by Western blotting. The results showed that FGF-2 increased the expression of Nestin, dramatically inhibited the expression of GFAP and Tuj1 and slightly suppressed the expression of CNPase. FGF-2 down-regulated the expression of endogenous CNTF in AHPs at both early (passage 4) and late stage (passage 22). These results suggested that FGF-2 could inhibit the spontaneous differentiation of cultured AHPs by negatively regulating the expression of endogenous CNTF in AHPs.",
