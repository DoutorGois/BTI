     "AB": "The release of acetylcholine (ACh), glutamate (GLU) and dopamine (DA) from various brain regions was investigated in young (3 month) and old (30 month) Balb/c mice. Aging increased the basal release of GLU (77%) and DA (29%) in striatum and GLU in hippocampus (94%); the concentrations of these neurotransmitters in the media after K+ stimulation were unaltered by aging. Although the basal release of ACh was not altered by age, K+-stimulated ACh release was reduced in striatum. The age-related increases in basal GLU and DA release may be important in the pathophysiology of cell death during aging.",
