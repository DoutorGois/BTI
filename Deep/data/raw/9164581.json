     "AB": "We examined spatial learning in the Morris water maze after daily acute bilateral micro-injection of 13.9 ng sodium acetate (NaAc) or 37.9 ng lead acetate (PbAc) in 1 microliter volumes into the dorsal hippocampus of normal adult rats. After six days of injections and water maze training, rats injected with NaAc were able to find a hidden platform in 8.3 s, and those injected with PbAc were significantly slower (15.2 s; p < 0.02). In a second experiment, rats were trained to find a hidden platform before injections began and then tested in order to determine if intrahippocampal injections of Pb affected the recall of a previously learned task. The escape latency on the first day after injections began was increased slightly when compared to the last day of training before injections, however the NaAc and PbAc groups were not significantly different over three days of injections. Both treatment groups performed as well as they did before injections began by the second day of injections. These results suggest that the direct injection of Pb into the hippocampus impairs the acquisition but not the recall of the spatial learning task in the Morris water maze.",
