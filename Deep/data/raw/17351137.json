     "AB": "We explored the circumstances in which rats engage either declarative memory (and the hippocampus) or habit memory (and the dorsal striatum). Rats with damage to the hippocampus or dorsal striatum were given three different two-choice discrimination tasks (odor, object, and pattern). These tasks differed in the number of trials required for learning (approximately 10, 60, and 220 trials). Dorsal striatum lesions impaired discrimination performance to a greater extent than hippocampal lesions. Strikingly, performance on the task learned most rapidly (the odor discrimination) was severely impaired by dorsal striatum lesions and entirely spared by hippocampal lesions. These findings suggest that discrimination learning in the rat is primarily supported by the dorsal striatum (and habit memory) and that rats engage a habit-based memory system even for a task that takes only a few trials to acquire. Considered together with related studies of humans and nonhuman primates, the findings suggest that different species will approach the same task in different ways.",
