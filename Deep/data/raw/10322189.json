     "AB": "Recent studies indicate that synapse addition and/or loss is associated with different types of learning. Other factors influencing synaptogenesis and synapse loss include neurotrophins, hormones, and the induction of long-term potentiation. An emerging view of synaptic plasticity suggests that local neurotrophin action and synaptically associated protein synthesis may promote synaptic remodelling and changes in receptor expression or activation.",
