     "AB": "Stress causes changes in neurotransmission in the brain, thereby influencing stress-induced behaviors. However, it is unclear how neurotransmission systems orchestrate stress responses at the molecular and cellular levels. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a non-selective cation channel involved mainly in pain sensation, affects mood and neuroplasticity in the brain, where its role is poorly understood. Here, we show that Trpv1-deficient (Trpv1(-/-)) mice are more stress resilient than control mice after chronic unpredictable stress. We also found that glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC) 2 expression and activity are reduced in the Trpv1(-/-) mice and that HDAC2-regulated, cell-cycle- and neuroplasticity-related molecules are altered. Hippocampal knockdown of TRPV1 had similar effects, and its behavioral effects were blocked by HDAC2 overexpression. Collectively, our findings indicate that HDAC2 is a molecular link between TRPV1 activity and stress responses.",
