     "AB": "This paper aimed to investigate the antidepressant-like effects and the mechanism of the albiflorin, paeoniflorin on rats with chronic restraint stress model. Fluoxetine and Xiaoyao group served as the positive control, body weight, sucrose preference test and the open field behavioral experiment were measured, the levels of nitric oxide (NO) in hippocampus were detected by Greg colorimetric method. Furthermore, the levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampus were detected by ELISA. Finally, the expressions of nNOS mRNA in hippocampus detected by RT-qPCR, the protein levels of nNOS and BDNF in hippocampus were detected by Western blot. Compared with the model group,the pass counts of paeoniflorin group(30 mg*kg(-)(1)) and albiflorin group(30 mg*kg(-)(1)) were obviously increased(P<0.05,P<0.01). Furthermore, compared with the model group,the levels of NO in paeoniflorin groups(30 mg*kg(-)(1) and 15 mg*kg(-)(1)) and albiflorin groups(30 mg*kg(-)(1) and 15 mg*kg(-)(1)) were all significantly decreased(P<0.05,P<0.01; P<0.05, P<0.05). BDNF levels of paeoniflorin group(30 mg*kg(-)(1)) and albiflorin group(30 mg*kg(-)(1)) were obviously increased(P<0.05). Finally, compared with the model group, the expressions of nNOS mRNA of paeoniflorin groups(30 mg*kg(-)(1) and 15 mg*kg(-)(1)) (P<0.01, P<0.01) and albiflorin groups(30 mg*kg(-)(1)) were significantly decreased(P<0.05). Compared with the model group, the protein exprsssions of BDNF of paeoniflorin group(30 mg*kg(-)(1)) and albiflorin group(30 mg*kg(-)(1)) were obviously increased(P<0.05). Albiflorin and paeoniflorin have the effects of smooth the liver and dispel stagnation, the mechanism has the relevant with adjusting and controlling the expression of NO and BDNF in hippocampus.",
