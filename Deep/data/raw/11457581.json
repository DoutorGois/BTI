     "AB": "Cation-chloride cotransporters have been considered to play pivotal roles in controlling intracellular and extracellular ionic environments of neurons and hence controlling neuronal function. We investigated the total distributions of K-Cl cotransporter 1 (KCC1), KCC2 (KCC2), and Na-K-2Cl cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) messenger RNAs in the adult rat nervous system using in situ hybridization histochemistry. KCC2 messenger RNA was abundantly expressed in most neurons throughout the nervous system. However, we could not detect KCC2 messenger RNA expression in the dorsal root ganglion and mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, where primary sensory neurons show depolarizing responses to GABA, suggesting that the absence of KCC2 is necessary for this phenomenon. Furthermore, KCC2 messenger RNA was also not detected in the dorsolateral part of the paraventricular nucleus, dorsomedial part of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and ventromedial part of the supraoptic nucleus where vasopressin neurons exist, and in the reticular thalamic nucleus. As vasopressin neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and neurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus produce their intrinsic rhythmicity, the lack of KCC2 messenger RNA expression in these regions might be involved in the genesis of rhythmicity through the control of intracellular chloride concentration. The expression levels of KCC1 and NKCC1 messenger RNAs were relatively low, however, positive neurons were observed in several regions, including the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and in the granular layer of the cerebellum. In addition, positive signals were seen in the non-neuronal cells, such as choroid plexus epithelial cells, glial cells, and ependymal cells, suggesting that KCC1 and NKCC1 messenger RNAs were widely expressed in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the nervous system. These results clearly indicate a wide area- and cell-specific variation of cation chloride cotransporters, emphasizing the central role of anionic homeostasis in neuronal function and communication.",
