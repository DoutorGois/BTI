     "AB": "Both a 5-hydroxytryptamine2A (5-HT2A) agonist and immobilization stress previously have been shown to differentially alter brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression in the neocortex and hippocampus. Both 5-HT2A receptor activation and immobilization stress also increase glutamate release in the rat prefrontal cortex. Given that the metabotropic glutamate2/3 receptor (mGluR2/3) agonist (1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-aminobicyclo[3.1.0] hexane-2,6-dicarboxylate monohydrate (LY354740) suppressed electrophysiological, behavioral and biochemical effects of 5-HT2A receptor activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), we assessed the efficacy of the mGluR2/3 agonist in suppressing the stress-induced increase in BDNF mRNA expression. LY35740 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the immobilization stress-induced increase in BDNF mRNA expression in the rat mPFC. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that mGlu2/3 agonists may be an efficacious treatment for stress-induced neuropsychiatric syndromes.",
