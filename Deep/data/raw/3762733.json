     "AB": "Slices of rabbit hippocampus were preincubated with 3H-noradrenaline (3H-NA), then superfused continuously in the presence of the noradrenaline (NA) uptake inhibitor (+)oxaprotilin and twice stimulated electrically. The stimulation induced tritium overflow was increased by the 5-HT receptor agonists, 5-HT, 2-methyl-5-HT and 5-carboxamidotryptamine in a concentration dependent manner; a tyramine-like displacement of NA by the 5-HT agonists was prevented by (+)oxaprotilin. The 5-HT M-receptor antagonists, MDL 72222 and ICS 205-930, inhibited the facilitatory effects of 5-HT agonists as well as the enhanced tritium overflow due to the selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor, 6-nitroquipazine: in each case, concentrations much higher than those required to block M-receptors of the periphery were necessary. At high concentrations MDL 72222, in contrast to ICS 205-930, seems to have alpha-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity. The 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin, had no effect on 5-HT-induced facilitation of transmitter release; metitepin facilitated stimulation-evoked transmitter release per se both in the absence and presence of phentolamine. From our results we conclude that, as on peripheral nerve endings, also on central noradrenergic terminals, facilitatory 5-HT receptors are present that modulate NA release. The enhanced tritium overflow following 6-nitroquipazine may be due to an increased release of endogenous 5-HT, a suggestion which supports the hypothesis of a physiological innervation of these facilitatory 5-HT receptors on NA terminals.",
