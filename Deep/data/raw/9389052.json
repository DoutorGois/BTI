     "AB": "We detected the level of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the serum of experimental epilepsy rats using simplified MBP ELISA, and the myelin sheaths of their brain with MBP immuno-histochemistry (IHC) and transmitted electronmicroscopy (TEM) in order to explore the relation of brain myelin sheaths and MBP to the pathogenic mechanism of epileptic seizure. The results show that the serum MBP level in the experimental epilepsy group is significantly higher than that in the control groups (P < 0.05), and is similar to that in some patients with generalized myoclonic seizures reported by us previously. The IHC and TEM findings in the brain of epilepsy rats indicate that the lamelliform structure of myelin sheaths in some part of hippocampus region becomes relaxing, disorderly and homogenized. Our studies imply that epileptic seizures are associated with MBP release from the subtle damaged regions of myelin sheaths during epileptic seizures, and the change of MBP component in myelin sheath may play and important role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy.",
