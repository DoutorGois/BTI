     "AB": "The integrins are transmembrane receptors for ECM proteins, and they regulate various cellular functions in the central nervous system. In hippocampal neurons, the beta3 integrin subtype is required for homeostatic synaptic scaling of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) induced by chronic activity deprivation. The surface level of beta3 integrin in postsynaptic neurons directly correlates with synaptic strength and the abundance of synaptic GluA2 AMPAR subunit. Although these observations suggest a functional link between beta3 integrin and AMPAR, little is known about the mechanistic basis for the connection. Here we investigate the nature of beta3 integrin and AMPAR interaction underlying the beta3 integrin-dependent control of synaptic AMPAR expression and thus synaptic strength. We show that beta3 integrin and GluA2 subunit form a complex in mouse brain that involves the direct binding between their cytoplasmic domains. In contrast, beta3 integrin associates with GluA1 AMPAR subunit only weakly, and, in a heterologous expression system, the interaction requires the coexpression of GluA2. Surprisingly, in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, expressing beta3 integrin mutants with either increased or decreased affinity for extracellular ligands has no differential effects in elevating excitatory synaptic currents and surface GluA2 levels compared with WT beta3 integrin. Our findings identify an integrin family member, beta3, as a direct interactor of an AMPAR subunit and provide molecular insights into how this cell-adhesion protein regulates the composition of cell-surface AMPARs.",
