     "AB": "Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) is a mammalian homologue of yeast vacuolar protein sorting (Vps) protein Vps27p; however, the role of Hrs in lysosomal trafficking is unclear. Here, we report that Hrs interacts with sorting nexin 1 (SNX1), a recently identified mammalian homologue of yeast Vps5p that recognizes the lysosomal targeting code of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and participates in lysosomal trafficking of the receptor. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that Hrs and SNX1 are ubiquitous proteins that exist in both cytosolic and membrane-associated pools, and that the association of Hrs and SNX occurs on cellular membranes but not in the cytosol. Furthermore, endogenous SNX1 and Hrs form a approximately 550-kDa complex that excludes EGFR. Immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies show that Hrs and SNX1 colocalize on early endosomes. By using deletion analysis, we have mapped the binding domains of Hrs and SNX1 that mediate their association. Overexpression of Hrs or its SNX1-binding domain inhibits ligand-induced degradation of EGFR, but does not affect either constitutive or ligand-induced receptor-mediated endocytosis. These results suggest that Hrs may regulate lysosomal trafficking through its interaction with SNX1.",
