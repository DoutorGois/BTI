     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The study characterized the status of retrograde amnesia (RA) in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHOD: We measured RA, anterograde amnesia (AA), brain measures, apolipoprotein-E status (ApoE), and conversion to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) across 3 years in 15 individuals with MCI. We compared the severity of amnesia and brain atrophy in MCI to a group of patients with limited damage to the hippocampus (H) or more extensive damage to the medial temporal lobe (MTL). RESULTS: The MCI group exhibited modest AA, together with severe RA, covering nearly 4 decades before their diagnosis. Compared with H-MTL patients, the temporal extent of RA was disproportionate to the severity of AA. The MCI group exhibited more modest AA and MTL atrophy than H-MTL patients, together with more severe RA and neocortical atrophy than H-MTL patients. The severity of AA corresponded to the integrity of MTL structures, whereas the severity of RA corresponded to the integrity of both MTL and neocortical structures. RA (but not AA, nor measures of cognitive status) was related to ApoE status and subsequent diagnosis of probable AD. RA was predicted by heritable risk for AD, in addition to the integrity of MTL and neocortical structures. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with H-MTL patients, the MCI group exhibited RA that was disproportionate to their AA and that was more severe than would be expected if their atrophy were limited primarily to the MTL. Heritable risk for AD, as well as the integrity of brain regions within and beyond the MTL, are important for understanding RA in MCI.",
