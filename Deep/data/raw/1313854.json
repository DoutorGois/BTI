     "AB": "We have investigated regional and temporal alterations in Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) and calcineurin (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase) after transient forebrain ischemia. Immunoreactivity and enzyme activity of CaM kinase II decreased in regions CA1 and CA3, and in the dentate gyrus, of the hippocampus early (6-12 h) after ischemia, but the decrease in immunoreactivity gradually recovered over time, except in the CA1 region. Furthermore, the increase in Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity was detected up to 3 days after ischemia in all regions tested, suggesting that the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ increased. In contrast to CaM kinase II, as immunohistochemistry and regional immunoblot analysis revealed, calcineurin was preserved in the CA1 region until 1.5 days and then lost with the increase in morphological degeneration of neurons. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the findings of the immunohistochemistry. These results suggest that there is a difference between CaM kinase II and calcineurin in regional and temporal loss after ischemia and that imbalance of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation may occur.",
