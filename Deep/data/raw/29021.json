     "AB": "The pattern and some substrates characteristic of the rat brain 5'-nucleotidase were studied using the isoelectric focusing technique, which revealed that the enzyme is present in a single form in hippocampus extracts. An alkaline phosphatase, which is also able to split nucleoside monophosphates, is not active at neutral pH values. The isoelectric points were found to be 6.4 +/- 0.1 for the specific 5'-nucleotidase and 6.8 +/- 0.1 for the phosphatase.",
