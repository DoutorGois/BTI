     "AB": "Previous electrophysiological studies suggested that GABAA receptors in rat hippocampal neurons might be less sensitive to ethanol than mouse neurons. Therefore, we examined the effects of ethanol (0.5-850 mM) in cultured mouse (C57BL/6) and rat (Sprague-Dawley) neurons. In 35% of the mouse neurons, the Cl- current was potentiated by ethanol starting at 0.5 mM. In all of the rat neurons examined, on the other hand, the current was potentiated by concentrations starting at 200 mM. We also studied the effects of GABA and other GABAergic ligands. GABAA receptors in rat and mouse neurons displayed EC50s for GABA of 9 +/- 0.3 and 17 +/- 0.8 microM, respectively and ethanol did not significantly change these values. The EC50 for diazepam was 92 +/- 3 and 120 +/- 8 nM in rat and mouse, respectively. Pentobarbital enhanced the current with EC50s of 84 +/- 3 and 106 +/- 6 microM in rat and mouse, respectively. The sensitivity for Cl-218,872, which binds preferentially to the Type I benzodiazepine receptor, was similar in all the neurons. RO 15-4513, an inverse partial agonist to the benzodiazepine receptor, was not effective in reversing the potentiation of the Cl- current in rat neurons and only slightly reduced the potentiation in mouse neurons. The receptors in rat neurons were more sensitive to external Zn2+; the current was inhibited by 50% with a concentration of 93 +/- 3 and 244 +/- 9 microM in rat and mouse, respectively. Analysis of mRNA encoding for the gamma 2L receptor subunit showed similar levels in rat and mouse neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
