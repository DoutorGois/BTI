     "AB": "Although the phospholipase C (PLC)beta-1 isoform is associated with spontaneous seizure and distinctively expressed in the telencephalon, the distribution of PLCbeta-1 expression in the epileptic gerbil hippocampus remains controversial. Therefore, we determined whether PLCbeta-1 is associated with spontaneous seizure in an animal model of genetic epilepsy. In the present study, PLCbeta-1 immunoreactivity was down-regulated in seizure-sensitive (SS) gerbils more than in seizure-resistant (SR) gerbils. The expression of PLCbeta-1 within calretinin (CR)- positive neurons was rarely detected within the dentate hilar region of SS gerbils. PLCbeta-1 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was significantly elevated as compared to that in pre-seizure SS gerbil 3 h post-ictal. These findings suggest that alterations in PLCbeta-1 immunoreactivity in the SS gerbil hippocampus may be closely related to the epileptic state of the gerbil brain and transiently elevated PLCbeta-1 protein levels following seizure episodes. Such alterations may be compensatory responses in the SS gerbil hippocampus.",
