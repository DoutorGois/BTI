     "AB": "This report analyzes long term potentiation (LTP) and associative interactions between synapses of the ipsilateral and crossed entorhinal cortical (EC) pathways to the dentate gyrus (DG). In the anesthetized rat, conditioning stimulation to one EC-DG pathway reliably elicits LTP at the ipsilateral synapses, while the synapses of the collateral, crossed pathway to the contralateral DG do not exhibit LTP. Furthermore, in the DG ipsilateral to the conditioning stimulation the convergent crossed pathway from the contralateral side, which had not been itself conditioned, failed to exhibit heterosynaptic LTP. These results are consistent with a specific 'synaptic' localization of the changes responsible for LTP, and suggest that some critical number of synapses must be activated in order to observe LTP. While the crossed EC-DG projection never exhibited LTP when conditioned alone, the crossed input could be potentiated under certain circumstances. Specifically, paired conditioning of ipsi- and contralateral inputs by nearly simultaneous conditioning stimulation of the EC bilaterally results in LTP in the crossed system. Furthermore, this associatively induced LTP of the crossed system can be reversed by subsequent conditioning of the ipsilateral system alone. Successive potentiating and depotentiating sequences are possible using paired and non-paired stimulation procedures even after lesions which prevent neural loops through the EC. The results are interpreted as evidence for a 'Hebb' type synapse which has the capability for erasure. This synaptic type is not appropriate for classical conditioning without appendant circuitry, but is suited for other forms of associative learning.",
