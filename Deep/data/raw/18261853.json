     "AB": "Sox11 is a transcription factor that is proposed to be involved in the development and regeneration of the brain [M.P. Jankowski, P.K. Cornuet, S. Mcllwrath, H.R. Koerber, K.M. Albers, SRY-box containing gene 11 (Sox11) transcription factor is required for neuron survive and neurite growth, Neuroscience 143 (2006) 501-514]. In this study, we compared the expression patterns of Sox11 and its two putative binding partners, Brn1 and Brn2 during development and following transient forebrain ischemia in the rat. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of Brn1 was similar to that of Sox11 from the late embryonic to postnatal development, and they are strongly expressed in the brain regions where neuronal progenitors and immature neurons are enriched. On the other hand, Brn2 was ubiquitously expressed in most tissues including developing nervous system. Neuronal depolarization of cerebral cortex neurons in vitro enhanced both Sox11 and Brn1 expression, whereas the induction of Brn2 was only marginal, further suggesting the similar transcriptional modulation of Sox11 and Brn1. In the hippocampus, however, they showed a little different expression patterns. The expression of Brn1 was not substantial in developing dentate gyrus (DG) where Sox11 expression was strong. The transient forebrain ischemia enhanced Sox11 gene expression moderately in the CA1 and strongly in the DG, whereas Brn1 was selectively induced only in the CA1 of the hippocampal formation. Collectively, overall results suggest that the expression of Sox11 and Brn1 may be modulated by the cell-type specific machinery.",
