     "AB": "Several lines of evidence show that cAMP-PKA signaling pathway plays critical role in memory functions and suggest nitric oxide as an important modulator in learning and memory. In this study, we assessed the effects of intra-hippocampal infusion of H-89, a selective PKAII inhibitor, and 1400 W, a selective inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, on spatial memory in rats. By using the Morris water maze, spatial memory retention parameters were examined 48 h after the infusions through measuring escape latency, traveled distance, and swimming speed. The rats receiving intra-hippocampal infusions of 1400 W (100 microM/side) showed a significant reduction (*P<0.05) in escape latency and traveled distance in comparison with the control saline group. In contrast, a significant increase (**P<0.01) in escape latency and traveled distance was observed after infusion of 10 microM H-89. Moreover, among combination groups, co-administration of 1400 W (400 microM/side) with 10 microM/side of H-89 caused a significant reduction (*P<0.05) in escape latency and traveled distance in comparison with the H-89 group. Also, we evaluated the molecular effects of 1400 W on the expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a cholinergic marker, in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and medial septal area (MSA). Immunohistochemical analysis of post-training bilateral intra-hippocampal infusion of 1400 W revealed a significant increase in ChAT immunoreactivity levels in both the CA1 and the MSA regions. Overall, the results suggest that 1400 W has protective effect against H89-induced spatial memory impairment. Moreover, the observed memory improvements caused by 1400 W infusions, might be due to interaction of iNOS with the cholinergic system.",
