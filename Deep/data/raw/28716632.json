     "AB": "Depression is a disease of an abnormal brain energy metabolism also marked with increased apoptosis in specific brain regions. Mounting evidence indicates that the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis are novel targets for the actions of estrogen receptors (ERs). In this study, we examined the effects of antidepressant (AD) fluoxetine (FLU) treatment on the mitochondrial ER alpha (ERalpha), ER beta (total and phospho-pERbeta) and their association with cytochrome c (cyt c) oxidase activity and apoptotic Bcl2/Bax-molecules in the hippocampal mitochondria of chronically isolated (CPSI) female and male rats depicting depression. Impaired behaviour induced by CPSI was followed by decreased corticosterone (CORT) in both sexes and downregulation of cyt c oxidase in males. CPSI did not affect the ERalpha in either of sexes, but it decreased mitochondrial ERbeta and increased pERbeta in both sexes. Stress-reduced ERbeta is associated with a decrease in mitochondrial energetic processes in males and with apoptotic mechanisms in females. FLU normalized behaviour in both sexes and increased cyt c oxidase in females. FLU elevated ERalpha in males, increased ERbeta and decreased pERbeta in both sexes. The AD-induced alterations of ERbeta paralleled with bioenergetics and pro-survival pathways in females. In conclusion, sex-unspecific regulation of ERbeta by the stress and by AD and its differential convergence with bioenergetics and apoptotic pathways in females and males implies its role as a vulnerability factor in the stress response and emphasizes mitochondrial ERbeta-dependent pathways as an important gateway of ADs action, at least in females.",
