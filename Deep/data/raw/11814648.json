     "AB": "Presenilin-1 (PS1) is intimately involved in cleavage of amyloid precursor protein to form beta-amyloid peptides, certain forms of which aggregate in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The function(s) of PS1 and its precise involvement in the development of cognitive deficits associated with AD are unclear. We have utilised genetically modified mice that under-express PS1 (PS1(+/-) mice) to investigate the role of PS1 in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Field excitatory postsynaptic responses elicited by baseline stimulation were indistinguishable between PS1(+/-) mice and wild-type controls. Likewise, a measure of short-term plasticity, paired-pulse facilitation, was normal in PS1(+/-) mice. However, long-term potentiation induced by multiple tetanus trains was reduced in PS1(+/-) animals. These results demonstrate that chronic reduction of PS1 activity leads to impaired synaptic plasticity, thus suggesting a role for PS1 in normal cognitive function.",
