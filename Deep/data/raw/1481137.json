     "AB": "The action of serotonin (5-HT) on GABAergic synaptic transmission was investigated with intracellular recordings in CA3 pyramidal cells of rat hippocampal slices. Local application of 5-HT (500 microM) hyperpolarized CA3 pyramidal cells, decreased cellular input resistance, and reduced slow afterhyperpolarizations. Serotonin attenuated the late (GABAB) component of polysynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs; 47% of control) without affecting the early (GABAA) component. During bath application of the excitatory amino acid antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) (20 microM) and 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (AP-5) (40 microM), 5-HT similarly decreased the amplitude of the late (GABAB) component (17% of control) of monosynaptic IPSPs but did not affect the early (GABAA) component. The mean reversal potentials of poly- and monosynaptic IPSPs were unaffected by 5-HT. The conductance increases associated with the late component of poly- and monosynaptic IPSPs were reduced by 5-HT. Hyperpolarizing responses evoked in CA3 pyramidal cells by somatic applications of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were unaffected by 5-HT. During bath application of bicuculline (20-50 microM), hyperpolarizing responses elicited by dendritic GABA application were reduced by 5-HT (71% of control). The effect of 5-HT on these direct GABAB hyperpolarizations (29% decrease in response) does not appear sufficient to fully account for the effect of 5-HT on late GABAB IPSPs (53-83% decrease in response). Therefore, 5-HT may reduce GABAB IPSPs in CA3 pyramidal cells 1) by a postsynaptic action on pyramidal cells and 2) by a selective presynaptic action on GABAergic interneurons mediating the GABAB IPSP. This presynaptic action of 5-HT does not appear to involve excitatory afferents onto inhibitory interneurons.",
