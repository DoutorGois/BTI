     "AB": "Studies suggest that microRNA (miR)34c may serve a role in cognitive function in rodent and primate groups. A previous study demonstrated an increase in miR34c expression in chronic epileptic rats with memory disorders, induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). However, the mechanism underlying the effects of miR34c on cognitive function in epileptic rats remains unclear. Therefore, the present study investigated alterations in cognitive function in temporal lobe epileptic rats, induced by repeated injections of PTZ, following treatment with an miR34c agomir compared with a scramble group. Increased expression of miR34c was observed in the agomir group, in addition to an increased deficit in learning and memory function in the Morris water maze test. Glutamate receptor ionotropic NmethylDaspartate (NMDA) 2B (NR2B), phosphorylated (p)reduced nicotinamideadenine dinucleotide phosphatedependent diflavin oxidoreductase 1 (NR1) and pglutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) protein expression was detected in the hippocampus using western blotting. Additionally, the downregulation of NR2B, pNR1 and pGluR1 in the miR34c agomir group demonstrated that miR34c may serve a negative role in cognitive function in epileptic seizures, by dysregulating NMDA and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5methyl4isoxazolepropionic acid receptors, which are associated with longterm potentiation.",
