     "AB": "Broadband white noise exposure (100 dB) in wistar strain male albino rats significantly increased the levels of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and 5-HT turnover in many of the discrete brain regions (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus, hippocampus, pons-medulla and corpus striatum) during sub-chronic noise exposure (4 h daily for 15 days). In acute (4 h for 1 day) and chronic noise exposures (4 h daily for 30 days) the levels were significantly altered only in certain regions. The turnover study of serotonin clearly indicates that neurotransmitter level alone cannot be an indicator, as in some brain regions the rate of synthesis matched with the degradation in order to maintain the normal levels. The intraperitoneal administration of 70% ethanolic extract of Ocimum sanctum(OS) at the dosage of 100 mg/kg body weight to animals subjected to noise exposure has prevented the noise induced increase in neurotransmitter levels without affecting the normal levels. This indicates that OS can be a probable herbal remedy for noise induced biogenic amine alterations.",
