Besides clinical use, they also contribute to neuroscience and to testing efficacy as surrogate measures in clinical trial. This paper, focusing on two different models beyond the therapeutic nihilism, discusses the roles of neuroimaging in relation to treatment of dementias; 1) treatable \"incurable dementia\" - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 2) untreated \"curable dementia\" - idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH).",
