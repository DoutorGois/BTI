     "AB": "An invariable interest in mechanisms of synaptic plasticity gave birth to several specific methods of evoked postsynaptic responses analysis: quantal analysis, component analysis, nonstationary fluctuation analysis (NSFA) etc. The major part of these methods are not standardized yet however, that can lead to obtaining different (and even contradictory) results in similar experiments performed by different scientific groups. This paper issues the experiments for revealing pre- or postsynaptic location of the synaptic plasticity mechanisms during the early phases of the long-term potentiation (LTP). On a model we analyse how an estimation of the single-channel current made by the NSFA is influenced by changes in the evoked postsynaptic currents shape variability. A hypothesis is made that the apparent increase in the AMPA-receptor single-channel current, reported in some works for early LTP stages, could be concerned with the increase in the postsynaptic response shape variability rather then with real increase in AMPA-receptor channels conductivity. The shape of the postsynaptic responses can become more variable after LTP-associated unsilencing of the previously silent synapses. A new method of independent component analysis (ICA) is introduced to check this hypothesis first on model and than on physiological data. The results of the experiments in general agree with the hypothesis suggested.",
