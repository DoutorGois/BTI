     "AB": "Studies on brain mitochondria are complicated by the regional, cellular, and subcellular heterogeneity of the central nervous system. This study was performed using synaptic and nonsynaptic mitochondria obtained from cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of male Sprague-Dawley rats (3 months old). Ubiquinone content, detected by HPLC analysis, was about 1.5 nmol/mg protein with an approximate CoQ9/CoQ10 molecular ratio of 2:1. The activities of several respiratory chain complexes were also studied (succinate-cyt. c reductase, NADH-cyt. c reductase, succinate-DCIP, ubiquinol2-cyt. c reductase, and cytochrome oxidase), and generally found to be higher in mitochondria from cortex than from other regions. Study of the activities of some of these enzymes vs. 1/T (Arrhenius plots) showed a straight line with an activation energy between 7 and 10 kcal/mol in all the three areas considered. Only CoQ2H2-cyt. c reductase activity revealed a biphasic temperature dependence. Also anisotropy (as fluorescence polarization) of the hydrophobic probe DPH showed a deviation from linearity; the break points for both enzymatic activity and anisotropy were found at about 23-24 degrees C.",
