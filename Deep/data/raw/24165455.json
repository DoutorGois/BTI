     "AB": "Activity-dependent dendritic development represents a crucial step in brain development, but its underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Here we report that glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) regulates dendritic development in an activity-dependent manner. We find that GSK3beta in somatodendritic compartments of hippocampal neurons becomes highly phosphorylated at serine-9 upon synaptogenesis. This phosphorylation-dependent GSK3beta inhibition is mediated by neurotrophin signalling and is required for dendritic growth and arbourization. Elevation of GSK3beta activity leads to marked shrinkage of dendrites, whereas its inhibition enhances dendritic growth. We further show that these effects are mediated by GSK3beta regulation of surface GABAA receptor levels via the scaffold protein gephyrin. GSK3beta activation leads to gephyrin phosphorylation to reduce surface GABAA receptor clusters, resulting in neuronal hyperexcitability that causes dendrite shrinkage. These findings thus identify GSK3beta as a key player in activity-dependent regulation of dendritic development by targeting the excitatory-inhibitory balance of the neuron.",
