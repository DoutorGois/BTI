     "AB": "The present investigation envisages the toxic effects of aluminium on the cholinergic system of male albino rat brain. Aluminium toxicity (LD(50)/24 h) evaluated as per Probit method was found to be 700 mg/kg body weight. One-fifth of lethal dose was taken as the sublethal dose. For acute dose studies, rats were given a single lethal dose of aluminium acetate orally for one day only and for chronic dose studies, the rats were administered with sublethal dose of aluminium acetate once in a day for 25 days continuously. The two constituents of the cholinergic system viz. acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase were determined in selected regions of rat brain such as cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and pons-medulla at selected time intervals/days under acute and chronic treatment with aluminium. The results revealed that while acetylcholinesterase activity was inhibited, acetylcholine level was elevated differentially in all the above mentioned areas of brain under aluminium toxicity, exhibiting area-specific response. All these changes in the cholinergic system were subsequently manifested in the behavior of rat exhibiting the symptoms such as adipsia, aphagia, hypokinesia, fatigue, seizures, etc. Restoration of the cholinergic system and overt behavior of rat to the near normal levels under chronic treatment indicated the onset of either detoxification mechanisms or development of tolerance to aluminium toxicity in the animal which was not probably so efficient under acute treatment.",
