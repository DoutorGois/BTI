     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To establish an animal model resembling human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE); observe the dynamic changes of mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) and neuron loss in the hippocampus; and investigate the expression changes of Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Synapsin I in the hippocampus in immature rats. METHODS: MTLE models of immature rats were induced by lithium-pilocarpine. The surviving animals were continually monitored for 8 weeks. Nissl staining was used to observe the neuron loss and Timm staining was performed to evaluate MFS. Western blot (WB) and immunohistochemical methods were performed to detect the expression of GFAP and Synapsin I. RESULTS: Status epilepticus (SE) was successfully induced in 94.1% of the rats with a high mortality of 68.8%; 75% of the survived rats were observed for spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) which resembles the features of human MTLE. Expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and Synapsin I fluctuated in correspondence with the different stages of MTLE development. CONCLUSION: We established an animal model depicting the human MTLE by using immature rats. GFAP and Synapsin I expressions are involved in MTLE development. Neuron loss and mossy fiber sprouting may have a role in epileptogenesis.",
