     "AB": "Models of cerebral ischaemia were used for analysis of mechanism of neuronal cell death and/or damage. Ischaemia is caused dominantly by severe hypoxia and hypoglycaemia: in the present study, we examined the influence of severe in vivo hypoxia (5% O2/95% N2 for 30 min at 22 degrees C). After hypoxia, neuronal damage was observed in the CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) after 3 and 21 days of survival, but not in the CA1.2,3-Dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX), an antagonist for AMPA/kainate receptors, showed neuroprotective effects in the CA3 and DG. These results suggest that hypoxia may induce neuronal damage in the CA3 and DG through activation of AMPA/kainate receptors.",
