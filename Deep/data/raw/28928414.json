     "AB": "Histone Deacetylase 11 (HDAC11) is highly expressed in the central nervous system where it has been reported to have roles in neural differentiation. In contrast with previous studies showing nuclear and cytoplasmic localisation, we observed synaptic enrichment of HDAC11. Knockout mouse models for HDACs 1-9 have been important for guiding the development of isoform specific HDAC inhibitors as effective therapeutics. Given the close relationship between HDAC11 and neural cells in vitro, we examined neural tissue in a previously uncharacterised Hdac11 knockout mouse (Hdac11 (KO/KO)). Loss of HDAC11 had no obvious impact on brain morphology and neural stem/precursor cells isolated from Hdac11 (KO/KO) mice had comparable proliferation and differentiation characteristics. However, in differentiating neural cells we observed decreased expression of schizophrenia-associated gene Fez1 (fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1), a gene previously reported to be regulated by HDAC11 activity. FEZ1 has been associated with the dendritic growth of neurons and risk of schizophrenia via its interaction with DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1). Examination of cortical, cerebellar and hippocampal tissue reveal decreased Fez1 expression specifically in the hippocampus of adult mice. The results of this study demonstrate that loss of HDAC11 has age dependent and brain-region specific consequences.",
