     "AB": "Development of recurrent inhibition in area CA1 of the rat hippocampus was monitored by a paired-pulse stimulation test. Inhibition of the second response was never observed before postnatal day six. In addition, a type of epileptiform activity, referred to as spontaneous unison firing, was observed frequently, only on postnatal days 4 and 5. Together these observations suggest that the inhibitory interneuronal network of area CA1 becomes effective on about postnatal day 6.",
