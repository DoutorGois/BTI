     "AB": "Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. We have examined the potential role of some chemokine/chemokine receptors in this process. It is known that CXCR2 is a strongly expressed chemokine receptor on neurons and is strongly upregulated in AD in a subpopulation of neuritic plaques. Here, we show that one of the CXCR2 ligand GROalpha/KC can be a potent trigger for the ERK1/2 and PI-3 kinase pathways, as well as tau hyperphosphorylation in the mouse primary cortical neurons. GROalpha immunoreactivity can be detected in a subpopulation of neurons in normal and AD. Therefore, the CXCR2-ligand pair may have a potent pathophysiological role in neurodegenerative diseases.",
