     "AB": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) functions at the center of cellular stress and sways the immune system at several key points, thus modulates inflammatory diseases. The antiinflammatory properties of PARP-1 inhibitors have been demonstrated ameliorating effect in various neuroinflammatory disorders. It has been reported that there is a close relationship between the inflammatory processes and major depressive disorder. In the present study, we have elucidated the role of oxidative-nitrosative stress-PARP-1 pathway in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neurobehavioral and neurochemical alterations in mice. 3-Aminobenzamide (10 and 30mg/kg) and imipramine (10 and 30mg/kg) were administered once daily for 14days. Mice were challenged with LPS (1mg/kg, i.p.) 30min after drug administration on the 14th day. The mRNA expression level of PARP-1 (12h after LPS injection) in the hippocampus was measured through quantitative real-time PCR. All the behavioral and biochemical parameters were assessed at 24h after LPS injection. The expression level of PARP-1mRNA was found significantly up-regulated in the hippocampus at 12h after LPS administration. Results showed that the LPS-challenged mice exhibited an increase in immobility time seen in forced swimming test and tail suspension test. LPS increased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and oxido-nitrosative stress parameters in the hippocampus. However, pretreatment with 3-aminobenzamide (30mg/kg) significantly reversed the LPS-induced alterations in behavioral parameters, proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative-nitrosative stress and PARP-1 mRNA levels. Imipramine failed to prevent the up-regulation of PARP-1 induced by LPS administration. Our results emphasized that oxidative-nitrosative stress-PARP-1 cascade can play a key role in LPS-induced neurobehavioral and neurochemical anomalies.",
