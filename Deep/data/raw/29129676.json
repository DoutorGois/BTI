     "AB": "Aerobic exercise is known to increase expression of neurotrophins, particularly brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in the hippocampus and to improve cognitive function. Exercise exerts neuroprotective effects in the hippocampus by inducing epigenetic changes, which play crucial roles in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, the activity levels of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate histone acetylation and modulate gene transcription. The objective of the present study was to assess the interactive effects of exercise and aging on cognitive function, expression of neurotrophins (BDNF and neurotrophin-4) and their receptors (tyrosine receptor kinase B and p75), and epigenetic regulations, including the activity of HATs and HADCs in the hippocampus. We used the senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM) model, specifically 13-month-old SAM resistant 1(SAMR1) and SAM prone 1 (SAMP1) lines. Mice were distributed into four groups based on accelerated senescence and exercise status. Mice in the exercise groups exercised on a treadmill for approximately 60min a day, 5days a week. Aerobic exercise for 4 weeks improved cognitive function, accompanied by an increase in BDNF expression and a decrease in p75 transcription in both SAMR1 and SAMP1. In addition, the exercise regimen activated both HAT and HDAC in the hippocampus. Therefore, the present study reveals that despite accelerated senescence, long-term exercise improved cognitive function, upregulated the expression of BDNF, and downregulated p75, a receptor involved in apoptotic signaling. Furthermore, long-term exercise enhanced activity of both HAT and HDAC, which may contribute to the transcriptional regulation underlying the improvement of cognitive function.",
