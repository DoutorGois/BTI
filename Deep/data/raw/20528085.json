     "AB": "Extensive research with laboratory animals indicates that the hippocampus is crucial for the formation and use of spatial memory. Hippocampal lesions in rodents impair spatial memory on radial arm maze tasks. It is unknown whether amnesic patients with hippocampal damage would exhibit similar impairments on a virtual version of a radial arm maze. To evaluate the importance of the hippocampus in spatial learning and memory, we tested amnesic participants with hippocampal damage in a virtual radial arm maze environment. The virtual radial arm maze required participants to learn and remember 4 rewarded arms of 8 total arms. Spatial learning and memory were assessed using the participants' ability to use salient distal cues in the virtual room to remember the 4 rewarded arms. Amnesic participants' latencies were longer and distance traveled was greater to the rewarded arms compared with nonamnesic participants. Amnesic participants made more errors than nonamnesic participants by either entering nonrewarded arms or by revisiting previously entered arms. These data are analogous to previous animal research. Overall, the human hippocampus is necessary for spatial memory and navigation in a virtual radial arm maze task.",
