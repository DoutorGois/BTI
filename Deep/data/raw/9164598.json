     "AB": "Mice treated neonatally with monosodium glutamate (MSG) were found to have learning and memory deficits in performing a non-spatial water escape task. Scopolamine impaired the water-escape performance of the control mice but not that of the MSG-treated mice. It was suggested that the water-escape performance deficit in the MSG-treated mice was a result of impaired central cholinergic mechanisms. As such, scopolamine was unable to further incapacitate an already impaired cholinergic system. This is strongly supported by the decreased affinity of the sodium-dependent high-affinity choline uptake observed in the hippocampus. D-Cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, did not affect the water-escape performance of the MSG-treated and control mice; nor did it alter the effects of scopolamine. This lack of effect of D-Cycloserine may imply that the NMDA receptors are not involved in non-spatial learning, in contrast to their reported involvement in spatial learning.",
