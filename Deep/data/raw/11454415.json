     "AB": "We studied the spectrins in developing hippocampal tissue in vivo and in vitro to learn how they contribute to the organization of synaptic and extrasynaptic regions of the neuronal plasma membrane. beta-Spectrin, but not beta-fodrin or alpha-fodrin, increased substantially during postnatal development in the hippocampus, where it was localized in neurons but not in astrocytes. Immunoprecipitations from neonatal and adult hippocampal extracts suggest that while both beta-spectrin and beta-fodrin form heteromers with alpha-fodrin, oligomers containing all three subunits are also present. At the subcellular level, beta-fodrin and alpha-fodrin were present in the cell bodies, dendrites, and axons of pyramidal-like neurons in culture, as well as in astrocytes. beta-Spectrin, by contrast, was absent from axons but present in cell bodies and dendrites, where it was organized in a loose, membrane-associated meshwork that lacked alpha-fodrin. A similar meshwork was also apparent in pyramidal neurons in vivo. At some dendritic spines, alpha-fodrin was present in the necks but not in the heads, whereas beta-spectrin was present at significant levels in the spine heads. The presence of significant amounts of beta-spectrin without an accompanying alpha-fodrin subunit was confirmed by immunoprecipitations from extracts of adult hippocampus. Our results suggest that the spectrins in hippocampal neurons can assemble to form different membrane-associated structures in distinct membrane domains, including those at synapses.",
