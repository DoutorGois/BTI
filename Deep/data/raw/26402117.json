     "AB": "For Braak staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the assessment of only hippocampal section has been proposed. In two published modifications, the emphasis is on the pathology in Ammon's horn. We investigated this approach in a cohort including 150 cases. A Braak stage was possible to assign in a subset of the cases, and the agreement rates varied from 60% to 36% . Thus, to reliably stage the AD-related neurodegeneration, regions such as the entorhinal, transentorhinal, temporo-occipital, and occipital cortices should be assessed as has also been recommended in 2012 by the National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer's Association guidelines.",
