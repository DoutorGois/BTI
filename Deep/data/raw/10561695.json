     "AB": "Death-associated protein kinase (DAP-kinase) is Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase that contains ankyrin repeats and the death domain. It has been isolated as a positive mediator of interferon-gamma-induced apoptotic cell death of HeLa cells. In order to reveal the physiological role of DAP-kinase, the tissue distribution and developmental changes in mRNA expression of DAP-kinase were investigated by Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses. DAP-kinase mRNA was predominantly expressed in brain and lung. In brain, DAP-kinase mRNA had already appeared at embryonic day 13 (E13) and was, thereafter, detected throughout the entire embryonic period. High levels of expression were detected in proliferative and postmitotic regions within cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar Purkinje cells. These findings suggest that DAP-kinase may play an important role in neurogenesis where a physiological type of cell death takes place. The overall expression of DAP-kinase mRNA in the brain gradually declined at postnatal stages, and the expression became restricted to hippocampus, in which different expression patterns were observed among rostral, central, and caudal coronal sections, suggesting that DAP-kinase may be implicated in some neuronal functions. Furthermore, it was found that the expression of DAP-kinase mRNA was increased prior to a certain cell death induced by transient forebrain ischemia, indicating a possible relationship between DAP-kinase and neuronal cell death.",
