     "AB": "The potential heterogeneity in the allosteric coupling between GABA and omega 1 binding sites within the native GABAA receptor complex has been evaluated in the rat by measuring the enhancement by GABA of [3H]zolpidem binding to omega 1 site in membranes from three rat brain structures (neocortex, cerebellum and hippocampus) and brain sections. The maximal stimulatory effect of GABA was significantly higher (265 +/- 47%) in cortical membranes than in cerebellar (165 +/- 48%) or in hippocampal (118 +/- 17%) membranes. These differences are not due either to the presence of different amounts of residual GABA in the membrane preparations or to the labeling, in presence of GABA, of binding sites other than omega 1 since: (1) the pharmacological properties of the [3H]zolpidem binding sites were similar in the three regions; (2) the degree of allosteric enhancement was unrelated to the relative proportion of omega 1 sites in each structure; and (3) GABA did not increase the Bmax for [3H]zolpidem. Regional differences in the effect of 100 microM GABA on [3H]zolpidem binding were also observed by quantitative autoradiography. Regions where the strongest (3-4-fold) effects of GABA in [3H]zolpidem binding were observed included the substantia nigra, lateral geniculate body, olfactory tubercule and red nucleus. A large increase in [3H]zolpidem binding was also demonstrated in the cingulate and frontoparietal cortices with higher effects in deep (4.2-fold) rather than in superficial layers (3.3-fold). Heterogeneous subregional increases in [3H]zolpidem binding in the presence of GABA were quantified within the cerebellum, hippocampus and superior colliculus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
