     "AB": "Three experiments examined the role of the dorsal hippocampus (dHIPP) in occasion setting with diffuse contextual and discrete light stimuli serving as occasion setters in classical fear conditioning with rats. Both sham-operated and dHIPP-lesioned animals readily learned a L-->T+, T- serial feature-positive discrimination in which a light (L) \"set the occasion\" for reinforcement of a tone (T+). dHIPP-lesioned animals were deficient, however, in acquiring a similar discrimination in which different contexts (A and B) served as occasion setters, i.e., A(T+) and B(T-). The lesioned animals also failed to discriminate between a context in which a tone had been partially reinforced and a context in which no conditioning had taken place, whereas sham-operated animals froze more to the tone in the conditioned context than in the novel context. Collectively, the data indicate that the dorsal hippocampus is important in processing information about the signaling value of contextual, but not discrete, stimuli.",
