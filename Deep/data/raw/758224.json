     "AB": "The rapid metabolism of [1-14C]butyrate and [2-14C]pyruvate in the brain was studied after intracarotid injection in control rats and rats given an end-to-side portocaval anastomosis (PCA). At 10 or 50 sec after injection there was a 40-50% lowering of the total amount of radioactivity in the brain of operated rats for both compounds. The percentage distribution of label in various metabolic fractions, e.g. amino acids, was unaltered by PCA. The results from the metabolic studies focused on an impaired transport of short chain monocarboxylic acids between blood and brain in rats with a PCA. The brain uptake index (BUI) of acetate, butyrate, pyruvate and glucose was determined by rapid intracarotid injection of the 14C test compound plus 3H2O as a reference marker. At 3 weeks after PCA, transport of all 3 monocarboxylic acids into brain was reduced by 40-50%. The reduction in [2-14C]pyruvate uptake was absent at one week, but thereafter, up to 50 weeks after operation, was consistently present. Eadie-Hofstee analysis of influx at varying substrate concentrations indicated a reduction in Vmax values of pyruvate and butyrate uptake without changes in Km. The calculated influx rate of glucose in operated rats was reduced in direct proportion to the lowering of plasma glucose. Portocaval anastomosis in the rat induces selective changes on substrates that are transported across the blood-brain barrier via a facilitated transport process.",
