     "AB": "Through statistical tests 3 groups of impulsive-aggressive patients were studied: group 1, 100 individuals with temporal dysrhythmia; group 2, 18 individuals with temporal dysrhythmia submitted either to group analytical therapy or to psychoanalysis; group 3, 25 impulsive-aggressive individuals. Moreover the author differentiates between the amygdaloid nucleus and dehumanization syndromes, through psychoanalytical or psychiatric studies, and stresses the importance of the molding periods in relation to social factors (frustration-aggression-injustice). Amygdalotomy of the hippocampus was suggested in special cases.",
