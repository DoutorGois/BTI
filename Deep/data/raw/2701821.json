     "AB": "The process of spreading of epileptic discharges in central nervous system has to be discussed in two points of view; as a propagation of signals in neuronal networks and as a process of dynamics changes in neuronal circuits and nets. On the base of the spreading of afterdischarges between entorhinal cortex and both hippocampi we discussed time and space relations in spreading of epileptic discharges, and automatic analytical methods in localization of epileptic focus. Spreading epileptic discharge is not only the symptom of pathologic function of system but it simultaneously changes the dynamics of system in which it spreads and causes epileptic destabilization of neuronal circuits and nets. The above mechanisms after theoretical investigations play also important role in evaluation of secondary epileptic foci and posttraumatic epilepsy.",
