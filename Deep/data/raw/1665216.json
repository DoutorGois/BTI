     "AB": "The distribution and the properties of the melatonin binding sites were characterized in the brain of the rabbit by combined use of autoradiography and in vitro ligand-receptor binding. Autoradiography revealed widespread specific binding in the brain. The pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland, suprachiasmatic nuclei, ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, tapetum, hippocampus, indusium griseum, cingulate gyrus, cortex and the choroid plexus were intensely labelled. Diffuse specific binding was recorded in the olfactory bulb and the anterior hypothalamus. Series of in vitro ligand-receptor binding experiments, using the anterior hypothalamus, confirmed that the binding was of high affinity and specificity. Coincubation with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue provoked a shift in the binding affinity, the numerical values of the Kd increasing from 20-30 pM to 280-300 pM. Apparently the melatonin receptor in the rabbit brain is linked to its second messenger via a G protein, similarly to what has been described for the brain of other vertebrates.",
