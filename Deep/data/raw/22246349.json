     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the axonal sprouting of somatostatin(SS) positive interneurons in temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: 6-8 week-old healthy male SD rats were divided randomly into an epileptic group (treated by lithium and pilocarpine intraperitoneal injection) and a control group (by lithium and normal sodium intraperitoneal injection). Each group was randomly divided into 5 subgroups at 1,7,15,30, amd 60 d after the injection. Immunohistochemistry method was used to detect the number changes of SS or neuronal nuclei (NeuN) positive neurons in different domains of the hippocampus at different time points in each group, and the coexpression of SS positive interneurons combined with NeuN was detected by double immunofluorescence to observe the dynamic changes and axonal sprouting of SS positive interneurons. RESULTS: The number of SS neurons in the experimental group exceeded that in the control group in the CA1 area at 60 d post-status epileptieus SE (P<0.01), and numerous SS positive fibers were seen throughout the layers of the CAl area at 60 d post-SE. NeuN positive neurons in the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum layers in the initiation site of the CA1 area were beyond normal at 60 d post-SE. The number of double labeled SS interneurons gradually rose at 15 d in stratum oriens of CA1, and even exceeded that of the controls in the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum layers of CA1 at 60 d. CONCLUSION: The numerous SS positive fibers throughout the layers of the CAl area at 60 d post-SE come from the increased interneurons in the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum layers of CA1 area. The pathological axonal sprouting may play an important role in the generation and compensation of temporal lobe epilepsy.",
