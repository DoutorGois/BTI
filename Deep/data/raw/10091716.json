     "AB": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 5-, 15-, and 60-min enflurane anesthesia on the levels of Met-enkephalin, Leu-enkephalin and neuropeptide Y in discrete areas of the rabbit brain. We also evaluated the effect of enflurane anesthesia on energetic, transport and catabolic processes by measuring the activities of succinate dehydrogenase, magnesium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase and acid phosphatase in the rabbit striatum and hypothalamus. Induction of anesthesia (5 min) decreased Met-enkephalin levels in the hypothalamus and striatum, and increased them in the hippocampus and mesencephalon. Induction of anesthesia increased Leu-enkephalin levels in all brain areas studied, except for the striatum, and increased neuropeptide Y content in the hippocampus. 15- and 60-min enflurane anesthesia increased Met-enkephalin content in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. After 15- and 60-min anesthesia, and after cessation of anesthesia, Leu-enkephalin levels were increased in the hypothalamus and mesencephalon, and were decreased in the striatum and hippocampus. In the striatum, neuropeptide Y content was significantly decreased during anesthesia and after cessation of anesthesia. Histochemical analysis revealed that enflurane enhanced ATP production, catabolic processes, and the rates of exchange and transport of energetic substrates in the striatum and hypothalamus. In conclusion, enflurane affects the levels of Met, Leu-enkephalins and NPY in a manner depending on the duration of anesthesia and the brain structure. Compared with isoflurane , which was studied in our previous study enflurane produces stronger alterations in the activities of enzymatic marker in the rabbit brain. This suggests that enflurane may be less safe than isoflurane.",
