     "AB": "Glutamate is essential for learning and memory processes, and acute and chronic exposures to ethanol (or protracted abstinence) alter glutamatergic transmission. In the current study, we investigated the effects of VU-29, positive allosteric modulator of metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptor, on the acute ethanol- and ethanol withdrawal-induced impairment of novel object recognition (NOR) task in rats. The influence of VU-29 (30 mg/kg) on memory retrieval was measured (a) at 4-h delay after acute ethanol administration, as well as (b) after acute withdrawal (24 and 48 h) of repeated (2.0 g/kg, once daily for 7 days) ethanol administration. Additionally, the effects of VU-29 on expression of mGlu5 and mGlu2 receptor proteins in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum were determined 48 h after ethanol withdrawal. Our results indicated that VU-29, given before acute ethanol administration, prevented the ethanol-induced impairments in spatial memory retrieval. Furthermore, VU-29 given before the testing session on the first day of abstinence facilitated NOR performance in ethanol-withdrawn rats at 4- and 24-h delay after administration. Our ELISA results show that VU-29 normalized ethanol withdrawal induced increase in expression of mGlu5 receptor protein in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum, as well as expression of mGlu2 receptor protein in the hippocampus. Thus, results from our study indicate that positive modulation of mGlu5 receptor prevented and reversed ethanol-induced memory impairment. Moreover, mGlu5 (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum) and mGlu2 (hippocampus) receptors play an important role in the ethanol-induced recognition memory impairment induced by ethanol withdrawal.",
