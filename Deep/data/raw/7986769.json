     "AB": "Performance on selected scores from the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) was compared in schizophrenia, Korsakoff's syndrome, and personality disorder patients. Five CVLT scores sensitive to dysfunction in the diencephalic-hippocampal memory system and one attention-sensitive variable were examined. The patient groups were matched on age, education, and verbal ability (WAIS-R). Schizophrenia patients differed consistently from Korsakoff patients on diencephalic-hippocampal memory variables. However, they did not differ significantly from patients with personality disorders. The three groups were comparable on immediate memory. Results are discussed in terms of the nature of memory problems in schizophrenia and the extent to which these problems reflect dysfunctional subcortical processing.",
