     "AB": "The sorting protein-related receptor 1 (SORL1 or LR11) gene has been verified to play an important role in the pathologic process of beta-amyloid (Abeta) formation and trafficking in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by plenty of cytological and molecular biological studies. But there were few studies investigated the association of SORL1 gene and neurodegeneration features from a rather macroscopic perspective. In the present study, we explored the effect of SORL1 genotypes on AD-related brain atrophy. We recruited 812 individuals with both baseline and two-year follow-up information from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and applied multiple linear regression models to examine the association between eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and neuroimaging phenotypes. Finally, four SNPs (rs11219350, rs2298813, rs3781836, rs3824968) showed trend of association with the volume of hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus but failed to survive the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Only rs1784933 and rs753780 showed significant association with right parahippocampal gyrus. According to our findings, SORL1 variations influence the atrophy of specific AD-related brain structures, which suggested the potential role of SORL1 in the neurodegeneration of cognitive related regions.",
