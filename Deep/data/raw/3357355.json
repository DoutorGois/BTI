     "AB": "A technique has been developed in which a planar array of 32 microelectrodes, arranged in a 4 by 8 pattern with 200 micron separation, is used to record from and stimulate the hippocampal slice preparation at multiple sites. Control of media flow past the tissue is critical to observe signals and preserve viability. Active suppression circuitry is used to prevent device saturation due to large stimulation artifacts. The field potentials recorded are spatially unique and provide a 2-dimensional description of the underlying population activity in the various pyramidal strata and subpopulations. Multisite stimulation is also possible with the array, permitting the experimenter to quickly stimulate and record from brain slices in many spatial patterns.",
