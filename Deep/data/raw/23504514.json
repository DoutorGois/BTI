     "AB": "Memory storage is a temporally graded process involving different phases and different structures in the mammalian brain. Cortical plasticity is essential to store stable memories, but little is known regarding its involvement in memory processing. Here we show that fear memory consolidation requires early post-training macromolecular synthesis in the anterior part of the retrosplenial cortex (aRSC), and that reversible pharmacological inactivation of this cortical region impairs recall of recent as well as of remote memories. These results challenge the generally accepted idea that neocortical areas are slow encoding systems that participate in the retrieval of remote memories only.",
