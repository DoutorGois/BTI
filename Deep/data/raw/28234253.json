     "AB": "Hyaluronic acid (HA) is the backbone of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and provides biochemical and physical support to aggrecan-based perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are associated with the selective vulnerability of neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we showed that HA synthases (HASs), including Has1, Has2, and Has3, were widely expressed in murine central nervous system. All types of HASs were localized to cell bodies of neurons; only Has1 existed in the membranes of neural axons. By using TauP301S transgenic (Tg) mouse model, we found that the axonal-localization of Has1 was abolished in TauP301S overexpressed mouse brain, and the redistribution of Has1 was also observed in human AD brains, suggesting that the localization of Has1 is dependent on intact microtubules which are regulated partially by the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycles of tau proteins. Furthermore, Has1 was reduced and Has3 was increased in TauP301S Tg mouse brain, resulting in the upregulation of shorter-chain HA in the ECM. These findings suggest that by abolishing the axonal-localization of Has1 and promoting the expression of Has3 and the synthesis of shorter-chain HA, the tau pathology breaks the balance of ECM components, promotes the reorganization of the ECM, and inhibits the formation of PNNs in the hippocampus, and then regulates neuronal plasticity during the progression of AD.",
