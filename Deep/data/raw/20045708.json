     "AB": "This study aimed to examine the feasibility of using thyroid hormone (TH) as a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mice were injected intra-hippocampally aggregated amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) to produce AD animal model. Intraperitoneal administration of l-thyroxine (L-T4) into Abeta-induced AD model mice prevented their cognitive impairment and improved their memory function. The mechanisms of L-T4 treating AD might be associated with regulating cholinergic function, protecting the brains of AD model mice against damage from free radicals, and rescuing hippocampal neurons from apoptosis. The results of the present study indicate that the use of TH has some therapeutic potential in AD.",
