     "AB": "alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin (ACT) has been reported to be present in senile plaques, and ACT level is elevated in the sera of patients with Alzheimer's disease. We found that ACT has a neurotrophic activity in vitro, i.e., it enhanced neuronal survival under the culture conditions used. Hippocampal neurons were cultured in chemically defined medium containing ACT at various concentrations. In order to evaluate the number of surviving neurons semiquantitatively, enzyme immunoassay for microtubule-associated protein2 (MAP2) was carried out using anti-MAP2 antibody. Cells cultured in medium containing 4 micrograms/ml of ACT showed 1.8-fold more neurotrophic activity than those cultured without ACT.",
