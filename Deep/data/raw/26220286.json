     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: Active inflammatory responses play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. We hypothesized that the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine is associated with the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators. METHODS: Forty-eight rats were equally randomized into six groups (a control and five chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) groups) and given either saline or 10 mg/kg ketamine, respectively. The forced swimming test was performed, and the hippocampus was subsequently harvested for the determination of levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), kynurenine (KYN), and tryptophan (TRP). RESULTS: CUMS induced depression-like behaviours and up-regulated the hippocampal levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IDO, and the KYN/TRP ratio, which were attenuated by a sub-anaesthetic dose of ketamine. CONCLUSION: CUMS-induced depression-like behaviours are associated with a reduction in hippocampal inflammatory mediators, whereas ketamine's antidepressant effect is associated with a down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the rat hippocampus.",
