     "AB": "The effect of baclofen on the development of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus was examined. Stimulus trains applied to the perforant path in the presence of baclofen produced significantly more potentiation of the perforant path-evoked response than did similar stimulation in control medium. In addition, baclofen enabled stimulus trains, ordinarily subthreshold for LTP induction, to produce LTP. These results demonstrate that GABAB receptor activation by baclofen makes repetitive stimulation more effective at producing LTP.",
