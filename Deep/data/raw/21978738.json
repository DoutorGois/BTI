     "AB": "In the present study, a biologically plausible neuronal population model is developed, which considers functional outcome of neuron-astrocyte interactions. Based on established neurophysiologic findings, astrocytes dynamically regulate the synaptic transmission of neuronal networks. The employed structure is based on the main physiological and anatomical features of the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. Utilizing our model, we demonstrate that healthy astrocytes provide appropriate feedback control in regulating neural activity. In this way, the astrocytes compensate the increase of excitation coupling strength among neurons and stabilize the normal level of synchronized behavior. Next, malfunction of astrocytes in the regulatory feedback loop is investigated. In this way, pathologic astrocytes are no longer able to regulate and/or compensate the excessive increase of the excitation level. Consequently, disruption of astrocyte signaling initiates hypersynchronous firing of neurons. Our results suggest that diminishing of neuron-astrocyte cross-talk leads to an abnormal synchronized neuronal firing, which suggests that astrocytes could be a proximal target for the treatment of related disorders including epilepsy.",
