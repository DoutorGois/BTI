     "PG": "370-81",
     "AB": "Clonic seizures were induced in Swiss or DBA/2 mice by methyl-6-7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), 0.048 mmol/kg i.p., or by methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), 0.044 mmol/kg i.p. Measurement of regional brain (cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum) amino acid levels after 15 min of seizure activity showed increases in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (in all regions after beta-CCM, and in cortex and hippocampus after DMCM), and an increase in glycine in the striatum after beta-CCM. Aspartate levels fell (in cortex and hippocampus) after DMCM, but were unchanged in all regions after beta-CCM. Glutamate levels fell in cortex after beta-CCM and in striatum after DMCM. Pretreatment with the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist, 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, 0.5 mmol/kg i.p., 45 min prior to the beta-carboline, significantly increased the ED50 for DMCM-induced clonic seizures (4.68 mumol/kg vs. 9.39 mumol/kg). Similar pretreatment did not significantly alter the ED50 for beta-CCM (4.22 mumol/kg vs. 6.6 mumol/kg). Pretreatment with 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, 1.0 mmol/kg, blocked the increase in GABA content produced by DMCM but not the fall in cortical aspartate content. Potassium-induced release of preloaded D-[3H]aspartate from rat cortical or hippocampal minislices was enhanced in the presence of DMCM (100 microM). In contrast, stimulated release of D-[3H]aspartate (from cortex or hippocampus) was not altered in the presence of beta-CCM (100 microM). Although DMCM and beta-CCM are both considered to induce convulsion by acting at the GABA--benzodiazepine receptor complex, the convulsions differ in several pharmacological and biochemical respects. It is suggested that enhanced release of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters plays a more important role in seizures induced by DMCM.",
