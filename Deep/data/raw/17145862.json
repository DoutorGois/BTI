     "AB": "Curative cancer treatment regimens often require cranial irradiation, resulting in lifelong neurocognitive deficiency in cancer survivors. This deficiency is in part related to radiation-induced apoptosis and decreased neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. We show that lithium treatment protects irradiated hippocampal neurons from apoptosis and improves cognitive performance of irradiated mice. The molecular mechanism of this effect is mediated through multiple pathways, including Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and Bcl-2/Bax. Lithium treatment of the cultured mouse hippocampal neurons HT-22 induced activation of Akt (1.5-fold), inhibition of GSK-3beta (2.2-fold), and an increase in Bcl-2 protein expression (2-fold). These effects were sustained when cells were treated with lithium in combination with ionizing radiation. In addition, this combined treatment led to decreased expression (40%) of the apoptotic protein Bax. The additional genes regulated by lithium were identified by microarray, such as decorin and Birc1f. In summary, we propose lithium treatment as a novel therapy for prevention of deleterious neurocognitive consequences of cranial irradiation.",
