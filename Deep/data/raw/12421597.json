     "AB": "The whole brain free fatty acid (FFA) level, as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were determined in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and pons-medulla region of the single pentylenetetrazol (PZT)-treated and PZT-kindled Hannover-Wistar rats. PZT administration in the convulsive dose caused significant increase of the brain FFA content. Decreased SOD activity was detected in the frontal cortex of PZT-kindled rats, whereas decreased GPX activity was found in the frontal cortex and cerebellum of all treated rats, as well as in the hippocampus and pons-medulla of PZT-kindled rats. Kindling caused distinctive change of antioxidative defense in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and pons-medulla region.",
