     "AB": "Using X-ray film autoradiography the distribution of 125I-galanin binding sites was studied in the forebrain of monkey and man. In the monkey a high density was found in all areas of the neocortex, especially layer 4, and in certain subfields in the hippocampal region. Also in the human brain high activity was seen in neocortex, mainly layer 6 and in hippocampal areas, as well as in amygdala, piriform cortex and hypothalamus. These results suggest that the 29-amino acid peptide galanin may be involved in the regulation of higher cortical functions in primates.",
