     "AB": "Proteins which are apparently regulated in concentration in two different areas of the rat brain by the indole neurotransmitter serotonin were identified using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined with computerized scanning densitometry. Reduction in central serotonin levels produced a decrease in the concentration of 3 different proteins (2 in the parietal cortex, 1 in the hippocampus). Two proteins, both in the hippocampus, were elevated in concentration following serotonin depletion. These results demonstrate that there exist in the brain a limited number of proteins whose concentration is influenced by serotonin.",
