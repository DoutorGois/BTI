     "AB": "[3H]kainate-binding site distribution in mouse brain was studied by in vitro autoradiography during postnatal development. Sites, highly concentrated at early postnatal ages and undetectable at adult ages, were observed in deep cerebellar nuclei, inferior olive, pontine nuclei, inferior colliculus and stratum lacunosum moleculare of the area CA1 in the hippocampus as well as in previously described rat brain areas. It is suggested that the molecules carrying these sites play a role in the development of the regions where they are transiently expressed.",
