     "AB": "Clinically, 4-8 Hz (or 30-80 Hz) stimulation of the caudate nucleus ceases (or enhances) the neocortical and hippocampal epileptiform activities of the epilepsy patients. Possibly, electric stimulation of the caudate nucleus could produce epilepsy. In order to prove this point we delivered the acute tetanization (60 Hz, 2s, 0.4-0.6 mA) into the rat right caudate putamen nucleus (ATRC) and examined bilateral neocortical EEG and hippocampal unit discharges in vivo. The results demonstrated that: (1) 80-280 Hz EEG ripples could be evoked bilaterally, and more stronger on the contralateral side. And the maximum amplitudes of the power spectra (microV2/Hz) have higher shifting variability among multiple contralateral EEG ripples. (2) The EEG ripples were coupled contralaterally with the hippocampal neuronal firing inhibition. (3) An episode of 10-15 Hz EEG oscillations was ipsilaterally coupled with rhythmic hippocampal neuronal bursts. It suggested that the hemispheric reactions of neocortical EEG and hippocampal neuronal discharges are lateralized in response to the stimulation. It implies that the epileptic network activities were reorganized by the ATRC. Neocortical EEG ripples, called as seizure-like fast oscillations, were repetitively evoked by the ATRC.",
