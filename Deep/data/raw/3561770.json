     "AB": "Subacute encephalitis, characterized by demyelination, gliosis of the gray and white matter, focal necrosis, microglial nodules, atypical oligodendrocyte nuclei, and multinucleation of cells, was present in 27 of 30 (90%) autopsied patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex. Subacute encephalitis was mainly distributed in the frontal (58%) and temporal (69%) lobes, basal ganglia (77%), amygdala (80%), and hippocampus (64%). Ten (37%) with moderate or severe subacute encephalitis were demented; 82% with mild subacute encephalitis had no recognized neurologic disorder. Human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) was isolated from neural tissue or CSF in 11 of 13 patients, 10 with subacute encephalitis, and 1 without CNS lesions. We conclude that subacute encephalitis is common in AIDS patients and is most likely caused by CNS infection with HTLV-III.",
