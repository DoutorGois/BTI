     "AB": "The aging process is associated with cognitive impairment and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, as well as with oxidative stress. We determined some parameters of oxidative stress in homogenates of hippocampus, hypothalamus and adrenal glands from male 2-, 6- and 24-months-old Wistar rats. A significant age-dependent increase in the generation of free radicals was observed in hippocampus, hypothalamus and adrenal glands, as well as on lipid peroxidation in hippocampus and hypothalamus. The glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was significantly reduced in hypothalamus and hippocampus from 6-months-old rats; a decline on GPx and catalase activities in adrenal glands of 24-months-old animals was also present. Interestingly, a great decrease in total antioxidant capacity was found in all tissues tested. Reported findings support the idea that oxidative events participate on multiple neuroendocrine-metabolic impairments and suggest that the oxidative stress found in hippocampus, hypothalamus and adrenals might be associated with age-related physiological deficits.",
