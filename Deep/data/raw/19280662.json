     "AB": "The medial diencephalon is vital for memory, but it is not known why. The present study tested between the predictions of current hypotheses as to why this region is critical for memory. Lesions were made in the rat mammillothalamic tract, the only diencephalic structure consistently associated with amnesia in humans after ischemia. Decreased activity, as measured by immediate-early gene expression (c-fos), was found in three key sites associated with memory function: the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the retrosplenial cortex. The specificity of these changes was confirmed by the qualitatively different patterns of immediately-early gene changes seen after amygdala lesions, e.g., hypoactivity in the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex following mammillothalamic tract lesions but not following amygdala lesions. The mammillothalamic lesion results unify substrates linked to diencephalic and temporal lobe amnesia, and thereby support a new account of diencephalic amnesia that emphasizes multiple dysfunctions across hippocampal, retrosplenial, and prefrontal areas. This account suggests a role for the mammillary bodies that is independent of their hippocampal inputs.",
