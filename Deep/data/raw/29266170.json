     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evidence suggests that exercise decreases nicotine withdrawal symptoms in humans; however, the mechanisms mediating this effect are unclear. We investigated, in a mouse model, the effect of exercise intensity during chronic nicotine exposure on nicotine withdrawal severity, binding of alpha4beta2*, alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR), mu-opioid (mu receptors) and D2 dopamine receptors and on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and plasma corticosterone levels. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Male C57Bl/6J mice treated with nicotine (minipump, 24 mg.kg(-1) .day(-1) ) or saline for 14 days underwent one of three concurrent exercise regimes: 24, 2 or 0 h.day(-1) voluntary wheel running. Mecamylamine-precipitated withdrawal symptoms were assessed on day 14. Quantitative autoradiography of alpha4beta2*, alpha7 nAChRs, mu receptors and D2 receptor binding was performed in brain sections of these mice. Plasma corticosterone and brain BDNF levels were also measured. KEY RESULTS: Nicotine-treated mice undertaking 2 or 24 h.day(-1) wheel running displayed a significant reduction in withdrawal symptom severity compared with the sedentary group. Wheel running induced a significant up-regulation of alpha7 nAChR binding in the CA2/3 area of the hippocampus of nicotine-treated mice. Neither exercise nor nicotine treatment affected mu or D2 receptor binding or BDNF levels. Nicotine withdrawal increased plasma corticosterone levels and alpha4beta2* nAChR binding, irrespective of exercise regimen. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We demonstrated for the first time a profound effect of exercise on alpha7 nAChRs in nicotine-dependent animals, irrespective of exercise intensity. These findings shed light onto the mechanism underlining the protective effect of exercise on the development of nicotine dependence.",
