     "AB": "In the present study, we compared the immunoreactivities and levels of Trx/prx redox system, thioredoxin 2 (Trx2), thioredoxin reductase 2 (TrxR2) and peroxiredoxin 3 (Prx3), as well as neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region between the adult and young gerbil after 5 min of transient cerebral ischemia. At 4 days post-ischemia, pyramidal neurons (about 90%) in the adult stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region showed \"delayed neuronal death (DND)\"; however, at this time point, few pyramidal neurons showed DND in the young stratum pyramidale. At 7 days post-ischemia, about 56% of pyramidal neurons showed DND in the young stratum pyramidale. The immunoreactivities of all the antioxidants in the young sham-group were similar to those in the adult sham-group. At 4 days post-ischemia, the immunoreactivity of TrxR2, not Trx2 and Prx3 in the adult ischemia-group was dramatically decreased in CA1 pyramidal neurons. At this time point, the immunoreactivities of all the antioxidants in the young ischemia-group were apparently increased compared to the adult ischemia-group. From 7 days pots-ischemia, non-pyramidal cells showed the immunoreactivities of all the antioxidants in the ischemic CA1 region; however, in the young ischemia-groups, the immunoreactivities were much lower than those in the adult ischemia-groups. In brief, our results showed that the immunoreactivities of Trx2, TrxR2 and Prx3 were dramatically increased in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the young ischemia-groups at 4 days post-ischemia compared to those in the adult ischemia-groups induced by transient cerebral ischemia.",
