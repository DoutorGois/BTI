     "AB": "The present study is the first to examine the effect of a single intraperitoneal injection of the neuroexcitotoxin domoic acid on learning in mice. Compared to saline controls, animals exposed to domoic acid (2.0 mg/kg) showed significant impairment on the acquisition of the place task in the Morris water maze. Observation of swim paths taken by mice searching for the underwater platform revealed a failure on the part of the domoic acid-exposed mice to select the appropriate problem solving strategies. The results, along with neuroanatomic work done here and elsewhere, suggest that impairment of acquisition and retention of this spatial navigation task by domoic acid, involves a neuropathology that includes not only the hippocampus, but other limbic, and possibly extralimbic brain regions.",
