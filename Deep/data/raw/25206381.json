     "AB": "Minocylcine, a tetracycline derivate, has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the central nervous system. In this study, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury models were established using the suture method, and minocycline was immediately injected intraperitoneally after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (22.5 mg/kg, initially 45 mg/kg) at a 12-hour interval. Results showed that after minocycline treatment, the volume of cerebral infarction was significantly reduced, the number of surviving cell in the hippocampal CA1 region increased, the number of apoptotic cells decreased, the expression of caspase-3 and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase-1 protein was down-regulated, and the escape latency in the water maze test was significantly shortened compared with the ischemia-reperfusion group. Our experimental findings indicate that minocycline can protect against neuronal injury induced by focal ischemia-reperfusion, which may be mediated by the inhibition of caspase-3 and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase-1 protein expression.",
