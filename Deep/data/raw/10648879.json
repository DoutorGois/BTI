     "AB": "The GABA(A) receptor is a pentameric ligand gated ion channel complex assembled from a family of at least 17 different subunits encoded by distinct genes. Two subunits, alpha(1) and alpha(2), exhibit age dependent expression throughout several areas of the brain. In general, the density of immunoreactive product for alpha(1) is greatest in the adult brain, while alpha(2) is highest in younger tissue. Since the developmental switch in alpha(1) and alpha(2) coincides with the end of the sensitive period for steroid-mediated sexual differentiation of the brain, we hypothesized that GABA(A) receptor subunit expression may be involved in this process. We have examined the age-dependent expression of alpha(1) and alpha(2) in discrete regions of the hypothalamus and limbic system of males and females. While we did not detect any dramatic sex differences in alpha(1) or alpha(2) immunoreactive density, each region exhibited a unique developmental profile. In the ventromedial nucleus of neonatal animals immunoreactivity is highest for alpha(1), while in the adult the signal for alpha(2) is greater; the opposite of that observed in the ventrolateral thalamus. There is no age dependent change for alpha(1) in the preoptic area, while alpha(2) shows a small, but significant increase. Immunoreactive densities for both subunits increase in the arcuate nucleus and the hippocampus, but decrease in the lateral amygdala. We conclude that these regional differences in subunit expression across development determine individual characteristics of brain areas and may play a role in establishing unique physiological responses to GABA.",
