     "AB": "Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) facilitates neuritic extension in cultured hippocampal neurons during initial development. However, the functions of LECT2 in neuritic extension are poorly understood. To elucidate these functions, we examined microtubular morphology and levels of katanin-P60, a microtubule-severing enzyme, in cultured hippocampal neurons from wild-type mice and LECT2 knockout (KO) mice. Microtubules in LECT2-KO mice exhibited fragmentation and were shorter than those of wild-type mice. Furthermore, the expression of katanin-P60 in LECT2-KO mice was significantly elevated when compared with wild-type mice at 1 day in vitro (DIV1) and 4. Our results suggest that LECT2 regulates neuritic extension through microtubular morphallaxis through the control of katanin-P60 levels.",
