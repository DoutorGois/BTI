     "AB": "The degree of cell loss of immunohistochemically stained cholinergic neurons was quantitatively compared in equivalent regions of the septum in three groups of animals with lesions transecting their axons at different levels in the fimbria-fornix (FF). Locations of different septal regions and of FF lesions were defined according to their distances from fixed anatomical reference points. Individual animals all exhibited a gradient of cholinergic cell loss, such that the severity of cell loss diminished progressively in the rostral and ventral directions as the distance from the lesion increased beyond a certain point. Comparison of animals with FF lesions in different locations showed that this gradient of cell loss shifts in the caudo-rostral and dorso-ventral directions within the septal complex in direct relation to the proximity of the axotomizing FF lesion. These findings suggest that among septal cholinergic neurons there is a fixed spatial relationship between the distance of neuronal somata from an axotomizing FF lesion and the likelihood of neuronal loss in response to axotomy. This relationship could not be defined precisely using the material studied, but simple geometrical calculations showed that within 2500 microns of the lesion cell loss is always pronounced (less than 30 per cent detectable cells vs controls) and beyond 4000 microns cell loss is generally not severe (greater than 80 per cent detectable cells). Between these two distances cell loss diminishes in a gradiated manner. Thus, relatively small differences (1 mm) in the location of FF lesions can lead to marked differences in the severity of degeneration observed in certain equivalent regions of the septum. The findings have implications both for attempts to understand the causes underlying retrograde neuronal degeneration and for studies investigating means of preventing retrograde degeneration of cholinergic septal neurons.",
