     "AB": "An efficient and simple class solution is proposed for hippocampal-avoidance whole-brain radiation therapy (HA-WBRT) planning using the Volumetric Arc Therapy (VMAT) delivery technique following the NRG Oncology protocol NRG-CC001 treatment planning guidelines. The whole-brain planning target volume (PTV) was subdivided into subplanning volumes that lie in plane and out of plane with the hippocampal-avoidance volume. To further improve VMAT treatment plans, a partial-field dual-arc technique was developed. Both the arcs were allowed to overlap on the in-plane subtarget volume, and in addition, one arc covered the superior out-of-plane sub-PTV, while the other covered the inferior out-of-plane subtarget volume. For all plans (n = 20), the NRG-CC001 protocol dose-volume criteria were met. Mean values of volumes for the hippocampus and the hippocampal-avoidance volume were 4.1 cm(3) +/- 1.0 cm(3) and 28.52 cm(3) +/- 3.22 cm(3), respectively. For the PTV, the average values of D(2%) and D(98%) were 36.1 Gy +/- 0.8 Gy and 26.2 Gy +/- 0.6 Gy, respectively. The hippocampus D(100%) mean value was 8.5 Gy +/- 0.2 Gy and the maximum dose was 15.7 Gy +/- 0.3 Gy. The corresponding plan quality indices were 0.30 +/- 0.01 (homogeneity index), 0.94 +/- 0.01 (target conformality), and 0.75 +/- 0.02 (confirmation number). The median total monitor unit (MU) per fraction was 806 MU (interquartile range [IQR]: 792 to 818 MU) and the average beam total delivery time was 121.2 seconds (IQR: 120.6 to 121.35 seconds). All plans passed the gamma evaluation using the 5-mm, 4% criteria, with gamma > 1 of not more than 9.1% data points for all fields. An efficient and simple planning class solution for HA-WBRT using VMAT has been developed that allows all protocol constraints of NRG-CC001 to be met.",
