     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Oseltamivir phosphate (OP, Tamiflu((R))) is a widely used drug in the treatment of influenza with fever. However, case reports have associated OP intake with sudden abnormal behaviors. In rats infected by the influenza A virus (IAV), the electroencephalogram (EEG) displayed abnormal high-voltage amplitudes with spikes and theta oscillations at a core temperature of 39.9 degrees C to 41 degrees C. Until now, there has been no information describing the effect of OP on intact brain hippocampal activity of IAV-infected animals during hyperthermia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of OP on abnormal EEG activities in the hippocampus using the rat model of influenza-associated encephalopathy. METHODS: Male Wistar rats aged 3 to 4 weeks were used for the study. Influenza A/WSN/33 strain (1 x 10(5) plaque forming unit in PBS, 60 microL) was applied intranasally to the rats. To characterize OP effects on the IAV-infected rats, EEG activity was studied more particularly in isoflurane-anesthetized IAV-infected rats during hyperthermia. RESULTS: We found that the hippocampal EEG of the OP-administered (10 mg/kg) IAV-infected rats showed significant reduction of the high-voltage amplitudes and spikes, but the theta oscillations, which had been observed only at >40 degrees C in OP non-administered rats, appeared at 38 degrees C core temperature. Atropine (30 mg/kg) blocked the theta oscillations. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that OP efficiently reduces the abnormal EEG activities after IAV infection during hyperthermia. However, OP administration may stimulate ACh release in rats at normal core temperature.",
