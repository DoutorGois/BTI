     "AB": "Electrophysiological study of functional interactions of the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, the head of the caudate nucleus and the thalamic medio-dorsal nucleus in 2 monkeys in conditions of the trace reflex and delayed reaction has revealed various morphofunctional systems for these types of memory. The morphofunctional system of the trace CR is characterized by greater stability and a small number of functional connections (21%) in contrast to the dynamic morphofunctional system with a considerable percentage of functional contacts (54%) in case of the delayed reaction. This difference can be very likely related to the different dynamics of functional connections between brain structures rather than to the involvement of various brain structures.",
