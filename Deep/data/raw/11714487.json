     "AB": "Sensory gating is defined as a decreased reaction on the second click, measured as evoked potentials (EP) within a double click paradigm. Recently, it was established that gating in rats was decreased during REM sleep compared to wakefulness and non-REM sleep. REM sleep in the rat is characterized by hippocampal theta rhythm. Therefore, it was investigated whether sensory gating would also be diminished during other states with hippocampal theta. Twelve Wistar rats were implanted with hippocampal electrodes and exposed to double clicks during passive wakefulness, REM sleep, and activity (voluntary movements and walking on a moving belt). Gating was examined by use of the amplitudes of the EPs in reaction to the first conditioned amplitude (CAMP) and second click test amplitude (TAMP), as well as two gating parameters (C-T score and T/C ratio). Except passive wakefulness all behavioral conditions were accompanied by hippocampal theta. Normal gating was always found, except during REM sleep. The CAMP was than lower than during passive wakefulness. Gating was less disturbed during behavioral activity. Negative correlations were found between the percentage theta power on the one side and the CAMP, respectively, the C-T score, on the other. The correlation between the percentage theta power and the T/C ratio was also significant. It is concluded that the presence of hippocampal theta is not a sufficient condition to cause disturbances in auditory sensory gating. Behavioral states that accompany theta activity, however, tend to affect the CAMP. The decrease in gating found during REM sleep cannot be easily related to well-known neurochemical and pharmacological data.",
