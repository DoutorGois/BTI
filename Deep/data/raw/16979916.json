     "AB": "The present study evaluated the role of chronic docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on active avoidance learning task performance in experimental hypertension. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five experimental groups as follows: control, sham, DHA treated, 1K-1C hypertensive, and 1K-1C hypertensive+DHA treated. Hypertension was induced in 1K-1C rats via placing a silver clip (0.20-mm ID) around the left renal artery following a right uninephrectomy. DHA (36 mg/kg/day) was given to the treatment groups for 60 days by gastric gavage. Arterial blood pressure was measured by using the tail-cuff method. Active avoidance responses were determined by an automated shuttle-box. In brain (cerebrum) and hippocampus tissues, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and nitrite levels were measured by fluorometric methods. DHA supplementation decreased blood pressure in hypertensive rats. Data from active avoidance training indicated that performance of active avoidance learning tasks were significantly impaired in 1K-1C hypertensive rats, but was completely restored by DHA supplementation. Increased cerebrum TBARS levels in 1K-1C rats were abolished by DHA administration. Cerebrum nitrite levels were lower in the DHA, 1K-1C and 1K-1C+DHA treated groups compared to controls. Hippocampus nitrite levels were lower in DHA treated and 1K-1C hypertensive rats compared to controls and higher in 1K-1C+DHA treated rats compared to the 1K-1C group. Our data indicates that DHA supplementation improves the performance of active avoidance learning tasks which is impaired in experimental hypertension. These affirmative changes might be due to a DHA-induced decrease in lipid peroxidation which may in turn limit the consumption of nitric oxide (NO) which promotes active avoidance learning.",
