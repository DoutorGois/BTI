     "AB": "The present dose-response study sought to determine the effects of subanesthetic dosages (4-16 mg/kg) of ketamine on locomotion, sensorimotor gating (PPI), working memory, as well as c-fos expression in various limbic regions implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In addition, we examined whether ketamine-induced locomotion was influenced by the dark/light cycle. We found that ketamine increased locomotor activity in a dose dependent manner, but found no influence of the dark-light cycle. Additionally, ketamine dose-dependently interrupted PPI, resulting in prepulse facilitation at doses of 8 and 12 mg/kg. The dose of 12 mg/kg also induced impairments in working memory assessed by the discrete-trial delayed-alternation task. C-fos expression indicated that the dose-dependent behavioral effects of ketamine might be related to changes in the activity of limbic regions, notably hippocampus and amygdala.",
