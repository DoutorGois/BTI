     "AB": "Since adult neurogenesis became a widely accepted phenomenon, much effort has been put in trying to understand the mechanisms involved in its regulation. In addition, the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, has been associated with imbalances in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. These imbalances may ultimately reflect alterations at the cell cycle level, as a common mechanism through which intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli interact with the neurogenic niche properties. Thus, the comprehension of these regulatory mechanisms has become of major importance to disclose novel therapeutic targets. In this review, we first present a comprehensive view on the cell cycle components and mechanisms that were identified in the context of the homeostatic adult hippocampal neurogenic niche. Then, we focus on recent work regarding the cell cycle changes and signaling pathways that are responsible for the neurogenesis imbalances observed in neuropathological conditions, with a particular emphasis on depression.",
