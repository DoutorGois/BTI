     "AB": "It was recently proposed that fast gamma oscillations (60-150 Hz) convey spatial information from the medial entorhinal cortex (EC) to the CA1 region of the hippocampus. However, here we describe 2 functionally distinct oscillations within this frequency range, both coupled to the theta rhythm during active exploration and rapid eye movement sleep: an oscillation with peak activity at approximately 80 Hz and a faster oscillation centered at approximately 140 Hz. The 2 oscillations are differentially modulated by the phase of theta depending on the CA1 layer; theta-80 Hz coupling is strongest at stratum lacunosum-moleculare, while theta-140 Hz coupling is strongest at stratum oriens-alveus. This laminar profile suggests that the approximately 80 Hz oscillation originates from EC inputs to deeper CA1 layers, while the approximately 140 Hz oscillation reflects CA1 activity in superficial layers. We further show that the approximately 140 Hz oscillation differs from sharp wave-associated ripple oscillations in several key characteristics. Our results demonstrate the existence of novel theta-associated high-frequency oscillations and suggest a redefinition of fast gamma oscillations.",
