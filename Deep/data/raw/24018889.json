     "AB": "We used forebrain-specific conditional presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) double knockout mice (dKO mice) that exhibit symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease, to investigate whether ibuprofen can rescue brain and periodontal tissue abnormalities by attenuating the inflammatory response. Mandibles were dissected for alveolar bone-height analysis. Maxillae were fixed and decalcified for histological observation and osteoclast detection. ELISA measurements from the hippocampus, cortex, and gingiva of the mandibular incisor teeth were used to assay inflammatory mediators. We confirmed periodontal tissue abnormalities and inflammatory responses in brain and periodontal tissues in naive nine- and 12-month-old dKO mice. The other two groups of age-matched dKO mice that received 375-ppm ibuprofen treatment for six consecutive months exhibited significantly attenuated damage in periodontal tissues and reduction in several inflammation-related factors in brain and periodontal tissues. Our findings showed that the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen significantly decreased inflammation through the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway in brain and periodontal tissues in dKO mice, and then attenuated abnormalities in periodontal tissues. This suggests that ibuprofen could be an ideal drug for preventing both nervous system and periodontal tissue damage caused by inflammatory responses.",
