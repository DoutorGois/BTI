     "AB": "In summary, I have reviewed the results from 6 coded compounds we have evaluated as part of CPDD's efforts to expand into testing the dependence potential of anorectics and anxiolytics. I have reviewed a great deal of additional studies in order to place the results with the test drugs into a broader context and also to demonstrate our experience in evaluating these classes of drugs. Clearly the 4 anxiolytic drugs were well characterized by our tests. The two compounds designated as anorectics are still unknown to us. CPDD 5 appears amphetamine-like, is self-administered, and in both tests is 1/10th as potent as amphetamine. The results with CPDD 6, however, are less clear. In the drug discrimination studies, it only substitutes for amphetamine in some animals, and in monkeys has minimal reinforcing properties.",
