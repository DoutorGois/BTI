     "AB": "The effects of chronic maternal perinatal nimodipine treatment on the immunocytochemical distribution of the Ca(2+)-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV) and S-100 beta in neocortex and hippocampus were studied at the age of postnatal day (PD) 5, 7, 10, 14 and 20. The Ca2+ antagonist nimodipine (1000 ppm BAY e 9736 in daily food) was administered to pregnant rats starting at postconceptual day 11. The expression of PV exemplified in layer V of parietal and retrosplenial cortex and in all hippocampal layers of CA1 and CA3 was enhanced by more than two-fold in the offspring of nimodipine-treated dams at PD 10 compared with placebo-treated animals. The difference was no longer present at PD 14 and 20. Nimodipine administration also significantly increased the number of S-100 beta-immunopositive glial cells in upper neocortical layers I-III at PD 5 and 7. Again, the difference between nimodipine and placebo-treated animals disappeared after PD 10. The data indicate an accelerated development of PV and S-100 immunoreactivity in the postnatal forebrain as a result of perinatal blockade of the L-type Ca2+ current.",
