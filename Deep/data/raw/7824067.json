     "AB": "From rat hippocampal homogenate, we recently isolated a novel subcellular fraction richly containing glial plasmalemmal vesicles (GPV), which takes up glutamate remarkably as a synaptosomal fraction [Y. Nakamura et al. (1993) Glia, 9, 48-56]. In the present study, we prepared GPV from different regions of rat CNS, namely olfactory bulb (Ob), cerebral cortex (Cx), caudatoputamen (Cp), hippocampus (Hp), cerebellum (Ce) and spinal cord (Sc), and analyzed their activities of Na(+)-dependent uptake of following neurotransmitters and a related compound; glutamate, gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA), glycine, dopamine and choline. The uptake activities of these amino acids were not significantly different between GPV and synaptosomes in each region. Regionally, however, the activities were varied considerably. The activities of glutamate uptake revealed in the following rank order: Cx, Hp, Cp > Ce, Ob > Sc. GABA uptake activities were: Ce > Ob, Cx, Hp > Cp, while glycine uptake activities were: Sc, Ce > Ob, Cp, Cx, Hp. On the other hand, the uptake activities of dopamine and choline were quite different between GPV and synaptosomes. Synaptosomal fraction from Cp took up dopamine in a high activity; however, GPV from the same tissue hardly showed the uptake activity. Choline was taken up by synaptosomes prepared from Hp but not by GPV.",
