     "AB": "In this study, male Sprague-Dawley rats maintained under controlled environmental conditions were used. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were determined in cerebral cortex, bulbus olfactorius, midbrain, hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, pons and medulla oblongata in control rats and rats treated with morphine (10 mg/kg) for 1 or 2 days. Repeated administration of morphine was associated with a decline in the degree of analgesia produced. Significant increase (p less than 0.01) in AChE activity of the medulla oblongata was observed following morphine administration for 1 or 2 days. A single injection of morphine resulted in a significant decline (p less than 0.01) in ChAT activity of hypothalamus, cerebellum and medulla oblongata. However, no such decline could be observed after 2 consecutive daily injections of morphine. In the cerebral cortex there was a significant decline (p less than 0.01) in ChAT activity after the second administration of morphine. These findings indicate that the changes in the responsiveness of the brain cholinergic enzymes following repeated morphine administration may in part explain the rapid development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine.",
