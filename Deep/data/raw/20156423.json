     "AB": "Aquaporins (AQP) 1 and 4 are water channel proteins localized respectively at the level of the blood-cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and blood brain (BBB) barriers. These barriers represent the sites of exchange between blood and nervous tissue and between blood, choroid plexus and CSF in brain ventricles respectively. Damage of these barriers may alter transfer of substances between blood and nervous tissue. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) chronic hypertension may induce BBB dysfunction and pronounced defects in the integrity of the blood-CSF barrier. AQP1 is expressed in the apical membrane of choroid plexus epithelium. AQP4 is expressed by astrocyte foot processes near blood vessels. The present study has assessed the expression of AQP1 and AQP4 in the brain of SHR in pre-hypertensive (2 months of age), developing hypertension (4 months of age) and established hypertension (6 months of age) stages. Age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as normotensive reference group. AQP1 expression is increased in choroid plexus epithelium of 6-month-old SHR. An increased expression of AQP4 was found in frontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus of 4- and 6-month-old SHR compared to younger cohorts and age-matched WKY rats. These findings suggest that the increase in AQP expression may alter fluid exchange in BBB and/or in blood-CSF barrier. This situation in case of an acute or excessively elevated rise of blood pressure can promote BBB changes causing the brain damage occurring in this animal model of hypertension.",
