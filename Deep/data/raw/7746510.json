     "AB": "Following unilateral electrolytic lesioning of the rat entorhinal cortex, we assessed changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for four neuron-associated proteins, GAP-43, SCG10, 68 kDa neurofilament (NF68), and alpha 1-tubulin that encode proteins of importance to synaptic remodelling. The mRNA levels for GAP-43 and SCG10 were reduced in the septal nuclei, while those of SCG10 and alpha 1-tubulin were elevated in the hippocampus; at most, the changes ranged from -40% to +50% of controls. Changes in NF68 mRNA levels were not significant. Correlations were found between mRNA for SCG10 and both GAP-43 and NF68. In view of these modest changes in most mRNA levels examined, we suggest that post-translational regulation may also be important in responses to injury.",
