     "AB": "Age-dependent studies on oligodendrocytes, which are the myelinating cells in the central nervous system, have been relatively less investigated. We examined age-dependent changes in Rip immunoreactivity and its protein level in the gerbil hippocampus during normal aging using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis with Rip antibody, an oligodendrocyte marker. Rip immunoreactivity and its protein level in the hippocampal CA1 region significantly increased at postnatal month 3 (PM 3). Thereafter, they decreased in the hippocampal CA1 region with age. At PM 24, Rip immunoreactive processes in the hippocampal CA1 region markedly decreased in the stratum radiatum. In the hippocampal CA2/3 region and dentate gyrus, the pattern of changes in Rip immunoreactivity and its protein level was similar to those in the hippocampal CA1 region; however, no significant changes were found in the CA2/3 region and dentate gyrus at various age stages. These results indicate that Rip immunoreactivity and protein level in the hippocampal CA1 region decreases significantly at PM 24 compared to the CA2/3 region and dentate gyrus.",
