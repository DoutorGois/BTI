     "AB": "Episodic memory organizes experience in time, so that we can review past events and anticipate the future. In a hippocampus-dependent memory task, spike timing in pairs of simultaneously active CA1 neurons with overlapping place fields distinguished the start and end of trials. At the common starting point of different journeys, the relative spike timing of the neurons was highly correlated. As the rat approached a common goal from different starting points, however, temporal firing patterns were strongly modulated across journeys even if the cells fired in the same spatial locations within fields, implying that different processes influenced when and where cells fire. Spike timing within hippocampal ensembles may thereby help parse the beginning from the end of episodes in memory.",
