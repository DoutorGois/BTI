     "AB": "PbS nanoparticles (NPs) is an important nanomaterial for biomedical imaging in living tissues. However, concerning the high toxicity, especially neurotoxicity, of Pb element, it is crucial that the toxicity assessment of \"naked\" PbS NPs should be adequately studied. In the current study, we systematically explored the neurotoxicity of PbS NPs in rats by measuring the body weight and brain coefficient changes, testing memory behaviors in Y-electric maze, and studying the neuronal ultrastructure and pathology in hippocampus. Furthermore, in order to study the toxic mechanism, we performed Pb and Ca content measurements in various organs, and investigated Ca(2+)-ATPase activity and L-type calcium channel subunit expression. Our results confirmed that PbS NPs showed high neurotoxicity, while a possible mechanism was suggested to be due to the PbS NPs-induced calcium homeostasis disorder which was caused by the abnormal calcium transportation.",
