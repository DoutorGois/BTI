     "AB": "Increasing evidence suggests that the chemokine interleukin (IL)-8/CXCL8 plays important roles in CNS development, neuronal survival, modulation of excitability, and neuroimmune response. Recently, we have shown that CXCL8 can acutely modulate ion channel activity in septal neurons expressing receptors CXCR1 and/or CXCR2. This was a surprising finding, insofar as CXCR1 expression had not been described for the mammalian brain. Here we investigated whether CXCR1 transcripts are present in other brain regions, whether they are expressed at the single-cell level in molecularly identified neurons and astrocytes, and how they are regulated during early postnatal development. In addition, possible cellular colocalization of CXCR1 and CXCR2 transcripts was examined. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that CXCR1 mRNAs were expressed in the septum, striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex (temporoparietal and entorhinal) at different levels and appeared to be regulated independently from CXCR2 during development. By using RT multiplex PCR on acutely dissociated cells from these brain regions, we show that CXCR1 transcripts were expressed in 83% of 84 sampled neurons displaying cholinergic (choline acetyltransferase mRNAs), gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (glutamic acid decarboxylases 65 and 67 mRNAs), or glutamatergic (vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 mRNAs) phenotypes. CXCR1 and CXCR2 transcripts were colocalized in 45% of neurons sampled and also were present in some glial fibrillary acidic protein mRNA-expressing astrocytes. This is the first study to demonstrate the widespread expression of CXCR1 transcripts in the brain and suggests that CXCR1 may have hitherto unsuspected roles in neuromodulation and inflammation.",
