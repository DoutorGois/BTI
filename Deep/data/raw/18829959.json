     "AB": "Enkephalins (ENKs) are endogenous opioids that regulate synaptic excitability of GABAergic networks in the cerebral cortex. Using retrograde tracer injections in the subiculum, we identified a hippocampal population of ENK-expressing projection neurons. In situ hybridization for GAD shows that ENK-expressing cells are a small GABAergic subpopulation. Furthermore, by extracellular recording and juxtacellular labeling in vivo, we identified an ENK-expressing cell in stratum radiatum of the CA1 area by its complete axodendritic arborization and characteristic spike timing during network oscillations. The somatodendritic membrane was immunopositive for mGluR1alpha, and there was both a rich local axon in CA1 and subicular-projecting branches. The boutons showed cell-type- and layer-specific innervation, i.e., interneurons were the main targets in the alveus, both interneurons and pyramidal cell dendrites were innervated in the other layers, and interneurons were exclusive targets in the subiculum. Parvalbumin-, but not somatostatin-, calbindin-, or cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons were preferred synaptic targets. During network activity, the juxtacellularly labeled ENK-expressing cell was phase modulated throughout theta oscillations, but silenced during sharp-wave/ripple episodes. After these episodes the interneuron exhibited rebound activity of high-frequency spike bursts, presumably causing peptide release. The ENK-expressing interneurons innervating parvalbumin-positive interneurons might contribute to the organization of the sharp-wave/ripple episodes by decreased firing during and rebound activity after the ripple episodes, as well as to the coordination of activity between the CA1 and subicular areas during network oscillations.",
