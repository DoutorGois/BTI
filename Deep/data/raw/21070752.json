     "AB": "Dendritic spine density increases after spatial learning in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Gonadal activity also regulates spine density, and abnormally low levels of circulating estrogens are associated with deficits in hippocampus-dependent tasks. To determine if gonadal activity influences behaviorally induced structural changes in CA1, we performed a morphometric analysis on rapid Golgi-stained tissue from ovariectomized (Ovx) and sham-operated (Sham) female rats 7 days after they were given a single water maze (WM) training session (hidden platform procedure) or a swimming session in the tank containing no platform (SC). We evaluated the density of different dendritic spine types (stubby, thin, and mushroom) in three segments (distal, medial, and proximal) of the principal apical dendrite from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Performance in the WM task was impaired in Ovx animals compared to Sham controls. Total spine density increased after WM in Sham animals in the proximal and distal CA1 apical dendrite segments but not in the medial. Interestingly, mushroom spine density consistently increased in all CA1 segments after WM. As compared to the Sham group, SC-Ovx rats showed spine pruning in all the segments, but mushroom spine density did not change significantly. In Ovx rats, WM training increased the density of stubby and thin, but not mushroom spines. Thus, ovariectomy alone produces spine pruning, while spatial learning increases spine density in spite of ovariectomy. Finally, the results suggest that mushroom spine production in CA1 after spatial learning requires gonadal activity, whereas this activity is not required for mushroom spine maintenance.",
