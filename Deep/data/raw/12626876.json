     "AB": "We investigated changes of immunoreactivities of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NR) and of excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC-1), the neuronal glutamate transporter, in the vulnerable CA1 area and the less vulnerable subiculum of the gerbil hippocampus at various times following transient forebrain ischemia. At 30 min after ischemia-reperfusion, the intensity of NR immunoreactivity increased markedly in neurons of CA1 and subiculum, particularly NR2A/B, while EAAC-1 immunoreactivity was reduced in CA1. At 3 hr after reperfusion, the density of NR1 immunoreactivity markedly decreased in CA1. In contrast EAAC-1 immunoreactivity increased in CA1 and in the subiculum. At 12 hr after reperfusion, the decrease of NR1 immunoreactivity was not detected whereas EAAC-1 immunoreactivities in the CA1 area were intensified. In the subiculum, both NR subunits immunoreactivities decreased significantly, in contrast to the maintenance of EAAC-1 immunoreactivity. At 24 hr after reperfusion, both NR2A/B and EAAC-1 immunoreactivities decreased markedly in CA1 and subiculum. We tentatively suggest that the increase of NR immunoreactivity in CA1 at early times after ischemia-reperfusion may increase the delayed neuronal death, and that the increase or maintenance of EAAC-1 immunoreactivity at early times after ischemia-reperfusion may be an important factor in survival of neurons.",
