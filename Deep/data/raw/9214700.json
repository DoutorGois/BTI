     "AB": "Quantitative RNase protection assays were performed to determine the levels of muscarinic receptor subtype (m1-m5) mRNAs in rat hippocampi. Results showed that the m1, m3, and m4 subtype mRNAs were expressed at relatively high levels, but the levels of the m2 and m5 subtype were very low. Three weeks following aspiration lesions of the fimbria-fornix to produce cholinergic denervation of the hippocampus, non-M1 receptors (non-pirenzepine displaceable [3H]quinuclindinyl benzilate binding sites) in the hippocampus were increased significantly, which correlated with increases in the levels of hippocampal m3 and m4 receptor mRNAs (m3: +24% and m4: +41%). These findings indicate that multiple muscarinic receptor subtypes are expressed in the hippocampus with the m3 and m4 subtypes predominantly postsynaptic to the septohippocampal cholinergic terminals.",
