     "AB": "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are major extracellular matrix components known to tightly regulate cell behavior by interacting with tissue effectors as trophic factors and other heparin binding proteins. Alterations of GAGs structures might thus modify the nature and extent of these interactions and alter tissue integrity. Here, we studied levels and composition of GAGs isolated from adult and aged human hippocampus and investigated if their changes can influence the function of important trophic factors and the Abeta42 peptide toxicity. Biochemical analyses showed that heparan sulfates are increased in the aged hippocampus. Moreover, GAGs from aged hippocampus showed altered capacities to regulate trophic factor activities without changing their capacities to protect cells from Abeta42 toxicity, compared to adult hippocampus GAGs. Structural alterations in GAGs from elderly were suggested by differential transcripts levels of key biosynthetic enzymes. C5-epimerase and 2-OST expressions were decreased while NDST-2 and 3-OST-4 were increased; in contrast, heparanase expression was unchanged. Results suggest that alteration of GAGs in hippocampus of aged subjects could participate to tissue impairment during aging.",
