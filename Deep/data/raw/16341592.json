     "AB": "Endothelin (ETB)-receptors mediate anti-apoptotic actions. Lack of functional ETB-receptors leads to increased neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus. The increased apoptosis must be compensated by other mechanisms, however, as ETB-deficient rats display normal overall brain morphology. To illuminate on brain plasticity in ETB-receptor deficiency, we studied the expression and function of another neuroprotective system, the cannabinoid CB1-receptors, in ETB-deficient hippocampus. We show that CB1 expression in hippocampus increases postnatally in all rats but that the increase in CB1-receptor expression is significantly higher in ETB-deficient compared to wildtype littermates. Neuronal apoptosis decreases during brain maturation but remains on a significantly higher level in the ETB-deficient compared to wildtype dentate. When investigating survival of hippocampal neurons in culture, we found significant protection against hypoxia-induced cell death with CB1-analogs (noladin, (9-tetrahydrocannabinol) only in ETB-deficient neurons. We suggest that CB1-receptor upregulation in the ETB-mutant hippocampus reflects an attempt to compensate for the lack of ETB-receptors.",
