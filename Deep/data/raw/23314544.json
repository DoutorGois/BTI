     "AB": "Choline is an essential nutrient for humans. Studies in rats and mice have shown that high choline intake during gestation or the perinatal period improves cognitive function in adulthood, prevents memory decline of old age, and protects the brain from damage and cognitive and neurological deterioration associated with epilepsy and hereditary conditions such as Down's and Rett syndromes. These behavioral changes are accompanied by modified patterns of expression of hundreds of cortical and hippocampal genes including those encoding proteins central for learning and memory processing. The effects of choline correlate with cerebral cortical changes in DNA and histone methylation, thus suggesting an epigenomic mechanism of action of perinatal choline.",
