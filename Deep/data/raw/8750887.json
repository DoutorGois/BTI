     "AB": "Agrin mRNA is broadly distributed throughout the adult rat brain, consistent with its proposed role in synaptogenesis and the organization of synaptic proteins in the central nervous system. The present study examined the effect of neuronal activity on agrin mRNA expression in adult rat forebrain using the hilus lesion paradigm for seizure induction and in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction techniques for quantification and characterization of agrin mRNA content. Seizures induced rapid, prolonged, and region-specific changes in agrin mRNA expression with the most prominent alterations occurring in hippocampal and cortical neurons. However, there were no detectable perturbations in the relative abundance of alternatively spliced agrin transcripts in affected brain regions. Activity-dependent changes in agrin expression suggest a role for this protein in modifications of synaptic structure associated with functional synaptic plasticity.",
