     "AB": "The objective of this study is to investigate the neurotoxicity of drinking water fluorosis on rat hippocampus. Just weaning male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups and given 15, 30, and 60 mg/L NaF solution and distilled water, respectively, for 9 months. The fluidity of brain synaptic membrane and expression level of postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) were tested. Results showed that the fluidity of brain synaptic membrane decreased gradually with increasing of fluoride concentration, and it was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in moderate-fluoride group compared with control group, and expression level of PSD-95 was significantly decreased (P < 0.01) in moderate-fluoride group when compared with that of control group. These results indicate that decrease of synaptic membrane fluidity and PSD-95 expression level may be the molecular basis of central nervous system damage caused by fluoride intoxication; PSD-95 in CA3 region of hippocampus is probably a target molecule for fluoride.",
