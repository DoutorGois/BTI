     "AB": "The downstream targets of amyloid beta (Abeta)-oligomers remain elusive. One hypothesis is that Abeta-oligomers interrupt axonal transport. Although previous studies have demonstrated Abeta-induced transport blockade, early effects of low-n soluble Abeta-oligomers on axonal transport remain unclear. Furthermore, the cargo selectivity for such deficits (if any) or the specific effects of Abeta on the motility kinetics of transported cargoes are also unknown. Toward this, we visualized axonal transport of vesicles in cultured hippocampal neurons treated with picomolar (pm) levels of cell-derived soluble Abeta-oligomers. We examined select cargoes thought to move as distinct organelles and established imaging parameters that allow organelle tracking with consistency and high fidelity - analyzing all data in a blinded fashion. Abeta-oligomers induced early and selective diminutions in velocities of synaptic cargoes but had no effect on mitochondrial motility, contrary to previous reports. These changes were N-methyl D-aspartate receptor/glycogen synthase kinase-3beta dependent and reversible upon washout of the oligomers. Cluster-mode analyses reveal selective attenuations in faster-moving synaptic vesicles, suggesting possible decreases in cargo/motor associations, and biochemical experiments implicate tau phosphorylation in the process. Collectively, the data provide a biological basis for Abeta-induced axonal transport deficits.",
