     "AB": "Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) comprise a family of enzymes that regulate the levels of cyclic nucleotides, key second messengers that mediate a diverse array of functions. PDE2A is an evolutionarily conserved cGMP-stimulated cAMP and cGMP PDE. In the present study, the regional and cellular distribution of PDE2A in tissues of rats, mice, cynomolgus monkeys, dogs, and humans was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. A polyclonal antibody directed to the C-terminal portion of PDE2A specifically detected PDE2A by Western blotting and by immunohistochemistry. The pattern of PDE2A immunoreactivity (ir) was consistent across all species. Western blot analysis demonstrated that PDE2A was most abundant in the brain relative to peripheral tissues. PDE2A ir was heterogeneously distributed within brain and was selectively expressed in particular peripheral tissues. In the brain, prominent immunoreactivity was apparent in components of the limbic system, including the isocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, habenula, basal ganglia, and interpeduncular nucleus. Cytoplasmic PDE2A staining was prominent in several peripheral tissues, including the adrenal zona glomerulosa, neurons of enteric ganglia, endothelial cells in all organs, lymphocytes of spleen and lymph nodes, and pituitary. These studies suggest that PDE2A is evolutionarily conserved across mammalian species and support the hypothesis that the enzyme plays a fundamental role in signal transduction.",
