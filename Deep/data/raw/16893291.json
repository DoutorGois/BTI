     "AB": "The present experiments used 2 versions of a modified Hebb-Williams maze to test the role of the dorsal hippocampus (dHip) and parietal cortex (PC) in processing allocentric and egocentric space during acquisition and retention. Bilateral lesions were made to either the dHip or PC before maze testing (acquisition) or after maze testing (retention). The results indicate that lesions of the dHip impair allocentric maze acquisition, whereas lesions of the PC impair egocentric maze acquisition. During retention, lesions of the PC produced a significant impairment on both maze versions, whereas lesions of the dHip produced short-lived, transient impairments on both maze versions. These results suggest that during acquisition, the hippocampus and PC process spatial information in parallel; however, long-term retention of spatial information requires the PC with the dHIP as necessary for retrieval and/or access but not necessarily storage.",
