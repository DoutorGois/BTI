     "AB": "The concentration-response relationship of membrane currents induced by L-homocysteic acid was studied on mouse embryonic hippocampal neurons in culture (n = 56). In the majority of neurons two phases in the dose-response relationship could be distinguished. The first was characterized by responses to 3-100 microM L-homocysteic acid which desensitized with a time-constant greater than 1 s in a concentration-dependent manner and were antagonized by 30 microM D-L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid indicating activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. At higher concentrations of L-homocysteic acid this component was strongly depressed. The second phase was characterized by sustained responses that were concentration-dependent (1 mM L-homocysteic acid maximum concentration tested) and were not blocked by D-L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid indicating activation of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Eight neurons did not exhibit these two-phase characteristics in the concentration-response relationship at the beginning of the recording. The magnitude of responses to L-homocysteic acid was positively related to concentration and the responses were partially blocked by D-L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid. In these neurons, however, repeated applications of L-homocysteic acid at concentrations 30 microM up to 300 microM resulted in a long-lasting, three- to four-fold increase of the membrane current. This increase was completely blocked by D-L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (50-100 microM) suggesting that it was produced by activation of receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
