     "AB": "Several mRNAs are known to be targeted to dendrites in hippocampal neurons. In this study, we show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA has two distinct cis-acting dendritic targeting elements in the short 3' untranslated region (UTR): a constitutive element and an activity-dependent one. Moreover, deletion of serial cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE)-like sequences in the short 3'UTR suppressed both constitutive and activity-dependent dendritic targeting. In addition to the interaction with cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein-1 (CPEB-1), depolarization enhanced CPEB-1 recruitment to the activity-dependent targeting element. These results suggest that CPE-like sequences are involved in the activity-dependent as well as constitutive dendritic targeting of BDNF mRNA.",
