     "AB": "ADHD is a neuro-psychiatric disorder characterized by a developmentally inappropriate, pervasive and persistent pattern of severe inattention, hyper-activity and impulsivity. Despite onset in early childhood, ADHD may continue into adulthood with substantial impairment in social, academic and occupational functioning. A new animal model of this disorder was developed in rats with genetic deletion of the dopamine transporter (DAT) gene (dopamine transporter knockout rats; DAT-KO rats). We analyzed the behavior of DAT-KO rats for a deeper phenotypical characterization of this model. We first tested rats of the three genotypes at different ages (pre-adolescent, adolescent and adult), in a novelty-seeking test using a Black/White Box (Exp. 1). After that, we tested adult rats in a novelty-preference test using a three-chamber apparatus with different shapes (Exp. 2). Exp. 1: As evidenced by analysis of time spent in the novel environment, adult DAT heterozygous (DAT-HET) rats show an increased curiosity-driven exploration compared to wild type (WT) controls while DAT-KO rats did not recognize novelty. The locomotor activity data show a minimal difference between genotypes at adolescent age while the pre-adolescent and adult DAT-KO rats have significantly increased activity rate compared to WT and DAT-HET subjects. Exp. 2: in this case, due to more clearly evident spatial differences, time spent in novel environment was not significantly different among genotypes. During first 10 minutes, DAT-KO rats showed a decreased hyperactivity, apparently related to curiosity and attention to the new environments. In conclusion, DAT-KO rats may show inattention while more novelty-seeking traits appear in DAT-HET rats.",
