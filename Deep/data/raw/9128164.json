     "AB": "The present paper describes a new multirecording device which performs continuous electrophysiological studies on organotypic cultures. This device is formed by a card (Physiocard) carrying the culture which is inserted into an electronic module. Electrical activities are recorded by an array of 30 biocompatible microelectrodes which are adjusted into close contact with the upper surface of the slice culture. The microelectrode array is integrated into the card enabling electrical stimulation and recording of neurons over periods ranging from several hours to a few days outside a Faraday cage. Neuronal responses are recorded and analyzed by a dedicated electronic and acquisition chain. A perfusion chamber is contained in the card, allowing continuous perfusion in sterile conditions. Electrophysiological extracellular recordings and some drugs' effects obtained with this system in hippocampal slice cultures were identical to conventional electrophysiological set-up results with tetrodotoxin, bicuculline, kainate, dexamethasone and NBQX. The Physiocard system allows new insights for studies on nervous tissue and allows sophisticated approaches to be used quicker and more easily. It could be used for various neurophysiological studies or screening tests such as neural network mapping, nervous recovery, epilepsy, neurotoxicity or neuropharmacology.",
