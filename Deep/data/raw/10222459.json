     "AB": "Brains of thirteen patients with Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) were evaluated regarding the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), an enzyme involved in the synthetic pathway of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, as well as neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). The neuronal induction of COX2 was demonstrated with immunohistochemistry and Western blotting confirmed the up-regulation. Preceded by COX2 immunoreactivity, NFT-containing neurons appeared in the majority of FCMD patients without beta-amyloid deposition or senile plaques. The hippocampus did not demonstrate neurodegeneration, while, in other areas, neurons with NFT spread in a similar manner to Alzheimer's disease. NFT-bearing neurons were concomitantly shown to be immunoreactive to COX2. The precedent induction of COX2, therefore, may be related to the formation of NFT in this genetic disorder.",
