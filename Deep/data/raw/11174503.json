     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to examine the effects of chronic embolization of the umbilical circulation during late gestation on regional concentrations of quinolinic acid and kynurenic acid (neuroactive products of tryptophan catabolism) and of the astrocyte-associated glial fibrillary acidic protein in the fetal brain. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant ewes bearing fetuses with long-term catheter placement were treated daily with injections of either saline solution (n = 4; control group) or mucopolysaccharide microspheres (n = 5; embolized group) into the umbilical circulation through a femoral artery catheter between 120 and 140 days' gestation. The fetuses in the embolized group received sufficient microspheres each day to reduce and maintain the femoral arterial PO2 at < or =12 mm Hg. Autopsies were performed at 140 days' gestation to obtain the fetal brain for chemical analysis. RESULTS: Umbilical embolization resulted in nonacidemic hypoxia and hypoglycemia at 140 days' gestation. Quinolinic acid concentrations in the embolized group were significantly increased in the medulla, pons, midbrain, hypothalamus, and hippocampus, whereas kynurenic acid concentrations in the embolized group were reduced in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. There were significant reductions in glial fibrillary acidic protein contents in the occipitoparietal cortex, hippocampus, and pons in the embolized group. CONCLUSION: Placental compromise during late pregnancy had effects on kynurenine metabolism and astrocyte function in some regions of the fetal sheep brain. We suggest that these changes increase the vulnerability of the brain to asphyxial injury during late gestation and the perinatal period.",
