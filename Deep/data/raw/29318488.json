     "AB": "Neuroimaging studies have revealed brain functional abnormalities in frontal-mesolimbic regions in obesity. However, the effects of obesity on brain network topology remains largely unknown. In the current study, we employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and graph theory methods to investigate obesity-related changes in brain network topology in 26 obese patients and 28 normal weight subjects. Results revealed that the whole-brain networks of the two groups exhibited typical features of small-world topology. Obese patients showed significantly increased shortest path length (Lp) and decreased global efficiency (Eglob). Moreover, decreased nodal-degree/efficiency was found in frontal (medial orbitofrontal cortex-mOFC, rostral anterior cingulate cortex-rACC), striatal (caudate/nucleus accumbens) and limbic regions (insula, amygdala, hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus) and thalamus in obese patients. Network-based statistics showed that a sub-network, composed of 31 nodes and 30 edges, was significantly disrupted in obese patients; 29 out of 30 connections were associated with the right rACC. In the obese group, Lp and Eglob were negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI, P < 0.005), and BMI was negatively correlated with nodal-degree/efficiency of the mOFC (P < 0.001). Findings suggest disruption of the small-world organization and a global reduction of integration of functional brain networks involving the right rACC in obesity and implicating the mOFC in mediating severity.",
