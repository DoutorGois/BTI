     "AB": "A mathematical transcription of the intrinsic circuit of the CA1 region of the rat dorsal hippocampus was made and the model parameters adjusted according to experimental data from intracellular recordings and single channel kinetics. This model was able to simulate well the profile of the field potentials recorded extracellularly and the well known phenomenon of the paired-pulse depression. The results suggest that the depression of the second pulse, often interpreted in the literature as resulting from GABA(A) inhibition, can also be due to 'shunting' effects on the CA1 pyramids' membrane. The rhythmic oscillations of the field potential (EEG) was obtained as an emergent property of the network dynamics. The frequency of the field oscillation followed the main synaptic input in the region (Schaffer collaterals).",
