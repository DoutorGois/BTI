     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship of memory decline that accompanies aging with structural changes in the medial temporal lobe, in healthy middle-aged and older subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample of 35 neurologically non-diseased subjects, between 55 and 70 years of age, were examined in a 5-year follow-up study. Neuropsychological investigation included tests of learning, verbal memory, and visual memory. MRI was performed with a superconducting MRI system operating at 1.0 T, using coronal slices of T1-weighted images. Medial temporal lobe atrophy was rated separately in the neocortical, entorhinal and hippocampal regions. RESULTS: We did not find any statistically significant relationship between mild hippocampal or temporal atrophy and memory test performance. Nor did the longitudinal decline in memory show a relationship with temporal lobe atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: The main outcome of our study was that age-related memory decline was not related to mild temporal lobe atrophy in healthy subjects without mild cognitive impairment. There could be other factors influencing memory functions besides age-related structural changes in temporal lobes.",
