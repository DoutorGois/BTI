     "AB": "It was shown in the experiments on rats, that three neuropathological syndromes develop as a result of daily subthreshold picrotoxin injections (1.25 mg/kg). Maximal expression of syndromes was different during various periods of kindling. The development of seizure syndrome was followed by prevalence of enhanced electrical activity in hippocampus; the development of \"akinetic\" syndrome was the same in the caudate nuclei. Data are discussed on the positions of theory of the generator, determinant and systemic mechanisms of neuropathological syndromes.",
