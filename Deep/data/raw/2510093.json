     "AB": "The present study was designed to clarify neural circuits involved in the mediation of behavioral suppression using the Vogel type conflict procedure in rats. Among the brain nuclei inclusive of neuroanatomical substrates of behavioral suppression, lesioning of the central amygdala, mammillary body or frontal cortex led to a significant increase in the punished drinking responses. Lesion of the septum also tended to increase these responses. These results show the key role of these brain areas in mediation of behavioral suppression such as conflict behavior.",
