     "AB": "Amino acid concentrations were measured in the cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus of the mouse brain before and during seizures induced by isoniazid (250 mg/kg i.p.), an inhibitor of L-glutamate-1-decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15: GAD). Valproate sodium and diazepam dose-dependently delay the onset of convulsive fits caused by isoniazid. However, neither diazepam nor valproate prevented the decrease in GABA concentrations produced by isoniazid alone. Also, these antiepileptic drugs did not modify the rate of GABA depletion elicited by isoniazid. These results, observed in four different brain structures, strengthen those first obtained with beta-vinyllactic acid, another inhibitor of GAD.",
