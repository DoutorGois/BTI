     "AB": "Adult rats with bilateral frontal cortex lesions received intracerebral infusion of phosphatidylcholine liposomes, or D-alpha-tocopherol-enriched liposomes, delivered continuously for 7 days to the damaged cortex by subcutaneous osmotic pumps. All subjects were first tested on a delayed spatial alternation task and then, 90 days later, on a spatial navigation task in the Morris water maze. Both tests showed that brain-injured rats with alpha-tocopherol treatment were less impaired than counterparts treated with plain liposomes. Alpha-tocopherol also reduced some of the injury-induced, secondary reactive changes that typically follow damage to the frontal cortex.",
