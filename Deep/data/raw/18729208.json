     "AB": "Anosmin-1 participates in the development of the olfactory and GnRH systems. Defects in this protein are responsible for both the anosmia and the hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism found in Kallmann's syndrome patients. Sporadically, these patients also manifest some neurological symptoms that are not explained in terms of the developmental defects in the olfactory system. We describe the pattern of Anosmin-1 expression in the central nervous system during rat development using a novel antibody raised against Anosmin-1 (Anos1). The areas with Anos1-stained neurons and glial cells were classified into three groups: (1) areas with immunoreactivity from embryonic day 16 to postnatal day (P) 15; (2) areas with Anosmin-1 expression only at postnatal development; (3) nuclei with immunoreactivity only at P15. Our data show that Anos1 immunoreactivity is detected in projecting neurons and interneurons within areas of the brain that may be affected in patients with Kallmann's syndrome that develop both the principal as well as sporadic symptoms.",
