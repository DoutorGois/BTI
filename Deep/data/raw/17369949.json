     "AB": "In rats with low excitability threshold of the nervous system demonstrating significant and persistent behavioral disorders under stress conditions, the content of methylcytosine-binding protein MeCP2 in neuronal nuclei of hippocampal field CA3 decreased over 2 weeks after long-term emotional and pain stress. It was hypothesized that protein MeCP2 triggers epigenetic changes in DNA that underlie \"stress memory\".",
