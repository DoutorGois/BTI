     "AB": "We have demonstrated that chronic administration of neuropeptide FF (NPFF) into the lateral ventricle potentiated the behavioral sensitization to amphetamine. Further, the treatment with NPFF decreased the levels of serotonin, and increased the glutamate and GABA content in the medial prefrontal cortex of amphetamine-sensitized rats. The results suggest that NPFF may modulate the neuronal process of amphetamine addiction.",
