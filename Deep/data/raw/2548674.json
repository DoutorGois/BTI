     "AB": "A role for endogenous opioids in trauma-induced brain injury has been supported by pharmacological studies. The present series of experiments were initiated to extend these observations by measuring opiate receptor subtype binding in gerbil hippocampus following 7 days recovery from a 10 min ischemic insult. Quantitative in vitro autoradiography was utilized to measure mu [( 3H]DAGO), kappa [( 3H]bremazocine + 10 microM morphiceptin + 100 nM DSLET), delta [( 3H]DSLET + 10 microM morphiceptin) and lambda [( 3H]naloxone + 300 nM diprenorphine) binding. While ischemic tissue samples at the level of the dorsal hippocampus showed complete loss of CA1 pyramidal cells, we observed no significant alterations in mu or delta binding suggesting a non-pyramidal cell localization of these receptors. Kappa binding decreased significantly to 88% of control in the CA1 and CA3 regions while lambda binding in the stratum lucidum (CA3) increased to 165% of control. Our results show that opiate receptor subtypes are differentially affected by an ischemic insult.",
