     "AB": "The effect of acute and chronic administration of methamphetamine (METH) on the levels of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (arc), an effector-immediate early gene, mRNA has been investigated in rat brain using in situ hybridization. Levels of arc mRNAs in the brain regions examined increased significantly from 0.5-1 h after an acute METH (4 mg/kg) administration compared with basal levels. The increase in arc mRNA continued by 3 h, and then subsided to basal levels by 6 h. The degree of increase in arc mRNA and the peak time after METH administration varied according to brain area. Arc mRNA in cerebral cortices showed robust increase 1 h after METH administration. In the striatum and hippocampus, it showed earlier and later increase, respectively, and its degree of both was less than in the cortices. Microscopic examination revealed that the METH-induced arc mRNAs in the parietal cortex were enriched in layers IV and VI, and those in the striatum existed mainly in the medium-sized neuron. Pretreatment with either 0.5 mg/kg SCH23390 or 0.25 mg/kg MK-801 almost completely blocked the enhanced striatal arc mRNA levels induced by acute METH administration, whereas such pretreatments only partially reduced the effect of METH in the cerebral cortical regions. In the chronic treatment experiment, the arc mRNA levels of the group that received chronic treatment with METH followed by a METH challenge showed an increase like seen after acute METH administration. Since previous studies proposed that arc is one of cytoskeleton-associated proteins and is selectively localized in neural dendrites, the results of the present study suggested that arc may play an important role in the synaptic plasticity underlying METH-induced adaptational changes including behavioral sensitization.",
