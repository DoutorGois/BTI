     "AB": "The entorhinal cortex functions as the gateway to the hippocampal formation. However, its role in formation and consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory remains relatively unexplored. In this issue of Neuron, Yasuda and Mayford report an elegant cell-type restricted inducible transgenic mouse overexpressing a mutant form of CaM kinase II selectively in superficial layers of medial entorhinal cortex and its upstream regions. These animals display a selective spatial memory deficit during the immediate posttraining period as well as during acquisition in the Morris water maze. Similar to the hippocampus, this time-limited involvement of entorhinal cortex in spatial memory processing suggests a crucial role for hippocampal-entorhinal circuitry in spatial memory formation.",
