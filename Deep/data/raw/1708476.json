     "AB": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor-like immunoreactivity has been demonstrated in the normal adult human hippocampus, using minimally fixed cryostat sections obtained from snap-frozen tissue and incubated with the mouse monoclonal antibody, ME 20.4. The majority of the reactivity was associated with nerve fibre processes and their terminals. Numerous fibres were apparent in the alveus, originating from the fornix, and extending into the stratum oriens and pyramidal layer of the hippocampal formation. A more diffuse particulate reactivity, presumed to be nerve terminal, was observed around the pyramidal neurons and in the stratum radiatum, stratum lacunosum moleculare and also in the dentate fascia. The pattern of hippocampal NGF receptor immunoreactivity was broadly similar to acetylcholinesterase histochemical localization, indicating a principal localization on cholinergic axons innervating this area. Preliminary observations indicate an overall reduction in NGF receptor-immunoreactive axons and terminals in old age and Alzheimer's disease.",
