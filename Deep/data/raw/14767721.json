     "AB": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is the most widely examined neurotrophin in the experimental models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been shown to prevent the retrograde degeneration of cholinergic neurons. In this study we examined NGF and cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT) changes in several rat brain regions after excitotoxic lesion of the entorhinal cortex with quinolinic acid and tested the effect of memantine on spatial learning in the radial maze after lesion. We observed a significant increase (+26%, p=0.02) of NGF concentrations in the hippocampus of the lesioned rats when compared to sham-lesioned rats. Chronic treatment with memantine showed no significant effect on the NGF increase in the hippocampus (p=0.72). The ChAT activity was significantly increased in the lesioned rats when compared to controls (+16%, p<0.05) and did not depend on treatment with memantine. In spite of this, memantine improved performance of the radial maze. This indicates that memory improving effects of memantine observed in experimental animals and in clinical studies are probably not related to changes in brain NGF content, whereas the observed NGF increase in the denervated hippocampus is probably trauma-related reflecting impaired retrograde transport of hippocampal NGF.",
