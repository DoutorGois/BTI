     "AB": "Psychotic symptoms--delusions, delusional misidentifications and hallucinations--are observed in a variety of organic or nonorganic conditions, and are, therefore, diagnostically nonspecific. Common patholophysiologic denominators of different organic diseases may offer insights into the origin of psychotic symptoms. This article reviews some of the clinical and neuroimaging findings in organic psychoses present in various organic disorders. It attempts to extract a number of hypotheses about underlying biologic factors contributing to the development of psychotic symptoms of organic origin.",
