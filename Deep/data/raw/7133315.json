     "AB": "Sheep have been used to study the effect of dietary iodine deficiency on the development of the fetal brain. Severe iodine deficiency caused reduction in fetal brain and body weights and in brain DNA and protein from 70 days gestation to parturition. The lowered brain weight and brain DNA at 70 days gestation indicates a reduced number of cells, probably due to slower neuroblast multiplication which normally occurs from 40-80 days in the sheep, and the reduction in DNA and protein after 80 days implies that the development of neuroglia could be slowed also in iodine deficiency. Morphological changes were observed in both the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum. In the cerebral hemispheres of the iodine-deficient fetuses an increased density of neurons was apparent histologically in the motor cortex and visual cortex and in the CA1 and CA4 areas of the hippocampus in comparison with controls. In the cerebellum there was delayed migration of cells from the external granular layer to the internal granular layer and increased density of Purkinje cells in the iodine-deficient fetal brains. In addition, the molecular area was increased and the medullary area reduced in comparison with controls. These change are indicative of delayed brain maturation. Evidence of fetal hypothyroidism was provided by low fetal thyroid iodine and plasma T4 values, thyroid hyperplasia from 70 days gestation, significant reduction in body weight at the same time as the brain retardation, and absence of wool growth and delayed skeletal maturation near parturition. It is apparent from the biochemical and histological changes observed during iodine deficiency that iodine is an essential element for normal fetal brain and physical development in the sheep.",
