     "AB": "The behavioral effects of the two muscarinic antagonists scopolamine and pirenzepine were examined using a representational memory task for rats in a T-maze. Rats were pretrained to a criterion of 100% correct responses for daily sessions of 10 paired-run trials. The training procedures eliminated all neophobic or wary responses, and response times were invariably short (less than 3 s). Following the initial training sessions, guide cannulae were surgically implanted bilaterally over the hippocampus of each animal. Following recovery from surgery, animals were injected with saline (0.5 microliter to each hippocampus), scopolamine hydrobromide (0.5 microliter of a 60 mg/ml solution (30 micrograms) to each side), or pirenzepine (0.5 microliter of a 69.1 mg/ml solution (34.6 micrograms) to each side) according to a fixed schedule. Saline injections aimed between the blades of the dorsal dentate gyrus failed to produce any change in the performance of the memory task. Initial doses of scopolamine, applied to the same area, produced a decrease in the percentage of correct responses as did the initial dose of pirenzepine. In contrast to pirenzepine, scopolamine also produced increases in response times even to the point of defaulted trials (response times greater than 90 s) in some animals following drug injections. Saline injections failed to produce significant impairments on the days following scopolamine injections, although animals receiving pirenzepine injections were still impaired on the two days immediately following the initial pirenzepine injection. Subsequent doses of pirenzepine were ineffective in producing an impairment of performance while scopolamine injections were less effective than the initial dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
