     "AB": "We analyzed brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) protein content in the central nervous system (CNS) of developing and adult mice exposed to the antiretroviral agent zidovudine (AZT) during prenatal and early postnatal period. Pregnant CD-1 mice received per os twice daily AZT (160 mg/kg) or vehicle from gestation day 10 until lactation day 7. BDNF and NGF contents were measured by enzyme immunoassays in male and female offspring on day 7, 21 or 60. In AZT-exposed females, BDNF levels were significantly increased in the hippocampus (days 7 and 21), in the cortex (day 60) and in the hypothalamus (day 21), while in males AZT exposure increased BDNF in the cortex on day 21. These findings support the hypothesis that developmental AZT exposure interferes with CNS development.",
