     "AB": "Agonist binding to GABAB receptors modulates the activity of the guanine nucleotide binding proteins, Go and Gi. These G proteins are ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin and this prevents them from coupling to the GABAB receptor resulting in a reduction in high-affinity GABAB binding. GTP, which binds to a different site on the G protein alpha subunit, also reduces the affinity of the receptor for the G protein, and this can be used as a \"marker\" for G protein-GABAB receptor linkage. We have examined GABAB binding site distribution in rat brain after unilateral intrahippocampal pertussis toxin injection in vivo, and after incubating brain slices in pertussis toxin in vitro, using the technique of receptor autoradiography. The effect of pertussis toxin was compared with that of GTP gamma S on GABAB binding. Intrahippocampal pertussis toxin administration reduced GABAB but not GABAA receptor binding and the effects appeared to be limited by pertussis toxin diffusion. More widespread reductions in GABAB binding were seen after incubation of brain slices in vitro but the extent varied in different brain regions. No reduction was detected in the corpus striatum. GABAB binding was also reduced in membranes prepared from cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum but there was no significant reduction in the corpus striatum after pertussis toxin treatment. GTP gamma S reduced GABAB binding to a similar extent in all areas studied irrespective of their sensitivity to pertussis toxin suggesting that while GABAB binding sites are linked to G proteins throughout the rat brain, those in the corpus striatum may be predominantly pertussis toxin insensitive.",
