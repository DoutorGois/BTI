     "AB": "In adult rats, erythropoietin improved outcomes early and late after traumatic brain injury, associated with increased levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor. Using our model of pediatric traumatic brain injury, controlled cortical impact in 17-day old rats, we previously showed that erythropoietin increased hippocampal neuronal fraction in the first two days after injury. Erythropoietin also decreased activation of caspase3, an apoptotic enzyme modulated by Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor, and improved Novel Object Recognition testing 14days after injury. Data on long-term effects of erythropoietin on Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor expression, histology and cognitive function after developmental traumatic brain injury are lacking. We hypothesized that erythropoietin would increase Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor and improve long-term object recognition in rat pups after controlled cortical impact, associated with increased neuronal fraction in the hippocampus. METHODS: Rats pups received erythropoietin or vehicle at 1, 24, and 48h and 7days after injury or sham surgery followed by histology at 35days, Novel Object Recognition testing at adulthood, and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor measurements early and late after injury. RESULTS: Erythropoietin improved Novel Object Recognition performance and preserved hippocampal volume, but not neuronal fraction, late after injury. CONCLUSIONS: Improved object recognition in erythropoietin treated rats was associated with preserved hippocampal volume late after traumatic brain injury. Erythropoietin is approved to treat various pediatric conditions. Coupled with exciting experimental and clinical studies suggesting it is beneficial after neonatal hypoxic ischemic brain injury, our preliminary findings support further study of erythropoietin use after developmental traumatic brain injury.",
