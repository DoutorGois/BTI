     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of the Chinese compound prescription Chaihu Shugan Tang (CHSGT) on the excitability in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (different brain regions) of pentetrazole (PTZ)-kindled chronic epileptic rats. METHOD: To establish the model of chronic kindling rats intraperitoneal injected with pentylenetet. Fully kindled rats were randomized into control and experimental groups for intragastric administration of normal saline (control, model), Sodium Valproate and CHSGT at the high, medium and low doses for 4 consecutive weeks. The content of 2-NBDG, the glutamate (Glu) and the aspartate (Asp) in different brain regions of rats were detected by fluorescence imaging techniques and HPLC assay respectively. RESULT: CHSGT at the high, medium and low doses all significantly decreased the content of 2-NBDG, the Glu and the Asp in different brain regions of chronic epileptic rats (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: CHSGT can inhibit the excitability in different brain regions of PTZ-induced epileptic rats, by decreasing the level of excitatory neurotransmitter maybe one of its antiepileptic mechanisms.",
