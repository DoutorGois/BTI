     "AB": "A 256-channel integrated interface for simultaneous recording of distributed neural activity from acute brain slices is presented. An array of 16 times 16 Au recording electrodes are fabricated directly on the die. Each channel implements differential voltage acquisition, amplification and band-pass filtering. In-channel analog memory stores an electronic image of neural activity. A 3 mm times 4.5 mm integrated prototype fabricated in a 0.35-mum CMOS technology is experimentally validated in single-channel extracellular in vitro recordings from the hippocampus of mice and in multichannel simultaneous recordings in a controlled environment.",
