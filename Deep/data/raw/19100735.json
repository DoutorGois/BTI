     "AB": "In rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) undergo a paired-pulse depression (PPD) by the second of two pulses, with inter-pulse intervals of 100-2000 ms, applied to the stratum radiatum. While GABA-C receptors are described in the CA1 area, their functional significance is unknown. In this study, the involvement of GABA-C receptors in PPD was examined using an in vitro hippocampal slice preparation. IPSCs evoked by stimulations in stratum radiatum were recorded with patch pipettes from CA1 pyramidal cells. PPD, when induced in the above fashion, was blocked by the GABA-C receptor antagonist (1,2,5,6-Tetrahydropyridin-4-yl) methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA, 10 muM, applied in the superfusing medium). GABA-A and GABA-B receptor-mediated IPSCs, as well as the baclofen-induced suppression of the GABA-A receptor mediated IPSC, were not antagonized by TPMPA (10-20 muM). These results indicate that PPD of the IPSC is mediated by the activation of GABA-C receptors.",
