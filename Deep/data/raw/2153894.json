     "AB": "Carboxypeptidase H is an exopeptidase which is highly specific for C-terminal basic amino acids and thought to play a role in neuropeptide biosynthesis. The distribution of carboxypeptidase H mRNA was examined in adult rat brain using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Enzyme transcripts were detected in all major brain areas. Very high levels of carboxypeptidase H mRNA were found in the hippocampus associated with pyramidal cells. Other brain regions showed varied levels of labelling, ranging from high levels in the magnocellular cells of hypothalamic nuclei to very low levels in the striatum. The appearance of enzyme transcripts throughout brain supports a role for this enzyme in the biosynthesis of many neuropeptides. The expression of transcripts in certain ventricular ependymal cells identified them as a new potential peptidergic cell type. The variations in levels of expression of carboxypeptidase H mRNA may reflect differences in peptidergic activity in different neuronal systems.",
