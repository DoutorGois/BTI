The authors studied the morphology of CalbindinD28K (CaBp) immunoreactive cells and processes in the hippocampal formation and the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenics using the immunohistochemical technique of avidin-biotin-complex method (ABC method), and the results were compared with those from normal human brains. 2. In the hippocampal formation area CA2 of schizophrenics, many CaBp-immunopositive cell bodies and fibers were disordered in their arrangement compared to normal control brains. 3. In the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) of schizophrenics, many immunopositive cell bodies were exhibited irregular axis arrangement and fiber disarray. 4. The altered distribution pattern of CaBp-immunopositive structures in the hippocampal formation and the prefrontal cortex might indicate the existence of GABA(gamma-aminobutyric acid)ergic dysfunction in the brain of schizophrenic patients.",
