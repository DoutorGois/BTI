     "AB": "The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to be upregulated in acute hypoxia. Although an increase in blood vessel number has been described in severe chronic brain hypoxia, it is unclear whether VEGF is upregulated in this condition. We therefore investigated male inbred Wistar rats, which were exposed for 9 to 13 weeks to decreasing amounts of oxygen, down to 7% O2 (15%: 15 days; 12%, 10%, respectively; 8%: 1 day, 3 weeks, respectively; 7%: 4 weeks). The expression of VEGF was studied by Northern analysis and in situ hybridization in frozen sections of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum in six chronic hypoxic and two control rats. We found a marked upregulation of VEGF mRNA in all brain regions investigated, being strongest in cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Our results suggest a potential role of VEGF for vascular growth and vascular permeability observed in chronic cerebral hypoxia.",
