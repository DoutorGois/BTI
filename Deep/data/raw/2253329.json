     "AB": "The septal neurons were cultured under the following conditions: (1) treated with 7S nerve growth factor (NGF) (50 ng/ml); (2) grown with hippocampal cell-conditioned medium supernatant; (3) cocultivated with hippocampal cells; (4) cocultivated with cerebellar cells; (5) no treatment. Acetylcholinesterase histochemistry was used to identify cholinergic cells after pretreatment with diisopropylfluorophosphate. The mean values of the perikaryal major axis and minor axis at day 14 of culture were significantly larger in septal cells cocultivated with hippocampal cells than in septal cells grown under other conditions. NGF-treated septal cells showed a smaller, but significant, increase in the mean value of the major axis of these neurons.",
