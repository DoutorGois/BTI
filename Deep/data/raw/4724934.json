     "AB": "Sensory events and the representation of past experience cause distinctive changes in the electrical activity of widespread regions of the brain. These regions have similar roles in the engram in the sense that they all seem to participate in responses to external events and in subsequent representations of these events. However, the relative contribution of these processes to the activity of different brain regions is quantitatively different, in that some regions are much more strongly affected than others. These results may constitute the basis for reconciliation of localizationist and antilocalizationist views of brain function.",
