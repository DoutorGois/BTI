     "AB": "Neurotensin (NT) is a tridecapeptide distributed in central and peripheral nervous systems, which can behave as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator at central and peripheral levels. Herein we tested the potential effect of this peptide on quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]-QNB) binding to muscarinic receptor in rat CNS membranes. It was observed that NT decreased up to 50-70% ligand binding at 1x10(-7) M-1x10(-5) M concentration in cerebral cortex, cerebellum and striatum. In the hippocampus, NT exerted a biphasic effect, behaving as a stimulator in the presence of 1x10(-12) M-1x10(-10) M concentration but as an inhibitor at 1x10(-8) M-1x10(-5) M concentration. In order to test the involvement of high-affinity NT receptor (NTS1) in NT inhibitory effect, assays were carried out in the presence of 1x10(-6) M NT and/or SR 48692 (Sanofi-Aventis, U.S., Inc.), a specific antagonist for this receptor, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) 10% v/v. As controls, membranes incubated with DMSO and/or NT 1x10(-6) M plus DMSO were processed. It was found that NT+DMSO decreased [3H]-QNB binding to cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampal membranes by 49%, 32% and 53%, respectively. This inhibition was not observed with the DMSO control group. Membrane preincubation with 1x10(-6) M SR 48692 failed to alter NT effect on binding. SR 48692 at 1x10(-6) M concentration decreased the binding by 50% only in cerebral cortex membranes, suggesting a possible direct effect of the antagonist on muscarinic receptors in this area. It was therefore concluded that the high-affinity NT receptor may not be involved in ligand binding inhibition to muscarinic receptor by NT.",
