Changes in ultrastructure of myelin fibres in these formations were found which exposed unequally in different regions and depended on the experiment duration. In 40 days hypokinezia changes were noted only in hippocampus and cingular cortex, while in neocortex they were prominent only in 90-days hypokinisia. Moreover, in neocortex changes were different in large and fine fibres, being more prominent in the former.",
