     "AB": "This study addressed the role of the medial temporal lobe regions and, more specifically, the contribution of the human hippocampus in memory for body-centered (egocentric) and environment-centered (allocentric) spatial location. Twenty-one patients with unilateral atrophy of the hippocampus secondary to long-standing epilepsy (left, n = 7; right, n = 14) and 15 normal control participants underwent 3 tasks measuring recall of egocentric or allocentric spatial location. Patients with left hippocampal sclerosis were consistently impaired in the allocentric conditions of all 3 tasks but not in the egocentric conditions. Patients with right hippocampal sclerosis were impaired to a lesser extent and in only 2 of the 3 tasks. It was concluded that hippocampal structures are crucial for allocentric, but not egocentric, spatial memory.",
