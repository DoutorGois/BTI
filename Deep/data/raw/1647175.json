     "AB": "In vitro phosphorylation of multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) converts it to a form that is independent of Ca2+. We demonstrate that significant Ca(2+)-independent CaM kinase activity is present in untreated hippocampal slices. Two manipulations that produce a long-lasting enhancement of neuronal activity in hippocampal slices, elevated extracellular Ca2+ or depolarization with high K+, generate additional Ca(2+)-independent activity. This increase is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and is correlated with an increased phosphorylation of CaM kinase. In contrast, CaM kinase in posterior pituitary, a brain structure that is not thought to be involved in memory-related processes, is not modulated by depolarization. These results suggest that the Ca(2+)-independent form of CaM kinase may modulate neuronal activity in the hippocampus.",
