     "AB": "The binding of the adenosine A2A receptor selective agonist 2-[4-(2-p-carboxyethyl)phenylamino] -5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS 21680) to the rat hippocampal and cerebral cortical membranes was studied and compared with that to striatal membranes. [3H] CGS 21680, in the concentration range tested (0.2-200 nM), bound to a single site with a Kd of 58 nM and a Bmax of 353 fmol/mg protein in the hippocampus, and with a Kd of 58 nM and a Bmax of 264 fmol/mg protein in the cortex; in the striatum, the single high-affinity [3H] CGS 21680 binding site had a Kd of 17 nM and a Bmax of 419 fmol/mg protein. Both guanylylimidodiphosphate (100 microM) and Na+ (100 mM) reduced the affinity of [3H] CGS 21680 binding in the striatum by half and virtually abolished [3H] CGS 21680 binding in the hippocampus and cortex. The displacement curves of [3H] CGS 21680 binding with 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX), N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) and 2-chloroadenosine (CADO) were biphasic in the hippocampus and cortex as well as in the striatum. The predominant [3H]CGS 21680 binding site in the striatum (80%) had a pharmacological profile compatible with A2A receptors and was also present in the hippocampus and cortex, representing 10-25% of [3H]CGS 21680 binding. The predominant [3H]CGS 21680 binding site in the hippocampus and cortex had a pharmacological profile distinct from A2A receptors: the relative potency order of adenosine antagonists DPCPX, 1,3-dipropyl- 8- inverted question mark4-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]carbonylmethyl- oxyphenyl inverted question mark xanthine (XAC), 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine (CSC), and (E)-1,3-dipropyl-8-(3,4-dimethoxystyryl)- methylxanthine (KF 17,837) as displacers of [3H] CGS 21680 (5 nM) binding in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was DPCPX > XAC >> CSC approximately KF 17,837, and the relative potency order of adenosine agonists CHA, NECA, CADO, 2-[(2-aminoethylamino)carbonylethylphenylethylamino]-5'-N- ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (APEC), and 2-phenylaminoadenosine (CV 1808) was CHA approximately NECA > or = CADO > APEC approximately CV1808 > CGS 21680. In the presence of DPCPX (20 nM), [3H] CGS 21680 (0.2-200 nM) bound to a site (A2A-like) with a Kd of 20 nM and a Bmax of 56fmol/mg protein in the hippocampus and with a Kd of 22 nM and a Bmax of 63fmol/mg protein in the cortex. In the presence of CSC (200 nM), [3H]CGS 21680(0.2-200 nM) bound to a second high-affinity site with a Kd of 97 nM and a Bmax of 255 fmol/mg protein in the hippocampus and with a Kd of 112 nM and a Bmax of 221 fmol/mg protein in the cortex. Two pharmacologically distinct [3H]CGS 21680 binding sites were found in synaptosomal membranes of the hippocampus and cortex and in the striatum, one corresponding to A2A receptors and the other to the second high-affinity [3H]CGS 21680 binding site. In contrast, the pharmacology of [3H]CHA binding was similar in synaptosomal membranes of the three brain areas. The present results establish the existence of at least two high-affinity [3H]CGS 21680 binding sites in the CNS and demonstrate that the [3H]CGS 21680 binding site predominant in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex has different binding characteristics from the classic A2A adenosine receptor, which predominates in the striatum.",
