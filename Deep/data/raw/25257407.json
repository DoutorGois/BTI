     "AB": "Correlation dependencies between nociceptive sensitivity and cytokine level in biological tissues of rats were studied on days 1 and 7 after antigenic stimulation due to intraperitoneal injection of LPS (30 mug/kg). No correlations were found between the nociceptive thresholds and cytokine contents in the dorsal hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex of animals. Inverse correlations between the tail-flick latency in response to nociceptive stimulation and concentrations of an anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in the peripheral blood of rats were revealed on day 7 after LPS injection. These animals were characterized by the following inverse correlations between the blood level of proinflammatory cytokines and baseline parameters of nociceptive sensitivity: IL-4 and latency of the tail-flick response; and IL-10 and vocalization threshold. The appearance of significant correlations between immune and nociceptive parameters in rats was shown to coincide with pronounced changes in the perceptual and emotional components of nociception in animals during antigenic stimulation. The formation of close interrelations between nociceptive sensitivity and immune processes in this period probably contributes to the systemic response to antigenic stimulation. Our results complement previous data on the relationship between individual immune reactivity and type of nociceptive reactions in mammals.",
