     "AB": "The homeostatic maintenance of the \"modification threshold\" for inducing long-term potentiation (LTP) is a fundamental feature of the Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) model of synaptic plasticity. In the present study, two key features of the modification threshold, its heterosynaptic expression and its regulation by postsynaptic neural activity, were tested experimentally in the dentate gyrus of awake, freely moving rats. Conditioning stimulation ranging from 10 to 1,440 brief 400-Hz trains, when applied to medial perforant path afferents, raised the threshold for LTP induction heterosynaptically in the neighboring lateral perforant path synapses. This effect recovered slowly over a 7- to 35-day period. The same conditioning paradigms, however, did not affect the reversal of long-term depression. The inhibition of LTP by medial-path conditioning stimulation was N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent, but antidromic stimulation of the granule cells could also inhibit lateral path LTP induction, independently of NMDA receptor activation. Increased calcium buffering is a potential mechanism underlying the altered LTP threshold, but the levels of two important calcium-binding proteins did not increase after conditioning stimulation, nor was de novo protein synthesis required for generating the threshold shift. These data confirm, in an in vivo model, two key postulates of the BCM model regarding the LTP threshold. They also provide further evidence for the broad sensitivity of synaptic plasticity mechanisms to the history of prior activity, i.e., metaplasticity.",
