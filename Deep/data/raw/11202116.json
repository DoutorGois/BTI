     "AB": "The authors investigated the cerebral projection of the vestibular system, using positron emission tomography, in right-handed subjects. Both sided cold caloric stimulation was used in every volunteer (n = 6). A detailed map of activated and deactivated brain regions is included. This portrays changes caused by vestibular stimulation. The contralaterally activated regions according to the stimulation side were: postcentral gyrus, transvers temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, posterior part of the insula, claustrum, putamen, inferior parietal lobule, precentral gyrus, premotor cortex, cingulate gyrus. The ipsilaterally activated regions were: transvers temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, posterior part of the insula. There was no hemispherial dominance. The activated regions partially correspond with previous results in the literature. It would like to be pointed out the Brodmann 6 region as the cortical manifestation of involuntary isometric tightening of muscles. The contralaterally deactivated regions were: inferior, superior and medius temporal gyrus, medial and medius frontal gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus. Ipsilaterally deactivated regions were: superior and medial frontal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, fusiform and inferior occipital gyrus. There was prominent hemispherial dominance in the stimulated, ipsilateral side. The deactivation based functional connection between the hippocampus and the vestibular system was pointed out in such a relation for the first time in this report.",
