     "AB": "1. The choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase activities in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and muscarinic binding in the cerebral cortex did not differ significantly between male and female Wistar rats. 2. Choline acetyltransferase activities in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rats were not altered during ageing. 3. Acetylcholinesterase activities in these same brain areas were markedly decreased during ageing, possibly reflecting a loss of postsynaptic enzyme activity. 4. When measured using 3H-pirenzepine, binding to the postsynaptic muscarinic receptors was slightly higher in 26-month-old rats than in 12-month-old rats; total muscarinic binding measured using 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate did not alter during ageing. 5. The present study does not support the hypothesis that in the rat brain the number of postsynaptic muscarinic binding sites decreases during ageing.",
