     "AB": "The influence of the chronic administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.05 mg/kg, s.c.) and the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist NAN-190 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) alone or in combination with 17beta-estradiol (0.5 microg per animal, i.m.) for 14 days on the depression behavior and the monoamine level in hippocampus has been studied in adult ovariectomized (OVX) female rats. The model of depression in rats was realized under the Porsolt test conditions. The levels of monoamine and its metabolites were determined using HPLC. It was established that the chronic administration of 8-OH-DPAT alone produces an antidepressant effect in OVX rats. The chronic administration of 8-OH-DPAT in combination with 17beta-estradiol potentiated the antidepressant action of both preparations. The antidepressant effect of 8-OH-DPAT in OVX rats was correlated with the restoration of noradrenergic, serotoninergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus. The obtained data are indicative of a close interaction between the ovarian hormonal system and the cerebral serotoninergic system in the realization of depression mechanisms.",
