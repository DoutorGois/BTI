     "AB": "Measurements of the presynaptic fiber volley (PSFV), the population excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), and the extracellular pH in the dendritic CA1 layer of rat hippocampal slices were used to evaluate the effects of lactacidosis on central synaptic transmission. Replacement of NaCl with sodium lactate (up to 30 mM) was found not to affect the PSFV; however, the EPSP was reversibly suppressed. Sodium citrate, with added CaCl2 to adjust for Ca2+ chelation, had the same effect as sodium lactate. Addition of lactic acid influenced the PSFV only when, at a concentration of 30 mM, the extracellular pH dropped to 6.6 or lower. With lactic acid concentrations of up to 20 mM, which produced pH levels of 6.8 in the slice, effects on the EPSP were reversible. However, 30 mM lactic acid suppressed both the PSFV and EPSP irreversibly. These results show that synaptic transmission is much more susceptible to lactacidosis than presynaptic axonal transmission. They also show that high levels of lactate, albeit causing suppression of synaptic transmission, do not cause irreversible damage. However, acidosis associated with lactic acid release may damage synaptic transmission irreversibly.",
