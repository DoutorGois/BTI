     "AB": "Neural stem cells (NSC) from the adult hippocampus easily lose their activity in vitro. Efficient in vitro expansion of adult hippocampus-derived NSC is important for generation of tools for research and cell therapy. Here, we show that a single copy disruption or pharmacological inhibition of p38alpha enables successful long-term neurosphere culture of adult mouse hippocampal cells. Expanded neurospheres with high proliferative activity differentiated into the three neuronal lineages under differentiating conditions. Thus, inhibition of p38alpha can maintain adult hippocampal NSC activity in vitro.",
