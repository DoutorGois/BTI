     "AB": "The median raphe nucleus is involved in controlling and maintaining hippocampal activity through its projection to inhibitory neurons in medial septum and hippocampus. It has been shown that anterogradely axonal-traced fibers originating in the median raphe nucleus project onto calbindin-containing neurons in hippocampus and parvalbumin-containing neurons in medial septum. Parallel immunohistochemistry studies showing serotonin fibers contacting calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neurons have led to the assumption that raphe fibers projecting on these types of neurons are mainly serotonergic. However, in both dorsal and median raphe nucleus there is a large amount of non-serotonergic neurons which also are projecting neurons, indicating that a part of the raphe fibers projecting to hippocampus and septum may be non-serotonergic. Our aim was to determine whether there is a non-serotonergic projection from the raphe nucleus onto calbindin- and parvalbumin-containing neurons in hippocampus and septum. Biotin dextran amine was used as the anterograde neuronal tracer and injected into either dorsal or median raphe nucleus. By use of triple immunofluorescence-labeling we analyzed the serotonergic content of the biotin dextran amine-labeled fibers contacting parvalbumin- and calbindin-positive neurons. Surprisingly, we found a significant non-serotonergic projection from both dorsal and median raphe nuclei onto calbindin- and parvalbumin-containing interneurons in septum and hippocampus, with a preference in hippocampus for projecting onto calbindin-positive neurons. These results indicate that the raphe nuclei may exert their control on hippocampal and septal activity not only through a serotonergic projection, but also through a significant non-serotonergic pathway.",
