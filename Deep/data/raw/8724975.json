     "AB": "Although extracellular matrix (ECM) components have been shown to play important roles in the development of the CNS, expression generally decreases in the adult brain. This study examines the expression of the SPARC-related glycoprotein SC1 in the rat brain during postnatal development and in the adult. In situ hybridization analysis indicates that expression of SC1 mRNA increases in a caudal to rostral manner as postnatal neural development proceeds and is found at near maximal levels in the adult brain. SC1 mRNA is expressed in glial-enriched areas of the brain at postnatal day 1 (P1) and P5. Between P10 and P20, SC1 mRNA increases in neuron-enriched regions of the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and cerebral cortex. Immunohistochemistry in the adult shows that SC1 protein is localized to neurons in these regions and to scattered glial cells. Subcellular fractionation demonstrates that the SC1 116/120 kDa doublet is associated with synaptosomes. SC1 is present in the aqueous phase following extraction of membranes with TX-114, suggesting that it is not a transmembrane protein, a property consistent with other adult brain ECM components. Furthermore in cerebellar granule cells grown in culture, high levels of the 120 kDa component are secreted into the media. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that SC1 is an ECM glycoprotein expressed in both the developing and adult brain.",
