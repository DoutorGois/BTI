     "AB": "This paper describes the use of a computational tool based on the Morlet wavelet transform to investigate the interaction dynamics between oscillations generated by two anatomically distinct neuronal populations. The tool uses cross wavelet transform, coherence, bi-spectrum/bi-coherence and phase synchronization. Using specimen data recorded from the hippocampus of a rat with experimentally induced focal epilepsy, linear and non-linear correlations between neuronal oscillations in the CA1 and CA3 regions have been computed. The results of this real case study show that the computational tool can successfully analyse and quantify the temporal interactions between neuronal oscillators and could be employed to investigate the mechanisms underlying epilepsy.",
