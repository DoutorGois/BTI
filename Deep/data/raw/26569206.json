     "AB": "The anti-inflammatory activity of auraptene (AUR), a citrus coumarin, in peripheral tissues is well-known, and we previously demonstrated that AUR exerts anti-inflammatory effects in the ischemic brain; the treatment of mice with AUR for eight days immediately after ischemic surgery suppressed demise and neuronal cell death in the hippocampus, possibly through its anti-inflammatory effects in the brain. We suggested that these effects were at least partly mediated by the suppression of inflammatory mediators derived from astrocytes. The present study showed that (1) AUR, as a pretreatment for five days before and another three days after ischemic surgery, suppressed microglial activation, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression in astrocytes, and COX-2 mRNA expression in the hippocampus; (2) AUR suppressed the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of COX-2 mRNA and the mRNA of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cultured astrocytes; (3) AUR was still detectable in the brain 60 min after its intraperitoneal administration. These results support our previous suggestion that AUR directly exerts anti-inflammatory effects on the brain.",
