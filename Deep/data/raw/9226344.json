     "AB": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats given electrolytic lesions of the septum followed by a single intraseptal injection of 5 microg of NGF were trained on a water maze task that assessed their ability to learn the location of a visible platform and the location of platform when it was submerged. Rats with damage to the septum acquired the visible platform version of the task but were significantly impaired in locating the submerged platform. Administration of NGF, however, produced an intermediate ameliorative effect on the measure of latency to find the hidden platform during these trials. In order to determine the relative strength of the place and cue responses learned during the visible and hidden platform training trials, a probe trial was given on the final test day in which the visible platform was moved to a new location. Control rats swam either to the new platform location or the old platform location indicating the use of both a place and cue response. However, both rats with septal damage alone and rats with septal lesions treated with NGF swam directly to the new platform location indicating the relative strength of the cue response. These results support previous findings indicating that a single injection of NGF can produce improvements on a cognitive task, but it may not be doing so by restoring lost spatial functions following septohippocampal damage.",
