     "AB": "This study was undertaken to investigate the protective effects and potential mechanism of testosterone (T) on cognitive performance in adult male rats given bilateral intrahippocampal injections of beta amyloid 1-42 oligomers (Abeta1-42) combined with gonadectomy (Abeta+GDX). A series of experiments were designed to verify the optimal administration time and dose of T and to explore its potential protective mechanisms on spatial ability in Abeta+GDX rats in the Morris water maze test. Abeta1-42 was injected only once two weeks before testing, while T and the androgen receptor (AR) antagonist flutamide (F) were administered daily beginning 2 days before and throughout the 6 days of testing. The Abeta1-42 injection and GDX individually impaired cognitive performance, and the combination of these treatments was additive, leading to even greater impairment. The serum T level peaked at 48 h after administration. T doses ranging from 0.25 to 1.00 mg corresponding to serum T levels of 4.5-21.35 ng/ml improved the spatial ability. Animals administered 0.75 mg of T corresponding to the serum T level of 15.2 ng/ml had the most significantly improved behavioral performances. However, higher T doses of 1.50 and 2.00 mg resulting in serum T levels of 34.8 and 45 ng/ml, respectively, impaired the behavioral performances. F had no effect on the serum T level and spatial ability, but it blocked the activational effect of T. These findings indicate that the effect of T on behavioral performances is partly mediated through ARs.",
