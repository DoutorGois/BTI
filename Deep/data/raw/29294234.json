     "AB": "The objective of this study was to determine the relation between the chronic consumption of garlic powder in combination with high-fat diet (HFD) on long term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of rat hippocampus. Male rats were divided to 4 groups, control with the standard diet, control with a standard diet plus garlic, high-fat diet (HFD) group and high-fat diet with garlic. Following 6 months of controlled dietary in each experimental group, the rats were anesthetized with i.p. injection of ketamine and xylazin (100 and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively), and placed into a stereotaxic apparatus for surgery, electrode implantation and field potential recording. The population spike (PS) amplitude and slope of excitatory post synaptic potentials (EPSP) were measured in the DG area of adult rats in response to stimulation applied to the perforant path (PP) (by 400 Hz tetanization). The results showed that garlic increased EPSP slope and PS amplitude respect to HFD group. It was suggested that the garlic powder administration could attenuate the deteriorating effect of HFD on in vivo hippocampal LTP in the granular cells of the DG.",
