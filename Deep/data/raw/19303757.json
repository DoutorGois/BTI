     "AB": "In order to be able to test single constituents of herbal plant extracts with respect to possible clinical usefulness, the model of local field potential analysis leading to the so-called electropharmacogram has been successfully used in rats to classify the effects of theanine and theogallin in the past. The present investigation aims at the prediction of efficacy and possible mechanisms of action of rutin and quercetin. Adult rats (day-night converted) were instrumented with four bipolar concentric electrodes into the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and reticular formation. Field potentials were recorded during a pre-drug reference period of 45 min followed by oral administration of the particular test compound and 4h recording thereafter. Data were transmitted wirelessly to the computer for spectral frequency analysis. Rutin (5-80 mg/kg) as well as quercetin (5-40 mg/kg orally) produced similar electropharmacograms with dose dependent decreases of spectral alpha2 and beta1 frequencies within all brain areas. Peak effects were reached 4h after administration. The pattern of changes approached that obtained after 2.5mg/kg of moclobemide during the first hour as revealed by discriminant analysis in comparison to a large matrix of other drugs with known clinical indications. Data suggest antidepressant capabilities for rutin and quercetin with inhibition of monoamino oxidase at least as part of the mechanism of action. Both compounds should be tested clinically in patients with symptoms of depression.",
