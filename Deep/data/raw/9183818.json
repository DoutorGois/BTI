     "AB": "A complete and selective destruction of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons projecting to the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus was induced in the rat by the toxin 192 IgG-saporin. Using electrophysiologic techniques, we have investigated the consequences of this cholinergic denervation on inhibitory and excitatory synaptic responses of CA1 pyramidal cells in rat hippocampal slices ex vivo. Histochemical experiments were performed in slices from control and 192 IgG-saporin-treated rats to check the efficacy of the intracerebroventricular injection of the immunotoxin. Stimulation of stratum radiatum elicits a glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials followed by a biphasic GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). No significant change in IPSP was observed in 192 IgG-saporin-treated rats. By contrast, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and to a lesser extent the non-NMDA components of the glutamatergic response were potentiated in these animals. The possible pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of this potentiation were discussed.",
