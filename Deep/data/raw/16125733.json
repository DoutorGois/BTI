     "AB": "Neurotoxicity in rat cortex and hippocampus following acute methamphetamine administration was characterized and compared to changes following traumatic brain injury. Doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg of methamphetamine produced significant increases in calpain- and caspase-cleaved alpha II-spectrin and tau protein fragments, suggesting cell injury or death. Changes in proteolytic products were significantly increased over vehicle controls. Use of fragment specific biomarkers detected prominent calpain-mediated protein fragments in the cortex and hippocampus while caspase-mediated protein fragments were also detected in the hippocampus. Remarkably, proteolytic product increases at the 40 mg/kg dose after 24 h were as high as those observed in experimental traumatic brain injury. Use of calpain and caspase proteolytic inhibitors may be useful in preventing methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.",
