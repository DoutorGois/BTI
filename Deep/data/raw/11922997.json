     "AB": "In mammals, the pallial amygdala is implicated in emotional learning and memory, whereas the hippocampus is involved in spatial, contextual, or relational memory. This review presents a set of experiments aimed to study the involvement of the dorsomedial and dorsolateral telencephalon of goldfish in spatial and active avoidance learning. Results showed that (1) medial lesions impaired both acquisition and retention of conditioned avoidance response in two-way active avoidance learning experiments with stimuli overlapping (emotional factor) and with an interstimuli gap (temporal and emotional factors), and (2) the medial lesion did not affect spatial learning (spatial, contextual, or relational factors). In contrast, lateral lesions did not impair conditioned avoidance response with stimuli overlapping, but affected conditioned avoidance response with an interstimuli gap and spatial learning. These results support the presence of two differentiated memory systems in teleost fish based on discrete pallial regions: emotional (dorsomedial telencephalon) and spatial/temporal or relational (dorsolateral telencephalon). Furthermore, these functional data support the homology between the medial pallium of the teleost and the pallial amygdala of land vertebrates, and between the teleost lateral pallium and the mammalian hippocampus.",
