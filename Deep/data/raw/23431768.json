     "AB": "Gluco- and mineralocorticoid receptors are believed to play important roles in mechanisms of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) regulation, neuronal death/survival, as well as learning and memory processes. Imbalanced levels of MR and GR result in impairment of HPA activity and can promote neuronal injury and loss following exposures to extreme factors. In the present study, using quantitative immunohistochemistry, the comparative analysis of the effects of hypobaric hypoxia in several modes on expression profiles of GR and MR in dorsal (CA1) and ventral (dentate gyrus) hippocampus was performed. According to the data obtained, severe injurious hypoxia induced prominent disturbances of GR and MR expression in the cells of CA1 and dentate gyrus that correlated to the remarkable neuronal injury/loss in CA1 and dysregulated HPA activity. Sets of three- or six-trial (but not one-trial) preconditioning using mild hypoxia prior to severe hypoxia prevented these abnormalities.",
