     "AB": "The effect of lead exposure on taurine-induced long-term potentiation (LTP(TAU)) was examined and compared with high-frequency stimulation-induced one (LTP(HFS)). Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) and fiber volley (FV) in area CA1 of hippocampal slice were recorded in control and lead-exposed rats. In contrast to the inhibitory effects of lead exposure on LTP(HFS), the amplitude of LTP(TAU) in the lead-exposed rats (199.3+/-13.7%, n=12) was significantly larger than that in controls (152.3+/-17.0%, n=12). It was also observed that taurine induced greater FV potentiation in lead-exposed rats (162.6+/-9.0%, n=10) than controls (132.1+/-6.9%, n=11). In addition, after a previous HFS, sequent perfusion of taurine could further increase the synaptic efficacy in lead-exposed rats. These results provide the first evidence that chronic lead exposure has opposite effects on the two types of LTP resulting from different lead toxicity sites.",
