     "AB": "The experiments were conducted on rabbits with chronically implanted electrodes (neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus). The rostral part of caudate nucleus was stimulated once daily at a current maximum 300 microA, using 60 Hz square pulses (1.0 Ms) 12.0 s in duration. The severity of motor seizures and its developmental velocity were studied in the relation with a degree of the epileptization of the brain. The data obtained illustrated the next relation: the more stable and intensive were discharges in hippocampus the harder motor seizures.",
