     "AB": "By means of local administration of tetrodotoxin (TTX) a fully reversible functional inactivation of rat's ventral hippocampus (VH) was obtained in order to characterize the role of this structure in the memorization of a conditioned passive avoidance response (PAR). In Experiment 1, on permanently cannulated animals, TTX (10 ng in 1.0 microl saline) or saline (1.0 microl) was injected uni- or bilaterally in the VH, respectively, 1 h before PAR acquisition, immediately after PAR acquisition, and 1 h before PAR retrieval, always performed 48 h after the acquisition trial. It was shown that both pre-acquisition and pre-retrieval VH uni- or bilateral blockades were followed by significant PAR retention impairment, while in post-acquisition only the bilateral blockade determined PAR retention impairment. In Experiment 2, on three different groups of rats, TTX (10 ng in 1 microl saline) was bilaterally administered, under general ketamine anesthesia (100 mg/kg b.w.), into the VH at different post-acquisition delays (0.25, 1.5, 6 h). Retrieval testing, 48 h after treatment, showed that post-acquisition bilateral VH blockade caused PAR impairment only when performed 0.25 h after acquisition. The results clearly indicate a role of VH during acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of PAR engram. The experimental evidence is discussed in comparison to previous results concerning TTX dorsal hippocampus blockade effects on rat's PAR and in relation to hippocampal connectivity with the medial septal area and the amygdala.",
