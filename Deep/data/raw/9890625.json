     "AB": "The role of ensheathing cells, a macroglial cell type with a unique presence in the olfactory system, in the outgrowth of olfactory receptor cell neurites was explored in vitro. Glial cell cultures harvested from both the olfactory bulb nerve layer and the hippocampus were established and immunocytochemically characterized. The expression of the p75 low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor by ensheathing cells was used to distinguish them from other macroglial subpopulations. Results indicated that ensheathing cell cultures were approximately 80% pure. Olfactory receptor cells were cocultured with ensheathing or hippocampal glial cells or were seeded on laminin or poly-L-lysine as controls. Olfactory receptor cells extended the longest primary neurites when cocultured with ensheathing cells. Neurite extension on hippocampal glia and laminin was less extensive than that observed on ensheathing cells but higher than that on poly-L-lysine. The neurite outgrowth-promoting effect of ensheathing cells was, at least in part, mediated by diffusible factors, because olfactory receptor cell neurite extension could also be facilitated when receptor cells were cultured in ensheathing cell-conditioned media. In contrast, cortical neurons extended neurites of equivalent lengths on ensheathing and hippocampal glia. The results suggest that ensheathing cells may release factors that support the continuous outgrowth of olfactory receptor cell axons and, therefore, the capacity of this pathway to recover from injury.",
