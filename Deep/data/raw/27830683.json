     "AB": "The programmed cell death (or apoptosis) plays an important role both in developing and mature brains. Multiple data indicate the involvement of processes of apoptosis in mechanisms of different psychopathologies. At the same time, nothing is known about the role of apoptosis in the regulation of genetically defined aggression. In the present work, the expression of the genes that encode main pro- and antiapoptotic BAX and BCL-XL proteins, as well as caspase 3 (the main effector of apoptosis), in different brain structures of rats that were selected on a high aggression towards human (or its absence) was studied. A significant increase in the expression of the gene encoding caspase 3 was detected in the hypothalamus. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the expression of proapoptotic Bax gene in the hippocampus and increase in mRNA level of antiapoptotic Bcl-xl gene in the raphe nuclei area of midbrain in highly aggressive rats. An increase in the ratio Bcl-xl: Bax was found in the midbrain and amygdala; a trend towards an increase in the ratio was also found in hippocampus of aggressive animals compared to tame animals. Thus, we demonstrated that genetically defined fear-induced aggression is associated with significant changes in the genetic control of apoptosis in the brain. It is assumed that an increase in the Bcl-xl gene expression (accompanied by a decrease in the Bax gene expression) can indicate an increase in the threshold of neuronal apoptosis in highly aggressive rats.",
