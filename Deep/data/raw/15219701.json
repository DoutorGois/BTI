     "AB": "Individual differences in novelty-induced exploratory activity identify rats which can serve as a model of human sensation-seeking, risk-taking behaviour. Experimentally naive rats, when exposed to mild stress of a novel environment, exhibit variability in their exploratory activity. Some rats display high rates of locomotor reactivity to novelty (high responders (HR)), and others display low rates (low responders (LR)). The LRHR phenotype is a reliable predictor of drug-taking behaviour and is linked to differences in hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression. In this study, we investigated whether the LRHR phenotype is associated with differences in the quantitative morphology of the hippocampal field CA3, dentate gyrus molecular layer, granule cell layer and mossy fibres. LRs and HRs showed no significant differences in the volumes of CA3 and dentate molecular layer volume or the number of dentate granule cells. However, LRs had a significantly larger suprapyramidal mossy fibre terminal field volume when compared to HRs. The infrapyramidal mossy fibres did not differ between phenotypes. Also, we found a LRHR phenotype-independent significant negative correlation between molecular layer volume per granule cell and the total number of granule cells. These findings implicate the SP-MF in vulnerability for risk-taking behaviour, and we propose that LR and HR hippocampi may differ in the way novelty information is processed.",
