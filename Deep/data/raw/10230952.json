     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether lidocaine can improve the neuropathologic results in canine brains after retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP). DESIGN: Randomized, blinded, experimental study. SETTING: University animal laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Mongrel dogs. INTERVENTIONS: Fourteen mongrel dogs were placed on 120 minutes of hypothermic (20 degrees C) RCP. Following the RPC, they then resumed cardiopulmonary bypass and rewarming for 60 minutes. In the lidocaine group (n = 8), lidocaine was administered continuously; in the control group (n = 6), normal saline was administered. Cerebral perfusion fixation was performed at the end of the experiment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The number of ischemic cells in 200 neurons was counted in the parietal cortex, CA1 sector of the hippocampus, CA3 sector of the hippocampus, ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus, and Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. Those in the parietal cortex, CA1 sector of the hippocampus, and ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus were significantly less in the lidocaine group than in the control group (25.8+/-17.3 v 53.7+/-12.0; p < 0.01; 17.0+/-8.5 v 54.7+/-22.1; p < 0.01; and 16.9+/-17.8 v 49.7+/-28.4; p < 0.05, respectively). The total number of ischemic cells in the five examined regions was also significantly less in the lidocaine group than in the control group (89.5+/-19.4 v 219.5+/-45.5; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Continuous lidocaine significantly alleviated the ischemic neuropathologic injury after RCP and thus possibly improved cerebral protection.",
