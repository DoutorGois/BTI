     "AB": "It is now recognized that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following necrotic neurological insults plays a central role in the subsequent neuron death. A key step in ROS detoxification is the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen by either catalase (CAT) or glutathione peroxidase (GPX). We have previously shown that overexpression of CAT or GPX protects cultured neurons against subsequent excitotoxic insults. Because of the unpredictability of most acute neurological insults, gene therapy will most often need to be carried out after rather than in anticipation of an insult. Thus, we have tested whether herpes virus amplicon vectors expressing CAT or GPX still protect cultured hippocampal neurons from oxygen/glucose deprivation if introduced following an insult. CAT-expressing vectors were protective even when introduced 8 h post-insult. In contrast, there was no post-insult time window in which GPX overexpression protected. While CAT requires no cofactor, GPX action requires glutathione as a cofactor. Thus, we speculated that the post-insult decline in glutathione compromises the protective potential of GPX. Supporting this, reversing the post-insult glutathione decline with glutathione supplementation was neuroprotective.",
