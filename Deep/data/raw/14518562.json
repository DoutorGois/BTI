     "AB": "Brain cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis, is rapidly and transiently induced by convulsions in hippocampal and cortical neurons. Therefore, we examined the effects of COX-2 on the 'rapid kindling' development in COX-2 knockout mice and in mice treated with nimesulide, a COX-2-selective inhibitor. Rapid kindling development was examined based on the incidence of hippocampal EEG seizures and behavioral seizures following repetitive electrical stimulation of the perforant path at an interval of 40 s, and on the total afterdischarge (AD) duration induced by 50 stimulations. In addition, we measured COX-2 mRNA expression by in situ hybridization and PGE2 concentration using enzyme immunoassay following rapid kindling stimulation. The results suggested that brain COX-2 mRNA levels were markedly increased in the hippocampal neurons and the concentration of PGE2 was elevated significantly, and that the incidence of AD and seizure behavior induction and the total AD duration were significantly decreased under conditions of COX-2 deficiency. Therefore, we concluded that inducible COX-2 facilitates the recurrence of hippocampal seizures.",
