     "AB": "The kynurenine (KYN) pathway, which is initiated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, is the main tryptophan (TRP) metabolic pathway. It shares TRP with the serotonin (5-HT) pathway. We investigated the influence of inescapable-predator (rat) stress on behavior and brain TRP metabolism in mice. Male ICR mice (4W) were exposed to 20-min inescapable-predator stress. Behavior on an elevated plus-maze, and TRP, KYN, and 5-HT levels in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsal raphe nuclei were measured 1 and 4 weeks after stress exposure. Predator stress increased the number of open-arm entries (NOA) 4 weeks after stress exposure without altering the number of closed-arm entries (NCA). Thus, the open/closed-arm entry ratio (NOA/NCA) increased after stress exposure. Predator stress increased KYN levels in the prefrontal cortex (until 4 weeks after stress exposure) and dorsal raphe nuclei (for 1 week after stress exposure), decreased 5-HT levels in all brain regions (until 4 weeks after stress exposure). Thus, predator stress increased the KYN/5-HT ratio in all regions, in particular in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus until 4 weeks after stress exposure. Predator stress shifted the balance between the KYN and 5-HT pathways to the KYN pathway, and induced behavioral disinhibition.",
