     "AB": "In rats under urethane, iontophoretic applications of GABA (30-60 nA) in the str. pyramidale of CA1, showed a rapidly fading inhibitory effect. By contrast, GABA had a well-maintained inhibitory effect in str. radiatum. During iontophoresis of nipecotic acid (30-85 nA) identical applications of GABA in str. pyramidale caused a more prominent depression without fading, which suggests that removal of GABA, by uptake, can at least in part account for 'fading'. Nipecotic acid also prolonged the paired-pulse inhibition, presumably by prolonging the duration of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials.",
