     "AB": "Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine/threonine-isozymes that are involved in many signaling events in normal and disease states. Previous studies from our lab have demonstrated that varepsilonPKC plays a pivotal role in neuroprotection induced by ischemic preconditioning. However, the role of varepsilonPKC during and after brain ischemia is not clearly defined. Therefore, in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that activation of varepsilonPKC during an ischemic event is neuroprotective. Furthermore, other studies have demonstrated that varepsilonPKC mediates cerebral ischemic tolerance in the rat brain by decreasing vascular tone. Thus, we also tested the effects of varepsilonPKC activation during ischemia on cerebral blood flow (CBF). We found that psivarepsilon-Receptors for Activated C Kinase (RACK), a varepsilonPKC-selective peptide activator, injected intravenously 30min before induction of global cerebral ischemia conferred neuroprotection in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. Moreover, measurements of CBF before, during, and after cerebral ischemia revealed a significant reduction in the reperfusion phase of rats pretreated with psivarepsilonRACK as compared to Tat peptide (vehicle). Our results suggest that varepsilonPKC can protect the rat brain against ischemic damage by regulating CBF. Thus, varepsilonPKC may be one of the treatment modalities against ischemic injury.",
