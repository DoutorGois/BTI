     "AB": "When administered to mice, 3-acetylpyridine has been shown to selectively destroy the hippocampa neural fields CA3 and CA4. Adult mice, injected i.p. with150 mg/kg 3-acetylpyridine showed a reduced frequency of spontaneous alteration(48%) in a T-maze, compared with saline injcetd controls (73%). The pattern of latency change in the experimental mice was consistent with a failure to habitatue normally. these behavioral effects of 3-acetylpyrdine resemble those observed following lesions of the hippocampus induced by stereotaxic surgery.",
