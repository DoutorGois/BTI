     "AB": "Much of our present understanding of the cellular mechanisms of learning and memory derives from studies on the hippocampus in which long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is produced by a train of high-frequency electrical stimulation or by potassium channel blockers. The hippocampus is also a seizure-prone region and recent studies have revealed that brief seizure episodes produce remarkably long-lasting changes which are reminiscent of 'classical' LTP. A brief seizure episode also sets in motion a cascade of events that includes changes in gene expression, sprouting of fibres and the establishment of new synaptic contacts. This paper reviews this use-dependent structural rearrangement of the neuronal network and discusses its possible role in epilepsy and as a model of plasticity in the adult nervous system.",
