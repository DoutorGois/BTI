     "AB": "Proteasome inhibition can induce abnormal accumulation and phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein tau. The major function of tau protein is to promote microtubules assembly and stabilization, and abnormal tau protein would disturb its microtubule-binding function. In this study, proteasome inhibitor MG132 was used to treat hippocampal slices to explore the role and mechanism of Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) in proteasome inhibition-induced tau abnormality. During the culture period, we measure the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) content to assay the viability of hippocampal slices. Following 2.5 and 5 muM MG132 treatment for 6 h, we detected the expression, phosphorylation modification, and microtubule-binding function of tau protein of slices. We also analyzed the changed activities of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and the level of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in the process. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation was used to investigate the interaction between Akt and Hsp90, Akt and protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) in the MG132-treated organotypic hippocampal slices. Our results indicated that proteasome inhibition led to degradation obstacles and abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein. The downregulated Akt/GSK-3beta signaling pathway might be responsible for the abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein at multiple sites which further reduced the microtubule-binding function of tau protein. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition decreased the binding capacity of Akt-Hsp90 while increased the Akt-PP2A binding ability which mediated Akt inactivity. This current study establishes a hippocampal slice model targeting Akt/GSK-3beta signaling pathway to explore the pivotal role of proteasome inhibition in tau pathology.",
