     "AB": "mGlu5 play an important role in physiology and pathology to various central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Several positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers have been developed to explore the role of mGlu5 in brain disorders. However, there are no single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) radioligands for mGlu5. Here we report development of [(123)I]IPEB ([(123)I]1) and [(123)I]IMPEB ([(123)I]2) as mGlu5 radioligands for SPECT. [(123)I]1 and [(123)I]2 were produced by copper(I) mediated aromatic halide displacement reactions. The SPECT imaging using mouse models demonstrated that [(123)I]1 readily entered the brain and accumulated specifically in mGlu5-rich regions of the brain such as striatum and hippocampus. However, in comparison to the corresponding PET tracer [(18)F]FPEB, [(123)I]1 showed faster washout from the brain. The binding ratios of the striatum and the hippocampus compared to the cerebellum for [(123)I]1 and [(18)F]FPEB were similar despite unfavorable pharmacokinetics of [(123)I]1. Further structural optimization of 1 may lead to more viable SPECT radiotracers for the imaging of mGlu5.",
