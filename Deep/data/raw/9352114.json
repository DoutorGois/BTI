     "AB": "Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was recently recognized as a potential neurotrophic factor in the developing brain. We studied expression of HGF and its receptor using Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization for mRNA and double immunofluorescent laser confocal microscopy. HGF and cMet messages were abundant in the hippocampus of both human and rat brains. In this region, both messages were localized in the neuronal layer. Segregation of HGF predominantly in the hippocampal CA3-4 and cMet in CA1 supports the hypothesis that HGF may mediate important neurotrophic functions in both developing and adult brains.",
