     "AB": "Tolerance to the anxiolytic-like effect of drugs may develop because of a memory derived from prior experience in certain apparatuses such as the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Activity in basolateral amygdala was shown to be required for consolidating this knowledge. The dorsal hippocampus (DH) is also implicated in long-term memory consolidation, a process relying on new protein synthesis. It is unknown, however, whether the DH protein synthesis disruption would prevent the phenomenon rendering animals unresponsive to benzodiazepines in the EPM retest. To address this, we bilaterally infused the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (ANI) into the rat DH 0, 3 or 6 h after, or 15 min before, the EPM test. DH infusion of ANI (80 mug) around the time of EPM testing preserved the anxiolysis of the midazolam (MDZ; 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) in rats retested in the EPM 24 h later, suggesting that information consolidated by DH protein synthesis impacts on the subsequent animal's responsiveness to this drug. To examine whether impaired memory acquisition could also contribute to the prevention of MDZ tolerance seen in EPM-experienced animals infused with ANI before testing, the EPM retest was performed 3 h after testing to coincide with the temporal window in which short-term memory remains, for the reason that this process does not require protein synthesis for its formation. The pretest DH anisomycin infusion's ability to prevent the MDZ tolerance on retesting was now missing. This result confirms a specific action of the ANI on memory consolidation. We also found that rats express further avoidance to open-arms in the EPM retest. However, neither pretest nor posttest DH ANI infusion interfered with this pattern of results exhibited by EPM-experienced rats.",
