     "AB": "To investigate the consequences of complement activation on neuronal viability, the effects of serum treatment on neuron-rich and mixed neuronal/glial cultures were evaluated. The neurotoxicity observed following treatment with either human or rat serum was variable and did not appear to be mediated through a complement-mediated mechanism. Serum lots lacking CH50 activity induced neurotoxicity, and heat treatment of toxic lots of either human or rat sera did not abolish toxicity. In cases where serum treatment did not induce cell death, treatment with PIPLC to remove endogenous membrane-bound complement inhibitors prior to serum exposure, did not result in cell death.",
