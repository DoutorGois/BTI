     "AB": "Previous studies have shown that large hippocampal lesions increase the gastric pathology found in restrained and unrestrained animals. The present experiments investigated the effects of lesions in the two major afferent and efferent pathways of the hippocampus, i.e., the dorsal pathway through the fimbria-fornix and the ventral pathway in the entorhinal region, on gastric pathology in restrained and unrestrained rats. Result demonstrated that lesions in the ventral pathway produced an increased incidence of pathology whereas lesions in the fimbria-fornix did not. Neuroanatomical pathways which may mediate these effects are described",
