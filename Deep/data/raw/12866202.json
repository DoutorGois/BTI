     "AB": "To explore biochemical basis for cerebroprotective effect of immunosuppressant FK506, we studied changes in subcellular distribution of protein kinase C gamma (PKC gamma) as well as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) after ischemia. Male Mongolian gerbils were subjected to 5 min forebrain ischemia. FK506 (1 or 3 mg kg-1) was administered at 1 min after recirculation, which was confirmed to be cerebroprotective by histological examination at seven days after ischemia. At the designated time points (before ischemia, 5 min ischemia, 1 and 24 h recovery), heads were frozen and samples were taken from CA1 subfield of hippocampus. Western blot analysis was carried out. Persistent translocations of PKC gamma and CaMKII to synaptosomal P2 fraction were observed in vehicle-treated group. FK506 significantly decreased levels of PKC gamma and CaMKII in P2 fraction at 24 h of recovery. The present results suggest FK506 downregulates translocated PKC gamma and CaMKII, which may contribute to its survival promoting effect after cerebral ischemia.",
