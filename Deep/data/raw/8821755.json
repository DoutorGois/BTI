     "AB": "It has been proposed that the long-term depression (LTD) seen following low frequency stimulation (LFS) in the rat hippocampus involves calcineurin. We have tested this by examining the effect of FK506, a macrolide which blocks calcineurin at nanomolar concentrations, on synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampal slice at a concentration of 1 microM which has been shown to block LTD in the visual cortex. The effect of FK506 on long-term potentiation (LTP) and spontaneous transmitter release was also studied. The magnitude of LTD induced by LFS was 16.7 +/- 2.4% in control which was not significantly different from the 22.3 +/- 3.0% seen in the same preparations after exposure to FK506 for 25-30 min. In contrast the magnitude of LTD induced 'de novo' in preparations exposed to FK506 was significantly reduced. FK506 had no significant effect on LTP, miniature EPSP frequency, miniature EPSP amplitude, resting membrane potential or input resistance. These results, therefore, support the hypothesis that calcineurin is involved in 'de novo' LTD but it appears that an event is triggered by LFS whereby FK506-insensitive LTD can subsequently be activated by a second episode of LFS.",
