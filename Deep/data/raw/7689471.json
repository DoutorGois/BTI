     "AB": "We planned to ascertain whether the administration of the anticholinesterase, tacrine (5 mg/kg i.p.), to rats pretreated 24 h before with lithium chloride (LiCl; 12 mEq/kg i.p.) produced any change in nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity in the hippocampus. A significant increase in hippocampal Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent NO synthase activity occurred 15 min after tacrine injection and was blocked by atropine (5 mg/kg i.p. given 15 min before tacrine) and by N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (300 micrograms given into one lateral cerebral ventricle 10 min before tacrine), a NO synthase inhibitor. A consistent cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) accumulation was also seen. In conclusion, the present results show that tacrine given to LiCl-pretreated rats produces a significant increase in NO synthase activity in the hippocampus and this may be responsible, at least in part, for seizures and related brain damage elicited by these drugs.",
