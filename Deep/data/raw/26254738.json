     "AB": "Mephedrone and methedrone are cathinone-related compounds, which act as non-selective substrates for monoamine transporters, facilitating a neurotransmitter release. We compared the acute pharmacological effects of mephedrone and methedrone, attempting to further evaluate the action mechanisms of methedrone by responsibly and ethically using mice under approved procedures. The effects of both compounds were examined from 10 to 60 min, in a series of behavioral paradigms, namely open-field, plus-maze, hot-plate and tail suspension tests, whereas neurotransmitter brain tissue levels were determined ex vivo by HPLC. Separate groups were pre-treated with the dopamine (DA) antagonist haloperidol, or the serotonin (5-HT) synthesis inhibitor rhoCPA, to further assess the mechanisms underlying methedrone effects. The compounds caused marked hyperlocomotion, displaying dissimilar stereotyped behavior, in an open-field arena. Mephedrone caused anxiolytic-like effects, while methedrone induced anxiogenic-like actions in the elevated plus-maze. Both compounds displayed thermal antinociception, with a reduced immobility time in the tail suspension model. Mephedrone triggered a 2- and 3-fold increment of dopamine and serotonin tissue levels, respectively, in the nucleus accumbens, with a 1.5-fold elevation of tissue dopamine in the frontal cortex. Methedrone caused a 2-fold increment of tissue dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and in the striatum, and a 1.5-fold increment of serotonin tissue levels in the hippocampus and striatum. In vivo methedrone effects were partially inhibited by a pre-treatment with haloperidol or rhoCPA. Despite similar actions on locomotion, analgesia, and depression-like behavior, the acute administration of mephedrone and methedrone elicited divergent effects on anxiety-like behavior and stereotyped movements in mice, which might be related to the distinct modulation of brain tissue neurotransmitter levels.",
