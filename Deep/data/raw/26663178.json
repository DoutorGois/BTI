     "AB": "Epilepsy is a common, serious neurological disease characterized by recurring seizures. Such abnormal, excessive synchronous firing of neurons arises in part because of imbalances in excitation and inhibition in the brain. The process of epileptogenesis, during which the normal brain is transformed after injury to one capable of generating spontaneous seizures, is associated with large-scale changes in gene expression. These contribute to the remodelling of brain networks that permanently alters excitability. Components of the microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis pathway have been found to be altered in brain tissue from epilepsy patients and experimental epileptogenic insults result in select changes to miRNAs regulating neuronal microstructure, cell death, inflammation, and ion channels. Targeting key miRNAs has been shown to alter brain excitability and suppress or exacerbate seizures, indicating potential for miRNA-based therapeutics in epilepsy. Altered miRNA profiles in biofluids may be potentially useful biomarkers of epileptogenesis. In summary, miRNAs represent an important layer of gene expression control in epilepsy with therapeutic and biomarker potential.",
