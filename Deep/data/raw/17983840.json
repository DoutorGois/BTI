     "AB": "Alterations in the complexity of social and physical housing environments modulate seizure susceptibility in animal models of epilepsy. The studies described here tested the hypothesis that environmental enrichment would delay seizure onset in the epileptic (El) mouse. Neural activation measured via cFos expression, accumulation of the stress neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and behavioral seizure susceptibility were quantified in El mice to better understand the mechanisms of ictogenesis. Enrichment housing of El mice from Postnatal Days 21 to 49 produced a 100% decrease in seizure susceptibility relative to El controls. cFos expression increased in the primary motor cortex, locus ceruleus, and hippocampus of El mice relative to ddY controls, an effect attenuated by enrichment housing. CRF levels were elevated by enrichment in the hippocampus of ddY mice only. This study provides evidence that enrichment housing delays the onset of seizure susceptibility in El mice while altering the neuronal and stress-related responses in seizure-associated regions of the El brain.",
