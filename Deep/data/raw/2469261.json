     "AB": "Formation of experimental neurosis in rats was accompanied in 64% of animals by development of amnesia of conditioned reaction of passive avoidance. Disturbance of mnestic processes was manifested by a change in free amino acids pool including the acids with neurotransmitter properties (GABA, glutamate, glycine). An increase of GABA and glycine content was found in the frontal cortex and an increase of glutamate and GABA--in the hippocampus and striate body. Substance P (125 mkg/kg) administered intraperitoneally against the background of a developed neurosis, produced in 80% of cases an antiamnestic action, accompanied by a statistically significant decrease of GABA content in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and midbrain, and an increase of glutamate in the midbrain. The level of taurine decreased in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and striate body, and increased in the midbrain. Threonine content increased in the striate body and midbrain; there was an increase of taurine, serine and glycine in the midbrain and of glycine in the striate body.",
