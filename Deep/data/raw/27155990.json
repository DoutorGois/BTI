     "AB": "There is limited information on the role of GABA type A receptors (GABAARs) containing alpha1, alpha5 and gamma2 subunits in learning and memory. Here, we assessed the possible role of such receptors in spatial learning using the multiple T-maze (MTM) paradigm. C57BL/6J mice were trained in the MTM which induced elevated levels of alpha1 and alpha5 subunit-containing hippocampal GABAAR complexes. Moreover, spatial learning evoked a significant increase in the colocalization of alpha1 and alpha5 subunits in both, CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus suggesting the formation of complexes containing both subunits. Additionally, the presence of alpha1, alpha5 and gamma2 subunits in high molecular weight GABAARs was detected and significant correlation in the level of alpha1-containing complexes with those containing alpha5 and gamma2 subunits was demonstrated. Accordingly, alpha1 deficiency led to decreased levels of gamma2 subunit-containing complexes, however, had no effect on alpha5-containing ones. On the other hand, alpha1 knockout mice showed impaired performance in the MTM correlating with increased levels of alpha5 subunit-containing GABAARs in comparison to trained floxed control animals which quickly learned the task. Taken together, these results suggest that alpha1, alpha5 and gamma2-containing hippocampal GABAAR complexes play an essential role in spatial learning and memory in which targeted disruption of the alpha1 subunit produces profound deficits.",
