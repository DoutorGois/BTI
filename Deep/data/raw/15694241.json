     "AB": "The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases the levels of the physiological antioxidant glutathione (GSH) in peripheral organ systems such as liver tissue. Only little evidence exists about the actions of this cytokine on GSH in neuronal cell systems despite its possible neuroprotective effects. Therefore, we here characterized the effects of IL-6 on GSH in clonal hippocampal HT22 cells and in rat neuronal primary hippocampal cells. Our results demonstrate significant increases of GSH under most conditions after treatment with IL-6 in a time range of 1 to 48 h (HT22 cells) and 1 to 72 h (primary rat neuronal hippocampal cells). Further studies with an IL-6 antibody strongly support the specificity of the effects. These results suggest that IL-6 plays a substantial role in the regulation of GSH in hippocampal cells.",
