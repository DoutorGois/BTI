     "AB": "An investigation of several neurochemical consequences of exposure of the rat to 3/4 of the estimated single injection LD50 quantity of trimethyltin chloride (TMT) indicated that a significant elevation in the levels of glutamine (Gln) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) occurred at post-dosing day 7 in each examined region of the brain; elevated Gln persisted in the hippocampus through day 14 and returned to control levels at day 28. At post-dosing day 7, levels of glutamate were decreased in the hippocampus, while levels of GABA were decreased in hippocampus and frontal cortex, but not in corpus striatum; hippocampal glutamate and GABA returned to control levels by post-dosing day 14. Decreased levels of taurine (Tau) occurred on day 7 in both hippocampus and frontal cortex; hippocampal Tau remained below control levels through post-dosing day 28. Levels of other amino acids and of amines and amine metabolites were not altered by TMT in the 7 to 28 day post-dosing interval. At day 7, TMT treatment did not alter brain regional activities of glutamine synthetase; however, plasma ammonia was elevated 100% above the control value. Alterations in several serum enzymes (esp., alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase) revealed several other peripheral consequences of TMT exposure which persist through post-dosing day 28. The more prominent and wide-spread neurochemical alterations resulting from TMT exposure appear to reflect consequences of hyperammonemia resulting from a peripheral effect of the organotin compound.",
