     "AB": "Previous studies have shown that exposing hippocampal slices to low osmolarity (pi(o)) or to low extracellular NaCl concentration ([NaCl](o)) enhances synaptic transmission and also causes interstitial calcium ([Ca(2+)](o)) to decrease. Reduction of [Ca(2+)](o) suggests cellular uptake and could explain the potentiation of synaptic transmission. We measured intracellular calcium activity ([Ca(2+)](i)) using fluorescent indicator dyes. In CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons in tissue slices, lowering pi(o) by approximately 70 mOsm caused \"resting\" [Ca(2+)](i) as well as synaptically or directly stimulated transient increases of calcium activity (Delta[Ca(2+)](i)) to transiently decrease and then to increase. In dissociated cells, lowering pi(o) by approximately 70 mOsm caused [Ca(2+)](i) to almost double on average from 83 to 155 nM. The increase of [Ca(2+)](i) was not significantly correlated with hypotonic cell swelling. Isoosmotic (mannitol- or sucrose-substituted) lowering of [NaCl](o), which did not cause cell swelling, also raised [Ca(2+)](i). Substituting NaCl with choline-Cl or Na-methyl-sulfate did not affect [Ca(2+)](i). In neurons bathed in calcium-free medium, lowering pi(o) caused a milder increase of [Ca(2+)](i), which was correlated with cell swelling, but in the absence of external Ca(2+), isotonic lowering of [NaCl](o) triggered only a brief, transient response. We conclude that decrease of extracellular ionic strength (i.e., in both low pi(o) and low [NaCl](o)) causes a net influx of Ca(2+) from the extracellular medium whereas cell swelling, or the increase in membrane tension, is a signal for the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores.",
