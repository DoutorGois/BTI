     "AB": "Rats treated with (+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or (+)-methamphetamine (MA) neonatally exhibit long-lasting learning impairments (i.e., after treatment on postnatal days (P)11-15 or P11-20). Although both drugs are substituted amphetamines, they each produce a unique profile of cognitive deficits (i.e., spatial vs. path integration learning and severity of deficits) which may be the result of differential early neurochemical changes. We previously showed that MA and MDMA increase corticosterone (CORT) and MDMA reduces levels of serotonin (5-HT) 24 h after treatment on P11, however, learning deficits are seen after 5 or 10 days of drug treatment, not just 1 day. Accordingly, in the present experiment, rats were treated with MA or MDMA starting on P11 for 5 or 10 days (P11-15 or P11-20) and tissues collected on P16, P21, or P30. Five-day MA administration dramatically increased CORT on P16, whereas MDMA did not. Both drugs decreased hippocampal 5-HT on P16 and P21, although MDMA produced larger reductions. Ten-day treatment with either drug increased dopamine utilization in the neostriatum on P21, whereas 5-day treatment had no effect. No CORT or brain 5-HT or dopamine changes were found with either drug on P30. Although the monoamine changes are transient, they may alter developing neural circuits sufficiently to permanently disrupt later learning and memory abilities.",
