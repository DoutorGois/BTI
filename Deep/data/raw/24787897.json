     "AB": "Modification of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitotoxicity appears to be a potential target in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Postsynaptic density protein-93 (PSD-93) specifically binds the C-terminal tails of the NMDAR, which is critical to couple NMDAR activity to specific intracellular signaling. This study is to investigate whether PSD-93 disruption displays neuroprotection in a focal ischemic stroke model of adult mice and, if it does, to explore possible mechanisms. It was found that, following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), PSD-93 knockout (KO) mice manifested significant reductions in infarcted volume, neurological deficits and number of degenerated neurons. PSD-93 deletion also reduced cultured cortical neuronal death caused by glucose and oxygen deprivation (OGD). Ischemic long term potentiation (i-LTP) could not be induced in the PSD-93 KO group and wild type (WT) groups pretreated with either AP-5 (NMDAR inhibitor) or PP2 (Src family inhibitor). PSD-93 KO decreased the phosphorylation of the NR2B at Tyr1472 and the interaction between NR2B and Fyn after MCAO. Together, our study demonstrated that PSD-93 KO confers profound neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury, which probably links to the inhibitory effect on Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of NR2B caused by PSD-93 deletion. These findings may provide a novel avenue for the treatment of ischemic stroke.",
