     "AB": "The interplay between principal cells and interneurons plays an important role in timing the activity of individual cells. We investigated the influence of single hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells on putative interneurons. The activity of CA1 pyramidal cells was controlled intracellularly by current injection, and the activity of neighboring interneurons was recorded extracellularly in the urethane-anesthetized rat. Spike transmission probability between monosynaptically connected pyramidal cell-interneuron pairs was frequency dependent and highest between 5 and 25 Hz. In the awake animal, interneurons were found that had place-modulated firing rates, with place maps similar to their presynaptic pyramidal neuron. Thus, single pyramidal neurons can effectively determine the firing patterns of their interneuron targets.",
