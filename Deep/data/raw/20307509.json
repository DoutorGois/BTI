     "AB": "Multiple potential uses of direct gene transfer into neurons require restricting expression to specific classes of glutamatergic neurons. Thus, it is desirable to develop vectors containing glutamatergic class-specific promoters. The three vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) are expressed in distinct populations of neurons, and VGLUT1 is the predominant VGLUT in the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex. We previously reported a plasmid (amplicon) Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1) vector that placed the Lac Z gene under the regulation of the VGLUT1 promoter (pVGLUT1lac). Using helper virus-free vector stocks, we showed that this vector supported approximately 90% glutamatergic neuron-specific expression in postrhinal (POR) cortex, in rats sacrificed at either 4 days or 2 months after gene transfer. We now show that pVGLUT1lac supports expression preferentially in VGLUT1-containing glutamatergic neurons. pVGLUT1lac vector stock was injected into either POR cortex, which contains primarily VGLUT1-containing glutamatergic neurons, or into the ventral medial hypothalamus (VMH), which contains predominantly VGLUT2-containing glutamatergic neurons. Rats were sacrificed at 4 days after gene transfer, and the types of cells expressing ss-galactosidase were determined by immunofluorescent costaining. Cell counts showed that pVGLUT1lac supported expression in approximately 10-fold more cells in POR cortex than in the VMH, whereas a control vector supported expression in similar numbers of cells in these two areas. Further, in POR cortex, pVGLUT1lac supported expression predominately in VGLUT1-containing neurons, and, in the VMH, pVGLUT1lac showed an approximately 10-fold preference for the rare VGLUT1-containing neurons. VGLUT1-specific expression may benefit specific experiments on learning or specific gene therapy approaches, particularly in the neocortex.",
