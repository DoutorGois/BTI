     "AB": "Multiple genetic and epigenetic events determine neuronal phenotype during nervous system development. After the mature mammalian neuronal phenotype has been determined it is usually static for the remainder of life, unless an injury or degenerative event occurs. Injured neurons may suffer one of three potential fates: death, persistent atrophy, or recovery. The ability of an injured adult neuron to recover from injury in adulthood may be determined by events that also influence neuronal phenotype during development, including expression of growth-related genes and responsiveness to survival and growth signals in the environment. The latter signals include neurotrophic factors and substrate molecules that promote neurite growth. Several adult CNS regions exhibit neurotrophic-factor responsiveness, including the basal forebrain, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord. The specificity of neurotrophic-factor responsiveness in these regions parallels patterns observed during development. In addition, neurons of several CNS regions extend neurites after injury when presented with growth-promoting substrates. When both neurotrophic factors and growth-promoting substrates are provided to adult rats that have undergone bilateral fimbria-fornix lesions, then partial morphological and behavioral recovery can be induced. Gene therapy is one useful tool for providing these substances. Thus, the mature CNS remains robustly responsive to signals that shape nervous system development, and is highly plastic when stimulated by appropriate cues.",
