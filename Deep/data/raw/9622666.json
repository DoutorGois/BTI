     "AB": "The temporal correlation between adenosine outflow and changes in field excitatory post synaptic potentials (fEPSP) occurring during ischemia-like conditions was investigated in rat hippocampal slices. Five-minute long ischemia-like conditions resulted in a 100% depression of fEPSP amplitude, followed by a complete recovery after 6-7 min of reperfusion. By reducing the duration of the ischemic insult to 2 min, fEPSP was depressed by 50%. During both 5 and 2 min of ischemia-like conditions, a significant increase in adenosine outflow was detected. During reperfusion, when fEPSP amplitude recovered completely, the adenosine level in the extracellular fluid returned to basal values. The strict relationship between the increase in adenosine outflow and fEPSP inhibition supports the hypothesis that adenosine is largely responsible for the synaptic transmission depression during cerebral ischemia.",
