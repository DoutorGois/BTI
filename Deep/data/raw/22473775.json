     "AB": "Glutamate-induced neurotoxicity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders; however, little is known about the cellular events that underlie neurotoxicity or how to impede these events. This study demonstrates that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-delta regulates glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in HT22 mouse hippocampal cells. Activation of PPARdelta by GW501516, a specific ligand, significantly inhibited glutamate-induced cell death and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HT22 cells. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of PPARdelta abrogated the effects of GW501516 in neuronal toxicity and ROS production induced by glutamate. In addition, ligand-activated PPARdelta reduced the glutamate-induced level of intracellular calcium ions (Ca(2+)) by modulating the influx of Ca(2+) from the extracellular space. Similarly, glutamate-induced cell death and intracellular Ca(2+) levels were attenuated in the presence of LY83583, an inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase. Taken together, these results suggest that PPARdelta plays an important role in glutamate-induced neurotoxicity by modulating oxidative stress and Ca(2+) influx.",
