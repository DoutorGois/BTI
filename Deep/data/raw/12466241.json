     "AB": "1. Baicalein is a bioactive flavonoid isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, a medicinal herb that has been used since ancient times to treat bacterial infections. As little is known concerning its pharmacokinetics, this study focussed on its pharmacokinetics as well as the possible roles of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein on its distribution and disposition. 2. Three microdialysis probes were simultaneously inserted into the jugular vein, the hippocampus and the bile duct of male Sprague-Dawley rats for sampling in biological fluids following the administration of baicalein (10, 30 and 60 mg kg(-1)) through the femoral vein. The P-glycoprotein inhibitor cyclosporin A was used to help delineate its roles. 3. The study design consisted of two groups of six rats in parallel: control rats which received baicalein alone and the cyclosporin A treated-group in which the rats were injected cyclosporin A, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, 10 min prior to baicalein administration. 4. Cyclosporin A treatment resulted in a significant increase in elimination half-life, mean residence time and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of unbound baicalein in the brain. However, AUC in the bile was decreased. 5. The decline of baicalein in the hippocampus, blood and bile suggested that there was rapid exchange and equilibration between the peripheral compartment and the central nervous system. In addition, the results indicated that baicalein was able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier as well as undergoing hepatobiliary excretion. 6. Although no direct transport studies were undertaken and multiple factors may affect BBB penetration and hepatobiliary excretion, strong association of the involvement of P-glycoprotein in these processes is indicated.",
