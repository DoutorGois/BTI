     "AB": "The mechanism of ATP-induced long-term potentiation was studied pharmacologically using guinea-pig hippocampal slices. Application of 1-10 microM ATP for 10 min transiently depressed and then slowly augmented the synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons leading to long-term potentiation (LTP). This ATP-induced LTP was blocked by the addition of K-252b, an ecto-protein kinase inhibitor, but was enhanced by the addition of RK682, an ecto-phosphatase inhibitor, both of which do not permeate the cell membrane. These results suggest that ATP applied to the perfusate provides enough substrate for ecto-protein kinase to induce LTP through phosphorylation of extracellular domains of membrane proteins in CA1 neurons.",
