     "AB": "UNLABELLED: To investigate the effect of +Gz exposure on the expression and distribution of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in rat brain. METHODS: One hundred rats were randomly divided into control group, +2 Gz, +6 Gz and +10 Gz exposures groups. The +Gz group rats were exposed to +2 Gz, +4 Gz, +6 Gz and +10 Gz for 3 minute respectively. The expression of HSP70 in rat brain was measured by immunohistochemistry and West blot methods after +Gz exposure. RESULTS: There was no HSP70 expression in the brains of control rats. In +2, +4. and +6 Gz groups, HSP70 was obviously expressed in cortex, hippocampus and pyriform cortex 6 h after exposures, and strongly expressed 1 d after exposure, and then had a tendency to decrease 2 d after exposure, and returned to control level 6 d after exposure. The expression of HSP70 after +6 Gz exposure was the strongest in all +Gz groups. In +10 GZ group, HSP70 protein was only weakly expressed in pyriform cortex after exposure. CONCLUSIONS: +Gz exposures may cause time-dependent HSP70 expression in rat brain.",
