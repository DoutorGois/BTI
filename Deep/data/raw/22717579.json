     "AB": "Endothelial cells represent an important component of the neurogenic niche and may regulate self-renewal and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Whether they have a role in determining the apoptotic fate of NPCs after stress or injury is unclear. NPCs are known to undergo p53-dependent apoptosis after ionizing radiation, whereas endothelial cell apoptosis after irradiation is dependent on membrane acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) and is abrogated in sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (smpd1)- (gene that encodes ASMase) deficient mice. Here we found that p53-dependent apoptosis of NPCs in vivo after irradiation was inhibited in smpd1-deficient mice. NPCs cultured from mice, wild type (+/+) or knockout (-/-), of the smpd1 gene, however, demonstrated no difference in apoptosis radiosensitivity. NPCs transplanted into the hippocampus of smpd1-/- mice were protected against apoptosis after irradiation compared with those transplanted into smpd1+/+ mice. Intravenous administration of basic fibroblast growth factor, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, known to protect endothelial cells against apoptosis after irradiation also attenuated the apoptotic response of NPCs. These findings provide evidence that endothelial cells may regulate p53-dependent apoptosis of NPCs after genotoxic stress and add support to an important role of endothelial cells in regulating apoptosis of NPCs after injury or in disease.",
