     "AB": "The pathogenicity for cats of EHV-9, a new neurotropic equine herpesvirus, was assessed by intranasal inoculation with 10(6) plaque-forming units. Four cats killed 4, 5, 6 or 10 days after inoculation showed neurological signs consisting of hyper-excitability and aggressiveness, followed by tremors, occasional convulsions, and depression. Histologically, the cats showed severe encephalitis characterized by neuronal degeneration and loss, intranuclear inclusions, perivascular cuffing and gliosis in the cerebrum. A positive immunohistochemical reaction for EHV-9 antigen was seen in degenerating neuronal cells. The lesions extended from the olfactory bulb to the rhinencephalon and hippocampus. All cats had rhinitis, with or without intranuclear inclusion bodies in the nasal mucosa, and interstitial pneumonia. These findings indicate that the cat, like certain other species such as the goat, is susceptible to experimental infection with EHV-9, and may be at risk from natural infection.",
