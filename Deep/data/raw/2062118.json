     "AB": "Hippocampal nerve cells of rats taken from embryonic donors were stained with the fluorescent dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33342) and grafted to the brains of adult rats. The numbers of labelled neurons inside the transplants were determined after 6 different intervals, ranging from 2 days to 6 months. Numerous labelled neurons were found inside the grafts up to 6 months after grafting. The results demonstrate that bisbenzimide is a suitable vital cell tracer for long-term grafting experiments.",
