     "AB": "The effects of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) on the excitability of 47 pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the hippocampus were determined by using intracellular recording techniques in a submerged slice preparation. Addition of 10(-6) M AVP to the bathing medium evoked an increase in spike discharge which was slow in onset and only gradually reversible. The discharge was accompanied by an increase in excitatory postsynaptic potentials without significant change of the resting input resistance. AVP-induced excitation was found in 81% of ventral and 29% of dorsal hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. In low Ca2+, high Mg2+ solution this excitatory action by AVP was blocked. Microiontophoretic application of AVP onto apical or basal dendrites or the cell body did not result in excitation. These observations suggest that the action of AVP on CA1 pyramidal cells is transsynaptic and is more pronounced in ventral than dorsal CA1.",
