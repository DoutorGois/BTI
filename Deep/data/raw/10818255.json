     "AB": "Anatomical, neurochemical and behavioural evidence support a role for galanin in hippocampally mediated functions such as spatial learning and memory. To obtain more precise information on this role, galanin (3 nmol/rat) was infused via bilateral chronic cannulae into different areas of the hippocampal formation which are characterized by different galanin receptor subtypes and also by different galanin innervation patterns. The effects of infused galanin on spatial learning were examined in the Morris swim maze. Infusions of galanin into both the dorsal and ventral dentate gyrus, which mainly contain GAL-R2 receptor mRNA and a high degree of galanin-noradrenaline coexistence, significantly retarded spatial acquisition without affecting swim speed or performance in the visible platform test. This spatial learning deficit was fully blocked by pretreatment with the non-selective galanin antagonist M35. Analysis of retention performance suggested that the major effect of intrahippocampal galanin is mediated via a specific disruption of acquisition mechanisms of importance for performance in the probe trial. Galanin infused into the ventral CA1 (a mainly GAL-R1 receptor mRNA expressing region) or into anterior, ventral CA3 regions did not produce any deficits in spatial learning compared to control animals. These results suggest that galanin mediates its action on spatial learning mainly through the GAL-R2 receptor subtype in areas where most of the galanin is present in noradrenergic terminals. A possible role for the GAL-R1 receptor subtype in cognition in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus remains to be defined. The results suggest a differential functional role for galanin and galanin receptor subtypes within subregions of the hippocampal formation.",
