     "AB": "Increasing evidence indicates that the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is implicated in regulating synaptic plasticity and memory formation in the hippocampus and other brain areas. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the memory-impairing effects of GRPR antagonism have remained unclear. Here we report that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF/FGF-2) rescues the memory impairment induced by GRPR antagonism in the rat dorsal hippocampus. The GRPR antagonist [D-Tpi(6), Leu(13) psi(CH(2)NH)-Leu(14)] bombesin (6-14) (RC-3095) at 1.0 microg impaired, whereas bFGF at 0.25 microg enhanced, 24 h retention of inhibitory avoidance (IA) when infused immediately after training into the CA1 hippocampal area in male rats. Coinfusion with an otherwise ineffective dose of bFGF blocked the memory-impairing effect of RC-3095. These findings suggest that the memory-impairing effects of GRPR antagonists might be partially mediated by an inhibition in the function and/or expression of neuronal bFGF or diminished activation of intracellular protein kinase pathways associated with bFGF signaling.",
