     "AB": "Central benzodiazepine receptor binding was studied in spontaneously epileptic rats (SER) and in their parent strain. Kyoto-Wistar (KW) rats, by ex vivo quantitative autoradiography with [125I]iomazenil. Thirteen-week-old SER developed tonic and absence-like seizures following mild stimulation by tapping at 5 min before injection of the radioligand. When compared with age-matched KW rats, a significant 76% elevation of radioactivity was observed in the SER hippocampus, while there was no difference in hippocampal blood flow obtained using [125I]N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine. Since benzodiazepine receptors act to enhance inhibitory GABA transmission, this finding suggests a possible mechanism for seizure-induced enhancement of inhibition.",
