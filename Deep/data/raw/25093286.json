     "AB": "Repeated Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) administration produces cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB(1)R) desensitization and downregulation, as well as tolerance to its in vivo pharmacological effects. However, the magnitude of CB(1)R desensitization varies by brain region, with CB(1)Rs in the striatum and its output nuclei undergoing less desensitization than other regions. A growing body of data indicates that regional differences in CB(1)R desensitization are produced, in part, by THC-mediated induction of the stable transcription factor, DeltaFosB, and subsequent regulation of CB(1)Rs. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether THC-mediated induction of DeltaFosB in the striatum inhibits CB(1)R desensitization in the striatum and output nuclei. This hypothesis was tested using bitransgenic mice with inducible expression of DeltaFosB or DeltacJun, a dominant negative inhibitor of AP-1-mediated transcription, in specific forebrain regions. Mice were treated repeatedly with escalating doses of THC or vehicle for 6.5 days, and CB(1)R-mediated G-protein activation was assessed using CP55,940-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS autoradiography. Overexpression of DeltaFosB in striatal dopamine type 1 receptor-containing (D1R) medium spiny neurons (MSNs) attenuated CB(1)R desensitization in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and amygdala. Expression of DeltacJun in striatal D1R- and dopamine type 2 receptor (D2R)-containing MSNs enhanced CB(1)R desensitization in the caudate-putamen and attenuated desensitization in the hippocampus and VTA. THC-mediated in vivo pharmacological effects were then assessed in DeltacJun-expressing mice. Tolerance to THC-mediated hypomotility was enhanced in DeltacJun-expressing mice. These data reveal that DeltaFosB and possibly other AP-1 binding proteins regulate CB(1)R signaling and adaptation in the striatum and limbic system.",
