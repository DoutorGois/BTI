     "AB": "A 60-year-old myelodysplastic syndrome patient underwent tandem cord blood transplantation. The primary cord blood graft was rejected, and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) encephalitis developed after engraftment of secondary cord blood. Polyuria and adipsic hypernatremia were observed during treatment of the encephalitis. The patient died of bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant Streptococcus epidermis. HHV6 infection in the posterior pituitary was confirmed on autopsy, as was infection of the hippocampus, but not of the hypothalamus. This is the first case report of central diabetes insipidus caused by an HHV6 posterior pituitary infection demonstrated on a pathological examination.",
