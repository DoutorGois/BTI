     "AB": "Rats were implanted with cannulae in the CA1 area of the dorsal hippocampus and trained in one-trial step-down inhibitory avoidance. Two retention tests were carried out in each animal, one at 1.5 h to measure short-term memory (STM) and another at 24 h to measure long-term memory (LTM). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the modulation on hippocampal nerve growth factor (NGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on short- and long-term memory. Immediately after training, animals received 5 microl of NGF (0.05, 0.5 or 5.0 ng), bFGF (1.25, 12.5 or 125 ng) or saline per side. At the higher dose, NGF blocked STM. In contrast, NGF at dose of 0.5 and 5.0 ng improved LTM. The bFGF infusion at a dose of 125 ng enhanced LTM. However, bFGF did not alter STM. These findings indicate that hippocampal NGF and bFGF modulate STM and LTM in a different manner.",
