     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Prenatal infection is a major risk factor for the occurrence of neuropsychiatric disorders. These have been associated with hippocampal neuroanatomical and functional abnormalities. In the present study, we evaluated the occurrence of pyramidal cell disarray and reelin neuronal deficit in the hippocampus, and the protective role of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in a rodent experimental model of prenatal immune challenge. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats received either 500 mug/kg of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) or 2 ml/kg of isotonic saline by i.p. injection on day 19 of gestation. After LPS injection, rats were or were not maintained on a preventive treatment of NAC (5 g/l in tap water), up to delivery. The pyramidal cell orientation and the number and type of reelin-expressing neurons were determined in male offspring. RESULTS: Prenatal LPS challenge led to permanent pyramidal cell disarray and to an early and transient decreased density of reelin-immunoreactive neurons. These disorders, more pronounced in the CA3 area, were prevented by NAC. CONCLUSION: Hippocampal cytoarchitectural alterations and reelin deficiency may be involved in the development of remote cognitive impairments in this model. The antioxidant NAC is an efficient neuroprotective drug that underlines the role of oxidative stress in prenatal infection and associated neurodevelopmental damage.",
