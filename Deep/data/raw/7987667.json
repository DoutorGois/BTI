     "AB": "We investigated the possible effects of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on sleep-wake phases and other associated behaviors controlled by the medial preoptic area, cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Chronic epidural electroencephalographic (EEG) and temporal muscle electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were placed in cycling female rats. After a week of recovery, rats were injected intraperitoneally at 3.00 pm on the day of proestrus with either saline or highly purified hCG or indomethacin or hCG plus indomethacin. Three hours after injection, EEG, EMG and behavioral activities were recorded for 3.5 h. The administration of hCG increased high and low amplitude sleep, resting phase and decreased active awake phase, walking, sniffing and chewing as compared to the controls. While the administration of indomethacin alone had no effect, coadministration inhibited hCG effects. Medial preoptic area, cerebral cortex and hippocampus contain immunostaining for LH/hCG receptors. The administration of hCG resulted in an increase of immunoreactive PGD2 and a decrease of PGE2 in median preoptic area, cerebral cortex and hippocampus as compared to the controls. In summary, hCG administration affects sleep-wake phases and other associated behaviors in rats which can collectively be described as decreased activity. These effects are probably mediated by increasing PGD2 and decreasing PGE2 in areas of brain which control these activities. The above findings may be relevant to pregnant women who experience decreased activity when hCG is present in the circulation and cerebrospinal fluid.",
