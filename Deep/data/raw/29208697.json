     "AB": "In this study, we report the development of a dual extraction protocol for RNA and lipids, including phospholipids, endocannabinoids, and arachidonic acid, at high spatial resolution, e.g., brain punches obtained from whole frozen brains corresponding to four brain subregions: dorsal hippocampus, ventral hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, and hypothalamus. This extraction method combined with LC/multiple reaction monitoring for lipid quantifi-cation and quantitative PCR for RNA investigation allows lipidomic and transcriptomic profiling from submilligram amounts of tissue, thus benefiting the time and animal costs for analysis and the data reliability due to prevention of biological variability between animal batches and/or tissue heterogeneity, as compared with profiling in distinct animal batches. Moreover, the method allows a higher extraction efficiency and integrity preservation for RNA, while allowing concurrently quantitative analysis of low and high abundant lipids. The method was applied for brain punches obtained 1 h after kainic acid-induced epileptic seizures in mice (n = 10) compared with controls (n = 10), and enabled the provision of valuable new insights into the subregional lipid and RNA changes with epilepsy, highlighting its potential as a new viable tool in quantitative neurobiology.",
