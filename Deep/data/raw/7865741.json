     "AB": "Many cells recorded from the dorsal hippocampus of freely moving rats are intensely active only when the rat's head is in a particular part of its environment. For this reason, such units are called 'place cells'. We have investigated whether place cells are also found in the ventral hippocampus. Recordings were made from ventral hippocampal units while rats chased food pellets in a cylindrical arena. The rat's position was simultaneously recorded by tracking a light on the rat's head. Our data show the existence of cells in the ventral hippocampus whose positional firing patterns and electrophysiological properties are very similar to those of dorsal hippocampal place cells.",
