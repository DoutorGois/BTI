     "AB": "Recent studies have shown that neurodevelopmental disturbances in the structure and function of the brain are significant factors in the onset of psychiatric disorders. Such deficits may also affect neurotransmission. Among the different neurotransmitter systems, serotonin (5-HT) plays an important role in the organisation and maturation of brain structures during development. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of neonatal 5-HT depletion on emotional and exploratory behaviours in adult rats. Three-day-old Wistar male rats received intraventricular injections of the selective serotonin neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT). Littermates given saline injections acted as controls. After three months, rat behaviour was analysed in an open field test, a social interaction test and a novel object test. Moreover, contextual-conditioned freezing and ultravocalisation fear responses were studied. The pain reactivity was measured in a flinch-jump test. Biochemical analysis of 5,7-DHT-treated rats revealed a significant decrease in the concentration of 5-HT and its metabolite in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum, with a decreased dopamine level in striatum. Early serotonin depletion reduced locomotor activity in the open field test and attenuated social interaction in non-aversive conditions and exploration of a novel object in adult rats. Ultravocalisation, but not freezing, was increased in the contextual fear-conditioning paradigm in 5-HT-depleted rats. There was no difference in the pain threshold between groups. These data demonstrate that neonatal 5-HT depletion resulted in subtle alterations in the locomotor, exploratory and conditioned fear response of adult animals.",
