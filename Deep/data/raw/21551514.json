     "AB": "Experimentally-induced lesions of the basal forebrain have been used to test the hypothesis that the cholinergic system plays a critical role in learning and memory. In the present study, a basal forebrain infusion of colchicine, a microtubule assembly inhibitor, was used to characterize the relationship between a cholinergic marker and behavioral function. Bilateral infusions were made in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) of male Long-Evans rats. At 4 weeks post-lesion, behavioral assessments were made on half of the rats in each group. These rats were sacrificed 1 week later and regional choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was measured. The remaining rats were behaviorally tested 11 weeks post-lesion and sacrificed 12 weeks post-lesion. The brains of additional rats were studied for Nissl-staining, ChAT-, GAD- and metEnk immunoreactivity (IR) and AChE histochemistry. At 5 weeks after colchicine infusion, there was a significant decrease in parietal and frontal cortical ChAT activity, impaired acquisition of a water maze spatial navigation task and decreased passive avoidance cross-over latency. At 12 weeks after colchicine infusion, ChAT activity was decreased in frontal but not parietal cortex; acquisition of the water maze task was not significantly different from vehicle-infused rats, and a significant deficit was observed in passive avoidance latency. ChAT-IR in the NBM showed a significant decrease at both time points, while changes in AChE-stained cortical fibers paralleled the ChAT activity. GAD- and metEnk-IR were decreased but were not different between the two time points. These data show task-specific behavioral recovery associated in time with recovery of regional cholinergic markers.",
