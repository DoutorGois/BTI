     "AB": "Intracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal cells were performed in in vitro hippocampal slices obtained from control and amygdala- or perforant path-kindled rats. Passive membrane properties did not differ between control and kindled cells. Twenty-three percent of kindled cells, however, displayed burst firing with depolarizing current injection, whereas no control cells produced bursts (P less than 0.01). Two different types of voltage-dependent alteration of depolarizing postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) were also evident in kindled cells. The majority (26/29) of these cells showed a smaller increase (type 1, n = 18), or a sudden decrease (type 2, n = 8), in PSP amplitude with passive membrane hyperpolarization when compared to controls (P less than 0.01). The NMDA antagonist D-APV did not markedly alter the overall slope of the PSP/membrane potential function in either 'type 1' or 'type 2' cells, suggesting that neither behavior was due to a change in the activation characteristics of NMDA receptors. The amplitude of IPSPs was smaller in 'type 1' kindled cells (P less than 0.05) than in controls, however, suggesting that the reduced slope of the PSP/membrane function may be accounted for by a change in inhibition.",
