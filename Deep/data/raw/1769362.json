     "AB": "Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to low doses of methyl mercury (3.9 mg mercury/kg diet), via their dams during gestation and lactation and directly via their diet until sacrifice at 50 days postpartum, in order to study possible detrimental effects on CNS development. The methyl mercury exposure of the rats resulted in a brain concentration of 1.45 +/- 0.06 mg mercury/kg wet weight (mean +/- SEM). No general toxic effects were observed; body weight was not affected, brain weight was only slightly increased. No discernible general morphological alterations were seen in the brain as evaluated using cresyl violet histology. Furthermore, no effects on GFA-positive astrocytes in brain sections were observed and computerized morphometry of smeared astrocytes from frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum did not reveal any effects of the methyl mercury treatment. The noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) systems were also studied. In cerebellum the NA levels were increased (117% of controls, P = 0.008), whereas in other regions analyzed NA and DA levels were unchanged. Thus, long-term low-dosage exposure of methyl mercury in rats during development does not appear to exert any major effects on the morphological maturation of neurons and astrocytes. However, the results indicate that effects may occur in specific transmitter-identified systems, such as the NA input to cerebellum. The results therefore underline the need for detailed biochemical analyses to study the effects of long-term low-dosage exposure to neurotoxic compounds.",
