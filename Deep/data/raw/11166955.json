     "AB": "Ischemic preconditioning requires increased nitric oxide (NO) production. However, NO may also trigger delayed neuronal death cascades. The goal therefore was to investigate nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms (neuronal NOS: nNOS; endothelial NOS: eNOS; inducible NOS: iNOS) with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in hippocampal slices from control mice and slices prepared upon preconditioning in vivo (single intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg body weight 3-nitropropionate (3NP)). One hour after preconditioning nNOS (108+/-34%, mean+/-SD), eNOS (93+/-34%), and iNOS (282+/-261%) remained at control levels. Similarly, nNos, eNOS, and iNOS stayed at control level 12, 24, and 72 h after preconditioning with 3NP. Incubation of slices, however, drastically increased iNOS (1676+/-818, P<0.01). We conclude that chemical preconditioning other than ischemic preconditioning may not increase potentially harmful nitric oxide synthase isoforms.",
