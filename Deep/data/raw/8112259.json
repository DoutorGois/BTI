     "AB": "During intracarotid sodium amobarbital (ISA) testing, EEG slow waves appear in the injected hemisphere and usually also contralaterally. They are frequently used to estimate duration of drug effect and thus the window of valid memory testing, but the relationship between slow waves and memory performance is not established. In 50 tests, we examined recognition for stimuli presented after amobarbital injection in relation to the quantified EEG. Performance was compared for injection ipsilateral versus contralateral to epileptic focus, with slow waves present bilaterally, unilaterally, or dissipated. Results showed that memory was impaired after injections contralateral to the focus when slow waves were present on the side of the focus (contralateral to injection). Injection contralateral to focus did not interfere with memory if slow waves were not also present, and slow waves contralateral to injection did not interfere with memory if the focus was not also present. This result emphasizes the functional significance of slow waves, which probably reflect decreased neuronal functioning.",
