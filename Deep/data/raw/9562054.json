     "AB": "Neuroimaging techniques have improved the understanding, diagnosis, and management of epilepsy. By providing excellent structural information, MRI is the technique of choice in evaluating patients with epilepsy. Functional imaging techniques, including MR spectroscopy, functional MRI, positron emission tomography, and single photon emission CT, permit noninvasive assessment of the epileptic substrate, its functional status, and neuroreceptors. The MRI-based techniques will potentially assume a greater role in the cost-effective workup of the patient. Currently, newer techniques such as magnetoencephalography, magnetic source imaging, and optical imaging are research tools.",
