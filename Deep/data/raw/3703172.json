     "AB": "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in organotypic slice cultures of hippocampus of the rat, have been examined using the tritiated muscarinic antagonist quinuclidinylbenzilate [( 3H]QNB) as a as a marker. Maximum specific binding of [3H]QNB in mature explants of hippocampus amounted to 316 fmol/mg protein and a dissociation constant (KD) of 185 pM was determined. Scatchard analysis suggested binding to one single binding site. In younger cultures smaller KDs were registered. This decrease in ligand affinity in maturer cultures possibly reflects a decrease in the turnover of acetylcholine. Muscarinic antagonists inhibited the total binding of [3H]QNB significantly, whereas muscarinic agonist, nicotinic antagonists and cholinesterase inhibitors had no influence whatsoever on the total binding of [3H]QNB. The content of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors varied between cultures with explants from different brain areas: hippocampus greater than striatum greater than septum greater than spinal cord greater than cerebellum. These in vitro results are generally in good agreement with results obtained in situ by other investigators and suggest that the binding of [3H]QNB observed in these cultures is indeed correlated to specific muscarinic receptor sites.",
