     "AB": "Three experiments examined the effect of central noradrenergic depletion on the acquisition and performance of a temporal discrimination in auditory or visual modalities. In Experiment 1, 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesions of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle significantly retarded acquisition compared to a similarly lesioned ventral noradrenergic bundle-group, two sham-operated and one unoperated control group. In Experiment 2, the acquisition impairment produced in the dorsal noradrenergic bundle group was replicated, for both auditory and visual modalities, by lesions depleting hippocampal and neocortical noradrenaline by over 80%. In rats subsequently switched to discriminations involving the unfamiliar modality, the dorsal-bundle lesion also impaired acquisition several weeks after surgery. Experiment 3 showed significantly impaired performance in rats with dorsal bundle lesions when training prior to surgery had not resulted in better than chance performance. In rats previously trained to criterion, the dorsal bundle lesion transiently, but non-significantly, impaired performance. In rats performing better than chance, but not having reached criterion, there were no significant effects of the dorsal bundle lesion. Subsequent manipulations of deprivation and difficulty of discrimination in general failed to distinguish between the dorsal bundle lesion and sham-groups, suggesting that the acquisition impairment did not result from simple sensory or motivational effects. Reducing the interstimulus interval did impair the dorsal bundle group more than controls. However, there was no evidence of altered \"distractibility\" in the lesioned group when the alternative modality was introduced as a distractor. The results are discussed in terms of other acquisition deficits shown by rats with central noradrenaline depletion and their significance for determining the functions of the projections from the locus caeruleus via the dorsal noradrenergic bundle to the neocortex and hippocampus.",
