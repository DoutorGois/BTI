     "AB": "Extracellular accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been reported that extracellular perfusion of Abeta inhibits long-term potentiation (LTP), which is strongly related to memory in animal models. However, it has recently been proposed that intracellular Abeta may be the first pathological change to occur in AD. Here, we have investigated the effect on LTP of intracellular injection of Abeta (Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42)) into hippocampal pyramidal cells using patch-clamp technique. We found that injection of 1 nM Abeta(1-42) completely blocked LTP, and extracellular perfusion of a p38 MAPK inhibitor or a metabotropic glutamate receptor blocker reversed these blocking effects on LTP. Furthermore, we have examined the effects of different concentrations of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) on LTP and showed that Abeta(1-40) required a 1,000-fold higher concentration to attenuate LTP than 1 nM Abeta(1-42). These results indicate that LTP is impaired by Abeta injected into genetically wild-type neurons in the sliced hippocampus, suggesting an acute action of intracellular Abeta on the intracellular LTP-inducing machinery.",
