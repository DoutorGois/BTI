     "AB": "The possible irreversible blockade of 5-hydroxytryptamine1 receptor subtypes 5-hydroxytryptamine1A, 5-hydroxytryptamine1B/5-hydroxytryptamine1D and 5-hydroxytryptamine1C by the chloramine 8-methoxy-2-(N-2'-chloropropyl,N-propyl)aminotetralin (8-MeO-2'-chloro-PAT) was investigated in rat brain sections by quantitative autoradiography using [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin [( 3H]8-OH-DPAT), [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine, [125I]BH-8-MeO-N-PAT and [125I]cyanopindolol as radio-ligands. A marked reduction (-50% to -75%) of [3H]8-OH-DPAT and [125I]BH-8-MeO-N-PAT specific binding to 5-hydroxytryptamine1A sites in the hippocampus (CA1 area) and the dorsal raphe nucleus, and of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine specific binding to 5-hydroxytryptamine1C sites in the choroid plexus was found in sections exposed to 1 microM 8-MeO-2'-chloro-PAT and then washed extensively. In contrast the specific binding of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine to 5-hydroxytryptamine1B/5-hydroxytryptamine1D sites and of [125I]cyanopindolol to 5-hydroxytryptamine1B sites in the substantia nigra and dorsal subiculum remained unaltered by this treatment. Similarly [125I]cyanopindolol binding to beta-adrenergic receptors was not affected by 8-MeO-2'-chloro-PAT. Prior occupancy of 5-hydroxytryptamine1A sites by 10 microM 5-hydroxytryptamine or 8-OH-DPAT, and of 5-hydroxytryptamine1C sites by 10 microM 5-hydroxytryptamine prevented any subsequent blockade by 8-MeO-2'-chloro-PAT. These data indicate that 8-MeO-2'-chloro-PAT should be a useful alkylating agent for achieving selective irreversible blockade of central 5-hydroxytryptamine1A and 5-hydroxytryptamine1C receptors in vivo in the rat.",
