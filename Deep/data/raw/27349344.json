     "AB": "Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is one of the most common causes of vascular dementia (VaD) and is recognised as an etiological factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). CCH can induce severe cognitive deficits, as assessed by the water maze task, along with neuronal loss in the hippocampus. However, there are currently no effective, approved pharmacological treatments available for VaD. In the present study, we created a rat model of CCH using bilateral common carotid artery occlusion and found that (-)-SCR1693, a novel compound, prevented rats from developing memory deficits and neuronal damage in the hippocampus by rectifying cholinergic dysfunction and decreasing the accumulation of the phospho-tau protein. These results strongly suggest that (-)-SCR1693 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of CCH-induced VaD.",
