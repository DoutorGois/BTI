     "AB": "GABA released either iontophoretically or synaptically near pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slice could produce a biphasic response: a hyperpolarization followed by a depolarization. The depolarizing component elicited by either method was accompanied by an increased membrane conductance, and a reduction in neuronal discharge. The depolarization was reversed at a potential which was less negative than the resting membrane potential; it was blocked by antagonists of GABA action such as picrotoxin; it was sensitive to manipulation of extracellular chloride concentration; and it persisted in the presence of concentrations of cobalt or manganese which were sufficient to block evoked synaptic activity. Iontophoresis of GABA near the apical dendrites elicited an initial depolarization rather than an initial hyperpolarization, suggesting a dendritic origin for the depolarizing component. Together, these results suggest that GABA can produce, in the same neuron, both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing responses which depend at least in part upon changes in chloride conductances.",
