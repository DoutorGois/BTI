     "AB": "The effects of concanavalin A (Con A) on plasma and brain concentration of aspirin (Asp) were investigated in rats. When Asp was administered in rats treated with Con A, the plasma and brain concentration of Asp and its metabolites (salicylic acid (SA), salicyluric acid (SU) and gentisic acid (GA)) were increased. Distribution of Asp and its metabolites into the hippocampus, striatum and hypothalamus were increased by treatment with Con A. Asp esterase activities in the small intestinal mucosa, liver and brain were increased by pretreatment with Con A, but these enzyme activities were decreased by a high dose of Con A. The inhibitory effect of Asp, SA, SU and GA on the writhing induced by acetic acid in Con A-pretreated mice was stronger than that in the control. A lowering of rectal temperature, after the administration of Asp, was stronger in Con A-treated rats than in control rats. These results suggested that Con A facilitated the absorption of Asp and enhanced the transfer of SA into the brain, and increased Asp esterase activities in various tissues.",
