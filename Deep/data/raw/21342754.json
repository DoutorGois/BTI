     "AB": "Neurokinin-3 receptors (NK(3)-R) are localized in brain regions which have been implicated in processes governing learning and memory as well as emotionality. The effects of acute subcutaneous (s.c.) senktide (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg), a NK(3)-R agonist, were tested in aged (23-25 month old) Wistar rats: (a) in an episodic-like memory test, using an object discrimination task (this is the first study to test for deficits in episodic-like memory in aged rats, since appropriate tests have only recently became available); (b) on parameters of anxiety in an open field test, (c) on indices of depression in the forced swimming test and (d) on the activity of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, using in vivo microdialysis and HPLC. Neither the saline-, nor senktide-treated aged animals, exhibited episodic-like memory. However, the senktide-, but not the vehicle-treated group, exhibited object memory for spatial displacement, a component of episodic memory. Senktide injection also had anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects. Furthermore, the active doses of senktide on behavior increased ACh levels in the frontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus, suggesting a relationship between its cholinergic and behavioral actions. The results indicate cholinergic modulation by the NK(3)-R in conjunction with a role in the processing of memory and emotional responses in the aged rat.",
