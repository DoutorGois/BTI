     "AB": "The SPECT ligand AM 281, a less lipophilic analog of the cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR 141716A, robustly potentiated electrically-evoked release of acetylcholine from superfused hippocampal slices and prevented the inhibition of acetylcholine release by the cannabimimetic drug WIN 55212-2. These results, similar to earlier observations with SR 141716A, indicate that AM 281 is either a cannabinoid receptor antagonist or inverse agonist. Despite showing lower affinity than SR 141716A in hippocampal membrane binding experiments, AM 281 had slightly greater potency than SR 141716A in the hippocampal slice experiments, perhaps because of reduced drug absorption to slice membranes and to the apparatus.",
