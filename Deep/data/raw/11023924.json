We have characterized pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein-based sensors (pHluorins) of synaptic vesicle cycling at nerve terminals. pHluorins have a pK approximately 7.1, which make them ideal for tracking synaptic vesicle lumen pH upon cycling through the plasma membrane during action potentials. A theoretical analysis of the expected signals using this approach and guidelines for future reporter development are provided.",
