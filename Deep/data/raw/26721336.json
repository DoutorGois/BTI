     "AB": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) is widely considered one of the early causes of cognitive deficits observed in Alzheimer's disease. Many of the deficits caused by Abeta are attributed to its disruption of synaptic function represented by its blockade of long-term potentiation (LTP) and its induction of synaptic depression. Identifying pathways that reverse these synaptic deficits may open the door to new therapeutic targets. In this study, we explored the possibility that Neurogranin (Ng)-a postsynaptic calmodulin (CaM) targeting protein that enhances synaptic function-may rescue Abeta-mediated deficits in synaptic function. Our results show that Ng is able to reverse synaptic depression and LTP deficits induced by Abeta. Furthermore, Ng's restoration of synaptic transmission is through the insertion of GluA1-containing alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid glutamate receptors (AMPARs). These restorative effects of Ng are dependent on the interaction of Ng and CaM and CaM-dependent activation of CaMKII. Overall, this study identifies a novel mechanism to rescue synaptic deficits induced by Abeta oligomers. It also suggests Ng and CaM signaling as potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease as well as important tools to further explore the pathophysiology underlying the disease.",
