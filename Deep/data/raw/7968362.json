     "AB": "The brain regions controlling song are much larger in male than in female zebra finches. This sex difference is thought to arise developmentally when the male's brain is exposed to higher levels of estrogen. The synthesis of estrogen from androgen is catalyzed by aromatase, a key enzyme implicated in song development in the zebra finch. To study the role of estrogen synthesis in the organization of brain regions responsible for song, a cDNA encoding aromatase was isolated from a zebra finch ovarian cDNA library. The 3188 bp cDNA contains a 1527 bp open reading frame with 5' and 3' untranslated regions of 116 bp and 1545 bp, respectively. The deduced polypeptide is 509 amino acids in length, and is highly homologous to aromatases reported for chicken (92%), human (72%), mouse (70%), rat (69%) and trout (53%). Northern blot analysis revealed 5.4 kb, 4.8 kb and 3.2 kb aromatase mRNAs in brain and ovary. In situ hybridization histochemistry revealed the expression of aromatase mRNA in ovarian thecal cells of some, but not all, follicles, suggesting that aromatase gene expression is regulated during follicular maturation. In the adult brain, the distribution of aromatase mRNA was surprisingly widespread, and included the preoptic area, hypothalamus, hippocampus and neostriatum. By contrast, little aromatase mRNA expression was noted in the song nuclei (HVC, RA, area X). This study, the first description of aromatase mRNA expression by in situ hybridization in the brain of any species, identifies a surprisingly large number of cells that express aromatase mRNA in the zebra finch telencephalon. This pattern may be a unique feature of all songbirds.",
