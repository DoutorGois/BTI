     "AB": "The specific aims of this study were to perform direct correlational analyses of age differences in learning, short-term memory and arousal in relation to cell loss and lipofuscin increase in the hippocampus CA1 zone and in visual area 17 of the Fisher 344 rat. The following tentative conclusions can be made from the results presented in this study: (1) significant age differences in 2 and 6 hour passive-avoidance retention or memory between mature and old rats were related to non-significant age differences in days to criterion learning, starting latencies, running distance and time in original approach learning, and (2) significant age differences in 2 and 6 hours retention of old, compared to mature rats were correlated significantly with loss of neurons, and very significantly with increases in intraneuronal lipofuscin in the hippocampus CA1 zone and in visual area 17.",
