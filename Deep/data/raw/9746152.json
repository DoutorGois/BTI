     "AB": "Mesaconitine, one of the main alkaloids contained in Aconiti tubers, is a centrally acting analgesic without affinity to opioid receptors. It has been reported that the antinociception is due to an interaction with the noradrenergic system. In the present study, the effect of mesaconitine on the uptake of noradrenaline and on neuronal activity was examined in rat hippocampus. Experiments were performed as a study of [3H]noradrenaline uptake into rat hippocampal synaptosomes. Mesoconitine inhibited [3H]noradrenaline uptake in a concentration-dependent manner with a Ki of 111.95+/-18 nM. In a further series of experiments, the effects of mesaconitine on the extracellularly recorded population spike were investigated in rat hippocampal slices. At a concentration of 10 nM, mesaconitine increased the amplitude of the postsynaptic population spike by 31.10%+/-6.7% of control and elicited one or two additional spikes. The presynaptic fiber spike and the field excitatory postsynaptic potential were not affected by this alkaloid. The enhancement of neuronal activity was abolished by 1 microM propranolol as well as by 1 microM timolol. It is concluded that mesoconitine increased the excitability in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells by an involvement of the noradrenergic system, with at least one mechanism being inhibition of noradrenaline uptake leading to an enhanced extraneuronal noradrenaline level.",
