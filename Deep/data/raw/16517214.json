     "AB": "Chronic medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is associated with memory loss due to damage in the hippocampal system. To investigate the relationship between volume of medial temporal lobe structures and performance on neuropsychological tests, we studied 39 consecutive patients with MTLE and unilateral hippocampal atrophy (HA) determined by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Structures of interest comprised hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal, perirhinal, parahippocampal, and temporopolar cortices. The findings indicated that (1) performance was significantly worse in the group with left HA as compared with the group with right HA on general memory, verbal memory, delayed recall, and verbal fluency tests and the Boston Naming Test (BNT), and (2) the volume of the left hippocampus and also the degree of asymmetry of perirhinal cortex volume were significant and independent predictors of performance on general memory, verbal memory, and verbal fluency tests and the BNT in patients with MTLE.",
