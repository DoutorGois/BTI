     "AB": "Stress plays a profound role in the onset of affective disorders, including an elevation in risk factors for depression and anxiety. Women are twice as vulnerable to stress as men because of greater sensitivity to a substance produced during times of anxiety. To better define the abnormal proteins implicated in cognitive deficits and other stress-induced dysfunction, female rats were exposed to terrified sound stress, and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) were utilized to determine the differential protein expression in the hippocampus in sound-stressed female rats compared with controls. Quantitative differences were found in 44 protein spots which were differentially expressed between the stressed and control groups (fold change of >2; p < 0.01). Eighteen protein spots were downregulated, and 26 protein spots were upregulated in the stressed group. The seven most differentially expressed proteins were identified and validated as follows: dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2), creatine kinase B type, dynamin-1 protein, alpha-internexin, glial fibrillary acidic protein beta, gamma-enolase, and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A. Changes in protein levels were detected in the hippocampus of female rats subjected to terrified sound stress. The findings herein may open new opportunities for further investigations on the modulation induced in the hippocampus by stress at the molecular level, especially with respect to females stress.",
