     "AB": "We have developed a simple and inexpensive procedure for explant culture termed 'thin slice culture' that relies on the use of thin sections of CNS tissue ( < or = 150 microm) which adhere directly to the bottom of collagen-coated culture dishes (or glass coverslips within culture dishes). Microscopic visualization and tissue oxygenation are enhanced due to the reduced slice thickness, and the reduced volumes of incubation media required lessen the amount of expensive agents used (e.g. growth factors). We show that thin slice cultures of spinal cord, brainstem and hippocampus remain viable for at least several weeks and are suitable for many experimental approaches including time-dependent studies, immunocytochemistry and electrophysiology.",
