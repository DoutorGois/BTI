     "AB": "The present study used in vitro autoradiography to examine the density of [3H]-kainate (KA) binding in subregions of the hippocampal formation and certain cortical areas in young (7-8 months) and aged (27-29 months) Long-Evans rats. In addition, the topography of KA binding in the dentate molecular layer was examined for evidence of reactive reorganization in the aged brain. This investigation of age-related changes in [3H]-KA binding included correlations with the animals' spatial learning performance in a Morris water maze. The results showed an age-related decrease in the density of [3H]-KA binding in several regions of the hippocampal formation (CA3, CA1, hilus) and within related cortical areas (subicular complex, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex). In addition, an expanded zone of KA binding in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus was observed in the aged group. This expansion of KA binding may reflect sprouting due to a loss of perforant path input to the dentate. The results of additional correlational analyses, however, indicated that these changes in the density and topography of [3H]-KA binding were not strongly correlated with a decline in place learning ability.",
