     "AB": "Here, we present the pharmacological characterisation of Lu AF64280, a novel, selective, brain penetrant phosphodiesterase (PDE) 2A inhibitor, in in vitro/in vivo assays indicative of PDE2A inhibition, and in vivo models/assays relevant to cognitive processing or antipsychotic-like activity. The in vitro selectivity of Lu AF64280 was determined against a panel of PDE enzymes and 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in the hippocampus were determined using in vivo microdialysis. Lu AF64280 potently inhibited hPDE2A (Ki = 20 nM), 50-fold above moderate inhibition of both hPDE9A (Ki = 1,000 nM) and hPDE10A (Ki = 1,800 nM), and displayed a >250-fold selectivity over all other full-length human recombinant PDE family members (Ki above 5,000 nM). Lu AF64280 (20 mg/kg) significantly increased cGMP levels in the hippocampus (p < 0.01 versus vehicle-treated mice), attenuated sub-chronic phencyclidine-induced deficits in novel object exploration in rats (10 mg/kg, p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated), blocked early postnatal phencyclidine-induced deficits in the intradimensional/extradimensional shift task in rats (1 and 10 mg/kg, p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated) and attenuated spontaneous P20-N40 auditory gating deficits in DBA/2 mice (20 mg/kg, p < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated). In contrast, Lu AF64280 failed to attenuate phencyclidine-induced hyperactivity in mice, and was devoid of antipsychotic-like activity in the conditioned avoidance response paradigm in rats, at any dose tested. Lu AF64280 represents a novel tool compound for selective PDE2A inhibition that substantiates a critical role of this enzyme in cognitive processes under normal and pathological conditions.",
