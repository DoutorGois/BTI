     "AB": "A1-adenosine receptors were identified in sections of rat brain and guinea pig kidney with the radioiodinated agonist 125I-N6-p-hydroxyphenylisopropyladenosine (125I-HPIA) using in vitro autoradiography. The affinities of adenosine receptor ligands in competing with 125I-HPIA binding to tissue sections were in good agreement with those found in membranes, and indicate that the binding site represents an A1-adenosine receptor. The distribution of 125I-HPIA binding sites in rat brain sections was similar to the pattern of [3H]N6-cyclohexyladenosine ([3H]CHA) binding sites determined previously, with highest densities in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, the cerebellar cortex, some thalamic nuclei and certain layers of the cerebral cortex. In the guinea pig kidney 125I-HPIA labelled longitudinal structures in the medulla. This study demonstrates that 125I-HPIA allows the autoradiographic detection of A1 adenosine receptors in the brain and peripheral organs and has the advantage of short exposure times.",
