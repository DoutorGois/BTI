     "AB": "Growing evidence suggests that the associative parietal cortex (APC) of the rat is involved in the processing of spatial information. This observation raises the issue of the respective functions of the APC and the hippocampus in spatial processing as well as of their possible interactions. In this paper, we review neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral data that support the existence of such functional interactions. Our hypothesis is that the APC is involved in the initial combination of visuospatial information and self-motion information necessary for the integration of egocentrically acquired information into allocentrically coded information, the latter step being completed in the hippocampus. The dialogue between the hippocampus and the APC is therefore crucial, particularly when the elaboration and/or updating of an allocentric representation depends on complex combinations of visuospatial and self-motion information.",
