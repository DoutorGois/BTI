     "AB": "Glucocorticoids affect a variety of tissues to enable the organism to adapt to the stress. Hippocampal neurons contain glucocorticoid receptors and respond to elevated glucocorticoid levels by down-regulating the HPA axis. Chronically, however, stress is deleterious to hippocampal neurons. Chronically elevated levels of glucocorticoids result in a decrease in the number of dendritic spines, reduced axonal growth and synaptogenesis, and decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Tolloid-like 1 (Tll-1) is a metalloprotease that potentiates the activity of the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Neurogenesis in the hippocampus of both developing and adult mammals requires BMPs. In this study, we demonstrate that Tll-1 expression is increased in mice that have increased neurogenesis. The Tll-1 promoter contains glucocorticoid response elements which are capable of binding to purified glucocorticoid receptor. Glucocorticoids decrease Tll-1 expression in vitro. Finally, prenatal stress leads to a decrease in Tll-1 mRNA expression in the hippocampus of adult female mice that is not observed in adult male mice indicating that Tll-1 expression is differentially regulated in males and females. The results of this study indicate that Tll-1 is responsive to glucocorticoids and this mechanism might influence neurogenesis in the hippocampus.",
