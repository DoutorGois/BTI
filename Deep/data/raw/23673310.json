     "AB": "The increased life expectancy of people living with HIV-1/AIDS is accompanied by increased prevalence of HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder. As well, these individuals are increasingly experiencing Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neurocognitive problems and neuropathological features such as increased deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein. Findings that Abeta production occurs largely in endolysosomes, that HIV-1 transactivator protein (Tat) disrupts endolysosome function-an early pathological feature of AD-and that HIV-1 Tat can increase Abeta levels prompted us to test the hypothesis that endolysosome dysfunction is associated with HIV-1 Tat-induced increases in neuronal Abeta generation. Using primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we found that treatment with HIV-1 Tat caused such morphological changes as enlargement of endolysosomes identified with LysoTracker dye and such functional changes as elevated endolysosome pH measured ratiometrically with LysoSensor dye. The HIV-1 Tat-induced changes in endolysosome function preceded temporally HIV-1 Tat-induced increases in Abeta generation measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat increased endolysosome accumulation of Abeta precursor protein and Abeta identified using immunostaining with 4G8 antibodies. Furthermore, we demonstrated that treatment of neurons with HIV-1 Tat increased endolysosome accumulation of beta amyloid-converting enzyme, the rate-limiting enzymatic step for Abeta production, and enhanced beta amyloid-converting enzyme activity. Together, our findings suggest that HIV-1 Tat increases neuronal Abeta generation and thereby contributes to the development of AD-like pathology in HIV-1-infected individuals by disturbing endolysosome structure and function.",
