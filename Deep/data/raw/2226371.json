     "AB": "Temporal lobe epilepsy is a common localization-related epileptic syndrome characterized by complex partial seizures, ictal and interictal epileptic discharges arising from limbic structures of the temporal lobe, and association with hippocampal sclerosis. Temporal lobe epilepsy may follow perinatal injury and febrile convulsions, may be progressive, and frequently becomes refractory to standard antiepileptic therapy. The neurobiology that underlies these features of temporal lobe epilepsy is not known. Recent studies in experimental models have provided new insights that may help clarify the relationship of seizures, hippocampal sclerosis, and temporal lobe epilepsy. Observations from the study of the hippocampus with kainic acid-induced lesions, the kindling model, and other experimental models of epilepsy have demonstrated that seizures induce structural and electrophysiologic alterations in hippocampal pathways that may lead to increased excitability and could play a role in the development and progression of temporal lobe epilepsy. These alterations include mossy fiber synaptic reorganization, induction of NMDA-mediated synaptic transmission, and progressive hippocampal neuronal loss induced by brief kindled seizures. Some of the structural alterations induced by kindling have also been observed in the human epileptic temporal lobe, raising the possibility that mechanisms operative in kindling may play a role in the pathogenesis of hippocampal sclerosis and in the syndrome of human temporal lobe epilepsy.",
