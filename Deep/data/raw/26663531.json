     "AB": "Proper operation of a neural circuit relies on both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We previously showed that cell adhesion molecules nectin-1 and nectin-3 are localized at puncta adherentia junctions of the hippocampal mossy fiber glutamatergic excitatory synapses and that they do not regulate the excitatory synaptic transmission onto the CA3 pyramidal cells. We studied here the roles of these nectins in the GABAergic inhibitory synaptic transmission onto the CA3 pyramidal cells using nectin-1-deficient and nectin-3-deficient cultured mouse hippocampal slices. In these mutant slices, the amplitudes and frequencies of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents were indistinguishable from those in the control slices. In the nectin-1-deficient slices, but not in the nectin-3-deficient slices, however, the amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) was larger than that in the control slices, although the frequency of the mIPSCs was not different between these two groups of slices. In the dissociated culture of hippocampal neurons from the nectin-1-deficient mice, the amplitude and frequency of mIPSCs were indistinguishable from those in the control neurons. Nectin-1 was not localized at or near the GABAergic inhibitory synapses. These results indicate that nectin-1 regulates the neuronal activities in the CA3 region of the hippocampus by suppressing the GABAergic inhibitory synaptic transmission.",
