     "AB": "Depending on task demands, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the dorsal striatum plays a critical role in not only learning new response strategies but also in the inhibition of pre-existing strategies when a shift in strategy is required. The present experiment examined the effects of lesions of the dorsal striatum or dorsal hippocampus on acquisition of a response-learning rule and a place-learning rule in a Greek Cross version of the Morris water maze. Specifically, adult Long-Evans rats were prepared with either sham lesions or lesions to one of two subcortical areas of the brain considered necessary for processing nondeclarative or declarative memories, the dorsal striatum or the hippocampus, respectively. An analysis of the trial 2 performance pooled across reversals revealed hippocampus lesions induced accelerated acquisition when a response-learning rule was required. A much smaller enhancement effect was observed in dorsal striatum-lesioned animals in the place-learning paradigm. Dorsal hippocampus- and dorsal striatum-lesioned animals were highly impaired on place learning and response learning, respectively. The present results are congruent with a growing body of literature suggesting that different anatomical substrates are involved in the acquisition and maintenance of different types of information, that these processes can occur simultaneously and in parallel, and that the dorsal striatum is necessary for the mediation of stimulus-response learning, while the hippocampus is necessary to mediate the expression of place learning.",
