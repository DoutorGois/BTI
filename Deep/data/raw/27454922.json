     "AB": "IMPORTANCE: In vivo tau imaging may become a diagnostic marker for Alzheimer disease (AD) and provides insights into the pathophysiology of AD. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of [18F]-AV-1451 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to stage AD and assess the associations among beta-amyloid (Abeta), tau, and volume loss. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An imaging study conducted at Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. A total of 59 participants who were cognitively normal (CN) (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] score, 0) or had AD dementia (CDR score, >0) were included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of [18F]-AV-1451 in the hippocampus and a priori-defined AD cortical signature regions, cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42, hippocampal volume, and AD signature cortical thickness. RESULTS: Of the 59 participants, 38 (64%) were male; mean (SD) age was 74 (6) years. The [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR in the hippocampus and AD cortical signature regions distinguished AD from CN participants (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve range [95% CI], 0.89 [0.73-1.00] to 0.98 [0.92-1.00]). An [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR cutoff value of 1.19 (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 86%) from AD cortical signature regions best separated cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42-positive (Abeta+) AD from cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42-negative (Abeta-) CN participants. This same cutoff also divided Abeta+ CN participants into low vs high tau groups. Moreover, the presence of Abeta+ was associated with an elevated [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR in AD cortical signature regions (Abeta+ participants: mean [SD], 1.3 [0.3]; Abeta- participants: 1.1 [0.1]; F = 4.3, P = .04) but not in the hippocampus. The presence of Abeta+ alone was not related to hippocampal volume or AD signature cortical thickness. An elevated [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR was associated with volumetric loss in both the hippocampus and AD cortical signature regions. The observed [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR volumetric association was modified by Abeta status in the hippocampus but not in AD cortical signature regions. An inverse association between hippocampal [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR and volume was seen in Abeta+ participants (R2 = 0.55; P < .001) but not Abeta- (R2 = 0; P = .97) participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Use of [18F]-AV-1451 has a potential for staging of the preclinical and clinical phases of AD. beta-Amyloid interacts with hippocampal and cortical tauopathy to affect neurodegeneration. In the absence of Abeta, hippocampal tau deposition may be insufficient for the neurodegenerative process that leads to AD.",
