     "AB": "High density neuronal cultures from rat E18 hippocampus and cortex have been characterised with respect to cholinergic binding sites. No specific binding of [3H]nicotine or [3H]cytisine to live cells in situ was detected although the limit for detection was estimated to be 30 fmol/mg protein. Muscarinic binding sites labelled with [3H]QNB were present at a density of 0.75 pmol/mg protein. [125I]alpha-Bungarotoxin (alpha Bgt) bound to hippocampal cultures with a Bmax of 128 fmol/mg protein and a Kd of 0.6 nM; cortical cultures expressed five times fewer [125I]alpha-Bgt binding sites. Fluorescence cytochemistry with rhodamine-alpha-Bgt indicated that 95% of hippocampal neurons were labelled, compared with only 36% of cortical neurons. Average densities of 4 x 10(4) and 2 x 10(4) binding sites/cell were calculated for hippocampal and cortical cultures, respectively. Double labelling experiments with mAb307 (which recognises the rat alpha 7 nicotinic receptor subunit) and rhodamine-alpha-Bgt gave coincident labelling patterns, supporting the correlation between the alpha 7 subunit and Bgt-sensitive neuronal nicotinic receptor. Treatment of hippocampal cultures with 10 microM nicotine for 14 days elicited a 40% increase in the numbers of [125I]alpha-Bgt binding sites, mimicking the up-regulation observed in in vivo studies. Primary cultures offer a useful in vitro system for investigating the expression and regulation of brain alpha-Bgt-sensitive receptors.",
