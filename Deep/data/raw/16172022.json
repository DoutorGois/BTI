     "AB": "Catecholamines in some central (hypothalamus and hippocampus) and peripheral tissues (adrenal glands and heart auricles) of long-term socially isolated normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats exposed to novel immobilization stress were determined by a simultaneous single isotope radioenzymatic assay. Long-term isolation (21 days) produced depletion of hypothalamic norepinephrine (NE) stores and hippocampal dopamine (DA) stores in both normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Acute immobilization stress (2 h) significantly decreased NE and DA stores in hypothalamus and hippocampus of naive normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats controls. However, novel immobilization stress applied to normotensive rats previously subjected to long-term isolation produced no changes in catecholamine levels in hypothalamus, while resulting in somewhat higher depletion of NE stores in hypothalamus of spontaneously hypertensive rats treated in the same way. Novel immobilization stress decreased NE and DA stores in hippocampus of normotensive but was without effect on NE and DA stores of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Social isolation did not affect catecholamine stores in peripheral tissues but novel immobilization stress produced a significant decrease in catecholamine content. The results suggest that some central and peripherals tissues of spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive rats differ with regard to catecholamine content and that there are certain differences in their responsiveness to stress.",
