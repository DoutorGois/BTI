     "AB": "Altered neural-endocrine relations have been proposed as factors in mammalian aging. In the same rats from three age groups we quantified astrocyte reactivity in hippocampus, performed radioimmunoassays for plasma adrenocorticoids, and measured adrenal weight. These variables were correlated in individual animals and generally increased with age. The findings are consistent with recent hypotheses that endocrine levels are related to brain aging, either as cause or effect.",
