     "AB": "L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists increase the threshold for electroshock-induced convulsions. Here, we show that a transgenic mouse line overexpressing cerebellum-restricted gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor alpha6 subunit in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (Thy1alpha6 mouse line) exhibits about a 20% increase in the electroshock current intensity inducing tonic hindlimb extension convulsion in 50% of the mice compared with that of their wild-type controls. AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in patch clamp recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices had decreased amplitudes (8.4 +/- 2.2 pA) in the transgenics compared with the wild types (10.3 +/- 2.5 pA) but showed no change in current decay or frequency. Our results suggest that decreased AMPA-mediated neurotransmission might explain the increased threshold for electroconvulsions and warrant further studies on the regulation between various components of inhibition and excitation in neurons.",
