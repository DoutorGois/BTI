     "AB": "During the last decade hippocampal long-term potentiation has become one of the most frequently used models to study cellular mechanisms of learning and memory. Receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase C is thought to be involved in LTP stabilisation. In the present review, 1. the molecular structure and activation mechanisms of PKC isoenzymes, 2. the biochemical evidences for PKC activation after induction of LTP using different stimulation paradigms as well as 3. the involvement of metabotropic glutamate receptors in PKC activation after induction of LTP are critically discussed.",
