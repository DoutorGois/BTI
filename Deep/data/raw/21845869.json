     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression of autophagy after ischemia/reperfusion and its possible function in rats hippocampus neurons. METHODS: After 2 hours oxygen-glucose deprivation and different periods time of reperfusion (OGD/R) treatment in primary hippocampal neurons, neuron viability was evaluated by MTT assay, specific structure of autophagosome and specific protein of autophagy microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 B (LC3B) were detected by transmission electron microscope and immunofluorescence respectively. The inhibitor of autophagy 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) was also used to exam the viability of neurons. RESULTS: Treatment by OGD/R markedly reduced neuronal viability. Compared to the control group, autophagy existed in different time periods after OGD/R shown both in transmission electron microscope and immunofluorescence. Application of 3-MA significantly reduced neuronal viability. CONCLUSION: Oxygen-glucose deprivation can activate autophagy in rat hippocampus neurons, which may resist the injury during ischemia/reperfusion.",
