     "AB": "Recent studies have demonstrated that intrahippocampal cholinergic septal grafts can ameliorate deficits in spatial memory function and hippocampal cholinergic neurochemical activity in animals with disruptions of the septohippocampal pathway. Further studies have revealed that hippocampal cholinergic activity, as measured by high affinity choline uptake, correlates significantly with performance on tests of spatial memory function. The present study was designed to examine the effect of cholinergic septal grafts on reversing deficits in hippocampal choline acetyltransferase activity and on normalizing muscarinic receptor binding in animals with lesions of the septohippocampal system, and to examine the correlations between these cholinergic parameters and performance of spatial memory tasks. The results of this study indicated that in animals with lesions plus septal grafts, hippocampal ChAT activity was restored significantly and muscarinic receptor binding was normalized to a level not different from the control animals. Regression analyses indicated that ChAT activity was significantly correlated with performance on spatial reference memory, spatial navigation and spatial working memory, while muscarinic receptor binding correlated significantly with spatial reference memory performance.",
