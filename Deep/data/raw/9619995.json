     "AB": "A series of five experiments examined the differential mnemonic roles of the hippocampus and caudate-putamen and the modulatory influence of the amygdala on hippocampal and caudate-putamen memory processes. Findings indicate that (a) posttraining intrahippocampal injections of amphetamine selectively enhance memory in a hidden platform water maze task, (b) posttraining intracaudate injections of amphetamine selectively enhance memory in a visible platform water maze task, (c) posttraining intra-amygdala injections of amphetamine enhance memory in both water maze tasks, (d) preretention intrahippocampal lidocaine injections block expression of the memory enhancing effects of posttraining intrahippocampal amphetamine injections in the hidden platform task, (e) preretention intracaudate lidocaine injections block expression of the memory enhancing effects of posttraining intracaudate amphetamine injections in the visible platform task, (f) preretention intra-amygdala lidocaine injections do not block the memory enhancing effect of posttraining intra-amygdala amphetamine injections on either task, (g) in the hidden platform task, posttraining intrahippocampal, but not intracaudate, lidocaine injections block the memory enhancing effects of posttraining intra-amygdala amphetamine, (h) in the visible platform task, posttraining intracaudate, but not intrahippocampal, lidocaine injections block the memory enhancing effects of posttraining intra-amygdala amphetamine. The findings indicate a double dissociation between the roles of the hippocampus and caudate-putamen in memory and suggest that the amygdala exerts a modulatory influence on both the hippocampal and caudate-putamen memory systems.",
