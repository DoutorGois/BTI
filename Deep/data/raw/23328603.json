     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the changes of extracellular glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in hippocampus during the high-frequency stimulation of anterior nucleus thalamus (ANT) in epileptic rats. METHODS: A total of 30 rats were divided equally into 2 groups:epilepsy model and normal control (n = 15 each). Concentric bipolar electrodes were stereotaxically implanted in bilateral ANT. A high-frequency stimulation of 130 Hz was applied in the epilepsy group. Microdialysis probes were unilaterally lowered into hippocampus. The concentrations of Glu and GABA in dialysate samples were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: Electrical stimulation of ANT induced an increase of GABA and a decrease of Glu in hippocampus. CONCLUSION: An increase of GABA and a decrease of Glu during the electrical stimulation of ANT play an important role in the therapy of epilepsy.",
