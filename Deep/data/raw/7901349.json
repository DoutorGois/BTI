     "AB": "Repetitive synchronized neuronal discharging that lasts for seconds and even minutes in in vitro brain slice preparations are important new models in experimental epilepsy. In hippocampal slices from 1-2-week-old rats, individual CA3 pyramidal cells undergo a sustained depolarization during such electrographic seizures, induced by GABAA receptor antagonists. In experiments reported here these events were produced in small isolated segments of the CA3 subfield, measuring only 400-500 microns along the cell body layer. In such minisclices local application of either kynurenic acid or 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2-3-dione (CNQX) to the proximal basilar dendrites abolished the synchronized discharges of electrographic seizures. Interictal spikes appeared unaffected by this treatment. Application of these excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists to distal basilar dendrites or apical dendrites was ineffective. In \"larger\" minislices, measuring 700-1000 microns along the cell body layer, application of kynurenic acid, CNQX, or TTX to the proximal basilar dendrites did not abolish electrographic seizures but instead selectively suppressed the intracellularly recorded sustained depolarization and the coincident slow negative field potential recorded in proximal basilar dendrites. Results of several experiments suggest that electrographic seizures recorded under these conditions were produced by a remote network of \"generator cells.\" Since the remote neurons were unaffected by local application of the drugs, it seemed likely that they continued to undergo a sustained depolarization. Simultaneous blockade of basilar dendritic synapses in the \"generator\" population abolished electrographic seizures throughout these larger minislices. These results suggest that the sustained depolarization plays a central role in seizure generation and that it does not have to be generated in every neuron, only in a critical number of \"generator cells\" for a seizure to occur. Taken together, results presented here suggest that the sustained depolarization of electrographic seizures is a separate physiological process from the more rapid repetitive depolarizations of the seizure discharges and is required if electrographic seizures are to occur. This slow depolarization appears to be synaptically mediated and generated exclusively in proximal basilar dendrites. Therefore, in addition to the excitatory synaptic potentials involved in paroxysmal depolarization shift generation, a second form of recurrent excitation may exist in immature hippocampus. Not only is this physiological process critical for the genesis of seizures, but it also appears to be highly partitioned within the hippocampal laminae.",
