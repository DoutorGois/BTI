     "AB": "Ultracytochemical reactions for enzymatic markers were applied to study the effect of aluminum on some cell organelles of neurons in the Ammon cortex and spinal cord in rabbits. The results showed that aluminum caused an appearance of secondary lysosomes and an increase in the number of lysosomes. The latter finding was endorsed by statistical analysis of Ammon neurons using a two-sided t-test. Concomitantly, decrease of the intensity of the reaction for thiamine pyrophosphatase (TPPase) and nucleoside diphosphatase (NDPase) in the Golgi apparatus was found. The reaction for NDPase in the endoplasmic reticulum remained unchanged. Cytochemical reactions for alkaline phosphatase and Mg2+-activated adenosine triphosphatase in the plasmalemma of neurons were negative both in control and in aluminum-treated animals. Our data point to the activation of the system of intracellular digestion and suppression of the enzymatic activities (NDPase, TPPase) of the Golgi apparatus in CNS neurons of rabbits treated with aluminum.",
