     "AB": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia (HAD) has been detected in 20-30% of patients suffering AIDS. The envelope glycoprotein 120 (gp120) derived from HIV seems to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of this dementia. Likewise, the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-derived gp120 causes neurological and electrophysiological abnormalitites in cats. We have studied the effects of gp120 derived from HIV or FIV on learning and memory processing, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), hippocampal neuronal cAMP production, the sleep-waking cycle, and locomotor activity and equilibrium in rats. Results showed that while both HIV- and FIV-gp120 impaired the rat's performance in the Barnes maze task, only HIVgp120 impaired the induction and maintenance of LTP. However, both glycoproteins induced a significant decrease in the posttetanic potentiation. HIVgp120 also caused a significant reduction in cAMP production in the hippocampus. Regarding the sleep-waking cycle, HIV- and FIV-gp120 increased the waking state and slow-wave sleep 1 (SWS1), while decreasing both SWS2 and REM sleep. Locomotor activity and equilibrium were significantly altered by these glycoproteins. These results suggest that HIVgp120 causes neurophysiological abnormalities and therefore may facilitate HAD development in AIDS patients.",
