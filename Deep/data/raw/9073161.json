     "AB": "We have previously isolated from a human brain cDNA library, a new protein having two C2-like domains which interact with Ca2+ and phospholipid, and named Doc2alpha. Doc2alpha is abundantly expressed in brain, where it is highly concentrated on the synaptic vesicle fraction, and is implicated in Ca2(+)-dependent exocytosis. We have isolated here a mouse Doc2alpha cDNA and determined the localization of its mRNA in adult mouse brain. The amino acid sequence of the mouse Doc2alpha cDNA is 92% identical with that of the human counterpart. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization on adult mouse brain sections have revealed that Doc2alpha is predominantly expressed in mouse brain, where it is expressed in neuronal cells, but not in non-neuronal cells. Doc2alpha is highly expressed in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdaloid complex, and ventromedial hypothalamus nucleus, but not in the cerebellum, caudate-putamen, or ventral thalamus. These results indicate that Doc2alpha is expressed heterogeneously in mouse brain, where it is predominantly expressed in neuronal cells, and suggest that Doc2alpha plays a specific role in the area where it is expressed.",
