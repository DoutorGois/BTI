     "AB": "Hippocampal sclerosis is the most common pathological finding associated with human temporal lobe epilepsy. Histochemical study with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining was used to investigate 7 surgically resected temporal lobes with hippocampal sclerosis from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. In all 7 specimens, an abnormal but consistent pattern of staining was noted. In the hilum of the dentate gyrus, AChE-rich polymorphic cells were relatively preserved in comparison to the pyramidal neurons. In Ammon's horn, AChE fibers were lost in regions corresponding to the pyramidal cell dropout. AChE fibers were also lost along the inner portion of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, yet they were preserved within the outer portions of the molecular layer. These findings provide additional evidence for the relative selectivity of hippocampal pathology in human temporal lobe epilepsy.",
