     "AB": "We investigated the effects of histidine on spatial memory deficits induced by the 5-HT1A-receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). Working memory deficits were elicited by 8-OH-DPAT without affecting reference memory. Histidine improved the working memory deficit induced by 8-OH-DPAT at doses causing a significant increase in brain histamine content. This finding suggests that the histaminergic system regulates 8-OH-DPAT-induced working memory deficit.",
