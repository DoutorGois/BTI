     "AB": "Using a polyclonal antibody against rat TNF-alpha, we have identified specific intracellular immunoreactive sites in hippocampal pyramidal cells, astroglia, and in microglia within 72 h after a period of ischemia. Electron opaque immunoreactive products in pyramidal cells were found mainly in somata and dendrites. Astrocytes and microglia were nearly devoid of such complexes. These findings demonstrate the presence of TNF-alpha in hippocampal neurons and its enhancement by ischemic stress.",
