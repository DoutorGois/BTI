     "AB": "Neural mouse xenografts undergoing rejection in the adult recipient rat brain were characterized with regard to infiltrating host leukocytes and reactions of graft and host astro- and microglial cells. Rejection occurred within 35 days with infiltration of the grafts by in particular macrophages and T-cells as well as blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage for IgG. In the surrounding host brain microglial cells showed increased histochemical staining for nucleoside diphosphatase (NDPase) and increased immunocytochemical expression of complement receptor type 3 (CR3), while astroglial cells displayed an increased immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Light microscopic findings of rat major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen class I on microglial cells, endothelial cells and leukocytes were confirmed at the ultrastructural level and extended to include a few astrocytes. Rat and mouse MHC antigen class II was only detected on leukocytes and activated microglia. We suggest that host macrophages and activated host and xenograft microglial cells act in situ as immunostimulatory cells on T-helper cells, and that increased levels of donor MHC antigen class I may further enhance the killer activity exerted by host T-cytotoxic cells.",
