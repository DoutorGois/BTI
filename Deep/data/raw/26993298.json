     "AB": "Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), associated with fragile X syndrome, is known as an RNA-binding protein to regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level in the brain. FMRP is also involved in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis during the process of precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) into mature miRNA. However, there is no description of the effect of FMRP on primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) processing. Here, we uncover a novel role of FMRP in pri-miRNA processing via controlling Drosha translation. We show that the expression of DROSHA protein, instead of its messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, is downregulated in both the hippocampus of Fmr1-knockout mice and the FMRP-knockdown Neuro-2a cells. Overexpression or knockdown FMRP does not alter Drosha mRNA stability. Immunoprecipitation and polysome analyses demonstrate that FMRP binds to the Drosha mRNA and enhances its translation. Additionally, we show that loss of FMRP in Fmr1-deficient mice results in the accumulation of three in six analyzed pri-miRNAs and the reduction of the corresponding pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs. Thus, our data suggest that FMRP is involved in pri-miRNA processing via enhancing DROSHA expression that may play an important role in fragile X syndrome.",
