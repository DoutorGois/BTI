     "AB": "Epileptogenic stimulation (kindling) leads to an increase in recurrent inhibition in the dentate gyrus, possibly due to an increase in benzodiazepine receptors. A second, late inhibitory component also potentiates as a result of kindling. In the present experiments, the time course of the development and decay of this kindling-induced increase in inhibition was studied. Rats were kindled by stimulation of the perforant path or by direct stimulation of the dentate gyrus. Paired-pulse stimulation was applied to the perforant path and field potential measures were taken within the dentate gyrus. These procedures allowed the monitoring of inhibitory events in chronic preparations over prolonged periods. Input/output measures of the baseline responses were also monitored during the course of, and after the completion of kindling. The increase in the early component (about 20-50+ ms) of paired-pulse depression was seen after the first kindling stimulation. The increase in the late component of depression (about 100-500+ ms) did not develop until after about 10 stimulations had been delivered. The late component then decayed more rapidly than the early component after the completion of kindling. The baseline response also showed some indication of depression, particularly in the dentate gyrus kindled group, raising the possibility that feedforward inhibition had also been potentiated.",
