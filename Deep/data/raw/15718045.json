     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Hippocampal size reduction detected by three-dimensional structural magnetic resonance imaging (3D-MRI) represents an important hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, epidemiological and neuropathological studies have associated coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiovascular risk factors with AD. The present study aimed to assess whether small hippocampal size is also a feature of CAD. METHODS: Hippocampal volumes were assessed in 20 men with CAD and 20 healthy matched control subjects by use of 3D-MRI. Subjects with a history of neurological or psychiatric disorder, or signs of cognitive impairment were rigorously excluded. RESULTS: Compared with controls, subjects with CAD had significantly smaller (-14%) hippocampal volumes. Cardiovascular risk factors were not related to hippocampal volumes of CAD subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate small hippocampal size in CAD subjects without any cognitive impairment. Future studies should clarify whether the annual rate of hippocampal volume loss of persons with CAD is greater than that of healthy individuals and predicts later cognitive decline or dementia.",
