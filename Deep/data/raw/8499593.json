     "AB": "The aim of this work was to confirm the presence of calcylin in brain and to identify calcyclin positive cells. Calcyclin was identified in brain soluble proteins that were bound to phenyl-sepharose in a calcium dependent fashion. Specific antibodies against calcylin were found to stain subsets of brain neurones such as neurones in Ammons horn of hippocampus, granule cells in cerebellum, and neurones in brain stem. Glial cells which contain large amounts of S-100 beta protein were calcyclin negative. These results indicate that calcyclin is present in neurones, but not in glial cells.",
