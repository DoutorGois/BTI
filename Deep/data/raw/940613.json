Delayed evoked potentials were formed after 10-400 pairings of light flash and hypothalamic stimulation and were manifested as potentials appearing in response to a conditioned stimulus with a delay equal to the interval between conditioned and unconditional stimuli. Amygdaloid stimulation facilitated their retrieval if they were previously extinguished or did not appear during initial testing.",
