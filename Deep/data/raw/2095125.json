     "AB": "E2001 (2-(4-(p-fluorobenzoyl)-piperidin-1-yl)-2'-acetonaphthone hydrochloride, CAS 107025-80-9) is a novel anti-ischemic agent, which is reported to protect against delayed neuronal death in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. The effect of E2001 on ischemia-induced impairment of the passive avoidance response in gerbils was studied. The passive avoidance response was not disturbed by transient cerebral ischemia of 3 min duration, but was impaired by 5-min ischemia. E2001 at oral doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg significantly improved the impaired passive avoidance response induced by 5-min cerebral ischemia. It is speculated that the improvement by E2001 may be partly due to the inhibition of extracellular glutamate accumulation, and the suppression of lipid peroxides formation during cerebral ischemia.",
