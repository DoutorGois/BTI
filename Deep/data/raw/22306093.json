     "AB": "Melatonin concentration in plasma reaches high levels during the night and synchronizes body rhythms with the photoperiod. Previous evidence obtained in cultured cells suggests that melatonin synchronizes cytoskeletal re-arrangements at nocturnal plasma concentration. In this study, we determined the amount of microtubules and microfilaments in the rat hippocampus as an index of cytoskeletal organization in rats submitted to a photoperiodic regime. Additionally, these parameters were determined in control rats, sham rats, pinealectomized rats, and rats that were pinealectomized and treated with melatonin for 1 week. The results showed an increase in both the amount of microfilaments in the hippocampus of rats sacrificed in the dark phase, and in melatonin levels. In addition, a decrease in both microfilament and microtubule amounts occurred in pinealectomized rats. In contrast, melatonin treatment partially reestablished actin and tubulin proportions organized in microfilaments and microtubules, respectively. The results indicate that actin organization in microfilaments was associated with both the photoperiod and with melatonin levels. Together, the data support that cytoskeletal organization is regulated rhythmically by melatonin in synchrony with the photoperiod.",
