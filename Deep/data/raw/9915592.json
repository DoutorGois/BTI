     "AB": "We have developed a carrousel irradiator for mice which delivers a head-first and near-field radiofrequency exposure that more closely simulates cellular telephone and radio use than conventional whole body exposure systems. Mouse cadavers were placed on the carrousel irradiator and exposed with their noses 5 mm from the feedpoint of a 1.6 GHz antenna. Local measured specific absorption rates (SAR) in brain regions corresponding to the frontal cortex, medial caudate putamen, and midhippocampal areas were 2.9, 2.4, and 2.2 W/kg per watt of irradiated power, respectively. In addition, average SAR was estimated to be 3.4 W/kg per watt along the sagittal plane of the brain, 2.0 W/kg per watt along the sagittal plane of the body, and between 6.8 and 8.1 W/kg per watt at peak locations along the sagittal plane at the body surface. This detailed SAR information in mice is critical to the interpretation of biological studies of IRIDIUM exposure, and similar analysis should be included for all studies of in vivo exposure of small animals to microwaves.",
