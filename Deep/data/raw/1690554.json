For all pathological cases, the SP-like immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in the neocortical areas and in the hippocampus. This contrasted with an enhanced SP-like immunoreactivity in the pallidum and the substantia nigra in AD brains and a more pronounced SP-like immunoreactivity in the more atrophic side in the asymmetrically atrophied brains.",
