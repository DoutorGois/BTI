     "AB": "The effects of antioxidants tocopherols and ascorbic acid were tested on the survival of hippocampal and striatal neurones in dissociated culture. Alpha- and gamma-tocopherol increased the number of surviving neurones in a concentration-dependent manner. Significant effect was observed at concentrations of 10(-8)-10(-6) M. Furthermore, the promoting effect of alpha-tocopherol on neuronal survival was markedly enhanced in the presence of ascorbic acid (2 x 10(-6) M). These results indicate that tocopherols and ascorbic acid support the survival of cultured neurones by protecting them from oxidative attack.",
