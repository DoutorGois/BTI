     "AB": "The ionotropic glutamatergic receptor system, especially the subtype mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), is known to exhibit special sensitivity to the effect of ethanol. This is due partly to the ability of ethanol to modulate the production of nitric oxide through the NMDA-nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway. In this study, we examined the effects of ethanol on basal and NMDA-stimulated NOS activity in rat hippocampal slices by measuring the conversion of [(14)C]-arginine into [(14)C]-citrulline in an incubation system containing the necessary cofactors. Stimulation of hippocampal slices with NMDA (100 microM) enhanced NOS activity by 43% (n = 12). Although ethanol did not alter NOS activity when added to the incubation system during NMDA stimulation, it dose-dependently inhibited NMDA-NOS activity when added to the slices during the 90-min preincubation period. Further assay of NOS activity with brain cytosolic fraction indicated an inhibitory effect of ethanol (200 mM) when the assay was carried out in the absence of exogenous tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a redox-active cofactor for NOS. Incubation of brain homogenates resulted in a time-dependent increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation products, but ethanol did not further enhance these products. Taken together, these results provide evidence for the role of BH4 but not oxidative stress in the inhibitory effect of ethanol on NMDA-NOS activity in rat hippocampal slices.",
