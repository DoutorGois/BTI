     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression of delta subunit-containing gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA)(A) receptors in insular electrical kindled rats and analyze the significance of the findings. METHODS: A total of 48 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into 3 groups: kindled, sham-operated and control. Kindled group: chronic insular electrical kindled models of rats established by electrical stimulation. Sham-operated group: the same method of the kindled group without electrical stimulation. CONTROL GROUP: without surgery. The number of hippocampal neurons of rat epilepsy, sham-operated and control groups were detected by Nissl staining. The hippocampal expressions of delta subunit of these groups were tested by immunohistochemistry. The mRNA of delta subunit of hippocampus of these groups was detected by quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR). RESULTS: The findings of Nissl staining showed that there was no significant difference of the number of hippocampal neurons between epileptic and normal rats (P > 0.05). The findings of q-PCR showed that mRNA of delta subunit of the hippocampus of sham-operated and control groups represented much more than that of kindled group at Day 7 post-kindling (P < 0.01). The findings of immunohistochemistry showed that the hippocampal expression of delta subunit of sham-operated and control groups represented much more than that of kindled group at Day 7 post-kindling (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The hippocampal expression of delta subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors decreases in insular epilepsy. It may play an important role in the occurrence and development of insular epilepsy.",
