     "AB": "Aggregated amyloid ss-protein (Ass) is pathognomonic of Alzheimer's disease and certain assemblies of Ass are synaptotoxic. Excess glutamate or diminished glutathione reserve are both implicated in mediating or modulating Ass-induced disruption of synaptic plasticity. The system xc- antiporter promotes Na(+) -independent exchange of cystine with glutamate thereby providing a major source of extracellular glutamate and intracellular glutathione concentrations. Here we probed the ability of two drugs with opposite effects on system xc-, the inhibitor sulfasalazine and facilitator N-acetylcysteine, to modulate the ability of Ass1-42 to inhibit long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 area of the anaesthetized rat. Whereas acute systemic treatment with sulfasalazine lowered the threshold for Ass to interfere with synaptic plasticity, N-acetylcysteine prevented the inhibition of LTP by Ass alone or in combination with sulfasalazine. Moreover acute N-acetylcysteine also prevented the inhibition of LTP by TNFalpha, a putative mediator of Ass actions, and repeated systemic N-acetylcysteine treatment for 7 days reversed the delayed deleterious effect of Ass on LTP. Since both of these drugs are widely used clinically, further evaluation of their potential beneficial and deleterious actions in early Alzheimer's disease seems warranted.
