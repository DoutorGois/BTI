     "AB": "Objectives There is a significant prevalence of affective disorders including depression and anxiety in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), resulting in reduced quality of life. Since the current treatments are not generally effective, further studies are needed to find appropriate drugs to alleviate anxiety and depression symptoms in these patients. Methods The effects of a new analog of cyclomyrsinol diterpenes (TAMEC) isolated from Euphorbia sogdiana on the anxiety (open field and elevated plus maze test) and depressive-like behaviors (sucrose preference test and forced swim test) in EAE-induced C57BL/6 mice (EAE; a mouse model of MS) were investigated. Hippocampal tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-10 levels were also measured by ELISA. Results The results indicated that TAMEC treatment reduced anxiety and depression-like behavior. This drug also decreased the levels of TNF-alpha and IL1beta and increased IL-10 level in the hippocampus. Discussion Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the drug we used here can reduce anxiety and depression-like symptoms in EAE-induced mice. However, more studies are still needed to validate, expand, and generalize these data.",
