     "AB": "These studies are concerned with neuronal population theory of brain function. Neural networks the cerebral cortex and the limbic systems are investigated. We use coherence, partial coherence, phase and cycle time spectral analysis in these studies. The development of software for phase filtering has permitted us to analyze directionality of neural signal flow following coherence and partial coherence estimates. These estimates give an indication of the interaction between the brain regions studied. These data give further insights of the input and output status and the linear aspects of these interactions. Spontaneous and evoked potential analog data are analyzed to evaluate the physiological parameters of these interrelations.",
