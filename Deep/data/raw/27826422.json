     "AB": "The effectiveness and efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) preconditioning and post-treatment modalities have been demonstrated in experimental models of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, including global brain ischemia, transient focal and permanent focal cerebral ischemia, and experimental neonatal hypoxia-ischemia encephalopathy. In general, early and repetitive post-treatment of HBO appears to create enhanced protection against brain ischemia whereas delayed HBO treatment after transient focal ischemia may even aggravate brain injury. This review advocates the level of injury reduction upon HBO as an important component for translational evaluation of HBO based treatment modalities. The combined preconditioning and HBO post-treatment that would provide synergistic effects is also worth considering.",
