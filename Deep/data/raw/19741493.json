     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor-mediated inhibition in the central nervous system exists in two forms: phasic (inhibitory postsynaptic currents, IPSCs) and tonic (nonsynaptic). Phasic inhibition is further subdivided into fast (GABA(A,fast)) and slow (GABA(A,slow)) IPSCs. By virtue of its dendritic location and kinetics, GABA(A,slow) has been proposed to control synaptic plasticity and memory. Etomidate is a nonbarbiturate, intravenous anesthetic that selectively modulates GABA(A) receptors and produces amnesia at low doses in vivo. This study tested whether correspondingly low concentrations of etomidate in vitro alter GABA(A,fast) and GABA(A,slow) phasic inhibition. METHODS: Electrophysiological recordings were obtained from hippocampal slices prepared from postnatal day 3-8 mice and maintained in organotypic culture for 10-14 days. Etomidate was applied at concentrations corresponding to one-half to four times the half maximal effective concentration that impairs hippocampus-dependent learning and memory--i.e., 0.125-1.0 microm. RESULTS: Etomidate 0.25 microm (the half maximal effective concentration) doubled the time constant of decay of GABA(A,slow) IPSCs, but it had no detectable effect on GABA(A,fast) IPSCs. Higher concentrations of etomidate had stronger effects on both types of phasic inhibition: 0.5 and 1 microm etomidate prolonged the time constant of decay by 310% and 410% for GABA(A,slow) and by 25% and 78% for GABA(A,fast). Concentrations of etomidate up to 1 microm had no significant effects on the amplitudes of either GABA(A,fast) or GABA(A,slow) IPSCs. CONCLUSIONS: At concentrations that impair hippocampus-dependent memory, etomidate modulates GABA(A,slow) more strongly than GABA(A,fast) IPSCs. Effects of etomidate on GABA(A,slow) IPSCs may contribute to etomidate-induced amnesia.",
