     "AB": "Behavioral deficits following inescapable stress (learned helplessness) may serve as an animal model of depression. Previous studies using foot-shock stress to induce learned helplessness and a bar-press test for the stress-induced behavioral deficit have found increased beta-adrenergic receptor density in the hippocampus of learned helpless rats. We replicated these experiments using a tail-shock stress and the shuttle-box test. In our experiments, rats that developed learned helplessness after inescapable stress did not demonstrate any significant differences in beta-adrenergic receptor density or affinity in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, or hippocampus compared to the nonhelpless rats, nor to the tested control rats. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic receptor changes in learned helplessness may depend on the specific stress and test procedures used.",
