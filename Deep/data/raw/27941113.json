     "AB": "A 37-year-old woman with a history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes presented acutely with a decreased Glasgow Coma Scale and a diagnosis of hypoglycaemic brain injury. Her MRI highlighted bilateral hippocampi diffusion restriction and T2 hyperintensity. Clinically, she had a marked cognitive deficit, particularly of short-term, anterograde amnesia. She was managed conservatively and with intensive rehabilitation.",
