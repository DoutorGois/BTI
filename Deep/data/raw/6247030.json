     "AB": "(1) Synaptic transmission was studied in isolated transverse hippocampal slices from guinea pigs. Extracellular evoked potentials were recorded in the region CA1. (2) Changing the normal perfusion solution (containing 2 mM Ca2+) to calcium-free Ringer abolished synaptic transmission which was again restored by adding strontium. A synaptic efficacy of 25--50% ofn normal was obtained for 10 mM Sr2+. (3) Two different synaptic inputs to CA1 pyramidal cells were tested with respect to their ability to produce long-lasting synaptic potentiation after tetanization in strontium Ringer. Following a brief tetanus the field EPSP and, especially, the population spike were greatly enhanced. (4) The potentiation so produced was similar to the long-lasting potentiation seen in the normal slice, because it (i) had a very long duration (hours), (ii) was specific for the tetanized pathway, (iii) showed potentiation of both 'volley-EPSP' and 'EPSP-spike' relations, and (iv) was accompanied by short-lasting (less than 5 min) generalized depression.",
