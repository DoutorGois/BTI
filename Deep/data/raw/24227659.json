     "AB": "PURPOSE: To report a systematic investigation of variations in brain T1rho (T1-rho) values over adulthood, and present normative values for cortical gray matter, juxtacortical white matter, selected white matter tracts and subcortical structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one healthy control subjects (23 males aged 18-76 years and 18 females aged 21-73 years) were imaged at 3.0 Tesla (T) using a novel whole-brain T1rho-weighted fluid suppressed three-dimensional turbo spin echo technique. T1rho maps were calculated and atlas-based segmentation used to determine regional T1rho values. Linear regression was used to determine changes in T1rho with age. RESULTS: T1rho values showed significant decreases with age in cortical gray matter (P < 0.001), left and right caudate (P = 0.004/0.006), putamen (P = 0.001, P < 0.001), hippocampus (P = 0.039/0.010), amygdala (P = 0.002/0.001), and nucleus accumbens (P = 0.001/0.002). Significant increases with age (P < 0.05) were observed in all the white matter tracts considered, except the corticospinal tracts and forceps major. CONCLUSION: T1rho demonstrates changes related to the processes of normal aging.",
