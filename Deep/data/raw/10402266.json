     "AB": "Animal experiments have already shown that neurotransmitters and neuropeptides are not only important for normal functioning of the adult central nervous system (CNS) but are also crucial to its development. However, information on the spatio-temporal distribution of these endogenous substances in the developing human CNS is still scarce. With the use of immunocytochemical staining and a constant supply of properly fixed human abortuses from southern China, an early appearance of acetylcholinesterase, enkephalin, and substance P immunoreactivities was detected first in the spinal cord (weeks 5 to 7 of gestation), then in the brainstem nuclei (weeks 11 to 12). Their overlapping localizations in many regions of the CNS suggest possible interactions among neurons containing these substances, which are in turn important for the proper establishment of the neuronal circuitry. Immunoreactivity for neuropeptide Y appeared initially in the lateral region of upper segments of the spinal cord at week 12 of gestation, then spread latero-medially and cranio-caudally to the sacral region. In the hippocampus, neuropeptide Y neurons appeared from week 15 onwards. Serotoninergic neurons were found in the dorsal raphe nucleus at week 10 and then decreased in number as the fetus grew older. Somatostatin releasing inhibitory factor, vasopressin, and oxytocin were detected in the hypothalamus from weeks 12 to 14 onwards, and monoamine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, parvalbumin, calbindin D28K, and vasoactive intestinal peptide were found in the visual cortex at midgestation. The early appearance and the abundance of the neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the developing CNS indicate that they may play a key role in neuronal differentiation.",
