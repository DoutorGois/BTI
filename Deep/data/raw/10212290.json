     "AB": "This work determined Ca2+ transport processes that contribute to the rise in cytosolic Ca2+ during in vitro ischemia (deprivation of oxygen and glucose) in the hippocampus. The CA1 striatum radiatum of rat hippocampal slices was monitored by confocal microscopy of calcium green-1. There was a 50-60% increase in fluorescence during 10 min of ischemia after a 3 min lag period. During the first 5 min of ischemia the major contribution was from Ca2+ entering via NMDA receptors; most of the fluorescence increase was blocked by MK-801. Approximately one-half of the sustained increase in fluorescence during 10 min of ischemia was caused by activation of Ca2+ release from mitochondria via the mitochondrial 2Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. Inhibition of Na+ influx across the plasmalemma using lidocaine, low extracellular Na+, or the AMPA/kainate receptor blocker CNQX reduced the fluorescence increase by 50%. The 2Na+-Ca2+ exchange blocker CGP37157 also blocked the increase, and this effect was not additive with the effects of blocking Na+ influx. When added together, CNQX and lidocaine inhibited the fluorescence increase more than CGP37157 did. Thus, during ischemia, Ca2+ entry via NMDA receptors accounts for the earliest rise in cytosolic Ca2+. Approximately 50% of the sustained rise is attributable to Na+ entry and subsequent Ca2+ release from the mitochondria via the 2Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. Sodium entry is also hypothesized to compromise clearance of cytosolic Ca2+ by routes other than mitochondrial uptake, probably by enhancing ATP depletion, accounting for the large inhibition of the Ca2+ increase by the combination of CNQX and lidocaine.",
