     "AB": "This letter examines the results of input-output (nonparametric) modeling based on the analysis of data generated by a mechanism-based (parametric) model of CA3-CA1 neuronal connections in the hippocampus. The motivation is to obtain biological insight into the interpretation of such input-output (Volterra-equivalent) models estimated from synthetic data. The insights obtained may be subsequently used to interpretat input-output models extracted from actual experimental data. Specifically, we found that a simplified parametric model may serve as a useful tool to study the signal transformations in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 regions. Input-output modeling of model-based synthetic data show that GABAergic interneurons are responsible for regulating neuronal excitation, controlling the precision of spike timing, and maintaining network oscillations, in a manner consistent with previous studies. The input-output model obtained from real data exhibits intriguing similarities with its synthetic-data counterpart, demonstrating the importance of a dynamic resonance in the system/model response around 2 Hz to 3 Hz. Using the input-output model from real data as a guide, we may be able to amend the parametric model by incorporating more mechanisms in order to yield better-matching input-output model. The approach we present can also be applied to the study of other neural systems and pathways.",
