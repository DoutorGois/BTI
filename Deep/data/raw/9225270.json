     "PG": "461-5",
     "AB": "The elevation of extracellular 5-HT after systemic administration of 5-HT reuptake inhibiting drugs is strongly potentiated by agents capable of blocking 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the midbrain raphe. The present in vivo microdialysis study was aimed at assessing the relative importance of 5-HT reuptake inhibition versus 5-HT1A autoreceptor blockade in this interaction. Citalopram (0.5 or 5.0 mg/kg s.c.) dose-dependently increased dialysate 5-HT in the rat ventral hippocampus, maximally doubling the initial baseline values within 60 min after injection. The selective 5-HT1A receptor blocker, WAY100635 (0.01-0.3 mg/kg s.c.), further augmented, in a dose-dependent manner, the high-dose citalopram response (to approximately 4-5 x the pre-citalopram baseline). For comparison, the effect of low-dose (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) citalopram was mildly, but not significantly, potentiated by WAY100635 (0.3 mg/kg). WAY100635 given alone does not alter 5-HT under these conditions. The data confirm previous findings that 5-HT1A autoreceptor blockade enhances the citalopram-induced increase of extracellular 5-HT in the forebrain. To the extent the extracellular levels of 5-HT is a valid index, through 5-HT reuptake blockade appears to be the primary prerequisite for this interaction to occur. New drugs and/or treatment regimes based on the SSRI/5-HT1A autoreceptor blocker combination concept should, therefore, emphasize the former property.",
