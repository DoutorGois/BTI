     "AB": "The neurotrophin family of growth factors has received enormous attention recently for its role in modulating synaptic strength in the developing and adult nervous system. Several recent studies have indicated a role for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of long-lasting plasticity observed at synapses in the hippocampus and other brain areas. The late-phase (L-LTP; e.g. > 2 h) of LTP has been shown to require the synthesis of new proteins. We have examined whether BDNF or other TrkB ligands participate in L-LTP in two ways: by examining transgenic mice which lack BDNF or by acutely blocking TrkB function using function-blocking antibodies. Slices from BDNF knock-out animals or slices treated with TrkB antibodies failed to exhibit L-LTP, indicating that TrkB ligands participate in extending synaptic enhancement from a short-lasting to a long-lasting form.",
