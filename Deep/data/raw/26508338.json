     "AB": "Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common complication in critically ill patients and is associated with a poor prognosis. However, the precise mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced cognitive impairment remain largely to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) activation-mediated neurotoxicity is involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced cognitive impairment. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation/perforation (CLP). The animals were randomly divided into the following five groups: Sham + vehicle group; Sham + 1-methyl-D, L-tryptophan group; Sham + L-Kynurenine group; CLP + vehicle group; or CLP + 1-methyl-D, L-tryptophan group. The survival rate was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Behavioral tests were performed by the open field and fear conditioning tests at days 13 and 14 after operation. In the present study, we demonstrated that sepsis induced a deficit in hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairment in a mouse model of SAE. Furthermore, a single peripheral kynurenine administration, the metabolic product of IDO, induced a deficit in the cognitive impairment in the sham mice. However, mice treated with IDO inhibitor 1-methyl-D, L-tryptophan were protected from sepsis-induced cognitive impairment. In conclusion, our study implicates IDO-dependent neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism as a critical factor responsible for the sepsis-induced cognitive impairment and a potential novel target for the treatment of SAE.",
