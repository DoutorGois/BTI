     "AB": "N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) is an alkylating agent having genotoxic potential to cause gene mutations and antiproliferative cytotoxic activity on developing brains to cause microcephaly by mid-gestational exposure in rodents. This study investigated the transient genotoxic and cytocidal effect of MNU at the beginning of the subgranular zone (SGZ) formation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus on neurogenesis in later life using rats. Pregnant rats were injected with MNU at 0 (vehicle controls), 1 or 3mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally from gestational day (GD) 18 to GD 20 once a day. In offspring, effects were observed at 3mg/kg. Fetal brains on GD 21 after the last MNU injection increased TUNEL(+) apoptotic cells in the tertiary germinal matrices. At postnatal day (PND) 21 on weaning, offspring displayed decrease of doublecortin (Dcx)(+) cells and cell proliferation in the SGZ and increase of calbindin (Calb1)(+) interneurons in the dentate hilus. Postnatal single bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) injection on PND 3 resulted in an increase of BrdU(+)/Dcx(+) cells. On PND 77, Dcx(+) cells recovered in number, but cell proliferation increased in the SGZ. Thus, late-gestational maternal MNU exposure may induce reversible reductions of type-3 progenitor and/or immature granule cells and cell proliferation on weaning in response to progenitor cell apoptosis, as well as delayed neurogenesis due to cell cycle arrest. Increases of Calb1(+) interneurons on weaning and SGZ cell proliferation later on may reflect compensatory mechanism for MNU-induced aberrant neurogenesis. Considering the lack of effects on PND 77, MNU may mainly target transient populations of highly proliferative progenitor cells without affecting their stem cells to undergo progenitor production. Protective and plasticity mechanism may be operated against genotoxic agents on hippocampal neurogenesis.",
