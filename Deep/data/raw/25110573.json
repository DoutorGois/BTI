     "AB": "The LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) family of transcription factors is well known for its functions during several developmental processes including cell fate specification, cell migration and axon guidance, and its members play fundamental roles in hippocampal development. The hippocampus is a structure that displays striking activity dependent plasticity. We examined whether LIM-HD genes and their co-factors are regulated during kainic acid induced seizure in the adult rat hippocampus as well as in early postnatal rats, when the hippocampal circuitry is not fully developed. We report a distinct and field-specific regulation of LIM-HD genes Lhx1, Lhx2, and Lhx9, LIM-only gene Lmo4, and cofactor Clim1a in the adult hippocampus after seizure induction. In contrast none of these genes displayed altered levels upon induction of seizure in postnatal animals. Our results provide evidence of temporal and spatial seizure mediated regulation of LIM-HD family members and suggest that LIM-HD gene function may be involved in activity dependent plasticity in the adult hippocampus.",
