     "AB": "Piloerection is a rare ictal manifestation of temporal lobe epilepsy. The case is a 38-year-old man with acute onset of repetitive pilomotor seizures. Lacking other symptoms implicating epileptic seizures, a month passed before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Ictal electroencephalography revealed rhythmic waves in the right temporal area. Reversible magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities were visible in the right hippocampus, right uncus, and right amygdala. The appropriate antiepileptic drug therapy made him seizure-free, but following MRI, he showed right hippocampal atrophy one year after seizure cessation. This case is significant in that we can follow sequential MRI from onset, and it is meaningful for considering the mesial temporal area as involved with piloerection.",
