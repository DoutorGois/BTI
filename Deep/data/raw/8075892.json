     "AB": "1. The in vivo effects of the high affinity sigma ligands 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine (DTG), (+)-N-cyclopropylmethyl-N-methyl-1,4-diphenyl-1- ethyl-but-3-en-1-ylamine hydrochloride (JO-1784), (+)-pentazocine and haloperidol, as well as of those of neuropeptide Y (NPY), on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)- and quisqualate (Quis)-induced neuronal activations of CA3 pyramidal neurones were assessed, using extracellular unitary recording, in control rats and in rats pretreated with a local injection of pertussis toxin (PTX), to evaluate the possible involvement of Gi/o proteins in mediating the potentiation of the neuronal response to NMDA by the activation of sigma receptors in the dorsal hippocampus. 2. Microiontophoretic applications as well as intravenous injections of (+)-pentazocine potentiated selectively the NMDA response in control rats as well as in PTX-pretreated animals. In contrast, the PTX pretreatment abolished the potentiation of the NMDA response by DTG, JO-1784 and NPY. Moreover, microiontophoretic applications of DTG induced a reduction of NMDA-induced neuronal activation. Neither in control nor in PTX-treated rats, did the sigma ligands and NPY have any effect on Quis-induced neuronal response. 3. In PTX-treated rats, the potentiation of the NMDA response induced by (+)-pentazocine was suppressed by haloperidol, whereas the reduction of the NMDA response by DTG was not affected by haloperidol. 4. This study provides the first in vivo functional evidence that sigma ligands and NPY modulate the NMDA response by acting on distinct receptors, differentiated by their PTX sensitivity.",
