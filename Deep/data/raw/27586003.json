     "AB": "In a group of older adults with very mild dementia, we aimed to characterize the nature and magnitude of cognitive decline as measured by the Cogstate Brief Battery, in relation to Abeta levels and hippocampal volume. Participants were characterized according to their status on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. A total of 308 individuals who were CDR 0 and had low cerebral Abeta levels (Abeta-), 32 individuals who were Abeta- and CDR 0.5, and 43 individuals who were Abeta+ and CDR 0.5 were included in this study. Participants completed the CogState brief battery at baseline, and at 18-, 36-, 54- and 72-month follow-up. Linear mixed model analyses indicated that relative to the Abeta- CDR 0 group, the Abeta+ CDR 0.5 group showed increased rates of memory decline and hippocampal volume loss. However, compared to the Abeta- CDR 0 group, the Abeta- CDR 0.5 group showed no changes in cognitive function or hippocampal volume over 72 months. The results of this study confirm that in individuals with very mild dementia, who also have biomarker confirmation of Abeta+, changes in cognitive function manifest primarily as deterioration in memory processing, and this is associated with hippocampal volume loss. Conversely, the absence of any cognitive decline or loss in hippocampal volume in individuals with very mild dementia but who are Abeta- suggests that some other non-AD disease process may underlie any static impairment in cognitive function.",
