     "AB": "Microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) are central to the development of normal neuronal cytoarchitecture and have been reported to be altered in schizophrenia. In 12 schizophrenic (DSM-III-R criteria) and 12 control hippocampi, we estimated the MAP2 immunoreactive dendritic length using antibodies that recognize total MAP2 (MAP2-T), and a non-phosphorylated form of MAP2 (MAP2-NP). Within the corona ammonis (CA) subregions, and the subiculum, we estimated, for each antibody, the length of the immunoreactive dendritic arborisation using a stereological length estimation technique based on Bouffon's Needle principle and image analysis computer software. Controlling for the confounding effects of age and post-mortem delay, we have found an elevation in overall MAP2-NP immunoreactive dendritic length among schizophrenic subjects in the CA3 (F=5.9, p=0.03), CA2 (F=6.5, p=0.02), CA1 (F=8.3, p=0.01) and subicular (F=9.5, p=0.008) hippocampal subregions. Similar analyses of MAP2-T immunoreactive dendritic length demonstrated significant elevations in the CA1 (F=8.3, p=0.02), CA4 (F=4.9, p=0.04) and subicular (F=7.4, p=0.01) regions. The findings of this quantitative study of increased MAP2 immunoreactive dendritic arborisation in schizophrenia are most likely to reflect either an altered dendritic arborisation or a generalised increase in levels of MAP2 with the hippocampal pyramidal neurons. These findings add to the growing literature indicating the presence of synaptodendritic abnormalities in schizophrenia.",
