     "AB": "This study aimed at an analysis of expression of epidermal-type and brain-type fatty acid-binding proteins (E-FABP and B-FABP, also called FABP5 and FABP7, respectively) in adult hippocampus and their potential value as neuroprotective factors after ischemic brain damage in monkey model. The immunostaining and Western blotting results show that FABP5 was mainly expressed in neurons, whereas FABP7 was primarily expressed in astrocytes and progenitors of the subgranular zone (SGZ). Interestingly, FABP5 expression in neurons increased in cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) and remains stable within dentate gyrus (DG) after ischemia; FABP7 expression increased within both CA1 and SGZ. This indicates a potential role for FABP5 and FABP7 in intracellular fatty acid transport within different neural cells. The change in FABP5-7 expression within CA1 and DG of the adult postischemic hippocampus was compatible with previous findings of downregulation in CA1 neurons and upregulation in SGZ progenitor cells after ischemia. Altogether, the present data suggest that polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid, may act via FABP5 or 7 to regulate adult postischemic hippocampal neuronal antiapoptosis or neurogenesis in primates.",
