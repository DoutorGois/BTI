     "AB": "Estradiol rapidly activates, within minutes, various physiological functions and behaviors including cognition in rodents. This review describes rapid effects of estradiol on hippocampal dependent learning and memory tasks in rodents. Mechanisms underlying the memory enhancements including the activation of signaling molecules and the enhancement of dendritic spinogenesis are briefly reviewed. In addition, the role of estradiol in the cognitive resilience to chronic stress exhibited only in females is discussed including contributions of ovarian as well as intra-hippocampally derived estrogens to this sex difference. Finally, speculations on possible physiologic functions for rapid mnemonic changes mediated by estrogens are made. Overall, the emergence of a novel and powerful mechanism for regulation of cognition by estradiol is described.",
