     "AB": "Although the microglial activation is concomitant to the Alzheimer's disease, its precise role (neuroprotection vs neurodegeneration) has not yet been resolved. Here, we show the existence of an age-dependent phenotypic change of microglial activation in the hippocampus of PS1xAPP model, from an alternative activation state with Abeta phagocytic capabilities (at 6 months) to a classic cytotoxic phenotype (expressing TNF-alpha and related factors) at 18 months of age. This switch was coincident with high levels of soluble Abeta oligomers and a significant pyramidal neurodegeneration. In vitro assays, using astromicroglial cultures, demonstrated that oligomeric Abeta42 and soluble extracts from 18-month-old PS1xAPP hippocampus produced a potent TNF-alpha induction whereas monomeric Abeta42 and soluble extract from 6- or 18-month-old control and 6-month-old PS1xAPP hippocampi produced no stimulation. This stimulatory effect was avoided by immunodepletion using 6E10 or A11. In conclusion, our results show evidence of a switch in the activated microglia phenotype from alternative, at the beginning of Abeta pathology, to a classical at advanced stage of the disease in this model. This change was induced, at least in part, by the age-dependent accumulation of extracellular soluble Abeta oligomers. Finally, these cytotoxic activated microglial cells could participate in the neuronal lost observed in AD.",
