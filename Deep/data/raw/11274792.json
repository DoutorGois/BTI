     "AB": "The present studies were undertaken to characterize the regional and temporal patterns of neurotrophin messenger RNA and protein levels for beta-nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 in the developing CNS. We have examined the levels of these neurotrophin messenger RNAs with ribonuclease protection assays and corresponding protein levels with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in the developing Long-Evans rat hippocampus, neocortex and cerebellum on postnatal days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 92. In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to localize the neurotrophins in these developing brain regions. Results indicated that in neocortex and hippocampus, messenger RNA for both nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor increased in an age-dependent manner, reaching a plateau by postnatal day 14. In the neocortex, nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein levels both peaked at postnatal day 14. In hippocampus, nerve growth factor protein peaked at postnatal day 7 while brain-derived neurotrophic factor peaked at postnatal day 14. In cerebellum, nerve growth factor messenger RNA levels were flat, while nerve growth factor protein peaked at postnatal day 7. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA increased in an age-dependent manner while the pattern for its protein levels was mixed. Neurotrophin-3 messeger RNA levels increased in an age-dependent manner in hippocampus, peaked at postnatal day14 in cerebellum, and no changes occurred in neocortex. Neurotrophin-3 protein was at its peak at postnatal day 1 and thereafter decreased at other postnatal days in all three brain regions. Results of neurotrophin immunohistochemistry often paralleled and complemented enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay data, demonstrating specific cell groups containing neurotrophin proteins in these regions. Within each region, patterns with regard to messenger RNA and respective protein levels for each neurotrophin were unique. No consistent relationship between patterns of neurotrophin messenger RNAs and their cognate proteins was observed between regions. The different regional patterns for neurotrophin messengerRNA and protein levels in each brain region indicate that messenger RNA studies of neurotrophin messenger RNA must be augmented by protein determination to fully characterize spatial and temporal neurotrophin distribution.",
