     "AB": "Grape seed extract (GSE) possess cardioprotective abilities by functioning as in vivo antioxidants and by virtue of their ability to directly scavenge ROS including hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of grape seed extract (GSE) in the gerbil hippocampus after 5 min transient forebrain ischemia. Neuronal cell density in GSE-treated ischemic animals was significantly increased as compared with vehicle-treated ischemic animals 4 days after ischemic insult. In the GSE-treated groups, about 60% of pyramidal cells of the sham-operated group were stained with cresyl violet 4 days after ischemic insult. In this study, we found that GSE had neuroprotective effects on neuronal injury by inhibiting DNA damage in the CA1 region after ischemia. In vehicle-treated groups, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) immunoreactivity was significantly changed time-dependently, whereas the immunoreactivity in the GSE-treated group was similar to the sham-operated group. In addition, we confirmed that astrocytes and microglia did not show significant activation in the CA1 region 4 days after ischemia-reperfusion, because many CA1 pyramidal cells were not damaged. Therefore, these results suggest that GSE can protect ischemic neuronal damage by inhibiting DNA damage after transient forebrain ischemia.",
