     "AB": "Protein kinase B (PKB, or Akt), a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-K), can play a critical role in regulating neuronal survival. Among known targets of PKB, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is inhibited by PKB-mediated phosphorylation. Recent studies implicate GSK-3 as a physiologically relevant principal regulatory target of the PI-3-K/PKB survival pathway. Here we show that SB-216763 and SB-415286, selective small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3, protected cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons and hippocampal neurons against excitotoxicity mediated by NMDA and non-NMDA receptor agonists. Treatment with SB-216763 and SB-415286 was optimal when initiated 6-7 days before excitotoxin exposure. As GSK-3 can modulate transcriptional events, these results may provide insight into the identification of new neuroprotective targets.",
