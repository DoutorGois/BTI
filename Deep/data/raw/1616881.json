     "AB": "Type I corticosteroid receptors were determined in cytosol from hippocampus (HIPPO) and amygdala (AMYG), using [3H]aldosterone (ALDO), [3H]dexamethasone (DEX) or the mineralocorticoid antagonist [3H]ZK 91587 as ligands. Incubations with the first two compounds also contained the pure glucocorticoid RU 28362 to block type II receptors. Binding of the three ligands was comparable in cytosol from HIPPO and it was slightly higher for [3H]DEX in AMYG. However, after heat-induced receptor transformation, binding to DNA-cellulose was observed for [3H]ALDO-receptor complex obtained from HIPPO or AMYG, whereas it was negligible for [3H]ZK 91587. Receptors charged with [3H]DEX or [3H]ALDO showed similar retention on DNA-cellulose columns in the case of the AMYG, while binding to the polynucleotide was higher for [3H]ALDO in the HIPPO. Finally, only [3H]ALDO was taken up to a significant extent in purified cell nuclei prepared from slices of HIPPO and AMYG previously incubated with the three ligands. It is concluded that binding of a natural agonist steroid may be a prerequisite for type I receptor transformation and translocation from the cytoplasm into the nuclear fraction. DEX binding to type I receptors resembles a partial agonist with antagonist properties, whereas antagonists such as ZK 91587 are bound and retained in cytoplasm, without further translocation.",
