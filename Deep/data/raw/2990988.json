     "AB": "Administration of estradiol to gonadectomized female, but not male rats, is associated with increased activity of choline acetyltransferase in the medial aspect of the horizontal diagonal band nucleus, the frontal cortex, and CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus. Four other basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei did not show changes in choline acetyltransferase activity after estradiol. These data have implications for possible benefits of estradiol administration to patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type.",
