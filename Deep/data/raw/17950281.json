     "AB": "Hypoxia-ischemia is relatively common in human infants. Hypoxia-ischemia can occur as a result of complications associated with prematurity or birth, frequently leading to altered brain development and cognitive and behavioral deficits that persist throughout life. Despite the relative frequency of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, the immature brain sustains relatively less damage than an adult who experiences a similar crisis of oxygen and nutrient deprivation. Therefore, factors may be present that protect the developing brain. During late gestation, the infant brain encounters high levels of the steroid hormone 17beta-estradiol. This observation, combined with evidence supporting 17beta-estradiol as a neuroprotective agent, led us to hypothesize that increasing the basal level of 17beta-estradiol would reduce the amount of hypoxia-ischemia induced injury to the neonatal brain. To test that hypothesis we administered 17beta-estradiol using either a repeated dosing paradigm or a single dose paradigm to immature male and female rats. Here we show that the repeated dosing paradigm (three doses of 17beta-estradiol) provided approximately 70% protection of the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and amygdala. By contrast, a single administration of 17beta-estradiol 24 h prior to hypoxia-ischemia conferred little protection. The only exception was the pyramidal layer of the female hippocampus, which was modestly protected (16% reduction in damage). The protection afforded by the multiple administrations of 17beta-estradiol was similar for females and males, with the only exception being the male amygdala, which displayed less damage than the female amgydala. We conclude that 17beta-estradiol acts as a potent neuroprotective agent against hypoxia-ischemia induced damage to the developing brain, and that pretreating infants at risk for hypoxic-ischemic injury may be advisable.",
