     "AB": "Our previous morphologic studies in the rat demonstrated that exposure to lead during the preweaning period induced delays in the maturation of late-developing regions of the hippocampal formation at 15 days of age, followed by normal development or hypertrophy of the same areas in young adulthood. The present study was carried out to determine whether or not subtle or latent effects of such exposure to lead may be unmasked with the additional challenge of aging. To do this, mid-dorsal sections of the hippocampal formation from middle-aged (578-631 days old) Long-Evans control rats and from rats exposed to lead from birth until weaning via dams drinking 0.2% lead acetate were analyzed by light and electron microscopy. Exposure to lead did not alter areas of either neuropil or neuronal layers of the hippocampus or the dentate gyrus or the numbers per section or numerical densities (numbers per unit area) of neurons in hippocampal CA3 stratum pyramidale or dentate stratum granulosum. It did reduce mean size of complex invaginated mossy fiber synapses without altering their numbers in the proximal (close to dentate gyrus) mossy fiber zone, which was the zone also affected at 15 and 90 days of age in our previous studies.",
