     "AB": "Heterogeneous ribonuclear protein U (hnRNP U/SAF-A) is a nuclear multi-potent regulatory protein. We investigated whether hnRNP U protein and transcript levels undergo circadian changes by immunoblot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. In the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), hnRNP U immunoreactivity (ir) changed in a robust circadian pattern as it showed a peak at late nighttime in both light/dark and constant dark conditions. hnRNP U transcript levels in the SCN changed in a similar circadian pattern. In the hippocampus, hnRNP transcript levels also showed a peak at late nighttime but hnRNP U-ir showed an opposite pattern as it peaked at late daytime. These findings suggest that hnRNP U participates in nuclear regulatory events that are involved in mammalian central and peripheral circadian clocks.",
