     "AB": "Patients with schizophrenia routinely fail to perform affect recognition tasks as accurately as healthy controls. The investigation of performance-related changes in cerebral activation in healthy subjects may facilitate the understanding of adaptation processes to different levels of difficulty and help to interpret the activation changes found in schizophrenic patients. Nine first hospitalized partly remitted schizophrenic patients and 10 healthy controls participated in an fMRI study with a facial affect discrimination and labeling task. Seven of the 10 healthy subjects were reexamined with changed stimulus conditions adapted according to the mean accuracy scores detected in schizophrenic patients. Controls showed a significantly increased activation of the right gyrus frontalis medialis with rising task difficulty during both tasks. The schizophrenic patients demonstrated a significantly decreased activation of the anterior cingulate during facial affect discrimination and of the amygdala-hippocampal complex bilaterally during facial affect labeling. In addition, an increased activation of the gyrus frontalis medialis bilaterally became apparent in the schizophrenic patients. It is suggested that the latter may reflect a compensatory effort for deficits in more basal limbic functions.",
