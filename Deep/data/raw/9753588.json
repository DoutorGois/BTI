     "AB": "The fundamental concept that synapse growth and change are associated with learning is considered a \"replay\" of early neurodevelopmental principles that instruct neural connectivity pattern. Common mechanisms suggested to link the process of memory formation through synaptic elaboration are exemplified by the activity of cell adhesion molecules following learning and that center on waves of glycoprotein synthesis occurring in the 6- to 8-h and 10- to 12-h posttraining periods of consolidation. These are associated with spatially clustered granule cells in the adult rat hippocampus that show a transient time-dependent increase in ribosome production and greater microtubular complexity and dendritic spine number 6 to 8 h following training. The elimination and/or selection of the synapses to be retained in the memory trace is proposed to be dependent on cell adhesion molecule glycosylation events in the 10- to 12-h posttraining period. The existence of similar cell adhesion molecule glycosylation mechanisms within a corticohippocampal pathway is used to contribute to a model of memory in which sensory representations are eventually consolidated through relative change in synaptic weightings.",
