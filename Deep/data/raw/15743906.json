     "AB": "The majority of excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain form on filopodia and spines, actin-rich membrane protrusions present on neuronal dendrites. The biochemical events that induce filopodia and remodel these structures into dendritic spines remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the neuronal actin- and protein phosphatase-1-binding protein, neurabin-I, promotes filopodia in neurons and nonneuronal cells. Neurabin-I actin-binding domain bundled F-actin, promoted filopodia, and delayed the maturation of dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons. In contrast, dimerization of neurabin-I via C-terminal coiled-coil domains and association of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) with neurabin-I through a canonical KIXF motif inhibited filopodia. Furthermore, the expression of a neurabin-I polypeptide unable to bind PP1 delayed the maturation of neuronal filopodia into spines, reduced the synaptic targeting of AMPA-type glutamate (GluR1) receptors, and decreased AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. Reduction of endogenous neurabin levels by interference RNA (RNAi)-mediated knockdown also inhibited the surface expression of GluR1 receptors. Together, our studies suggested that disrupting the functions of a cytoskeletal neurabin/PP1 complex enhanced filopodia and impaired surface GluR1 expression in hippocampal neurons, thereby hindering the morphological and functional maturation of dendritic spines.",
