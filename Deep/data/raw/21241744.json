     "AB": "Dissociated hippocampal neuron culture has long been the model system of choice for many neuroscientists. The ability to culture dissociated hippocampal neurons from genetically modified mice provides an invaluable tool for studying many neuronal processes. In this study, we established a novel method to culture dissociated hippocampal neurons from embryonic and neonatal mice. Dissociated neurons were cultured in a microchamber between the glass coverslip and the plastic cell container without the use of glial feeder cells. Our method significantly simplifies the preparation while produces healthy and long-lived neuronal cultures that are difficult to achieve without the use of feeder cells.",
