     "AB": "We examined the effect of interleukin-6 (human recombinant) on glutamate-induced neuronal death of cultured 20-day fetal rat hippocampal neurons. After 7 days in culture, the hippocampal neurons were markedly degenerated by the addition of L-glutamate and also N-methyl-D-aspartate. The neuronal death was prevented by the addition of MK801, a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist. Interleukin-6 at the concentration of 50 ng/ml has a significant preventive effect on the glutamate-induced neuronal death. Basic fibroblast growth factor at the concentration of 100 ng/ml gave also significant protective effect on hippocampal neurons, but nerve growth factor was ineffective in preventing the toxicity. It has been postulated that glutamate plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neuronal death such as ischemia and the various neurological diseases. Interleukin-6 might have somewhat physiological or pathological role in these events.",
