     "AB": "In order to determine whether an amino acid may act as a neurotransmitter in the perforant pathway we examined the effect of lesion of rat entorhinal cortex on the concentrations of various amino acids in the hippocampus proper and fascia dentata. Only the aspartic acid content was found significantly decreased after the lesion. This decreases is not due to a loss from target cells of the perforant pathway, but rather to a loss from its degenerating terminals.",
