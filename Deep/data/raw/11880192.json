     "AB": "A serine protease neuropsin expressed in the hippocampus of adult brain has been implicated in synaptic plasticity. We report here that endogenous neuropsin was localized extracellularly in neuronal cell bodies and their neurites in mouse hippocampal cultures. Furthermore, we found that, in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, recombinant neuropsin enhanced neurite projection from soma after 14 h of culture and neuronal aggregation with neurite fascicles at 48 h. This suggests that neuropsin is involved in neurite outgrowth and fasciculation during the development of the nervous system.",
