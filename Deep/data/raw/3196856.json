Both 1 and 2 application (5 mkM, 15 min) reduced paired-pulse inhibition (PPI). Single-pulse and frequency stimulation revealed population spike (PS) increase or generation of additional PS after 1 or 2 application, the former drug being more active at all stimulation patterns. 3 had no definitive activity in the test-system used. The data obtained suggest similarity of pharmacological profiles of 1 and 2, and anxiogenic activity of 2 in vivo.",
