     "AB": "The electrical field application technique has revealed that the electrotonic length of the distal apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurones is long compared to the rest of the cell. This difference may be due to an asymmetrical distribution of channels responsible for the leak conductance in distal and proximal membrane segments. One such conductance, the hyperpolarization-activated cation current, I(h), is reported to display an increasing density with distance from the soma along the apical dendrite. Such asymmetry of I(h) could be a major cause of the increased electrotonic length of the distal apical dendrite. In the present study we found that blockade of I(h), by bath application of Cs(+) (3 mM) or ZD7288 (20 microM), reduced the electrical field-induced transmembrane polarization (TMP) in the distal apical dendrites. In some neurones the polarization reversed polarity, reflecting a movement of the indifference point (site of zero polarization) from the distal dendrites, across the recording site to a more proximal position. These effects were more pronounced when Cs(+) and ZD7288 were applied locally to the distal apical dendrites. Bath application of another antagonist of leak conductance, Ba(2+) (1 mM), also decreased the average field-induced polarization. This latter effect, however, did not reach statistical significance. These data suggest that I(h) is partly responsible for the distal location of the indifference point, and indicate that an elevated activity of I(h) contributes to the relatively increased electrotonic length of the most distal part of the apical dendrites.",
