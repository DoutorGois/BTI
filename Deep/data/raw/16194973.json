     "AB": "This review considers event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of human recognition memory that have or have not reported activations within the medial temporal lobes (MTL). For comparisons both between items at study (encoding) and between items at test (recognition), MTL activations are characterized as left/right, anterior/posterior, and hippocampus/surrounding cortex, and as a function of the stimulus material and relevance of item/source information. Though no clear pattern emerges, there are trends suggesting differences between item and source information, and verbal and spatial information, and a role for encoding processes during recognition tests. Important future directions are considered.",
