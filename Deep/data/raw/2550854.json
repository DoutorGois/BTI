     "AB": "We examined the role of phosphoinositide turnover in muscarinic rhythmic slow activity (RSA; also called theta) in rat CA3 pyramidal neurons. Pre-incubation of hippocampal slices in pertussis toxin (which inhibits some GTP-binding proteins) or in Li+ (which blocks inositol phosphate degradation, and thereby decreases the resynthesis of phosphoinositides), prevented the induction of RSA by carbachol. Phorbol esters, which can activate protein kinase C (PKC) directly, did not induce RSA but inhibited muscarinic RSA. We infer that muscarinic RSA involves a GTP-binding protein linked increase in phosphoinositide turnover, while the activation of PKC may have a negative feedback role.",
