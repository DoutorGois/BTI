     "AB": "The binding of [3H]physalaemin [( 3H]PHY) to rat brain membranes is specific, saturable and reversible in the presence of monovalent cations and peptidase inhibitors. Monovalent cations increase the binding of [3H]PHY in an ionic strength (mu)-dependent manner with an optimal effect at mu higher than 0.3. Addition of 2.5 mM MnCl2 results in a 2-fold increase in the affinity (KD) and a 40% increase in the maximal receptor density (Bmax). Scatchard analysis under these conditions indicates the existence of a single population of noninteracting sites with KD of 3.6 nM and a Bmax of 76 fmol/mg of protein. Substance P (SP) and physalaemin are equipotent in inhibiting the binding of [3H]PHY, whereas the potency of SP(2-11), SP(3-11), and SP(4-11) decreased in inverse proportion to their length. The relative affinity of the different tachykinins, SP, and SP fragments in competing with [3H]PHY correlates with their potency to stimulate several bioassay systems, indicating that [3H]PHY labels a physiologically relevant binding site that correspond to the SP-P tachykinin receptor. Guanine nucleotides completely abolish the increase in the binding of [3H]PHY produced by 2.5 mM MnCl2, but in its absence, the nucleotides reduce binding only by 15%. Guanine nucleotides reduce binding to the same level regardless of the presence or absence of the divalent cation. Regional distribution studies confirm that the density of SP receptors is maximal in the olfactory bulb, followed by the hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum.",
