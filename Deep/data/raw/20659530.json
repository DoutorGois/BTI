     "AB": "Accumulated evidence suggests that the single transmembrane domain insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF-II/M6P or IGF-II receptor) plays an important role in the intracellular trafficking of lysosomal enzymes and endocytosis-mediated degradation of insulin like growth factor (IGF-II). However, the role of this receptor in signal transduction following IGF-II binding remains controversial. In the present study, we revealed that Leu(27)IGF-II, an analog which binds preferentially to the IGF-II receptor, can attenuate K(+)-as well as veratridine-evoked GABA release from the adult rat hippocampal formation. Tetrodotoxin failed to alter the effects of Leu(27)IGF-II on GABA release, thus suggesting the lack of involvement of voltage-dependent Na(+) channels. Interestingly, the effect is found to be sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX), indicating the possible involvement of a Gi/o protein-dependent pathway in mediating the release of GABA from the hippocampal slices. Additionally, Leu(27)IGF-II was found to attenuate GABA release from frontal cortex but not from striatum. These results, together with the evidence that IGF-II receptors are localized on GABAergic neurons, raised the possibility that this receptor, apart from mediating intracellular trafficking, may also be involved in the regulation of endogenous GABA release by acting directly on GABAergic terminals.",
