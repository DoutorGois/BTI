     "AB": "The expression of mRNA of genes involved in neurogenesis and apoptosis (Apaf1, Ascl1, Bax, Bcl2, Casp3, Casp8, Casp9, Dffb, Myh10, Naip2, Napa, Notch2, Numb, Pura, S100a6, Tnf) in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum was studied in adult rats. The content of mRNA of these genes (except Apaf1) was several-fold higher in the cerebellum than in the hippocampus and brain cortex. In the hippocampus, the expression of Apaf1 was significantly lower than in the prefrontal cortex, while the expression of Ascl1, Pura, S100b, and Tnf was higher. Regional differences in the direction, strength, and numbers of significant correlations between the expression of the studied genes were detected. Documented differences in gene expression were regarded as validation of the structural and functional cooperation of neurogenesis and apoptosis at the molecular genetic level.",
