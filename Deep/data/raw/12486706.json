     "AB": "Synaptic plasticity has a central role in nearly all models of learning and memory. Besides experiments documenting changes in synaptic function during learning, most of the evidence supporting a role for synaptic plasticity in memory comes from manipulations that either enhance or lesion synaptic processes. In the last decade, mouse transgenetics (knock outs and transgenics) have provided compelling evidence that the molecular mechanisms responsible for the induction and stability of synaptic changes have a critical role in the acquisition and storage of information. Here, I will review this literature, with a special focus on studies of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory.",
