     "AB": "The localization of cathepsin D (CD) in normal adult rat neural tissue was determined with an indirect immunoperoxidase technique utilizing rabbit anti rat brain CD followed by a horseradish peroxidase conjugate of the Fab portion of goat antirabbit IgG. The immunoreactive enzyme protein was distributed predominantly in a granular pattern, presumably lysosomal, in neurons and choroid plexus epithelium. Smaller amounts were detected in oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells. The neuronal localization included the perikaryon and its processes, was widely distributed, and displayed a range of staining intensities in different anatomical areas. Immunoreactive CD was heavily concentrated in brain stem and spinal cord motoneurons, large neurons of the caudate nucleus, neurons of several nuclear groups, especially the paraventricular and supraoptic, in the hypothalamus, and neurons of superior cervical and dorsal root ganglia. CD was also readily detected in brain stem sensory neurons, pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, inferior olive and Purkinje cells, but was absent or present in very small quantities in the granule cells of the cerebellar cortex, the more superficial layers of the neocortex, and smaller neurons of the caudate nucleus. This distribution suggests that CD may have a major role in specific chemical events in neural functions and peptidergic pathways and could be involved in the alterations of certain neural structures in disease states.",
