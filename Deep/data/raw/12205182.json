     "AB": "Postsynaptic [Ca2+]i increases result from Ca2+ entry through ligand-gated channels, entry through voltage-gated channels, or release from intracellular stores. We found that these sources have distinct spatial distributions in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Large amplitude regenerative release of Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive stores in the form of Ca2+ waves were found almost exclusively on the thick apical shaft. Smaller release events did not extend more than 15 microm into the oblique dendrites. These synaptically activated regenerative waves initiated at points where the stimulated oblique dendrites branch from the apical shaft. In contrast, NMDA receptor-mediated increases were observed predominantly in oblique dendrites where spines are found at high density. These [Ca2+]i increases were typically more than eight times larger than [Ca2+]i from this source on the main aspiny apical shaft. Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated channels, activated by backpropagating action potentials, was detected at all dendritic locations. These mechanisms were not independent. Ca2+ entry through NMDA receptor channels or voltage-gated channels (as previously demonstrated) synergistically enhanced Ca2+ release generated by mGluR mobilization of IP3.",
