     "AB": "The present study examined the functional changes in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell system in vivo occurring after 12-min forebrain ischemia in the rat. A population excitatory postsynaptic potential and orthodromic population spike of CA1 pyramidal cells to stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals were potentiated at 6-8 h post-ischemia. These changes were not associated with an increase in excitability of the CA1 pyramidal cells as evaluated from the antidromic population spike induced by alveus stimulation, suggesting the presence of an increased synaptic efficacy. The post-ischemic potentiation was prevented by pretreatment with the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, MK801, in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that 12-min forebrain ischemia in the rat activates NMDA receptors, which results in an increase in synaptic efficacy to the CA1 pyramidal cells at 6-8 h post-ischemia.",
