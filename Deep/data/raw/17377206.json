     "AB": "Increasing evidence shows that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine - 5-HT) plays a modulatory role in memory functions. 5-HT transmission has been implicated in learning and memory. Both 5-HT depletion and specific 5-HT agonists lower memory performance. Hippocampus is thought to be the key region involved in long-term memory. It is the major limbic target of the brainstem serotonergic neurons that modulate learning. In the present study, we examined the effects of increased hippocampal 5-HT metabolism following tryptophan (TRP) administration on short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) in rats. Learning acquisition (LA) and memory consolidation (MC) in rats was also evaluated. TRP at 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg body weight was used. Assessment of memory in rats was done using the water maze test (WM) after 6 weeks of daily administration of TRP. The results showed that administration of TRP enhanced both STM and LTM. However, the effect on STM was significant only at the higher dose. Rats administered the higher dose of TRP also exhibited a significant enhancement in LA. A significant effect on MC was also observed in tryptophan-treated rats. The results suggest that serotonergic system in the hippocampus is important in LA and MC in rats.",
