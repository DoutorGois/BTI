     "AB": "The membrane metalloenzyme endopeptidase-24.11 has been localized by immunocytochemistry in the porcine hippocampus in the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum. Endopeptidase-24.11 was found to be approximately 10-fold more abundant in a striatal than a hippocampal membrane preparation. Both somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14 were metabolized by endopeptidase-24.11, but the kinetics of hydrolysis markedly favoured the smaller form of the neuropeptide. After phase separation with Triton X-114 of striatal and hippocampal membrane preparations, and by using selective inhibitors, the major (> 80%) somatostatin-metabolizing activity was found to partition into the detergent-rich phase and was attributable predominantly to endopeptidase-24.11. The residual activity observed in the presence of the selective endopeptidase-24.11 inhibitor phosphoramidon was blocked by Pro-Ile or N-[1-(RS)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate, inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.16 and endopeptidase-24.15, respectively. However, Pro-Ile, at comparable concentrations, was shown to inhibit endopeptidase-24.11, challenging the validity of its use as a selective inhibitor of endopeptidase-24.16. The immunocytochemical and Triton X-114 phase-separation data implicate endopeptidase-24.11, rather than endopeptidase-24.16 or endopeptidase-24.15, as the major physiological somatostatin-degrading neuropeptidase in the striatum and hippocampus.",
