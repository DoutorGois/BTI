     "AB": "Prostacyclin (PGI(2)) is a labile, lipid-derived metabolite of arachidonic acid synthesized through the sequential action of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) and prostacyclin synthase (PGIS). In addition to its well-characterized vasodilatory and thrombolytic effects, an increasing number of studies report an important role of PGI(2) in nociception in various animal species. In this study we investigated the regional distribution of PGIS in human brain by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. PGIS-immunoreactive (ir) protein was localized to blood vessels throughout the brain. Neuronal cells and glial cells, such as microglia and oligodendrocytes, also showed intense labeling. The strongest expression of PGIS was seen in large principal neurons, such as pyramidal cells of the cortex, pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Abundance of PGIS mRNA was observed in blood vessels and large neurons and correlated well with the immunohistochemical findings. The expression of PGIS in human brain was further demonstrated by immunoblotting and detection of 6-keto-PGF (1alpha), the stable degradation product of prostacyclin in human brain homogenate. These results demonstrate a widespread expression of PGIS in the central nervous system and suggest a potentially important role of prostacylin in modulating neuronal activity in human brain.",
