     "TI": "Repeated administration of CGP 46381, a gamma-aminobutyric acidB antagonist, and ethosuximide suppresses seizure-associated cyclic adenosine 3'5' monophosphate response element- and activator protein-1 DNA-binding activities in lethargic (lh/lh) mice.",
     "PG": "207-10",
     "AB": "To characterize seizure-associated increases in cerebral cortical and thalamic cyclic AMP responsive element (CRE)- and activator protein 1 (AP-1) DNA-binding activities in lethargic (lh/lh) mice, a genetic model of absence seizures, we examined the effects of ethosuximide and CGP 46381 on these DNA-binding activities. Repeated administration (twice a day for 5 days) of ethosuximide (200 mg/kg) or CGP 46381 (60 mg/kg) attenuated both seizure behavior and the increased DNA-binding activities, and was more effective than a single administration of these drugs. These treatments did not affect either normal behavior or basal DNA-binding activities in non-epileptic control (+/+) mice. Gel supershift assays revealed that the increased CRE-binding activity was attributable to activation of the binding activity of CREB, and that the c-Fos-c-Jun complex was a component of the increased AP-1 DNA-binding activity.",
