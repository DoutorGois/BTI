     "AB": "In vitro autoradiography was used to examine the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in the brain of a baboon species, Papio anubis, and compared to that of Papio papio which exhibits a photosensitive epilepsy. The epilepsy originates in the frontal cortex and is accompanied by an enhanced sensitivity to N-methyl-D-aspartate. In both Papio anubis and Papio papio, the density of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors was greatest in the hippocampus, followed by associational areas including frontal cortex, and low in primary sensory areas such as the visual cortex. The receptors were concentrated in the outer cortical layers I-III, very low in layer IV except in primary visual cortex, and of intermediate density in layer V. The density of binding sites was approximately two-fold lower than previously observed in the rodent brain, whereas the affinity of the receptor for [3H]L-glutamate was greater in the primate versus the rodent brain. Glycine potentiated the binding of [3H]L-glutamate in both cortex and hippocampus. No significant differences in the properties of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors were observed between the two baboon species, suggesting that the photosensitivity of Papio papio is not due to alterations in the binding of L-glutamate to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex.",
