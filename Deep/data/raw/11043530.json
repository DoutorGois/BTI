     "AB": "Immunohistochemical techniques were employed to examine the distribution of RNA-binding proteins A2 and B1 in the rat forebrain. Intense A2 and B1 immunolabeling were observed in the nucleoplasm of the neurons in the cerebral cortices, hippocampal formation, olfactory regions, caudate-putamen as well as the supraoptic nucleus of hypothalamus. In contrast, within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, as well as the medial and lateral habenular nucleus of thalamus, immunoreactivity for both proteins was weak. Within the globus pallidus and thalamic nucleus immunoreactivity for A2 was hardly detectable despite of intense B1 immunolabeling, while within the endopiriform nucleus and lateral and basolateral nucleus of amygdala intensity of B1 immunolabeling was relatively weak compared to A2. Our study suggests that the distribution of A2 and B1 are not constant throughout the forebrain and this diversity may reflect the post-transcriptional regulation of cell-specific gene expression of neuronal cells.",
