     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A preliminary report suggested that magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) was useful to lateralize epileptic foci in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We attempted to confirm this finding in a larger group by investigating the relationship between MTR of mesial temporal structures and seizure lateralization in patients with refractory TLE. METHODS: We compared the MTR of amygdalae and hippocampi of 10 patients with unilateral TLE to values obtained from 10 healthy control participants. RESULTS: Three of 10 patients with TLE had MTR values that were 2 SD below the normal mean; the MTR abnormality was concordant with electroclinical lateralization in only one of the three. CONCLUSION: We conclude that MTR measurements of amygdalae and hippocampi are not useful for lateralization of TLE.",
