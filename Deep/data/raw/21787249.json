     "AB": "Manasamitra vatakam (MMV) has long been used as a traditional medicine in India for the treatment of psychosomatic diseases, anxiety neurosis, and stress. The present study was designed to examine the neuroprotective effect of MMV against aluminum (Al)-induced memory impairment and oxidative damage in rats. Neurotoxicity was induced by the administration of Al [100 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) per oral (p.o.)/day] to Wistar albino rats for 90 days. Al administration induced neurotoxicity as well as oxidative stress by affecting the active avoidance and memory impairment, as well as altering antioxidants, such as HSP70 protein, superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and acetylcholinesterase. It was observed that the administration of MMV (100 mg/kg b.w./p.o./day) along with AlCl(3) improves memory performance and antioxidant activity against Al-induced neurotoxicity in rats. In conclusion, these data suggest that MMV can prevent brain damage from Al-induced neurotoxicity in rats and thus can be used as a neuroprotective agent.",
