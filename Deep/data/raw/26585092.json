     "AB": "BACKGROUND: We previously reported that patients with early-stage bipolar disorder, but not healthy comparison controls, had body mass index (BMI)-related volume reductions in limbic brain areas, suggesting that the structural brain changes characteristic of bipolar disorder were more pronounced with increased weight. AIMS: To determine whether the most consistently reported neurochemical abnormality in bipolar disorder, increased glutamate/glutamine (Glx), was also more prominent with higher BMI. METHOD: We used single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure hippocampal Glx in 51 patients with first-episode mania (mean BMI = 24.1) and 28 healthy controls (mean BMI = 23.3). RESULTS: In patients, but not healthy controls, linear regression demonstrated that higher BMI predicted greater Glx. Factorial ANCOVA showed a significant BMI x diagnosis interaction, confirming a distinct effect of weight on Glx in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Together with our volumetric studies, these results suggest that higher BMI is associated with more pronounced structural and neurochemical limbic brain changes in bipolar disorder, even in early-stage patients with low obesity rates.",
