     "AB": "Scrapie is a neurodegenerative disease in sheep and goats. Neuropathological examination shows astrocytosis. One issue is whether the astrocytosis seen in scrapie is a function of an increase in reactivity of individual cells, or whether there is actual replication of astrocytes. We used double-label immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to determine the mitotic state of cells and to confirm their identity as astrocytes. Brain sections from hamsters (strain LVG/LAK) infected with 139H or 263K scrapie isolates were examined. GFAP immunostaining was increased in astrocytes in most regions of the brains of scrapie-infected hamsters. These qualitative observations were confirmed by computerized image analysis quantification. A proportion of the hypertrophic astrocytes (0.5-10.8%, depending on specific location) were PCNA immunoreactive. The PCNA-immunopositive astrocytes were most frequently found in cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, subependymal areas, fimbria, caudate, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and dentate gyrus. Our results suggest that the astrocytosis seen in scrapie-infected animals is, at least in part, owing to actual replication of astrocytes in these animals. We hypothesize that the astrocytes may be an important locus for the disease process.",
