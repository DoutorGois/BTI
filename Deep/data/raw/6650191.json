     "AB": "The effects of classic conditioning on the viscerosensory evoked potentials (EPs) were studied in twenty cats during wakefulness (W), slow-wave-sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS). Four types of the experiment were performed on four groups of animals. Weak, non-painful stimulation of the small intestine or of the left splanchnic nerve was used as conditional stimulus (CS) in all experiments. A painful or non-painful shock on the left radial nerve served as unconditional stimulus (US) which followed the CS with a delay of 500 ms. In the first and second series of experiments, the CS was paired with non-painful or painful CS during W. In the third and fourth types of experiment, weak US was used and conditioning was done during SWS or PS. The evoked responses were recorded from the primary (SI) and secondary (SII) somatosensory and associative (AS) cortex, the thalamus (VPL), hypothalamus (HPT) and dorsal hippocampus (HPC). In each experiment, the stimulus pairings resulted in a complex electrographic conditional response (CR) which included an amplitude increase of the late components of EP's (early CR) and the development of a wave of 500 ms latency (delayed CR). In the second experiment, however, a behavioural CR (limb flexion) also appeared. All these CRs proved to be extinguishable. The recall of CR established during W was successful in SWS. The traces of CS-US pairings during SWS could, however, be elicited only in SWS. Both establishment and recall of CR were unsuccessful during PS. The possible mechanism of the effects originating from an interaction of conditioning and sleep on the viscerosensory inputs of the brain are discussed.",
