     "AB": "Previous data have suggested that galectin-1 is expressed widely in nervous tissues at embryonic stages but becomes restricted mainly to peripheral nervous tissues with maturation. Though the expression is intense in adult mammalian peripheral neurons, there had been no report about functions of galectin-1 there. Recently we discovered a factor that enhanced peripheral axonal regeneration. The factor was identified as oxidized galectin-1 with three intramolecular disulfide bonds and showed no lectin activity. Oxidized recombinant human galectin-1 (rhGAL-1/Ox) showed the same nerve growth promoting activity at very low concentrations (pg/ml). rhGAL-1/Ox at similarly low concentration was also effective in in vivo experiments of axonal regeneration. Moreover, the application of functional anti-rhGAL-1 antibody strongly inhibited the axonal regeneration in vivo as well as in vitro. Since galectin-1 is expressed in the regenerating sciatic nerves as well as in both sensory neurons and motor neurons, these results suggest that galectin-1 is secreted into the extracellular space to be oxidized, and then, in its oxidized form, to regulate initial repair after axotomy. The administration of oxidized galectin-1 effectively promoted functional recovery after sciatic nerve injury in vivo. Oxidized galectin-1, hence, appears to play an important role in promoting axonal regeneration, working as a kind of cytokine, not as a lectin. Recent reports indicated additional roles of cytosolic galectin-1 in neural diseases, such as ALS. Furthermore galectin-1 has been proved to be a downstream target of DeltaFosB. In hippocampus of rat brain, expression of DeltaFosB is induced immediately after ischemia-reperfusion, suggesting that galectin-1 may also play important roles in central nervous system after injury.",
