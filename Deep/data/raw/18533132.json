     "AB": "The composition of the ACSF is fundamental in controlling the extracellular environment of the brain slice preparation. 'Typical' formulations lack amino acids and contain a higher concentration of glucose (10 mM) than in the cerebrospinal fluid (0.47-4.4 mM). We examined the effects of different concentrations of glutamine, the most abundant amino acid in the CSF, and glucose on rat hippocampal slice physiology. Bipolar paired-pulse stimulation was applied to the Schaffer collaterals and population spikes were monitored in the CA1 pyramidal layer for approximately 1 hour. Addition of glutamine (0.5 mM) to slices superfused with 10 mM of glucose did not enhance population spike amplitude. Higher concentration of glutamine (2-5 mM) resulted in spreading-depression. Decreasing glucose concentration from 10 mM to 5 mM, in the absence of glutamine, attenuated population spikes. Decreasing glucose to 2 mM, in the absence of glutamine, suppressed evoked population spikes. Superfusing brain slices with ACSF containing 'physiological' concentrations of both glucose (2 mM) and glutamine (0.5 mM) similarly suppressed population spikes. In separate experiments, during high-K+ induced epileptiform activity, glutamine (0.5 mM) did not affect the burst duration, frequency or waveform. These results suggest that the concentration of glucose in ACSF should conservatively be 10 mM in order to maximize paired-pulse population responses while the presence of physiological concentration of glutamine (0.5 mM) has minimal effects on paired-pulse responses and high-K+ induced epileptiform activity. These results are discussed in the context of fundamental differences between in vitro brain slice superfusion and in vivo brain perfusion.",
