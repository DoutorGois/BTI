     "AB": "Chronic restraint stress causes spatial learning and memory deficits, dendritic atrophy of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons and alterations in the levels of neurotransmitters in the hippocampus. In contrast, intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) rewarding behavioral experience is known to increase dendritic arborization, spine and synaptic density, and increase neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus. In addition, ICSS facilitates operant and spatial learning, and ameliorates fornix-lesion induced behavioral deficits. Although the effects of stress and ICSS are documented, it is not known whether ICSS following stress would ameliorate the stress-induced deficits. Accordingly, the present study was aimed to evaluate the role of ICSS on stress-induced changes in hippocampal morphology, neurochemistry, and behavioral performance in the T-maze. Experiments were conducted on adult male Wistar rats, which were randomly divided into four groups; normal control, stress (ST), self-stimulation (SS), and stress + self-stimulation (ST + SS). Stress group of rats were subjected to restraint stress for 6 h daily over 21 days, SS group animals were subjected to SS from ventral tegmental area for 10 days and ST + SS rats were subjected to restraint stress for 21 days followed by 10 days of SS. Interestingly, our results show that stress-induced behavioral deficits, dendritic atrophy, and decreased levels of neurotransmitters were completely reversed following 10 days of SS experience. We propose that SS rewarding behavioral experience ameliorates the stress-induced cognitive deficits by inducing structural and biochemical changes in the hippocampus.",
