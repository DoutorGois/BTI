     "AB": "The K(+) channel interacting proteins (KChIPs1-4) interact with and modulate activity and trafficking of Kv4 potassium channels. We report here the distribution of KChIPs in adult mouse brain. KChIP1 was expressed in a subpopulation of neurons widely distributed in brain and enriched in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and in the reticular thalamic and medial habenular nuclei. KChIP2 transcripts were highly expressed in layer IV of the cerebral cortex and in striatum and hippocampus, but expressed at low levels in cerebellum. KChIP3 transcripts were detected primarily in the layer V and deep layer VI of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the entire cerebellum. KChIP4 was highly expressed by neurons in layers II-IV of cortex and in hippocampus, thalamus and the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum. Collectively, different KChIPs appear to be expressed by selected neuronal populations in different brain regions where expression of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 have been reported. These findings support the likelihood of functional interactions between KChIPs and Kv4 K(+) channels in brain.",
