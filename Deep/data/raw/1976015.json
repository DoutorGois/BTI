     "AB": "Behavioral changes following injury, neural degeneration, and aging partly reflect the synaptic plasticity of the nervous system. Such long-term plastic changes are likely to depend on alterations in the production of proteins involved in synaptic structures and neurotransmission. We have studied the regulation of the mRNA encoding one such protein, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), the rate limiting enzyme of GABA synthesis, after a unilateral lesion in the hippocampus that leads to increased seizure susceptibility. Quantitative in situ hybridization reveals a long-term increase in GAD mRNA in several bilateral structures, as well as in specific neurons in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus. Our data do not support the often stated hypothesis that seizure susceptibility depends on the malfunction of GABA neurons.",
