     "AB": "Existing data on the involvement of the hippocampus in contextual memory and the fact that contextual memory is impaired in dreams occurring during paradoxical sleep allowed us to suggest that one of the causes of this impairment consists of changes in the efficiency of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus due to increases (as compared with waking) in the concentrations of acetylcholine, dopamine, and cortisol, as well as the absence of serotonin and noradrenaline. Our previous analysis showed that in paradoxical sleep, long-term depression can be induced all components of the polysynaptic pathway through the hippocampal formation, while potentiation can occur at the inputs from the entorhinal cortex to hippocampal fields CA1 and CA3 and in the associative connections in field CA3. It is hypothesized that the correct functioning of episodic memory requires efficient transmission of signals in each component of the polysynaptic pathway through the hippocampus, allowing a neuronal representation of the context to be created within it. In the state of waking, reproduction of the context of an episode simultaneously activates the neuronal representation of the context remembered in the hippocampus and neuronal representations of the details of the episode remembered in those areas of the cortex in which they were processed. It follows from the proposed mechanism that any neurotransmitter or neuropeptide able to promote longterm potentiation in all components of the polysynaptic pathway through the hippocampus can improve episodic memory. As the consequences of the mechanism are consistent with experimental data, it can be used to seek agents improving episodic memory.",
