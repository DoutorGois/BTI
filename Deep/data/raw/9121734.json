     "AB": "The localization of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) immunoreactivity and mRNA in the adult rat brain was examined by light microscopic and electron microscopic immunohistochemistries, and in situ hybridization. For the purpose of detailed investigation of the distribution and comparison of GR immunoreactivities and mRNAs, specific polyclonal antibodies against a part of the transcription modulation (TR) domain of rat GR were used in the immunohistochemistry, whereas fluorescein-labeled RNA probes, complementary to the TR domain in the GR cDNA were used in the in situ hybridization. In the rat brain, GR immunoreactivity was predominantly localized in the cell nucleus, and the expression of GR mRNA was detected in the cytoplasm. GR-immunoreactive and GR mRNA-containing cells were widely distributed from the olfactory bulb of the forebrain to the gracile-cuneate nuclei of the medulla oblongata. The highest densities of GR-immunoreactive and mRNA-containing cells were observed in the subfields of cerebral cortex, olfactory cortex, hippocampal formation, amygdala, septal region, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, trapezoid body, cerebellar cortex, locus coeruleus and dorsal nucleus raphe. The distributional pattern of GR immunoreactivity in many regions was well-correlated with that of GR mRNA, but in the CA3 and CA4 pyramidal layers of the hippocampus, different localization was noted. The present study provides the groundwork for elucidating the role of GRs in brain function.",
