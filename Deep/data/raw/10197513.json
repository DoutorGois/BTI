     "AB": "The authors used mRNA differential display to identify genes whose expression levels are altered in the adult rat hippocampus 24 hours after global ischemia. At this time after challenge, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, SEF-2, and the 26S proteasome complex subunit, p112, were identified as genes whose expression levels are decreased and increased, respectively, in the hippocampus. To determine the spatial and temporal patterns of expression change for each gene, the authors antisense in situ hybridization to paired brain sections of sham-operated and global ischemia-challenged rats at 6, 12, and 24 hours after reperfusion SEF-2 expression was not significantly altered from that of sham-operated controls in any hippocampal subfield at or before 12 hours after challenge. At 24 hours after ischemia, however, SEF-2 expression levels were significantly diminished in the vulnerable CA1 subfield, but not in the less vulnerable CA3 or dentate granule cell subfields. The proteasome p112 subunit gene displayed no change in expression levels at 6 hours after insult; however, an elevated expression was observed at 12 hours after challenge in the dentate granule cell subfield. By 24 hours after challenge, p112 expression was significantly elevated in both the CA1 and dentate granule cell subfields. These results demonstrate that a member of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors, SEF-2, and the major subunit of the 26S proteasome complex, p112, display altered gene expression in the hippocampus after transient cerebral ischemia.",
