     "AB": "Neurons are highly specialized cells in which the integration and processing of electrical signals critically depends on the precise localization of ion channels. For large-conductance Ca(2+)- activated K(+) (BK) channels, targeting to presynaptic membranes in hippocampal pyramidal cells was reported; however, functional evidence also suggests a somatodendritic localization. Therefore we re-examined the subcellular distribution of BK channels in mouse hippocampus using a panel of independent antibodies in a combined approach of conventional immunocytochemistry on cultured neurons, pre- and postembedding electron microscopy and immunoprecipitation. In cultured murine hippocampal neurons, the colocalization of BK channels with both pre- and postsynaptic marker proteins was observed. Electron microscopy confirmed targeting of BK channels to axonal as well as dendritic membranes of glutamatergic synapses in hippocampus. A postsynaptic localization of BK channels was also supported by the finding that the channel coimmunoprecipitated with PSD95, a protein solely expressed in the postsynaptic compartment. These results thus demonstrate that BK channels reside in both post- and presynaptic compartments of hippocampal pyramidal neurons.",
