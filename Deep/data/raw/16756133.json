     "AB": "Rats received intracerebroventricular injections of z-DEVD-FMK (caspase-3 inhibitor) or z-FA-FMK (control peptide) in a dose of 3 nmol. Administration of z-DEVD-FMK significantly decreased the number of avoidance reactions in some blocks of trials in active avoidance (shuttle box) learning. However, only slight effect of the caspase inhibitor across the session was found. Z-DEVD-FMK impaired development of some essential components of the two-way active avoidance performance, such as escape reaction, conditioned fear reaction, and inter-trial crossings. Z-DEVD-FMK did not impair working memory in the spontaneous alternation behavior paradigm. Z-DEVD-FMK affected neither emotionality nor locomotor activity in the open-field test. It also did not influence behavior in the light-dark chamber. Measurement of caspase-3 activity in rat brain regions involved in active avoidance learning revealed z-DEVD-FMK-related inhibition of the enzyme activity most pronounced (about 30%) in the fronto-parietal cortex; a similar effect was close to significant in the hippocampus. The results suggest the involvement of brain caspase-3 in selected forms of learning.",
