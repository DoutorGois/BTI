     "AB": "GluR5-containing kainite receptor (GluR5-KAR) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of nervous system diseases, while S-nitrosylation exerts a variety of effects on biological systems. However, the mechanism of GluR5-KAR S-nitrosylation is still unclear up to now. Here our researches found that GluR5-KAR selective agonist ATPA stimulation activated the nonclassical GluR5-KAR-Gq-PLC-IP(3)R pathway and the signalling module GluR5.PSD-95.nNOS (the former is more important), led to Ca(2+) release from intracellular calcium stores endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to cytoplasm and extracellular calcium indrawal, respectively, which further resulted in nNOS activation and GluR5-KAR S-nitrosylation, and then inhibited GluR5-mediated whole-cell current attenuation and induced apoptosis in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Clarification of the primary mechanisms of GluR5-KAR S-nitrosylation induced by ATPA and identification of critical cysteine for GluR5-2a S-nitrosylation (Cys231 and Cys804) open up a brand-new field for revealing downstream signalling pathway of GluR5-KAR and its molecular characteristics, exploring the pathogenesis of neurological diseases and searching for promising therapies.",
