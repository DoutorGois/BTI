     "AB": "The entorhinal cortex (EC) projects via the perforant pathway to all subfields in the hippocampal formation. One can distinguish medial and lateral components in the pathway, originating in corresponding medial and lateral subdivisions of EC. We analyzed the innervation by medial and lateral perforant pathway fibers of parvalbumin-expressing neurons in the subiculum. A neuroanatomical tracer (biotinylated dextran amine, BDA) was stereotaxically injected in the medial or lateral entorhinal cortex, thus selectively labeling either perforant pathway component. Transport was allowed for 1 week. Transported BDA was detected with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488. Parvalbumin neurons were visualized via immunofluorescence histochemistry, using the fluorochrome Alexa Fluor 594. Via a random systematic sampling scheme using a two-channel, sequential-mode confocal laser scanning procedure, we obtained image series at high magnification from the molecular layer of the subiculum. Labeled entorhinal fibers and parvalbumin-expressing structures were three dimensionally (3D) reconstructed using computer software. Further computer analysis revealed that approximately 16% of the 3D objects ('boutons') of BDA-labeled fibers was engaged in contacts with parvalbumin-immunostained dendrites in the subiculum. Both medial and lateral perforant pathway fibers and their boutons formed such appositions. Contacts are suggestive for synapses. We found no significant differences between the medial and lateral components in the relative numbers of contacts. Thus, the medial and lateral subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex similarly tune the firing of principal neurons in the subiculum by way of parvalbumin positive interneurons in their respective terminal zones.",
