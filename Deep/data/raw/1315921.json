     "AB": "Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) mRNA expression was examined after hypoxia-ischemia in rat brains using in situ hybridization. Twenty-one-day-old Wistar rats had unilateral ligation of the right carotid artery followed by either 15 or 90 min inhalational hypoxia. Fifteen min of hypoxia resulted in moderate damage with selective neuronal loss in cortical layer 3 and in the hippocampus of the ligated hemisphere. Seventy-two hours after hypoxia TGF beta 1 expression was markedly increased above control levels in those sites. Levels were normal after 120 h. Ninety min of hypoxia led to an infarction of the lateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the ligated hemisphere. One hour after hypoxia TGF beta 1 mRNA was expressed in the hippocampus of the damaged side. Seventy-two and 120 h after hypoxia, expressing cells were found throughout the cerebral cortex, piriform cortex, striatum, thalamus and hippocampus of the infarcted side. These data show that TGF beta 1 mRNA expression is induced after a hypoxic-ischemic insult in the brain. TGF beta 1 may be involved in post-asphyxial repair mechanisms.",
