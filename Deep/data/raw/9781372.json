     "AB": "The biological role and origin of human lactoferrin (Lf) within the brain in normal and disease processes are as yet uncharted. In this context the origin and expression of brain Lf in normal and MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-treated mice were investigated using immunohisto chemistry, PCR amplification and in situ hybridization. Lf immunostaining was observed both on sections of mouse lactating mammary gland, which was used as a positive control, and brains from young, adult and aged mice. Lf immunoreactivity was present in the pituitary gland, the hippocampus and the cortex of mouse brains and to a greater extent in older mice. After reverse transcription, Lf transcripts were also found in these brain sections. Lf distribution and expression in the MPTP-induced parkinsonian mouse model were next investigated. A marked depletion of dopamine and its metabolites: dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) occurs in the high dose MPTP-treated mice. The level of Lf expression was found to be greatly increased in the same animals but Lf immunoreactivity detected in the same brain region was not found increased in the affected areas.",
