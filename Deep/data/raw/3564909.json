     "AB": "The clinical signs and morphological brain lesions associated with histotoxic hypoxia induced by subcutaneous injection of 3-nitropropionic acid (NPA) in rats are described, and compared to hypoxic brain damage from other causes including ischemia and hypoglycemia. The brains were perfusion-fixed with paraformaldehyde/glutaraldehyde fixative, and examined by light and electron microscopy. Intoxicated rats developed severe neurological disease characterized by somnolence, uncoordinated gait with stereotypical paddling movements, and ventral or lateral recumbency. Recumbent rats had a selective, bilaterally symmetrical pattern of severe morphological injury in the caudate-putamen, hippocampus, and thalamus. Recumbency was a consistent indicator of the development of morphological brain lesions. In contrast to reports describing rat models of ischemia and hypoglycemia, morphological injury was not seen in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices of NPA-intoxicated rats. Ultrastructurally, neuronal alterations ranged from chromatin clumping with increased cytoplasmic lucency to severe cellular shrinkage or swelling with marked mitochondrial swelling (high amplitude swelling). White matter alterations included axonal swelling and adaxonal splitting of myelin lamellae. Vascular changes included perivascular deposits of proteinaceous material presumably from leakage of serum proteins, variable electron lucency of endothelial cell cytoplasm, an apparent increase in pinocytotic vesicles, rare platelet thrombosis of capillaries, and rare intravascular blebs of luminal plasma membrane. As a model of brain damage following energy deficiency, NPA intoxication has the advantages of producing morphological brain injury in a highly predictable anatomical pattern, and at a time paralleling the onset of clinical recumbency.",
