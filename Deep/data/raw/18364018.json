     "AB": "The group I metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR1 and mGluR5, exhibit differences in their regulation of synaptic plasticity, suggesting that these receptors may subserve separate functional roles in information storage. In addition, although effects in vivo are consistently described, conflicting reports of the involvement of mGluRs in hippocampal synaptic plasticity in vitro exist. We therefore addressed the involvement of mGluR1 and mGluR5 in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampal CA1 region of adult male rats in vitro. The mGluR1 antagonist (S)-(+)-alpha-amino-4-carboxy-2-methylbenzene-acetic acid (LY367385) impaired both induction and late phases of both LTP and LTD, when applied before high-frequency tetanization (HFT; 100 Hz) or low-frequency stimulation (LFS; 1 Hz), respectively. Application after either HFT or LFS had no effect. The mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), when given before HFT, inhibited both the induction and late phases of LTP. When given after HFT, late LTP was inhibited. MPEP, given prior to LFS, impaired LTD induction, although stable LTD was still expressed. Application after LFS significantly impaired late phases of LTD. Activation of protein synthesis may comprise a key mechanism underlying the group I mGluR contribution to synaptic plasticity. The mGluR5 agonist (R,S)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG) converted short-term depression into LTD. Effects were prevented by application of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, suggesting that protein synthesis is triggered by group I mGluR activation to enable persistency of synaptic plasticity. Taken together, these data support the notion that both mGluR1 and mGluR5 are critically involved in bidirectional synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region and may enable functional differences in information encoding through LTP and LTD.",
