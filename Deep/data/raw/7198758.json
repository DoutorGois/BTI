     "AB": "The clinical and neuropathological effects of elevated brain aluminum levels have only recently been described. The clinical symptoms, and localization of aluminum in the brain, suggest an altered catecholamine balance. We report the effects of elevated brain aluminum upon the endogenous steady-state levels of norepinephrine and dopamine in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. The neurotoxic effects of ingested aluminum are shown to be dependent upon the dietary intake of copper, zinc, iron, and magnesium. Norepinephrine levels in the cortex and cerebellum decreased in rats fed a low copper diet with aluminum added (0.1%, w/w). Suboptimal iron levels decreased norepinephrine in the cerebellum. The presence of aluminum in diets low in copper or zinc decreased dopamine levels in the cortex. The data are interpreted with respect to the clinical symptomatologies seen in demented, chronic renal dialysis patients with depressed serum copper and zinc levels.",
