     "AB": "The ontogeny of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and somatostatin (SRIF) was studied in various structures of the rat central nervous system (CNS), using specific radioimmunoassays. The effect of adrenal corticoids on the concentration of both peptides was investigated during the development of the rat from 3 days before birth to 2 months after birth. The evolution of both peptides was different since SRIF was found before birth in each structure tested while VIP appeared only after birth in the same structures. However, after birth the ontogeny of VIP and SRIF was quite similar and the maximum concentration of both peptides occurred between day 14 and day 21. Hypercorticism (implant of corticosterone) and hypocorticism (Metyrapone injections) modified the postnatal evolution of both peptides, suggesting that corticoids play an important role in the brain developmental patterns of VIP and SRIF.",
