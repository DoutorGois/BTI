     "AB": "The subiculum is the principal target of CA1 pyramidal cells. It functions as a mediator of hippocampal-cortical interaction and has been proposed to play an important role in the encoding and retrieval of long-term memory. The cellular mechanisms of memory formation are thought to include long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) of synaptic strength. This review summarizes the contemporary knowledge of LTP and LTD at CA1-subiculum synapses. The observation that the underlying mechanisms of LTP and LTD at CA1-subiculum synapses correlate with the discharge properties of subicular pyramidal cell reveals a novel and intriguing mechanism of cell-specific consolidation of hippocampal output.",
