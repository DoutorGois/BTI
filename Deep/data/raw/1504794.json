     "AB": "Expression of the immediate early gene zif/268 (also termed NGFI-A, Krox 24, TIS8 and Egr-1) was investigated in awake rats following various long-term potentiation (LTP) induction protocols. zif/268 mRNA (Northern blots) and protein (immunohistochemistry) levels sharply increased following LTP, and followed a time course characteristic of other immediate early genes. When measured across 3 tetanization protocols known to produce differing degrees of LTP persistence, zif/268 induction was found to be more highly correlated with LTP duration than with the magnitude of initial LTP. These data support the hypothesis that the immediate early gene zif/268 plays a role as a third messenger in the cascade of cellular and nuclear events that govern the persistence of LTP.",
