Responses were categorized into 5 response types on the basis of their morphology, ranging from simple (single spike component) to complex (multiple spike components). A higher percentage of ventral slices, compared to dorsal slices, responded with a complex morphology under normal and increased K+ concentrations. Thus, there was a significantly greater tendency for cells within the ventral hippocampus to generate burst responses.",
