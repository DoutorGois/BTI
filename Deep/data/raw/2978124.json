     "AB": "The effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) treatment of rat atrial natriuretic factor III (ANF III; 0.5 microgram) was measured on the arginine-8-vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXT) contents of rat hypothalamic and limbic brain areas as well as those in the plasma. The hormone concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The administration of ANF III in conscious euhydrated rats resulted in a significant reduction of both AVP and OXT contents in the hippocampus. Ether anesthesia interfered with the effect of ANF III, since in anesthetized rats ANF III reduced the levels of AVP and OXT in the septal regions, too. ANF III had no effect on the basal plasma AVP and OXT concentrations, however, the peptide inhibited the plasma AVP and OXT elevation induced by hyperosmosis (intraperitoneal injection of 2.5% NaCl). The results suggest that ANF III may be important in the control of the activity of both the peripheral (hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal) and the central (brain) AVP-ergic and OXT-ergic systems.",
