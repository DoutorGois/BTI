     "AB": "Synthetic amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) oligomers bind with high affinity to cellular prion protein (PrP(C)), but the role of this interaction in mediating the disruption of synaptic plasticity by such soluble Abeta in vitro is controversial. Here we report that intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta-containing aqueous extracts of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain robustly inhibits long-term potentiation (LTP) without significantly affecting baseline excitatory synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus in vivo. Moreover, the disruption of LTP was abrogated by immunodepletion of Abeta. Importantly, intracerebroventricular administration of antigen-binding antibody fragment D13, directed to a putative Abeta-binding site on PrP(C), prevented the inhibition of LTP by AD brain-derived Abeta. In contrast, R1, a Fab directed to the C terminus of PrP(C), a region not implicated in binding of Abeta, did not significantly affect the Abeta-mediated inhibition of LTP. These data support the pathophysiological significance of SDS-stable Abeta dimer and the role of PrP(C) in mediating synaptic plasticity disruption by soluble Abeta.",
