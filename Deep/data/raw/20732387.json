     "AB": "Several changes in brain function, including learning and memory, have been reported during pregnancy but the molecular mechanisms involved in these changes are unknown. Due to the fundamental role of glial cells in brain activity, we analyzed the content of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, preoptic area, hypothalamus and cerebellum of the rat on days 2, 14, 18, and 21 of pregnancy and on day 2 of lactation by Western blot. A differential expression pattern of GFAP was found in the brain during pregnancy and the beginning of lactation. GFAP content was increased in the hippocampus throughout pregnancy, whereas a decrease was observed in cerebellum. GFAP content was increased in the frontal cortex and hypothalamus on days 14 and 18, respectively, with a decrease in the following days of pregnancy in both regions. In preoptic area a decrease in GFAP content was observed on day 14 with an increase on days 18 and 21. In the frontal cortex and cerebellum, GFAP content was increased on day 2 of lactation, while it was maintained as on day 21 of pregnancy in the other regions. Our data suggest a differential expression pattern of GFAP in the rat brain during pregnancy and the beginning of lactation that should be associated with changes in brain function during these reproductive stages.",
