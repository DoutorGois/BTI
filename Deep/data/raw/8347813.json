     "AB": "The possible involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) in mechanisms of long-term potentiation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural input of rat CA1 neurones was investigated using several inhibitors in vitro. If 10 microM H-8, 100 nM KT5720 or 50 microM Rp-cAMPs was applied to the bath before a triple 100 Hz/0.5 s tetanization, post-tetanic and short-term potentiation developed almost normally. However, from about 3 h after tetanization the long-term potentiation (LTP) of the field-EPSP declined with respect to the control in an irreversible manner. These data suggest that besides protein kinase C the synergistic activation of PKA is necessary for the maintenance of LTP.",
