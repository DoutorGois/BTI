     "AB": "A 56-year-old right-handed man suffered from progressive apraxia of speech (AOS), characterized by agrammatism and buccofacial apraxia. He also became mute at the later stages of the disease progression. At autopsy, the left precentral gyrus, pars opercularis, and hippocampus showed severe atrophy. Pick bodies and Pick cells were observed. In this report, we also review previous case reports of AOS. Pick's disease is among the most commonly associated of the major diseases. Brain lesions associated with AOS may be found in regions such as the precentral gyrus and the pars opercularis in the left hemisphere.",
