     "AB": "The urge to demand, pour, and drink water at the time of an attack was encountered in 20 patients who had seizures with complex partial symptomatology. Two patients were studied with bitemporal stereotaxically implanted depth electrodes. Drinking was associated with electrographic and clinical seizures starting in the amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Sometimes, this was the only clinical manifestation of an attack, and its significance would not have been recognized without depth recording. Ictal drinking was never encountered in patients without electroencephalographic evidence of temporal epileptic abnormality, and therefore seems to have localizing significance.",
