     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To preliminarily compare the efficacy of pregabalin with that of placebo on the cerebellar signs caused by cortical cerebellar atrophy (CCA). A deficiency of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been described in the cerebellum in CCA, and pregabalin has been shown to enhance GABA release in rat hippocampus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two consecutive patients with clinical diagnoses of CCA took part in the study. A placebo and pregabalin, 225 mg per day, were administered in a single-blind scheme during 15 day periods to every patient; cerebellar function was evaluated with the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) at the end of each period. A video recording of the SARA items performed by the first patient accompanies this article. RESULTS: Total SARA scores of 19 and 15 were obtained for the patients after placebo administration. The SARA scores decreased to 11 and 8, respectively, with the administration of pregabalin; an important amelioration of the ataxia was also evident. Both patients preferred continuing treatment with pregabalin when the trial was over. CONCLUSION: Pregabalin was superior to placebo in the improvement of the cerebellar signs caused by CCA. Further studies are needed to confirm the present results.",
