     "AB": "The activation of phosphoinositide turnover in rat cerebral cortex and choroid plexus is triggered by the stimulation of 5-HT2 and 5-HT1C receptors, respectively. To characterize the 5-HT receptor subtype mediating the activation of phosphoinositide turnover in the hippocampus, the potency of several 5-HT agonists and antagonists on total [3H]inositol phosphate formation has been compared in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and choroid plexus of immature rats. 5-HT, alpha-methyl-5-HT, quipazine, MK-212, mCPP (m-chlorophenylpiperazine) and TFMPP (m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine) are less potent and efficient in stimulating phosphoinositide turnover in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex than in the choroid plexus. However, for a number of 5-HT receptor antagonists (ketanserin, spiperone, ritanserin, pizotifen, cyproheptadine, mesulergine, mianserin, methiothepin, methysergide) there is a good correlation (r = 0.82) between their antagonistic potency in the hippocampus and choroid plexus while such correlation is not observed for the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The specific 5-HT2 receptor antagonist spiperone only partially antagonizes (37% inhibition at 1 microM) the stimulation by 5-HT of phosphoinositide turnover in the hippocampus. These results suggest that in the immature rat hippocampus the activation of phosphoinositide turnover by 5-HT is mainly mediated by the 5-HT1C receptor subtype.",
