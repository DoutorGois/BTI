     "AB": "Increasing of peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) production during ischemia in the immature brain was considered to be associated with impaired cognitive function. GABAergic synapses played an important role in memory formation including the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in hippocampus. In the present study, we examined the effects of acute exposure of the ONOO(-) donor, SIN-1 on GABAergic synaptic transmission in immature rat hippocampal slices with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. The results showed that SIN-1 increased the peak amplitude of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) and decreased paired pulse ratio via the formation of ONOO(-). In addition, it also increased the frequency of spontaneous (but not miniature) IPSCs in a dose-dependent manner without altering amplitudes or rise and decay times of both (sIPSCs and mIPSCs). It further demonstrated that the presynaptic action of SIN-1 was external calcium dependent and was not related to the changes of interneuron excitability. This study provides electrophysiological evidences from developing hippocampal slices to support that SIN-1 enhances action potential-dependent GABA release. It suggests that the potentiation effect of ONOO(-) may contribute to hyperexcitability and seizures and may underlie one of the mechanisms by which ischemia increases seizure susceptibility in the immature brain.",
