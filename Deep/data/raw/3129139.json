     "AB": "The effects of acute ethanol administration on glucose utilization in the CNS of rat were studied using the 2-deoxyglucose technique. Cerebral glucose utilization was determined for 53 brain regions at peak and descending blood ethanol concentrations averaging 14, 26 and 66 mM. Decreased glucose utilization was the predominant finding and was observed in 20% of the regions evaluated, with median raphe, vestibular nucleus, cerebellar vermis, and various structures associated with the auditory system showing the greatest reductions. The only structures that showed increased glucose utilization were the dentate region of the hippocampus and the superior olive, and this was only apparent at a blood ethanol concentration of 14 mM.",
