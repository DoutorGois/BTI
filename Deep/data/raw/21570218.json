     "AB": "PURPOSE: To determine whether early assessment of cerebral white matter degradation can predict late delayed cognitive decline after radiotherapy (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients undergoing conformal fractionated brain RT participated in a prospective diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging study. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were acquired before RT, at 3 and 6 weeks during RT, and 10, 30, and 78 weeks after starting RT. The diffusivity variables in the parahippocampal cingulum bundle and temporal lobe white matter were computed. A quality-of-life survey and neurocognitive function tests were administered before and after RT at the magnetic resonance imaging follow-up visits. RESULTS: In both structures, longitudinal diffusivity (lambda( ||)) decreased and perpendicular diffusivity (lambda( perpendicular)) increased after RT, with early changes correlating to later changes (p < .05). The radiation dose correlated with an increase in cingulum lambda( perpendicular) at 3 weeks, and patients with >50% of cingula volume receiving >12 Gy had a greater increase in lambda( perpendicular) at 3 and 6 weeks (p < .05). The post-RT changes in verbal recall scores correlated linearly with the late changes in cingulum lambda( ||) (30 weeks, p < .02). Using receiver operating characteristic curves, early cingulum lambda( ||) changes predicted for post-RT changes in verbal recall scores (3 and 6 weeks, p < .05). The neurocognitive test scores correlated significantly with the quality-of-life survey results. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between early diffusivity changes in the parahippocampal cingulum and the late decline in verbal recall suggests that diffusion tensor imaging might be useful as a biomarker for predicting late delayed cognitive decline.",
