     "AB": "Activity-dependent local translation of dendritic mRNAs is one process that underlies synaptic plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that several of the factors known to control polyadenylation-induced translation in early vertebrate development [cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB), maskin, poly(A) polymerase, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and Aurora] also reside at synaptic sites of rat hippocampal neurons. The induction of polyadenylation at synapses is mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which transduces a signal that results in the activation of Aurora kinase. This kinase in turn phosphorylates CPEB, an essential RNA-binding protein, on a critical residue that is necessary for polyadenylation-induced translation. These data demonstrate a remarkable conservation of the regulatory machinery that controls signal-induced mRNA translation, and elucidates an axis connecting the NMDA receptor to localized protein synthesis at synapses.",
