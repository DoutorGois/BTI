     "AB": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) play an important role in synaptic plasticity and brain development. We have previously shown that NR1-pan mRNA is significantly increased in the hippocampus of rats chronically exposed to low levels of lead (Pb(2+)) during development [T.R. Guilarte, J.L. McGlothan, Hippocampal NMDA receptor mRNA undergoes subunit specific changes during developmental lead exposure, Brain Res., 790 (1998) 98-107]. It is not known whether this Pb(2+)-induced increase in NR1-pan mRNA is associated with changes in specific splice isoforms. To study this effect, we used in situ hybridization of oligonucleotides to probe for the NR1-a, NR1-b, NR1-1, NR1-2, and NR1-4 isoforms which are most abundantly expressed in the rat hippocampus. Developmental exposure to increasing levels of Pb(2+) resulted in significant increases in NR1-a mRNA throughout the pyramidal and granule cell layers of the rat hippocampus at postnatal day 14 (PN14). NR1-b mRNA was increased in the pyramidal cell layer of Pb(2+)-exposed rats at PN21. Splicing of the C-terminus cassettes was also regulated by developmental exposure to Pb(2+). NR1-2 mRNA was increased in CA4 pyramidal cells and in dentate granule cells of PN21 Pb(2+)-exposed rats. Notably, expression of NR1-4 mRNA in CA3 pyramidal cells was increased in Pb(2+)-exposed rats at PN14 and decreased at PN21. No significant Pb(2+) effect was measured for NR1-1 mRNA expression. These data indicate that alternative splicing of the NR1 gene shows selective anatomical and temporal regulation by Pb(2+) in the developing rat hippocampus. This study provides further support to the hypothesis that NMDARs are important targets for Pb(2+)-induced neurotoxicity.",
