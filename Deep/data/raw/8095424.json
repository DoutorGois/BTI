     "AB": "A somatostatin-specific antibody (Ab) (1:250) was continuously infused into the stimulated dorsal hippocampus of rats from 4 days before to 26 days after the beginning of kindling or until the first stage 5. Controls received boiled Ab. The number of stimulations to the first stage 5 were reduced by 41 +/- 4% (P < 0.01, Student's t-test) in animals infused with the Ab compared to controls. The cumulative after-discharge in the stimulated hippocampus was slightly, although not significantly, reduced. Kindling was not affected when the Ab was infused only during the first 10 stimulations (stage 2). Histological analysis showed no neurotoxic effects in the hippocampus as a consequence of Ab infusion.",
