     "AB": "To assess the role of the apoptosis-inducing death receptor Fas/CD95 and Fas Ligand (FasL) after global cerebral ischemia, expression of these proteins was investigated in differentially, i.e. selectively vulnerable brain areas. Following experimentally induced cardiac arrest of 6 min duration, rats were resuscitated. After 3, 6, and 24 h of reperfusion, the thalamus and hippocampus of one hemisphere were analyzed for Fas/CD95 and FasL by immunoblotting and semiquantitative densitometry. Corresponding hemispheres were examined by immunohistochemistry. No significant changes in hippocampal Fas/CD95 expression were revealed in comparison to sham operated animals. In the thalamus, a significant reduction in Fas/CD95 expression was observed after 24 h of reperfusion. FasL expression in the hippocampus had declined after 3 and 6 h, as compared with control animals. In contrast, in the thalamus a significant induction of FasL expression was observed after 3 h. Immunohistochemistry revealed a predominantly neuronal expression of the two proteins. In light of the observed increased expression of FasL in the thalamus, such an induction may lead to significant activation of the Fas/CD95 signaling cascade. Our results suggest for the first time a possible role of the Fas/CD95-FasL system after global cerebral ischemia.",
