     "AB": "Effects of minaprine, a psychotropic drug, on changes in monoamines and their metabolites were examined in Mongolian gerbils with 5-min occlusion of the common carotid arteries. Noradrenaline (NA), dopamine, serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindol acetic acid, homovanillic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid contents in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum remained unaltered during a 5-min occlusion. NA levels in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum and 5-HT levels in the hippocampus and striatum significantly decreased 30 min-2 hr after re-circulation. Particularly, minaprine significantly inhibited the decrease of 5-HT in the hippocampus. These observations suggest that the effect of this drug on delayed neuronal death in the CA1 neurons in the hippocampus in Mongolian gerbils with occluded common carotid arteries may be related to the serotonergic system.",
