     "AB": "Thyroid hormone is an essential modulator of brain development, but little is known about its actions in the adult brain. Hypothyroidism is associated with gene expression changes in both central and peripheral nervous tissue. Functional consequences of adult-onset hypothyroidism include an inability to produce long-term potentiation in rat hippocampus and impaired learning and memory in both rats and man. Long-term potentiation is a form of learning that is dependent on functional N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA)-preferring ionotropic glutamate receptors. This work examines the expression of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit mRNA following surgical thyroidectomy with or without thyroid hormone replacement. In situ hybridization histochemistry was used to determine the mRNA levels of the NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, NR2B, the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1, and the kainate receptor subunit KA2. Reducing circulating concentrations of thyroid hormone by surgical removal of the thyroid gland 2 weeks before sacrifice decreased the expression of NR1 mRNA exclusively in the hippocampus. Conversely, hyperthyroidism selectively reduced NR2B mRNA expression in the dorsal hippocampus. Altering thyroid hormone status had no effect on the expression of KA2 or GluR1 subunit mRNA. The regulation of expression of NR1 and NR2B mRNA by thyroid hormone is a novel mechanism for explaining the relationship between thyroid hormone and cognitive function.",
