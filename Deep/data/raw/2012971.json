     "AB": "The relationship between changes in learning behavior and neurological damage following transient forebrain ischemia was studied in rats. The transient forebrain ischemia was induced by 4-vessel occlusion, and behavioral experiments were started 4 weeks later when histological damage to the brain seemed to have stabilized. Histological evaluation of brain damage was conducted after completion of the behavioral studies. The rats showed marked learning impairment in a radial maze task done from 4 to 10 weeks after ischemia. In particular, there was an increase in the number of working memory errors according to the duration of forebrain ischemia. However, the same rats showed good avoidance responses in a passive avoidance task done 12 weeks after ischemia. The rats also showed good acquisition of escape response in a water maze task carried out 13 weeks after ischemia, but showed slight impairment of spatial navigation in the transfer test. Marked neuronal degeneration was observed in the hippocampal pyramidal cells of the rats exposed to ischemia. This neuronal damage was closely related to memory impairment in the radial maze task, as demonstrated by a significant negative correlation (r = -0.609 or -0.709) between the number of surviving neurons and the number of reference or working memory errors. These results suggest that rats exposed to transient forebrain ischemia show marked impairment of both reference and working memories as a result of postischemic hippocampal damage.",
