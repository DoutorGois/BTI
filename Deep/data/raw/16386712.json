     "AB": "Since protein kinase C (PKC) is known to be activated in the olfactory bulb and in several limbic areas related to odor processing, we determined whether an olfactory stimulus was able to modulate the activity of PKC in animals with bilateral entorhinal cortex lesion. The translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane was studied using the phorbol ester 12,13-dibutyrate ([3H]PDBu) binding in control and bilateral entorhinal cortex (EC) lesioned rats. The lesion of EC per se did not significantly affect [3H]PDBu binding in any of the brain structures analyzed, while odor stimulation induced it in both control and EC-lesioned groups in the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb. In contrast, an odor-induced increase of [3H]PDBu binding in internal glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb was only observed in EC lesioned animals. Similar results were obtained in the piriform cortex. In both CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subfields, odor stimulation induced an increase of [3H]PDBu binding in both control and EC-lesioned animals, the increase being potentiated only in CA1 of lesioned rats. The dentate gyrus and the amygdala exhibited a similar pattern of [3H]PDBu binding, showing a significant increase exclusively in EC-lesioned animals after odor stimulation. The results strongly suggest that the EC plays a key role in odor processing. PKC appears to play an important role in responding to the activation of lipid second messengers, which have been described to be involved in the processing of odor stimuli in several structures of the olfactory pathway.",
