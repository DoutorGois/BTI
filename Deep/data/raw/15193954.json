     "PG": "939-46",
     "AB": "Four weeks old (weanling) female rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant and histamine/serotonin receptor blocker mianserin for studying its faulty hormonal imprinting effect. Measurements were done four months later. Brain serotonin levels significantly decreased in four regions (hippocampus, hypothalamus, striatum and brainstem), without any change in the cortex. Sexual activity of the treated and control rats was similar. Cerebrospinal fluid nocistatin level was one magnitude higher in the treated rats, than in the controls. The density of uterine estrogen receptors was significantly reduced, while binding capacity of glucocorticoid receptors of liver and thymus remained at control level. The results call attention to the possibility of 1. a broad spectrum imprinting at the time of weaning by a receptor level acting non-hormone molecule 2. imprinting of the brain in a non-neonatal period of life and 3. a very durable (lifelong?) effect of the late imprinting with an antidepressant.",
