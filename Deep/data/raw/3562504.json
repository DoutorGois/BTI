     "AB": "The objective of this study was to determine the effect of co-dergocrine in rats on local cerebral glucose utilization and performance in a complex T-maze. Middle-aged (12-16 months) male Fischer-344 rats were given injections of co-dergocrine (3 or 10 mg/kg, IP) 35 min before behavioral testing or the administration of 2-deoxy-D-[1-14C]glucose ([14C]DG), a radiotracer for local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU). Both doses stimulated LCGU in the locus ceruleus and median raphe nucleus and in subcortical structures associated with learning and memory (hippocampus and subiculum). The higher dose also stimulated LCGU in motor areas (caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, internal capsule). In contrast, co-dergocrine decreased LCGU in the frontal cortex. Poorer performance in a complex maze (increased shocks, errors and run time) was observed in middle-aged as compared with younger animals (3 months). Acute co-dergocrine treatment did not improve performance of middle-aged rats in this task. Thus, in the present experimental paradigm employing single dose administration, co-dergocrine's stimulation of LCGU was not associated with an alteration of maze performance in age-matched animals.",
