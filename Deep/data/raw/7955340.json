     "AB": "The localization of the rat brain 5-HT1A receptor mRNA was analyzed by RNAse mapping and in situ hybridization during postnatal development, particularly in the cerebellum. The regional distribution of 5-HT1A mRNA during the first 2 postnatal weeks was different from that found in adults. In some areas of the immature brain (hippocampus, cerebral cortex), 5-HT1A mRNA was found in lower density than in the adult brain. In contrast, high concentrations of the transcript were present in other brain structures only during the first days after birth. Thus, in the cerebellum, the density of 5-HT1A mRNA decreased markedly from day 2 to day 9 after birth and could hardly be detected in the adult animal. The localization of the mRNA in the molecular/Purkinje cell layer of the immature cerebellum agreed with that of the 5-HT1A receptor protein visualized by immunocytochemistry and was consistent with the hypothesis that Purkinje cells express this receptor.",
