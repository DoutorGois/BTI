     "AB": "Diabetes is associated with a high risk of developing cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychiatric disabilities, and these disease symptomsare termed diabetic encephalopathy (DEP). Inflammation is involved in the development of DEP. The cleavage and maturation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1beta is regulated by the NLRP3 inflammasome. Obese and type 2 diabetic db/db mice show anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and cognitive disorders associated with hippocampal inflammation. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in DEP. Results showed that expression levels of inflammasome components including NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and caspase-1, as well as IL-1beta in the hippocampus of diabetic db/db mice were higher than those of non-diabetic db/m mice. Treatment of db/db mice with NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 ameliorated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors as well as cognitive dysfunction, and reversed increased NLRP3, ASC, and IL-1betaexpression levels and caspase-1 activity in hippocampus. Moreover, MCC950 treatment significantly improved insulin sensitivity in db/db mice. These results demonstrate that inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation may prove to be a potential therapeutic approach for DEP treatment.",
