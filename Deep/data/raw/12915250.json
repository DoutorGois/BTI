     "AB": "Rodent models of focal and global ischemia were used to examine caspase activation. Several readouts were employed on identical tissue to provide correlative measurement of caspase induction, activation and enzymatic activity. In a rat focal ischemia model, caspase-3 enzymatic activity, as recorded by DEVD-AMC cleavage, peaked in penumbral cortex at 6-12 h following ischemia, correlating with increases in caspase 3-cleaved substrates of PARP and alpha-spectrin and subsequent disappearance of caspase-3 zymogen. Although induction of caspases 8 and 2 proteins was detectable as early as 6 h following ischemia, examination of the same tissues for caspase 8 or 2 enzymatic activities did not show significant modulation up to 12 h after ischemic insult. Caspase 9 induction was evident only after 24 h postischemia and did not correlate with elevated LDHD-AMC cleavage. Following global ischemia in gerbils, levels of caspase-3 enzyme activity peaked at 12 h in hippocampal tissue extracts. Cleaved caspase-3 signal was prominent in NeuN-positive layers in the CA1 region 6-12 h following ischemia. Interestingly, strong caspase-3 immunoreactivity was also detected in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, a known region of ischemia-induced neurogenesis. Caspase-3 activation may be responsible for the loss of these cells, thereby hindering the endogenous recovery process.",
