     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and small vessel disease dementia (SVDD) are common causes of dementia. The ApoE genotype has been proposed as a risk factor for AD. The frequency of the three ApoE alleles was correlated with the neuropathological changes of AD (senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid angiopathy) and SVDD (status lacunaris, status cribosus, leucoencephalopathy, micronecrosis and vascular fibrohyalinosis) in order to validate previous ApoE genotyping results in AD and to identify pre-clinical AD. Representative cerebral regions (cortex, gyrus cinguli, putamen, hippocampus, white matter) from 28 AD cases, 7 SVDD and 38 non-neurological controls were studied using classical histological techniques and immunohistochemistry for tau protein and amyloid-beta. The frequency of the ApoE allele 4 was significantly increased not only in AD patients but also in aged controls. However, following a detailed histopathological examination was found 62% of this group to exhibit histological changes associated with AD in limited brain areas (entorhinal region, hippocampus and adjacent temporal cortex or entorhinal region and hippocampus, or only in the entorhinal region), but 87% of these cases were found to be ApoE4 positive. The significant differences found in the distribution of ApoE allele frequencies were more marked when these cases were excluded from the control group and included as AD cases. In contrast, the frequency of the ApoE allele 2 is significantly increased in SVDD patients. Using histological techniques we confirmed the clinical diagnoses of all cases and classified the AD patients according to the severity of cortical pathology related to AD, while re-grouping from the control group those cases which had no clinical history of the disease but exhibited typical AD and SVDD histological lessions which could be considered as \"pre-clinical\" forms of these diseases.",
