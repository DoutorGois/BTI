     "AB": "A critical role of oxidative stress has been implicated in ischemic brain damage. Mild ischemic pretreatment and/or synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs) has been suggested to protect against oxidative brain damage. However, experimental support of this suggestion have proven to be difficult partly because sensitive indices to assess oxidative consequences of ischemic brain damage were few. In this study, we have attempted to establish biochemical assay systems to quantitate oxidative brain damage following ischemia. We produced experimental brain ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) and examined the hippocampus for ischemic brain damage. The results obtained from ischemic gerbil hippocampus demonstrated that oxidative brain damage can be quantitated by determining glutathione oxidation ratio together with the accumulation of the oxidative DNA damage product, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8 ohdG). Our results also demonstrated a role for mild ischemic pretreatment and synthesis of HSPs against oxidative brain damage. We showed that mild 2-min ischemic pretreatment reduced the degree of both glutathione oxidation ratio and 8 ohdG accumulation in gerbil hippocampus subsequent to 10 min ischemic challenge. We also showed that the accumulation of HSP70 was closely associated with the reduction of oxidative brain damage. To our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate glutathione redox states and oxidative DNA damage levels to evaluate a protective role of mild ischemic pretreatment and HSP synthesis following brain ischemia. Our data validate the previous suggestions and provide new additional data that argue for the protective role of mild ischemic pretreatment and HSP70 synthesis against oxidative brain damage.",
