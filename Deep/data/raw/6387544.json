     "AB": "A new double-labeling method combining immunocytochemistry and a retrograde tracer technique using biotin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (B-HRP) was developed. Retrogradely accumulated B-HRP was visualized in the soma by incubation with avidin-conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-green fluorescein) solution. Texas red (red fluorescein)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used for simultaneous demonstration of the antigen. Using this method, the present study reports a newly demonstrated commissural hippocampal alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormonergic neuron system in the rat.",
