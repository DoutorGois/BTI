     "AB": "Brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease contain diffuse and senile amyloid plaques. Using an experimental model, we have addressed the issue whether diffuse plaques of amyloid persist, develop with time, or both, in rats injected with human beta-amyloid-(1-42)-peptide for 3 and 12 mon after brain ischemia. Rats receiving beta-amyloid peptide for 3 months after brain ischemia demonstrated widespread diffuse amyloid plaques in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Neuronal, glial, ependymal, endothelial and pericyte cell bodies were observed filled with beta-amyloid peptide. No staining was observed in control brains. In the group alive 1 year no deposition of human beta-amyloid peptide was observed, too. Direct evidence that diffuse amyloid plaques can disappear in the brain is thus provided for the first time.",
