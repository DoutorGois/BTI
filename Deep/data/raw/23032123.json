     "AB": "This report describes a patient who misidentified all surrounding persons as her family after a cerebral hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe. She had no difficulty with visual face recognition. Single-photon emission computed tomography revealed hyperperfusion in the right amygdala and hippocampus. Electroencephalography showed a bilateral fronto-temporal delta burst intermittently during the symptom. Carbamazepine suppressed the symptom completely. These results suggest that hyperexcitability in the right limbic system and bilateral fronto-temporal cortex might cause the alteration of familiarity. She felt a strong sense of familiarity to others. Perhaps because it lasted a long time, she regarded these other people as her family.",
