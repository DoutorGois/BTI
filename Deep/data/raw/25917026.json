     "AB": "4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) is a potassium channel blocker used for the treatment of neuromuscular disorders. Otherwise, it has been described to produce a large number of adverse effects among them cell death mediated mainly by blockage of K(+) channels. However, a protective effect against cell death has also been described. On the other hand, Kv channel interacting protein 1 (KChIP1) is a neuronal calcium sensor protein that is predominantly expressed at GABAergic synapses and it has been related with modulation of K(+) channels, GABAergic transmission and cell death. According to this KChIP1 could play a key role in the protective or toxic effects induced by 4-AP. We evaluated, in wild type and KChIP1 silenced primary hippocampal neurons, the effect of 4-AP (0.25muM to 2mM) with or without semicarbazide (0.3M) co-treatment after 24h and after 14 days 4-AP alone exposure on cell viability, the effect of 4-AP (0.25muM to 2mM) on KChIP1 and Kv 4.3 potassium channels gene expression and GABAergic transmission after 24h treatment or after 14 days exposure to 4-AP (0.25muM to1muM). 4-AP induced cell death after 24h (from 1mM) and after 14 days treatment. We observed that 4-AP modulates KChIP1 which regulate Kv 4.3 channels expression and GABAergic transmission. Our study suggests that KChIP1 is a key gene that has a protective effect up to certain concentration after short-term treatment with 4-AP against induced cell injury; but this protection is erased after long term exposure, due to KChIP1 down-regulation predisposing cell to 4-AP induced damages. These data might help to explain protective and toxic effects observed after overdose and long term exposure.",
