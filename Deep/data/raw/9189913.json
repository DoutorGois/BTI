     "AB": "We previously isolated the cell cycle element SKP1 as a candidate plasticity gene in the rat visual cortex. Here, we studied the expression and localization of SKP1 mRNA and protein in rat brain. We found a high level of expression for the SKP1 gene in the cortex at different postnatal ages. SKP1 mRNA levels remained stable from P2 (postnatal day 2) to adulthood. SKP1 mRNA expression was also detected in several other brain areas. Skp1p (SKP1 protein) immunohistochemistry showed nuclear staining in a large majority of neurones. The pyramidal cells in the hippocampus, as well as cortical cells were stained. The presence of Skp1p in post-mitotic neurones suggests that this protein is involved in processes other than the cell cycles other target proteins and functions in neurones are currently under investigation.",
