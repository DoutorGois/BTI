     "AB": "The metabotropic glutamate type 7 (mglu(7)) receptor is a widely distributed, mainly presynaptic Group III mglu receptor that can regulate glutamate release. Recently, largely as a result of the identification of specific proteins that interact with the C-terminal domain of this receptor, considerable progress has been made towards understanding some of the mechanisms that underlie the regulation, signal transduction pathways and targeting of mglu(7) receptors. This has led to the proposal that there are three distinct functionally relevant domains present in the intracellular C-terminus of this receptor: (1) a proximal intracellular signalling domain that interacts with G-protein betagamma-subunits and the Ca(2+) sensor Ca(2+)-calmodulin, and is phosphorylated by protein kinase; (2) a central domain thought to provide a signal for axonal targeting; and (3) an extreme PDZ-binding motif that interacts with the protein kinase C interacting protein, PICK1.",
