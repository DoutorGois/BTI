     "AB": "The involvement of kainate (KA)-sensitive regions in ethanol withdrawal behaviors was investigated in male Wistar rats given three intraperitoneal (IP) injections of KA (12 mg/kg) or saline each followed by recovery at 4 degrees C for 5 h and room temperature for 3 days and a final KA or saline injection at room temperature. Some animals received MK-801 (1 mg/kg, IP) 30 min after each injection and one group received saline only. The saline/saline, saline/MK-801, and KA/MK-801 groups displayed typical ethanol withdrawal behaviors 8-12 h after ethanol withdrawal. These behaviors were attenuated in the KA/saline group. Audiogenic seizures could be induced in all treatment groups 12 h after withdrawal. There was severe neuronal degeneration in the hippocampal CA region and the piriform cortex of the KA/saline-treated animals that was reduced by MK-801 treatment. The inferior colliculus remained intact. These results suggest that the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mediates KA-induced damage in limbic structures and that these regions may play an important role in typical, but not audiogenically induced ethanol-withdrawal behaviors.",
