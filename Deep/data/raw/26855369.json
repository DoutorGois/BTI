     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. It has become increasingly clear that while neuronal cell loss in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus occurs in Alzheimer's disease, it is preceded by a long period of deficits in the connectivity of the hippocampal formation that contributes to the vulnerability of these circuits. Hippocampal neurogenesis plays a role in the maintenance and function of the dentate gyrus and hippocampal circuitry. This review will examine the evidence suggesting that hippocampal neurogenesis plays a role in cognitive function that is affected in Alzheimer's disease, will discuss the cognitive assessments used for the detection of Alzheimer's disease in humans and rodent models of familial Alzheimer's disease, and their value for unraveling the mechanism underlying the development of cognitive impairments and dementia.",
