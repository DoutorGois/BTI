     "AB": "Evidence suggests that brain tissues of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are easily attacked by oxidative stress, and numerous studies indicate that heme oxygenase (HO) is a major cell adaptive responder to stress. However, whether HO1 and HO2 play different roles in this process has not yet been studied. In the present study, it was shown in an AD model that HO1 and HO2 have different roles in the early stages of AD. Learning and memory ability was tested in APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic and wildtype mice using the Morris water maze. betaamyloid plaques were measured using immunofluorescence staining. Changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the hippocampi were measured using a fluorescence technique. The results indicated that the escape latency, amyloid plaque deposition and ROS production increased in the hippocampi of APP/PS1 transgenic mice compared with wildtype mice. Furthermore, using doubleimmunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis, it was found that the expression of HO1 and HO2 increased in the hippocampi of APP/PS1 mice and, notably, HO2 was also found to be overexpressed in astrocytes. Little difference was observed in the plasma HO1 concentrations between the two groups, while the plasma HO2 concentration of the APP/PS1 mice was lower than that of the wildtype mice, shown by ELISA. In conclusion, HO2 overexpression is an early event and plays a more critical role in the progression of AD.",
