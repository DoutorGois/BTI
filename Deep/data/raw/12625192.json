     "AB": "Even though there is an abundance of information about the complications of hypertension, studies of its influence on visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are rare. In previous studies, it was pointed out that hypertension induces changes on VEPs. However, it has not yet been clarified which models of hypertension are more effective on VEPs. The aim of this study was to investigate this subject in rats. Animals were divided equally into six groups: control group (C), sham operated (Sham), two kidney-one clip (2K-1C), one kidney-one clip (1K-1C), deoxycorticosterone-salt (DOCA), and N-omega-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) groups. Mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in four hypertensive groups compared with control and sham groups, but there were no significant differences either among hypertensive groups or between sham and control groups. At the end of the experimental period, flash visual evoked potentials were recorded. The mean latencies of P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 components were significantly prolonged in all hypertensive groups compared with the control and sham groups. The mean latencies of all VEPs components in the L-NAME group were longer than in the other hypertensive groups. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were determined as an indicator of lipid peroxidation. Our data showed that hypertension caused a significant increase of lipid peroxidation in brain and retinal tissues. Additionally, plasma renin activity (PRA) was highest in the 2K-1C group and lowest in the DOCA group.",
