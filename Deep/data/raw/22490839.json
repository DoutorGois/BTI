     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of a continuous low-dose of X-ray upon neuronal morphology and expression of microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2) in hippocampus of young rats. METHODS: A total of 18 Sprague-Dawley rats aged 35 days were randomly divided into two irradiated groups and one control group (n = 6 each). The irradiated groups received different doses of 0.2 mGy/d, 1.0 mGy/d for 7 consecutive days while the control group sham radiation. The hippocampal pyramidal cell was observed by HE staining, the expression of MAP-2 by immunohistochemistry and Western blot, and the morphologies of microtubule and synapse in CA1 by electron microscopy. RESULTS: (1) The phenomenon of neurodegeneration was observed in the 1.0 mGy group while the control and 0.2 mGy groups were normal; (2) the average optical density of positive MAP-2 protein significantly decreased in the 1.0 mGy group (0.242 +/- 0.017) in the region of CA1 versus the control group (0.282 +/- 0.016) (F = 14.419, P = 0.005). And the average optical density of positive MAP-2 significantly increased in the 0.2 mGy group (0.331 +/- 0.017) compared with the control group (F = 21.700, P = 0.002). The expression of total MAP-2 significantly decreased in the 1.0 mGy group (0.332 +/- 0.001) versus the control group (0.370 +/- 0.012) (F = 28.055, P = 0.000). And the expression of total MAP-2 significantly increased in the 0.2 mGy group (0.455 +/- 0.018) versus the control group (F = 61.974, P = 0.002); (3) there were the reduction of microtubule and the damage of postsynaptic density (PSD) in the 1.0 mGy group in hippocampal CA1. Increased microtubule and normal synapses were found in the 0.2 mGy group in hippocampal CA1. CONCLUSION: The expression of MAP-2 is strongly associated with the integrity of hippocampal neurons in young rats. The 0.2 mGy group may promote the proliferation of hippocampal microtubule in hippocampus and further promote the expression of MAP-2. And the damage of microtubule and PSD on neuron could reduce the expression of MAP-2 in the 1.0 mGy group.",
