     "AB": "We have previously demonstrated that 4-day-treatment of mice with bilobalide, a sesquiterpene of Ginkgo biloba L., increases GABA levels in mouse brain, but, effects of chronic treatment with it are not clear. To study effects of chronic treatment of mice with bilobalide on amino acid levels in the brain, we determined the levels of aspartate, glutamate, serine, glutamine, glycine, taurine and GABA in the hippocampus, striatum and cortex. Bilobalide (3 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to 4-week-old mice for 40 days. Bilobalide treatment resulted in a significant increase in the levels of glutamate, aspartate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glycine in the hippocampus of mice compared with the control. An increased level of glycine after bilobalide treatment was also detected in the striatum. In the cortex, bilobalide increased the GABA level, whereas it decreased the level of aspartate. These changes in the levels of various amino acids may be involved in the broad spectrum of pharmacological activities of the extract of Ginkgo biloba on the central nervous system.",
