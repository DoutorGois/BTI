     "AB": "1. Whole cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells were performed to investigate the interaction between excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) or currents (EPSCs), and the slow Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) current, I(sAHP). Blockers of the slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) such as isoprenaline (ISO) or noradrenaline (NA) reduced the hyperpolarization that followed a short train of EPSPs, and slowed the decay of summated EPSPs or EPSCs. 2. ISO/NA action on synaptic responses was observed in the absence of action potentials, but was curtailed by Ca(2+) chelation (10 mM EGTA in the electrode) and was not observed with a caesium-based recording solution. This suggests the involvement of an ISO/NA-sensitive Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) current without a requirement for regenerative spiking. 3. An ISO/NA-sensitive sAHP was observed following both NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-mediated EPSP trains in nominally zero Mg(2+) medium. Isoprenaline sensitivity was blocked by hyperpolarization during EPSPs or by isradipine, suggesting a requirement for voltage-dependent Ca(2+) influx during EPSPs. The data indicate that bursts of EPSPs can activate voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, which trigger I(sAHP) during synaptic responses. 4. A decrease in EPSP temporal summation occurred during both spike-evoked sAHPs and persistent activation of sAHP conductance following internal dialysis with diazo-2 (2 mM). At constant membrane potential, diazo-2 caused a decrease in membrane time constant and input resistance and accelerated the rate of EPSP decay. Photolysis of diazo-2 or application of NA reduced the resting sAHP conductance, causing an increased membrane time constant and input resistance in association with an increase in EPSP half-width. 5. These results indicate that short bursts of EPSPs can activate a Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) current resembling I(sAHP), and that activation of this current reduces the postsynaptic response to high-frequency synaptic input. The findings imply that modulation of I(sAHP) can regulate synaptic efficacy and may influence the threshold for tetanus-induced synaptic plasticity.",
