     "AB": "PURPOSE: Combined electroencephalography (EEG) and functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) can be useful in the evaluation of epilepsy patients. The reproducibility of EEG-fMRI findings needs to be established to consider it as a clinically valuable method. We addressed the intrasubject reproducibility of EEG-fMRI and the possible superiority of higher magnetic field strength in patients who were scanned twice. METHODS: Fifteen patients were studied: Seven had one 1.5T and one 3T scan and eight had two 3T EEG-fMRI studies. Equal numbers of events of the same interictal epileptic discharge (IED) were included, and IED-related blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) results were compared. KEY FINDINGS: In 1.5T-3T comparisons, five patients had BOLD responses in both studies, but in four there was a better response (higher maximum t-score and larger cluster) in 3T studies. One patient had a BOLD response in the 3T study only. The remaining patient had no BOLD response in either study. In 3T-3T comparisons, results were reproducible in five of eight patients, and one patient had no response in both studies. The two remaining patients had previous extensive surgery and extremely frequent IEDs. Some of the reproduced patterns in other patients, however, differed in terms of maximum t-score and cluster size. SIGNIFICANCE: EEG-fMRI appears to provide reasonable reproducibility, although repeated studies may show differences. The absence of BOLD response seems to be reproducible as well. EEG-fMRI results tend to benefit from higher field scanners (3T over 1.5T). Further studies are needed to determine if reproducibility depends on specific clinical, electrographic, or anatomic findings.",
