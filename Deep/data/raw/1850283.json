     "AB": "Rats were exposed for 24 min to bilateral clamping of the common carotid arteries (BCCA) in pentobarbital anaesthesia. 14 days later the animals were subjected to subcutaneous injection of (+)-bicuculline (3 or 4 mg/kg). A significantly decreased susceptibility to bicuculline-induced seizures could be observed in BCCA treated rats compared with sham operated controls. It is suggested that BCCA treatment protects animals against status epilepticus and lethal toxicity produced by bicuculline. Electrographic recordings of the BCCA animals revealed no ictal activity within 1 h after bicuculline injection. An analysis of the GABA content showed a significant increase in the hippocampus (HPC), frontal cortex (FCX), parietal cortex and substantia nigra in BCCA animals compared with controls. It is therefore possible that an increase in GABA content postsynaptically counteracts the GABAA antagonistic effect of bicuculline in BCCA animals thus preventing the normal seizure inducing effect of this substance.",
