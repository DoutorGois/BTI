     "AB": "Stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors was found to induce proteolysis of brain spectrin in hippocampal slices. The effect was dependent upon extracellular calcium, blocked by the antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (AP5), and was not reproduced by potassium-induced depolarization. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the involvement of NMDA receptors in plasticity and excitotoxicity is at least partially mediated by calcium-activated proteolysis of cytoskeletal proteins.",
