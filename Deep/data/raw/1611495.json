     "AB": "Rats were administered 8 injections of 12.5 mg/kg fenfluramine over a 4-day period. Extracellular hippocampal serotonin levels were monitored in vivo during the 4-day treatment period. Predrug baseline serotonin levels were 0.6 +/- 0.17 pg/5 microliters; 60 min after the first fenfluramine injection extracellular serotonin levels were increased to 28.06 +/- 5.2 pg/5 microliters. Fenfluramine-induced increases in serotonin were substantially reduced on the 2nd through 4th days of the regimen. Baseline serotonin levels were increased on days 2 through 4 of the treatment regimen. In a separate group of animals post-mortem tissue concentrations of serotonin were measured 2 weeks after 1,2,4, or 8 injections of 12.5 mg/kg fenfluramine. There were decreases in serotonin tissue concentrations which were related to the number of fenfluramine injections administered. The in vivo dialysis and post-mortem tissue assay results are consistent with the view that fenfluramine is neurotoxic.",
