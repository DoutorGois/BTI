     "AB": "The role of the hippocampus and subiculum in classical conditioning of tone-light discrimination reversal learning of the rabbit nictitating membrane response was investigated using aspiration lesions of both limbic structures. Only two of seven animals with hippocampal-subicular damage successfully reached reversal criteria within 21 days of conditioning, although all hippocampectomized animals learned the initial discrimination at rates equivalent to those of two control groups. Thus, previously reported deficits in two-tone reversal learning seen after similar lesions are not due to increased within-modality generalization to the conditioned stimuli (CS) serving as the CS+ and CS-.",
