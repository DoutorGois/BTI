     "AB": "The Morris water maze (MWM) technique is well known as a prominent method of evaluating learning acquisition and memory retention impairments in rats. We previously reported on a modified fluid percussion device that is able to consistently produce experimental cortical contusion (CC) and diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in separate groups of rats. The purpose of the present protocol is to evaluate the differences in learning acquisition and memory retention impairments between these two types of injured rats in the chronic stage using the MWM technique. CC and DAI rats are respectively induced by lateral and midline fluid percussion. We also compare the histological differences between these two different types of traumatic brain injury. The results show statistically significant differences in learning acquisition impairment between the sham and CC rats and between the sham and DAI rats. However, a difference in memory retention impairment was expected to be seen only between the sham and DAI rats. Histologically, the loss of CA3 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus was observed ipsilaterally in the CC and bilaterally in DAI. Neuronal cell loss was observed in bilaterally in layer II of the entorhinal cortex in DAI, but not in CC.",
