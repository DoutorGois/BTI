     "AB": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats, trained to perform a delayed-non-match-to-sample eight-arm radial maze task, were implanted with a single cannula aimed at the medial septal nucleus. A within-subjects design was utilized to examine the effects of intraseptal administration of bicuculline (0.5 micrograms) on performance of this task with 1- and 4-h delay intervals imposed between choices four and five. Administration of bicuculline immediately following the first four choices produced an impairment in maze performance at both a 1- and a 4-h delay interval. This treatment also produced an increase in latency per choice. Bicuculline-induced impairments were not observed when administered 2 h following the predelay session (2 h prior to testing). These data support previous observations that pharmacological manipulation of GABAergic activity within the septum modifies working memory processes.",
