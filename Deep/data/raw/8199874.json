     "AB": "To investigate the role of non-NMDA receptors in epileptic seizures, we examined the antiepileptogenic and anticonvulsant effects of NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)-quinoxaline), a potent and selective AMPA receptor antagonist, in the rat kindling model. Systemic administration of 10-40 mg/kg NBQX significantly and dose dependently suppressed previously kindled seizures from the amygdala (AM), assessed in terms of the motor seizure stage and afterdischarge (AD) duration. The maximal effects were observed at 0.5-1 h after drug injection. When the intensity of electrical stimulation was increased to twice the generalized seizure-triggering threshold (GST), the anticonvulsant effects of NBQX on AM-kindled seizures were not reversed, suggesting that the effects were not due to non-specific elevation of the GST. In contrast to AM-kindled seizures, 20-40 mg/kg NBQX significantly suppressed only the motor seizure stage without reducing the AD duration of previously hippocampal-kindled seizures. Daily administration of 15 or 30 mg/kg NBQX prior to each electrical stimulation of the AM markedly and significantly suppressed the development of kindling. During drug sessions, the growth of the AD duration was blocked almost completely, while the waveform of ADs became more complex. These results indicate that NBQX has potent antiepileptogenic and anticonvulsant actions on kindling, at least from the AM and that non-NMDA receptors have an important role in seizure propagation.",
