     "AB": "Actions of norepinephrine (NE) in the dentate gyrus were examined before and after kindling-induced epilepsy, neuronal plasticity produced by daily high-frequency stimulation. NE, acting on beta 1-receptors, depolarized granule cells, increased input resistance, firing and influx of Ca2+ in response to repetitive stimulation, and elicited long-lasting potentiation of synaptic potentials. In addition, NE acting via alpha 1-receptors, attenuated Ca2+-dependent regenerative potentials. After kindling-induced plasticity, there were marked reductions in all these effects of NE on granule cells, changes likely to influence kindling-induced seizures, protecting against further enhancement of excitability once plasticity is in place.",
