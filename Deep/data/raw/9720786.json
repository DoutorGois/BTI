     "AB": "1. The effects of the active metabolite of chloral derivative sedative-hypnotic agents, 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (trichloroethanol), and its analog 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (trifluoroethanol), were studied on ion current activated by the excitatory amino acids N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainate in mouse hippocampal neurones in culture using whole-cell patch-clamp recording. 2. Both trichloroethanol and trifluoroethanol inhibited excitatory amino acid-activated currents in a concentration-dependent manner. Trichloroethanol inhibited NMDA- and kainate-activated currents with IC50 values of 6.4 and 12 mM, respectively, while trifluoroethanol inhibited NMDA- and kainate-activated currents with IC50 values of 28 and 35 mM, respectively. 3. Both trichloroethanol and trifluoroethanol appeared to be able to inhibit excitatory amino acid-activated currents by 100 per cent. 4.Concentration-response analysis of NMDA- and kainate-activated current revealed that trichloroethanol decreased the maximal response to both agonists without significantly affecting their EC50 values. 5. Both trichloroethanol and trifluoroethanol inhibited excitatory amino acid-activated currents more potently than did ethanol. The inhibitory potency of trichloroethanol and trifluoroethanol appears to be associated with their increased hydrophobicity. 6. The observation that trichloroethanol inhibits excitatory amino acid-activated currents at anaesthetic concentrations suggests that inhibition of excitatory amino acid receptors may contribute to the CNS depressant effects of chloral derivative sedative-hypnotic agents.",
