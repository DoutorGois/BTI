     "AB": "Therapeutics for cerebral ischemia/hypoxia, which often results in ischemic stroke in humans, are a global unmet medical need. Here, we report that bryostatin-1, a highly potent protein kinase C (PKC) activator, interrupts pathophysiological molecular cascades and apoptosis triggered by cerebral ischemia/hypoxia, enhances neurotrophic activity, and induces synaptogenesis in rats. This postischemic therapeutic approach is further shown to preserve learning and memory capacity even 4 months later as well as long-term memory induced before the ischemic event. Our results of electromicroscopic and immunohistochemical analyses of neuronal and synaptic ultra-structure are consistent with a PKC-mediated synaptic remodeling and repair process that confers long-lasting preservation of spatial learning and memory before and after the cerebral ischemic/hypoxic event, suggesting a previously undescribed therapeutic modality for cerebral ischemia/hypoxia and ischemic stroke.",
