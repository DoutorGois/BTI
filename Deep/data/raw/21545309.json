     "AB": "The activation of event-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and cytosolic phospholipaseA2 (cPLA2), which can aggravate hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) damage related to their downstream Bcl-2/Bax and Caspase-3 pathway, plays a key role in H/R. The M1 receptors could be responsible for activation of ERK1/2. Thus, it seems that the regulation of M1 receptors mediated the ERK1/2; cPLA2-mediated Bcl-2/Bax pathway may be a significant responsive signal in H/R. Penehyclidine hydrochloride (PHC) is an anticholinergic agent with high degree of selectivity for M1 and M3 receptor subtypes, it is reported that PHC has a protective effect against H/R damage. Here we hypothesize and demonstrate that PHC could downregulate the expression of pERK1/2, cPLA2, and Caspase-3, increased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. This study may widen the application of PHC and therapeutic agents of stroke.",
