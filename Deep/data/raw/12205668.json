     "AB": "Both nestin and the neural RNA-binding protein Musashi1 (Msi1) are expressed in neural stem cells in the subventricular zone. Neurogenesis in the hippocampus has received much attention, so we evaluated the expression of Msi1 and nestin in the adult rat hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia. Both Msi1 and nestin were induced in the reactive astrocytes after ischemia, especially in the CA1 region, until 35 days after ischemia. Induction of both molecules suggested that reactive astrocytes might have immature characteristics. In the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, Msi1-positive cells formed clusters after ischemia. These cells were labeled by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) but did not express glial fibrillary acidic protein. In contrast, very few nestin-positive cells were labeled by BrdU. Our results suggest that neuronal progenitor cells in the SGZ expressed Msi1 but not nestin.",
