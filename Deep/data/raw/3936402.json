     "AB": "Electrically kindled hippocampal seizures in rats were used to evaluate the acute effects of the antidepressants amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, bupropion, maprotiline, and trazodone on behavioral and electrical convulsions. All of the drugs reduced afterdischarge duration significantly. Behavioral seizures were not significantly reduced by bupropion or trazodone, whereas the other drugs did reduce seizure severity. Afterdischarge threshold was not modified by these drugs. In contrast, phenobarbital significantly elevated threshold and reduced seizure severity and afterdischarge duration. Amitriptyline was the most effective antidepressant, attenuating both seizure severity and afterdischarge duration.",
