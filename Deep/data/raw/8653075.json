Using the spin labels, 5- and 16-DS-stearic acid, the order parameter for 5-DS was found to be increased in all brain areas with aging and a much greater increase was found in the hippocampus and cerebellum at 18 months of age. The results demonstrated that there was a different pattern of the increase of the parameter between 15-DS and 16-DS in synaptosomal membranes of different brain regions with aging.",
