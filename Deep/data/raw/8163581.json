     "AB": "Acute lesions of hippocampal pathways have been shown previously to ameliorate CA1 pyramidal cell loss after subsequent transient cerebral ischemia. In this study, we examined the effect of chronic neonatal lesion with reorganization of hippocampal circuitry on adult postischemic neuron loss in the hippocampus. Newborn rats were subjected to unilateral knife-cut lesions at various positions along the trisynaptic entorhino-dentato-hippocampal pathway. Seven months later, the rats were subjected to transient cerebral ischemia using the four-vessel occlusion technique. At the time of killing 4 days later, a Nissl stain was used to demonstrate neuronal degeneration, while connective reorganization resulting from the neonatal lesions was monitored by Timm staining. In one group of rats, neonatal lesions had caused severe depletion of entorhinal projections to the septodorsal fascia dentata and hippocampus (CA1 and CA3), without any direct damage to the dorsal hippocampus itself. Another group had extensive damage of the dorsal CA3, with removal of the Schaffer collaterals from these levels to CA1, and variable damage to the entorhinal afferents. In both groups, the extent and pattern of ischemia-induced degeneration of CA1 pyramidal cells were the same on the lesioned and nonlesioned sides of the brain, demonstrating that neonatal lesions and the subsequent connective reorganization did not have a sparing effect. Seen in relationship to previous observations in adult rats of the neuroprotective actions of acute, preischemic lesions of the trisynaptic hippocampal pathway, it is concluded that CA1 pyramidal cell loss requires the presence of intact excitatory afferents rather than an intact hippocampal circuitry.",
