     "AB": "Immediate postretrieval bilateral blockade of long-acting voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCCs), but not of glutamatergic NMDA receptors, in the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus hinders retention of long-term spatial memory in the Morris water maze. Immediate postretrieval bilateral inhibition of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II in dorsal CA1 does not affect retention of this task 24 h later but does hinder it 5 d later. These two distinct amnesic effects are abolished if protein degradation by proteasomes is inhibited concomitantly. These results indicate that spatial memory reconsolidation depends on the functionality of L-VDCC in dorsal CA1, that maintenance of subsequent reconsolidated memory trace depends on CaMKII, and these results also suggest that the role played by both L-VDCC and CaMKII is to promote the retrieval-dependent, synaptically localized enhancement of protein synthesis necessary to counteract a retrieval-dependent, synaptic-localized enhancement of protein degradation, which has been described as underlying the characteristic labilization of the memory trace triggered by retrieval. Thus, conceivably, L-VDCC and CaMKII would enhance activity-dependent localized protein renewal, which may account for the improvement of the long-term efficiency of the synapses responsible for the maintenance of reactivated long-term spatial memory.",
