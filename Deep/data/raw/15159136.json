     "AB": "Interleukin-6-deficient (IL-6(-/-)) mice and their normal littermate (WT) were studied to evaluate their susceptibility to seizures induced by electroshock and audiogenic stimuli at different ages. No significant changes in maximal electroshock susceptibility were evidenced between the two strains, while audiogenic seizures (AGS) can be induced only in IL-6(-/-) mice. The effects of age and genetic condition on AGSs were evaluated. The behavioural and electrocortical changes during audiogenic stimulus were observed. In addition, the levels of neurotransmitter amino acids in five brain areas (of both strains) were measured at 60 days of age. Aspartate level significantly increased in the brain stem (BS) and hippocampus (HI), while it decreased in the diencephalon (DE) of IL-6(-/-) mice. Glutamate content significantly decreased in the cerebellum (CB), DE and HI. GABA levels significantly decreased in all the areas studied. Glycine significantly decreased in the BS, CB and DE, while taurine decreased only in the DE. The levels of glutamine significantly decreased in all the areas examined, except in the cortex (CX). The changes of neuroactive amino acid levels, particularly in the BS, might explain the characteristic of high propensity to AGS of IL-6(-/-) mice. The present data support the validity of IL-6(-/-) mice as a novel epileptic model for the study of the pathophysiology and pharmacology of epilepsy.",
