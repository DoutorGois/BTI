     "AB": "A description is given of a functional silicon micromachined device that permits non-invasive, bidirectional, highly specific communication with cultured mammalian neurons. The heart of the system is a well structure that holds the cell in close proximity to a metal extracellular electrode while permitting normal outgrowth of axons and dendrites. An iterative approach is used to create a design that allows normal growth of the neurons while preventing their escape. An array of 16 such neurowells makes it possible to perform studies of biological neural network development and function with unprecedented detail.",
