     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Refinement of mature cognitive functions, such as working memory and decision making, typically takes place during adolescence. The acquisition of these functions is linked to the protracted development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dopamine facilitation of glutamatergic transmission. However, the mechanisms that support these changes during adolescence remain elusive. METHODS: Electrophysiological recordings (in vitro and in vivo) combined with pharmacologic manipulations were employed to determine how N-methyl-D-aspartate transmission in the medial PFC changes during the adolescent transition to adulthood. The relative contribution of GluN2B transmission and its modulation by postsynaptic protein kinase A and D1 receptor signaling were determined in two distinct age groups of rats: postnatal day (P)25 to P40 and P50 to P80. RESULTS: We found that only N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor transmission onto the apical dendrite of layer V pyramidal neurons undergoes late adolescent remodeling due to a functional emergence of GluN2B function after P40. Both protein kinase A and dopamine D1 receptor signaling are required for the functional expression of GluN2B transmission and to sustain PFC plasticity in response to ventral hippocampal, but not basolateral amygdala, inputs. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the late adolescent acquisition of GluN2B function provides a mechanism for dopamine D1-mediated regulation of PFC responses in an input-specific manner.",
