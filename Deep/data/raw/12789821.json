     "AB": "Dysfunction of limbic structures of temporal lobes (mainly, hippocampus), chiasmus, hypothalamus and epiphysis are followed by inner time-keeping disorder. In temporal lobes and skull base lesions, auto-chronometric shifts are of the same type, being mostly pronounced and not directly connected with either locomotor parameters, or with changes of CNS general functional condition. Regardless of CNS dynamic state disorders, any serious defects of endogenous time-keeping were not found both in patients with spinal or vertebral injuries, including those with tumor processes, and in patients with extensive lesions of fronto-parietal neocortex regions. These findings allow considering cerebral oscillator formations--hippocampus, hypothalamic region, epiphysis--as the structures involved directly in physiological mechanisms of autochronometric regulation.",
