     "AB": "Brain stimulation is an alternative treatment for epilepsy. However, the neuronal circuits underlying its mechanisms remain obscure. We found that optogenetic activation (1Hz) of entorhinal calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKIIalpha)-positive neurons, but not GABAergic neurons, retarded hippocampal epileptogenesis and reduced hippocampal seizure severity, similar to that of entorhinal low-frequency electrical stimulation (LFES). Optogenetic inhibition of entorhinal CaMKIIalpha-positive neurons blocked the antiepileptic effect of LFES. The channelrhodopsin-2-eYFP labeled entorhinal CaMKIIalpha-positive neurons primarily targeted the hippocampus, and the activation of these fibers reduced hippocampal seizure severity. By combining extracellular recording and pharmacological methods, we found that activating entorhinal CaMKIIalpha-positive neurons induced the GABA-mediated inhibition of hippocampal neurons. Optogenetic activation of focal hippocampal GABAergic neurons mimicked this neuronal modulatory effect and reduced hippocampal seizure severity, but the anti-epileptic effect is weaker than that of entorhinal LFES, which may be due to the limited spatial neuronal modulatory effect of focal photo-stimulation. Our results demonstrate a glutamatergic-GABAergic neuronal circuit for LFES treatment of epilepsy, which is mediated by entorhinal principal neurons.",
