     "AB": "Binding of (125I)iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) and (3H)CGP-12177 to rat brain homogenates was characterized and compared. ICYP was shown to bind to both beta-adrenergic and serotonin1B (5HT1B) receptors whereas (3H)CGP-12177 only labelled the first ones. The addition of 10 microM serotonin (5HT) prevented ICYP binding to 5HT receptors and under these experimental conditions both ligands labelled a similar total number of beta-adrenoceptors in the different rat brain regions. ICYP displayed a higher affinity for cerebellar (mainly beta 2-subtype) than for cerebral cortex beta-adrenoceptors (mainly beta 1-subtype) suggesting a subtype selectivity. A multiple displacement binding approach using CGP-20712A, a beta 1-subtype ligand, as competitor revealed a 2.6 fold selectivity of ICYP for the beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype. On the other hand, (3H)CGP-12177 binds only to beta-adrenoceptors and is not subtype selective in the rat brain homogenate. Considering both its high specificity and its lack of subtype selectivity (3H)CGP-12177 seems to be a more suitable ligand than ICYP to non-selectively label beta-adrenoceptors in rat brain.",
