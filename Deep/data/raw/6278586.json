     "AB": "The high-affinity binding sites for mianserin and imipramine appear to be locate in different neurons of rat brain. Studies in which lesions were produced with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine and other studies in which the 5-hydroxytryptamine content was decreased with p-chlorophenylalanine indicate that some of the imipramine binding sites are on serotonin axon terminals and others are on nonserotonergic synapses. The sites that bind mianserin are on postsynaptic serotonin sites as well as on synapses of other neuronal systems.",
