     "AB": "Dopamine increases the incorporation of L-fucose and of D-mannose to a similar significant degree, whereas the incorporation of D-galactose as well as of N-acetyl-D-glucosamin into the total proteins of hippocampal slices was only slightly enhanced. The incorporation of N-acetyl-neuraminic acid was not influenced by dopamine. The results suggest that the effect of dopamine on glycoprotein formation seems mainly to depend on the kind of nucleotides necessary for activation of sugars and not on the sugar's final position in the glycan chain.",
