     "AB": "The locus coeruleus is one of the most thoroughly investigated mammalian brain areas. Its fibers innervate large parts of the neuraxis, in particular, areas involved in cognitive functions such as the cortex and the hippocampus. A role of locus coeruleus has been proposed in such processes as memory, the control of vigilance, blood pressure and others. Results obtained in this and other laboratories demonstrate that the firing rate of locus coeruleus neurons is affected by a great number of psychoactive agents such as antidepressants, minor tranquillizers, neuroleptics, psychostimulants and certain psychogeriatric drugs. We have attempted to correlate the data obtained on the cell bodies of locus coeruleus with studies reporting effects on terminal areas and thereby gain an overall view of the action of the above mentioned drugs on this cell system. The activity of noradrenergic neurons in locus coeruleus is thought to correlate with the level of cortical vigilance. Special emphasis is placed on the finding that a number of drugs which exert a positive effect on cognitive functions in man and animals increase the firing rate of the rat locus coeruleus neurons.",
