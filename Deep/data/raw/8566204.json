     "AB": "In view of numerous studies demonstrating that intracerebral implants of fetal neural tissue can promote functional recovery and structural repair in the damaged brain, the present study examined the potential use of neocortical transplantation in newborn rats that sustained hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Ischemic insult was induced in Long-Evans, black-hooded 1-week-old rats by unilateral common carotid artery occlusion followed by 2.5 h of hypoxia in 8% O2. One week later, animals received neocortical block transplants. At 2-6 weeks posttransplantation, animals were sacrificed and their brains examined histologically. Transplants survived in over 80% of the animals and the presence of acetylcholinesterase-positive fibers crossing the host-transplant interface provided evidence of transplant integration with the host brain. However, morphometric measurements revealed that the transplants were unable to reduce the hypoxia-ischemia-induced degeneration in the host hippocampus, caudate-putamen, or thalamus. Nonetheless the demonstrated survival of grafts in the neonatal hypoxia-ischemia model suggests a potential therapeutic effect.",
