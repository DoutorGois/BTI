     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To characterize the cerebral metabolic changes in dementia with Lewy bodies patients. METHODS: The metabolic ratios of NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr in bilateral hippocampus were determined by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 8 patients and 8 age-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Dementia with Lewy bodies patients showed significantly lower NAA/Cr ratios in bilateral hippocampus, while the Cho/Cr ratio did not differ from the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show relatively decrease of N-acetylaspartate in the hippocampus of patients with early or intermediate stage DLB. Hence, damage of neurons seems to be an early alteration in DLB.",
