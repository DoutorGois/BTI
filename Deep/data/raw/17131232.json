     "AB": "Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) is a key enzyme in cerebral phospholipid metabolism. Preliminary post-mortem studies have shown that PLA(2) activity is decreased in frontal and parietal areas of the AD brain, which is in accordance with recent (31)P-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy evidence of reduced phospholipid turnover in the pre-frontal cortex of moderately demented AD patients. Such abnormality may also be observed in peripheral cells, and reduced PLA(2) activity in platelet membranes of AD patients, and correlates with the severity of dementia. In rat hippocampal slices, PLA(2) has been implicated in mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. In adult rats, the stereotaxic injection of PLA(2) inhibitors in the CA1 area of hippocampus impaired, in a dose-dependent manner, the formation of short- and long-term memory. Additionally, such inhibition resulted in a reduction of the fluidity of hippocampal membranes. In primary cultures of cortical and hippocampal neurons, the inhibition of PLA(2) precluded neurite outgrowth, and the sustained inhibition of the enzyme in mature cultures lead to loss of viability. Taken together, these findings reinforce the involvement of PLA(2) enzymes in neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration processes, and further suggest that reduced PLA(2) activity, probably reducing membrane phospholipids breakdown, may contribute to the memory impairment in AD.",
