     "AB": "Concentrations of dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), noradrenaline (NA), free 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG), serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were determined in brain regions of 5-, 20-, and 32-month-old male Brown-Norway rats using high pressure liquid chromatography. In view of the activating effects of sex steroids on peptide and monoamine transmitter systems and the declining plasma testosterone levels with aging, the effects of testosterone supplementation on age-related changes in central monoamine metabolism were also studied. Age-related decreases in monoamine metabolism were observed in nigrostriatal, mesocortical and coeruleohippocampal systems. Marked reductions in DOPAC (35%) and HVA (50%) occurred in the ventral tegmental area between 20 and 32 months of age. 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels showed reductions and increases depending on the brain region. Testosterone administration resulted in elevations of HVA in the substantia nigra and MHPG in the locus coeruleus and hippocampus, which were most pronounced in young animals. It is concluded that there are marked differences in age-related changes between nigrostriatal, mesocortical and coeruleohippocampal systems and that testosterone exerts a stimulatory influence on some aspects of monoamine metabolism in young but not in aged animals.",
