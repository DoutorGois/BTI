     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The relationship between medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) and cognitive impairment in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) remains unclear. We examined this relationship using voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer disease (VSRAD) advance software, which allowed us to quantify the degree of MTA on images obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients diagnosed with DLB were recruited and scanned with a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner. All MRI data were analyzed using VSRAD advance. The target volume of interest (VOI) included the entire region of the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. The degree of MTA was obtained from the averaged positive z-score (Z score) on the target VOI, with higher scores indicating more severe MTA. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R), which strengthened the measures of memory and language more than MMSE, were used to assess the presence of cognitive impairment. RESULTS: A negative correlation was found between the Z score and MMSE total scores or the HDS-R total scores. A stepwise multiple regression analysis performed to adjust the covariate effects of sex, age, the onset age of the disease, duration of DLB, years of education, and donepezil treatment showed that the HDS-R total scores were independently associated with the Z score, whereas MMSE total scores were not. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MTA is related to cognitive impairment in patients with DLB, particularly the regions of orientation, immediate and delayed recall, and word fluency.",
