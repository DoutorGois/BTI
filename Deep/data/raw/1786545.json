We report here that synthetic beta-amyloid peptide shows both aggregation and neurotoxicity after a 2-4 day incubation period, but is neurite-promoting and not toxic in its initially solubilized state. SDS-PAGE characterization shows that newly solubilized beta-amyloid is predominantly monomeric whereas incubated peptide has several high molecular weight species.",
