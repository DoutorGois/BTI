     "AB": "10-20% of symptomatic epilepsies are post-traumatic. We examined effect of LPS preconditioning on epileptogenesis after controlled cortical impact (CCI). LPS (0.01, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) was injected i.p. to rats 5 days before induction of CCI to parieto-temporal cortex. Kindling started 24h after CCI by i.p. injection of 30 mg/kg of pentylenetetrazole every other day until manifestation of 3 consecutive generalized seizures. CCI injury accelerated the rate of kindled seizures acquisition. LPS (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) prevented the acceleration of kindling. LPS preconditioning significantly decreased IL-1beta and TNF-alpha over-expression and the number of damaged neurons in the hippocampus of traumatic rats.",
