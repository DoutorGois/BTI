     "AB": "The contributions of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors to posttetanic excitation of CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices were studied using extracellular and intracellular recording techniques. Synaptic responses were evoked on tetanic stimulation (100-200 Hz, 40-100 pulses) applied in stratum radiatum close (300-600 microm) to the recording site. Under control conditions, tetanic stimulation resulted in a triphasic depolarization/hyperpolarization/sustained depolarization sequence in area CA1 pyramidal cells. The late depolarization usually gave rise to a prolonged (< or = 3 s) spike firing. The late depolarization and the associated spike firing were blocked both specifically and completely (within a time window of 3-6 min starting from picrotoxin application) by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin (PiTX, 100 microM). Paradoxically, at this early stage of PiTX application, overall neuronal firing was attenuated to a higher degree than what was achieved by ionotropic glutamate antagonists. Complete block of ionotropic glutamate receptors by the antagonists D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentoate (AP5, 80 microM), 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX, 10 microM), and ketamine (50 microM) blocked the initial fast depolarization and suppressed the late one. Exposure to a permeable inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, ethoxyzolamide (EZA, 50 microM) inhibited the late, apparently GABA-mediated depolarization. It is concluded that GABA can provide the main posttetanic excitatory drive in the adult hippocampus. The present results suggest that intense activation of GABAergic interneurons may accentuate the excitation of principal neurons and, hence, play an important facilitatory role in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and epileptogenesis.",
