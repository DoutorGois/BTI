     "AB": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is expressed in most organs and its expression is reported to be increased in activated microglia in the brain. [(11)C]PK11195 has been widely used for the in vivo imaging of PBRs, but its signal in the brain was not high enough for stable quantitative analysis. We synthesized a novel positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, [(11)C]DAA1106, for PBR and investigated its in vivo properties in rat and monkey brain. High uptake of [(11)C]DAA1106 was observed in the olfactory bulb and choroid plexus area, followed by the pons/medulla and cerebellum by in vivo autoradiography of rat brain, correlating with the binding in vitro. [(11)C]DAA1106 binding was increased in the dorsal hippocampus with neural destruction, suggesting glial reaction. [(11)C]DAA1106 binding was both inhibited and displaced by 1.0 mg/kg of DAA1106 and 5 mg/kg of PK11195 by 80% and 70%, respectively. Specific binding was estimated as 80% of total binding. [(11)C]DAA1106 binding was four times higher compared to the binding of [(11)C]PK11195 in the monkey occipital cortex. These results indicated that [(11)C]DAA1106 might be a good ligand for in vivo imaging of PBR.",
