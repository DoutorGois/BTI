     "AB": "Taber et al. (1977) introduced new model of epilepsy to obtain experimental status epilepticus in mice, through a modification of the kindling method (Goddard et al. 1969). The aim of this paper is to report the effect of Taber's modification on a new animal specie (rats). Bipolar, twisted steel electrodes were stereotaxically implanted into the CA1-CA3 regions of the dorsal hippocampus. After one week the animals received 2 h stimulation sessions, one stimulus per minute, during which a sustained electrographical and behavioral seizures were induced. Different patterns of electrographical discharges as well as tonic-clonic convulsions were observed. The animals which were submitted to 3 stimulating sessions respectively 7, 14 and 21 days after surgery showed an increase in the epileptic activity. This has been interpreted as a plastic neural modification of the hippocampus similar to that observed during learning and memory consolidation. In comparison to other inducing kindling methods this one permits a more rapid elicitation of the phenomenon. For this reason this method will provide a good epilepsy model for the study of anticonvulsant drugs and basic mechanisms involved in the epileptic activity.",
