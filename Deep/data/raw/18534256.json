     "AB": "The olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) rat is an extensively investigated animal model of depression. In the present study the effects of olfactory bulbectomy in drug-naive adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-240 g) on global (gCGU) and regional cerebral glucose (rCGU) utilization was evaluated. Two weeks following surgery, the autoradiographic measurement of CGU using [14C]-2-deoxyglucose was employed. The levels of CGU in the OBX and sham-operated rats were compared in 40 brain regions. Statistical methods indicate significantly lower levels of global (overall) CGU in the OBX group than in the sham group. Discriminant analysis was done on the z-scores to remove animal to animal variability. The following thirteen regions were identified by the stepwise discriminant analysis of the z-scores as significantly contributing to the differences between the sham and OBX: amygdala, cingulate cortex, caudate putamen at the level of globus pallidus, caudate putamen-lateral part, dorsal subiculum, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, median raphe, somatosensory cortex, substantia nigra, ventral hippocampus, ventral tegmental area and the ventral thalamus. The pattern of changes in the rCGU following OBX does not completely correlate with the pattern of connectivity of the olfactory bulbs, however, many regions with direct connection to the olfactory bulbs (e.g., amygdala, hypothalamus, ventral hippocampus, and ventral tegmental area) were found to be important for differentiation. No left to right asymmetries in the rCGU were found. The data suggest that there are very important regional differences in glucose utilization between the OBX and sham operated rats, which points to the need to study antidepressants in an animal model of depression rather than in normal animals.",
