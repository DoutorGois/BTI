     "AB": "Considerable evidence has been accumulated to suggests that blocking the inflammatory reaction promotes neuroprotection and shows therapeutic potential for clinical treatment of ischemic brain injury. Consequently, anti-inflammatory therapies are being explored for prevention and treatment of these diseases. Induction of brain tolerance against ischemia by pretreatment with resveratrol has been found to influence expression of different molecules. It remains unclear, however, whether and how resveratrol preconditioning changes expression of inflammatory mediators after subsequent global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Therefore, we investigated the effect of resveratrol pretreatment on NF-kappaB inflammatory cascade, COX-2, iNOS and JNK levels in experimental I/R. Adult male rats were subjected to 10 min of four-vessel occlusion and sacrificed at selected post-ischemic time points. Resveratrol (30 mg/kg) pretreatment was injected intraperitoneally 7 days prior to I/R induction. We found that resveratrol treatment before insult remarkably reduced astroglial and microglial activation at 7 days after I/R. It greatly attenuated I/R-induced NF-kappaB and JNK activation with decreased COX-2 and iNOS production. In conclusion, the neuroprotection of resveratrol preconditioning may be due in part to the suppression of the inflammatory response via regulation of NF-kappaB, COX-2 and iNOS induced by I/R. JNK was also suggested to play a protective role through in neuroprotection of resveratrol, which may also be contributing to reduction in neuroinflammation. The study adds to a growing literature that resveratrol can have important anti-inflammatory actions in the brain.",
