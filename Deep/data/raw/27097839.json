     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Default mode network (DMN) has been reported to be susceptible to APOE epsilon 4 genotype. However, the APOE epsilon 4-related brain changes in young carriers are different from the ones in elderly carriers. The current study aimed to evaluate the cortical morphometry of DMN subregions in cognitively normal elderly with APOE epsilon 4. METHOD: 11 cognitively normal senior APOE epsilon 4 carriers and 27 matched healthy controls (HC) participated the neuropsychological tests, genotyping, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was used to assess the global volumetric changes. Surface-based morphometry (SBM) analysis was performed to measure regional gray matter volume (GMV) and gray matter thickness (GMT). RESULTS: Advancing age was associated with decreased GMV of DMN subregions. Compared to HC, APOE epsilon 4 carriers presented cortical atrophy in right cingulate gyrus (R_CG) (GMV: APOE carriers: 8475.23 +/- 1940.73 mm3, HC: 9727.34 +/- 1311.57 mm3, t = 2.314, p = 0.026, corrected) and left insular (GMT: APOE epsilon 4 carriers: 3.83 +/- 0.37 mm, HC: 4.05 +/- 0.25 mm, t = 2.197, p = 0.033, corrected). CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the difference between different cortical measures and suggest that the cortical reduction of CG and insular maybe a potential neuroimaging marker for APOE 4 epsilon senior carriers, even in the context of relatively intact cognition.",
