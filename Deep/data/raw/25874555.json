     "AB": "The hippocampal output structure, the subiculum, expresses two major memory relevant network rhythms, sharp wave ripple and gamma frequency oscillations. To this date, it remains unclear how the two distinct types of subicular principal cells, intrinsically bursting and regular spiking neurons, participate in these two network rhythms. Using concomitant local field potential and intracellular recordings in an in vitro mouse model that allows the investigation of both network rhythms, we found a cell type-specific segregation of principal neurons into participating intrinsically bursting and non-participating regular spiking cells. However, if regular spiking cells were kept at a more depolarized level, they did participate in a specific manner, suggesting a potential bimodal working model dependent on the level of excitation. Furthermore, intrinsically bursting and regular spiking cells exhibited divergent intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties in the active network. Thus, our results suggest a cell-type-specific segregation of principal cells into two separate groups during network activities, supporting the idea of two parallel streams of information processing within the subiculum.",
