     "AB": "Immunohistochemistry for haptoglobin (Hp) in the postischemic hippocampus demonstrated an immunoreactivity visible one day after reperfusion and continuing to increase until 14 days after ischemia. The immunoreactivity was most prominent in CA1 and the dentate hilar region, especially in cells with astroglial morphology. Double immunofluorescence histochemistry confirmed colocalization of the Hp and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Furthermore, a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction study confirmed an elevated Hp mRNA level in the postischemic hippocampus. The Hp gene expression was also upregulated in C6 and A-172 glioblastoma cell lines after H O treatment. These findings suggest that Hp is synthesized in reactive astrocytes in response to ischemia-reperfusion injury.",
