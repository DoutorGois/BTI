     "PG": "294-303",
     "AB": "Even though there is no direct evidence to prove the cellular and molecular changes induced by radiofrequency (RF) radiation itself, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of any biological effect of mobile phone frequency radiation. We established a carousel-type exposure chamber for 849 MHz or 1763 MHz of mobile phone RF radiation to expose RF to the heads of C57BL mice. In this chamber, animals were irradiated intermittently at 7.8 W/kg for a maximum of 12 months. During this period, the body weights of 3 groups-sham, 849 MHz RF, and 1763 MHz RF-did not show any differences between groups. The brain tissues were obtained from 3 groups at 6 months and 12 months to examine the differences in histology and cell proliferation between control and RF exposure groups, but we could not find any change upon RF radiation. Likewise, we could not find changes in the expression and distribution of NeuN and GFAP in hippocampus and cerebellum, or in cell death by TUNEL assay in RF exposure groups. From these data, we conclude that the chronic exposure to 849 MHz and 1763 MHz RF radiation at a 7.8 W/kg specific absorption rate (SAR) could not induce cellular alterations such as proliferation, death, and reactive gliosis.",
