     "AB": "The regional brain and spinal cord concentrations of cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8) were measured in age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. The relative order of distribution of CCK-8 in the WKY strain was hippocampus (20.5 +/- 1.3 pmol/g) greater than cortex greater than striatum = hypothalamus greater than midbrain = thalamus greater than spinal cord greater than medulla oblongata/pons (MO/P, 1.6 +/- 0.2 pmol/g) whereas in the SH strain this order was hippocampus (12.9 +/- 0.8 pmol/g) greater than cortex = striatum greater than hypothalamus greater than midbrain greater than thalamus = spinal cord greater than MO/P (1.4 +/- 0.2 pmol/g). The concentrations of CCK-8 in the cerebellum were at the level of assay sensitivity (0.5 pmol/g in both strains). In comparison to the WKY rats, the SH strain had significantly lower levels of CCK-8 in the hippocampus (-37%), cortex (-28%), spinal cord (-23%) and pituitary (-57%). The lowered levels of CCK-8 in the brain of the SH rat may be causally related to, or result from, the cardiovascular, behavioural or morphological abnormalities of this strain.",
