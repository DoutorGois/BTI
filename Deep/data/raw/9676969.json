     "AB": "Rats with bilateral electrolytic or ibotenic acid lesions that were centred in perirhinal cortex displayed a significant delay-dependent deficit on a delayed nonmatch to position task in the T maze. Although the removal of prominent extramaze visual cues did not affect the performance of these rats, rotating the maze between the sample and test phases did, indicating that rats were using a spatial strategy. Interestingly, a further group of rats with hippocampal and perirhinal damage displayed deficits that may reflect a dysfunction in the use of inertial cues. These results suggest that both electrolytic and excitotoxic lesions of perirhinal cortex produce spatial memory impairments but that these impairments are qualitatively different than those exhibited following hippocampal damage.",
