     "AB": "We investigated the changes in water diffusion in the hippocampus and the temporal white matter (the temporal stem) in eight patients with possible Alzheimer's disease (AD), 10 patients with probable AD, and 10 age-matched controls, using coronal diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were derived for the three orthogonal axes and an index of diffusion anisotropy (IDA = ADC(max-min)/ADC(mean)) was then calculated. Although no significant differences were found in ADC and IDA values in the hippocampal body between controls and patients, vertical (superior-inferior) ADC values and ADC(mean) values in the temporal stem of patients with AD were significantly higher than those in controls, and IDA values were therefore significantly lower in patients with possible or probable AD than those in controls. Moreover, IDA values in the temporal stem were significantly correlated with the clinical severity. These results suggest that decreased fiber density, such as the disruption and loss of axonal membranes or myelin, occur early in the temporal stem, probably due to secondary degeneration related to grey matter pathology including the medial temporal lobe.",
