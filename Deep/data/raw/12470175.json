     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The nature of functional metabolic disturbances in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To compare in vivo measures of hippocampal metabolic abnormalities in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, as acquired with fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, and to determine the relationship between N-acetylaspartate (NAA) disturbances and well-established derangements of glucose metabolism. DESIGN: Measures of hippocampal glucose metabolism from fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography were normalized to whole brain counts to provide a glucose uptake metabolic index. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging was performed at 4.1 T, and measures of creatinine/NAA ratio were made from mostly hippocampal-only voxels. Direct comparisons and correlation analysis of measures were performed. SETTING: Presurgical evaluations for treatment of intractable epilepsy. PATIENTS: Twenty-nine patients between July 1994 and June 1996 who were candidates for anterior-medial temporal lobectomy at the epilepsy centers of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Vanderbilt University schools of medicine were studied. RESULTS: The mean ipsilateral hippocampal glucose metabolic index (0.85) was normal, while the contralateral metabolic index (0.95) was nearly significant for an abnormally elevated measure. The mean ipsilateral hippocampal creatinine/NAA (1.26) was abnormally elevated; the mean contralateral creatinine/NAA (0.88) was normal. Hippocampal glucose and creatinine/NAA measures did not correlate; asymmetry measures also did not correlate. CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal metabolic disturbances in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy as measured by fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography vs proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging reflect different mechanisms of biochemical dysfunction. This lack of correlation is hypothesized to reflect a differential effect of varying degrees of disturbed cellular energy metabolism on mechanisms of glucose use and biosynthesis of NAA.",
