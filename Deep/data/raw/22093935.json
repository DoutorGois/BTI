     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of lesions in the limbic system related structures in general paresis of insane (GPI) patients so as to explore its pathogenesis and provide a new MRI diagnostic method. METHODS: The clinical data and MRI findings of lesions in the limbic system related structures were retrospectively analyzed for a total of 31 GPI patients. The parameters were volume and signal abnormality. RESULTS: On MRI, structural abnormalities were found in amygdaloid body (n = 29), hippocampus (n = 28), insular lobe (n = 24), parahippocampal gyrus (n = 23), lenticular nucleus (n = 23), corpus callosum (n = 20), caudate nucleus (n = 11), hypothalamus (n = 10), anterior nucleus of thalamus (n = 10), cingulate gyrus (n = 8) and thalamus (n = 2). The frequent manifestations were atrophy, swelling, T2 hyperintensity in various structures and T2 hypointensity in lenticular nucleus. CONCLUSION: A frequent involvement of limbic system structures in GPI patients may be related with dementia and other psychiatric symptoms. Swelling and T2 hyperintensity of involved structures may be the characteristic MRI manifestations of GPI.",
