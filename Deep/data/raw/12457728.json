     "AB": "Having demonstrated a transcranial gradient of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in patients with either traumatic brain injury or spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage we have employed in situ hybridisation for IL-6 messenger RNA (mRNA) to determine the site of this IL-6 production within the central nervous system (CNS). A rodent weight drop model of traumatic brain injury was used. IL-6 mRNA levels in brains were determined 6 h after injury. Sham animals had normal constitutive expression for IL6 mRNA. In traumatised animals an intense area of IL-6 mRNA labelling was found below the hippocampus. Cells strongly expressing IL-6 mRNA were also seen in the dentate gyrus. This inflammatory cytokine is clearly implicated in the response to CNS injury, but whether this response is neuroprotective or pathological is uncertain.",
