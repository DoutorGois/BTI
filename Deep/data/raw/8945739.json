This study examined the effect of environmental complexity on the levels of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) mRNA in the rat visual cortex and hippocampus, studied by in situ hybridization. Rats housed in groups in a complex, stimulating environment had significantly higher levels of NT-3 mRNA in the visual cortex and the hippocampus than rats housed in individual cages without stimulating objects. These results indicate a possible role for NT-3 in synaptic plasticity.",
