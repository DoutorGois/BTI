     "AB": "Two non-protein amino acids of Lathyrus sativus, beta-(isoxazoline-5-on-2-yl)-alanine (BIA) and its higher homologue alpha-amino-gamma-(isoxazoline-5-on-2-yl)-alanine (ACI) were tested for excitotoxic potential. BIA (0.5-2.0 mM) but not ACI (2.0 mM) produced a concentration-dependent neurodegeneration in mouse cortical explants. The neuronal damage was prevented by the prior and simultaneous application of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), indicating that it was mediated by non-N-methyl-D-aspartate type receptors. BIA (0.5-2.0 mM) activated CNQX-sensitive currents which were significantly smaller than those activated by 3-N-oxalyl-L-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid (beta-ODAP) or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) in the majority of neurons. In a small number of cells, BIA (2 mM) produced currents which were similar in amplitude to those activated by beta-ODAP (50 microM). These results suggest that Lathyrus sativus plants engineered to block the synthesis of beta-ODAP may accumulate a neurotoxic precursor and therefore must be tested for the presence of both BIA and beta-ODAP.",
