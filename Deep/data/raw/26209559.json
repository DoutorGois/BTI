     "AB": "Although the health effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) pollution in the atmospheric environment are not new, epidemiological studies and parallel experimental investigations indicate that acute SO2 exposure causes glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity and even contributes to the outcome of cerebral ischemia. Additionally, the free radical-related inflammatory responses are responsible for neuronal insults and consequent brain disorders. However, few medications are available for preventing the inflammatory responses and relieving the subsequent harmful insults from SO2 inhalation. Here, we show that endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) prevents neurotoxicity from SO2 inhalation by suppressing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) overexpression, and this action appears to be mediated via cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1)-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways. Furthermore, CB1-dependent peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) expression was an important modulator of the 2-AG-mediated resolution on NF-kappaB-coupled COX-2 elevation in response to SO2 neuroinflammation. This finding provides evidence of a possible therapeutic effect of endogenous 2-AG regulation for protecting against neurological dysfunction from SO2 inhalation in polluted areas.",
