     "AB": "Ginseng saponins are known to have various pharmacological actions on the central nervous system. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1) and malonylginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1-m) on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus using anesthetized rats. Injection (i.c.v.) of GRb1 did not affect the basal synaptic responses evoked by low-frequency test stimulation, but significantly attenuated the magnitude of LTP induced by strong tetanus (100 pulses at 100 Hz). The inhibitory effect of GRb1 depended on its doses (0.5-50 nmol, i.c.v.). On the other hand, GRb1-m did not affect the LTP induced by the strong tetanus, but facilitated the generation of LTP by the weak tetanus (20 pulses at 60 Hz) that produced only short-lasting potentiation in normal condition. The LTP-facilitating effect of GRb1-m was seen maximally at a dose of 5 nmol (i.c.v.) and diminished at a higher dose (50 nmol, i.c.v.). Since another ginseng saponin ginsenoside Rg1 did not affect the induction of LTP at all, the inhibition and facilitation of LTP induction are probably specific actions of GRb1 and GRb1-m, respectively. This is the first report providing direct evidence that ginseng saponins affect the activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the brain.",
