     "AB": "A method is described which allows intracranial injection of drug solutions through glass micropipettes (tip diameter 15 micron) in the freely moving rat by use of air pressure. Compared with conventional injection methods through steel cannulae this method has the advantages of (1) minimal destruction of brain tissue, (2) precise injection of small volumes of solutions (1 nl to several microliters), (3) simultaneous recording of local EEG activity, and (4) usage of multipipette assemblies.",
