     "AB": "Transforming growth factor-beta mRNA was detected with a rat TGF-beta 1 coding sequence probe as a 2.5 kb band by RNA blot hybridization of total RNA from the adult male rat hippocampus. Following electrolytic lesions of the entorhinal cortex that cause hippocampal deafferentation and synaptic remodeling, TGF-beta mRNA increases 5-fold in ipsilateral hippocampus when compared with intact controls. This increase was independent of prior adrenalectomy or corticosterone-replacement. These data demonstrate that TGF-beta gene expression increases in response to hippocampal deafferentation.",
