     "AB": "Preadaptation of cultured HT22 mouse hippocampal neurons to oxidative stress prevented cell damage induced by severe oxidative stress. This protection manifested in a decrease in metabolic disturbances in neurons. Adaptation of neurons to oxidative stress was accompanied by accumulation of HSP32 and HSP70. HSP synthesis inhibitor quercetin abolished the protective effect of adaptation under conditions of oxidative stress. Activation of HSP70 synthesis in neurons is an important mechanism for adaptive protection of cells.",
