     "AB": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key player in learning and memory processes. However, little is known about brain area-specific functions of this neurotrophin. Here we investigated whether BDNF could differently affect motor neocortical and hippocampal-related cognitive and plastic morphologic changes in young (12-week-old) and middle-aged (30-week-old) BDNF heterozygous (BDNF(+)/(-)) and wild type (wt) mice. We found that at 30 weeks of age, BDNF(+)/(-) mice showed impaired performance in accelerating rotarod and grasping tests while preserved spatial learning in a T-maze and recognition memory in an object recognition task compared with wt mice suggesting a specific neocortical dysfunction. Accordingly, a significant reduction of synaptic markers (PSD-95 and GluR1) and corresponding puncta was observed in motor neocortex but not in hippocampus of BDNF(+)/(-) mice. Interestingly, 30-week-old BDNF(+)/(-) mice displayed increased TrkB levels in the hippocampus but not in the motor neocortex, which suggests specific hippocampal compensatory mechanisms as a consequence of BDNF decrease. In conclusion, our data indicates that BDNF could differentially regulate the neuronal micro-structures and cognition in a region-specific and in an age-dependent manner.",
