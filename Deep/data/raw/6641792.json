     "AB": "Intra-amygdaloid injections of folic acid (FA) in rats induce behavioural, metabolic (assessed using the 2-deoxyglucose method) and neuropathological changes which, however, differ considerably from those produced by kainic acid (KA). Thus FA, in contrast to KA, does not readily induce limbic motor seizures, fails to activate the entire limbic system and does not readily reproduce the local and distant damage induced by KA, notably in the Ammon's horn of the hippocampus. The results argue against the hypothesis that KA acts at folate receptors to induce its limbic epileptic/brain damage syndrome.",
