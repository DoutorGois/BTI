     "AB": "We report two new types of potassium channels in cultured hippocampal neurons of rat. Both channels occurred in the soma membrane of these cells at very low density. They were active in steady-state conditions, within a wide voltage range that included the resting membrane potential. Their open probability was enhanced by membrane depolarization, but not influenced by Ca ions. In symmetrical 150 mM KCl the channels showed a slope conductance of ca. 40 and 80 pS, respectively. Current-voltage relations of both K channels show a negative slope at high positive voltages.",
