     "AB": "Cerebral ischemic damage in gerbils was assessed by locomotor activity studies and histopathological examination of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Pretreatment with AICAr (50 and 500 mg/kg) 30 min prior to a 5-min ischemic episode in unanesthetized gerbils, significantly attenuated the degree of ischemic neuronal damage as measured by either technique with the 500 mg/kg dose; the 50 mg/kg dose, although showing a trend, was not significant. A potential mechanism for AICAr-induced cerebroprotection may be that it is metabolized to uric acid, a free radical scavenger.",
