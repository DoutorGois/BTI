     "AB": "Accepted taxonomies of memory typically distinguish among different kinds of remembering depending upon the information that must be remembered. A basic dichotomy distinguishes between the retention of factual or experiential information on the one hand, and the retention of habits and motor skills on the other. Factual memory can be further differentiated into working and reference memory. As first described by Werner Honig's group [1], working memory is required when \"different stimuli govern the criterion response on different trials, so that the cue that the animal must remember varies from trial to trial.\" Thus, working memory is required for remembering information that varies unpredictably in time and/or in content: it is this type of memory that is decimated in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias [2]. In contrast, reference memory is used to retain information that remains constant over time (e.g., removing the cup from a baited well provides access to food). The study of working memory processes is generally accomplished using delayed response (DR) tasks and, within the confines of even relatively short test sessions, one can readily assess processes associated with short-term memory using these procedures. In such tasks, one presents a bit of information (a sample) to a subject, withdraws that information, waits for a period of time (recall delay), then presents that same bit of information along with a comparison bit and asks the subject to identify (choose) which bit of information was presented previously. This process is then repeated across a number of trials. DR tasks using nonhuman primates as surrogates are used primarily to determine the biological underpinnings of human learning and memory processes and their associated mechanisms. The complex brain functions associated with the performance of these tasks can be assessed using a variety of approaches, and the careful monitoring of behavioral outputs provides important experimental advantages. Many of the different types of assessments of memory processes have evolved from studies ranging from those employing neuroanatomical lesions to electrophysiological recordings and, more recently, neuroimaging techniques. Goldman-Rakic et al. have shown the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the performance of DR tasks in nonhuman primates by employing lesions and electrophysiological and neuroimaging techniques [3-6]. Brain lesion experiments in monkeys have also demonstrated the importance of the hippocampus and its relevance to performance in DR tasks [7]. Through the use of lesions, Zola et al. (2000) and Squire (2004) have also demonstrated the importance of the medial temporal lobe in performance of these types of tasks in monkeys [8,9]. Taken together these and other studies have elucidated the importance of the prefrontal cortex in visual-spatial functions, inhibition of behavior (temporal mechanisms), decision making, working memory, problem solving, planning, and organizing. Likewise, the findings that the hippocampal formation (medial temporal lobe) is important in memory consolidation, associative memory formation, declarative memory, and recognition memory stem from these and similar studies. The prefrontal cortex and the hippocampal formation are two brain areas intricately involved in the performance of DR tasks. The understanding of short-term memory and, more specifically, working memory has benefited greatly from this work.",
