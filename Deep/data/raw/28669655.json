     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: IMM-H004 (7-hydroxy-5-methoxy-4-methyl-3-[4-methylpiperazin-1-yl]-2H-chromen-2-one) is a novel coumarin derivative that showed better effect in improving global cerebral ischemia in rats. However, the effects and mechanisms in focal cerebral ischemia were not clear. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) protection is a vital strategy for the treatment of cerebral ischemia. This study is to investigate whether IMM-H004 improves brain ischemia injury via BBB protection. METHODS: Focal brain ischemia model was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 hour and reperfusion (MCAO/R) for 24 hours in rats. IMM-H004 (1.5, 3, 6 mg/kg) and edaravone (positive drug, 6 mg/kg) were administered after 5 minutes of occlusion. Neurological score and TTC staining were used to evaluate the effect of IMM-H004. Evans Blue (EB) staining and electron microscopy were used to assess BBB permeability. Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of BBB structure-related proteins. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, IMM-H004 in the focal brain ischemia model improved neurological function and reduced cerebral infarction size and edema content. IMM-H004 sharply reduced the EB content and alleviated BBB structure. In addition, IMM-H004 increased the level of zonula occludens (ZO-1) and occluding, decreased the level of aquaporin 4 and matrix metalloproteinase 9, either in cortex or in hippocampus. And all of these changed were related to BBB protection. CONCLUSION: IMM-H004 improved cerebral ischemia injury via BBB protection. For a potential therapy drug of cerebral ischemia, IMM-H004 merits further study.",
