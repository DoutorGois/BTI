     "AB": "Morphological changes in the neurons of the gerbil hippocampus following 5 min of forebrain ischemia were examined using light and electron microscopy. Although non-pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus survived through the full length of the observation period, up to six weeks after ischemia, they consistently demonstrated degenerative changes distinct from those of the well-known \"delayed neuronal death\" of CA1 pyramidal cells. When examined with the light microscope, CA1 non-pyramidal neurons were found to be shrunken and their nuclei and cytoplasm were hyperchromatic between seven days and six weeks after ischemia. When examined with the electron microscope, postischemic non-pyramidal neurons were found to have markedly electron-dense profiles; their cytoplasm contained numerous free ribosomes and heterogeneous smaller granular substances, the latter also filling the nuclei. However, there was no loss of ribosomes from the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondrial cristae were preserved, suggesting that these neurons were viable. CA1 non-pyramidal neurons were studied immunohistochemically using three types of monoclonal antibodies, one each against parvalbumin, a nonphosphorylated epitope on the 168,000 mol. wt and 200,000 mol. wt subunits of neurofilament proteins, and microtubule-associated protein 2. CA1 non-pyramidal neurons lost immunoreactivity to these neuron-specific substances six weeks after ischemia, suggesting that these degenerating cells lacked certain types of normal neuronal activity. We conclude that non-pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region survive transient ischemia but undergo degenerative changes following complete loss of CA1 pyramidal cells. These changes may be due to depletion of presumptive target-derived trophic factors within the non-pyramidal neurons.",
