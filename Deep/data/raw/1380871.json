     "AB": "Identification of a src-related tyrosine kinase and its regional and cellular distributions were studied in rat brain. The study was performed using a specific antibody raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the conserved autophosphorylation site of src-family tyrosine kinases. The antibody (alpha-src antibody) recognized a 43 kDa polypeptide in plasma membrane enriched fraction. The immunohistochemical data revealed that the polypeptide is localized in astrocytes of corpus callosum and fimbria hippocampus. The presence of this src-related protein in astrocytes suggests that it may have some control in their proliferation and differentiation.",
