     "AB": "The activity of glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.41.1.3) is studied in homogenates and subcellular fractions of five limbic structures: regio superior, regio inferior of hippocampus, fascia dentata, septum and corpora mamillaria. The lowest activity of the enzyme is found in regio superior of hippocampus. 80% of the total enzyme activity of primary fractions is found in \"crude\" mitochondria. After centrifugation of the latter within the linear sucrose density gradient the distribution of the enzume activity is similar for different structures and the highest activity is found in the region of sucrose molarity from 1.44 up to 1.50 M which corresponds to the mitochondria distribution region. 50% of the total found activity is in the fraction enriched by mitochondria, 30% is in the fraction enriched by nerve endings with the high activity of glutamate decarboxylase. It was found for different fractions that 1 mM of ADF with 0.2 mM NAD-H+ produces about 10-fold increase in the enzyme activity. Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate inhibits the enzyme from inactivation. The results are discussed in connection with the possible role of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate in regulation of the glutamate dehydrogenase activity in vivo.",
