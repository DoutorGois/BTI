     "AB": "AIMS: In the preliminary study, kimchi, a traditional food fermented with Chinese cabbage, protected scopolamine-induced mouse memory deficit in passive avoidance test. Therefore, we screened protective ingredients, particularly lactic acid bacteria, from Chinese cabbage kimchi against scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactic acid bacteria, isolated from Chinese cabbage kimchi, were identified by 16S rDNA sequence analysis, G+C content and cellular fatty acid composition and sugar fermentation test. Memory deficit was induced in mice by intraperitoneally injecting with scopolamine. Kimchi, particularly its supernatant, protected scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice in passive avoidance test. Of kimchi ingredients, a lactic acid bacterium, strain C29, potently protected scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. C29 was a gram-positive, catalase-negative, anaerobic and non-motile rod. Its pylogenetic property was near to Lactobacillus pentosus (99%) and Lact. plantarum (99%). However, C29 fermented inulin and L-rhamnose and grew in pH 3 and at 45 degrees C in contrast with Lact. pentosus and Lact. plantarum. Therefore, it named to be Lact pentosus var. plantarum C29. The strain C29 protected scopolamine-induced memory deficit in Y-maze and Morris water maze tests. Furthermore, C29 increased hippocampal BDNF and p-CREB expressions, which were reduced by scopolamine. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus pentosus var. plantarum C29 may protect memory deficit by inducing BDNF and p-CREB expressions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Lactic acid bacteria, such as Lact pentosus var. plantarum C29, may prevent memory deficit and its contained fermented foods may be beneficial for dementia.",
