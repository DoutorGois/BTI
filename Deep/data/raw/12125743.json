     "AB": "Protein deposition is a common event in age-related neurological diseases that are characterized by neuronal dysfunction and eventual cell death. Here, cultured hippocampal slices were infused with the lysosomal disrupter chloroquine to examine the link between abnormal protein processing/deposition and early synaptopathogenesis. Tau species of 55 to 69 kDa increased over several days of treatment with chloroquine, while the protein and message levels of synaptic markers were selectively reduced. Neurons of subfields CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus accumulated protein deposits recognized by antibodies against paired helical filaments and ubiquitin, and this was accompanied by tubulin fragmentation and deacetylation. The deposition filled the basal pole of pyramidal neurons, encompassing the area of the axon hillock and initial dendritic branching but without causing overt neuronal atrophy. Neurons containing the polar aggregates exhibited severely impaired transport along basal dendrites. Transport capability was also lost along apical dendrites, the opposite direction of deposited material in the basal pole; thus, perpetuating the problem beyond physical blockage must be the associated loss of microtubule integrity. These data indicate that transport failure forms a link between tau deposition and synaptic decline, thus shedding light on how protein aggregation events disrupt synaptic and cognitive functions before the ensuing cellular destruction.",
