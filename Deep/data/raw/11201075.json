     "AB": "A transcriptional regulation of bFGF expression via both gluco- and mineralocorticoid receptors is known to exist. In the present study the glial nuclear fraction of bFGF transcripts was studied in sham-operated (SHAM), adrenalectomized (ADX), and corticosterone-treated ADX rats in subregions of the dorsal hippocampal formation. A substantial increase was observed in the population of bFGF RNA-expressing glial cells after acute corticosterone treatment (10 mg/kg, s.c.) in subregions of the CA1 area and the dentate gyrus but no changes were observed after adrenalectomy. The levels of glial nuclear bFGF transcripts were similar in all the experimental groups. These data suggest that in a subpopulation of hippocampal glial cells corticosterone regulates bFGF gene expression transcriptionally in an on/off manner.",
