     "AB": "In this work, we investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO) in neurotoxicity triggered by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor activation in cultured hippocampal neurons. In the presence of cyclothiazide (CTZ), short-term exposures to kainate (KA; 5 and 15 min, followed by 24-h recovery) decreased cell viability. Both NBQX and d-AP-5 decreased the neurotoxicity caused by KA plus CTZ. Long-term exposures to KA plus CTZ (24 h) resulted in increased toxicity. In short-, but not in long-term exposures, the presence of NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors (l-NAME and 7-NI) decreased the toxicity induced by KA plus CTZ. We also found that KA plus CTZ (15-min exposure) significantly increased cGMP levels. Furthermore, short-term exposures lead to decreased intracellular ATP levels, which was prevented by NBQX, d-AP-5 and NOS inhibitors. Immunoblot analysis revealed that KA induced neuronal NOS (nNOS) proteolysis, gradually lowering the levels of nNOS according to the time of exposure. Calpain, but not caspase-3 inhibitors, prevented this effect. Overall, these results show that NO is involved in the neurotoxicity caused by activation of non-desensitizing AMPA receptors, although to a limited extent, since AMPA receptor activation triggers mechanisms that lead to nNOS proteolysis by calpains, preventing a further contribution of NO to the neurotoxic process.",
