     "AB": "Recent studies indicate that there may be multiple subtypes of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine ([3H]5-HT) binding sites. Mianserin and spiperone inhibited the specific binding of [3H]5-HT (2-3 nM) to rat brain cortical membranes with shallow displacement curves. The displacement data for spiperone were best described by the presence of three independent binding sites, for which spiperone had high, medium, and low affinities. The displacement data for mianserin were best fitted by two independent, high- and low-affinity sites. The inclusion of mianserin (250 nM) to inhibit [3H]5-HT binding to the mianserin-sensitive site selectively blocked one of the sites discriminated by spiperone. These results suggest the presence of three binding sites for [3H]5-HT, one blocked by low concentrations of spiperone (5-HT1A), one blocked by low concentrations of mianserin (5-HT1C), and one blocked only by high concentrations of both mianserin and spiperone (5-HT1B). Regional differences in the relative densities of the three sites were observed. The hippocampus was rich in 5-HT1A sites, whereas the striatum contained mainly 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C sites. Selective degeneration of 5-HT-containing nerve terminals induced by the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine increased binding to all three sites in the cerebral cortex. Binding of [3H]5-HT to the three sites was differentially modulated by CaCl2 and guanylimidodiphosphate. The present data suggest the presence of three independent 5-HT1 binding sites having different affinities for mianserin and spiperone and having different regional distributions.",
