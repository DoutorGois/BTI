     "AB": "Neurons and fibers from human autopsy material were labeled by application of Lucifer Yellow or diI. Dye-filled neurons and fibers were immersed in a diaminobenzidine and potassium cyanide solutions and irradiated with epifluorescent illumination until all visible fluorescence had faded. This simple photo-oxidation procedure resulted in the autopsy human tissue of a stable, nonfading, brown reaction product, visible with the light microscope providing a Golgi-like image, and EM level. This methodological procedure was successfully used for revealing detailed morphology of neurons with dendritic spines, axons with collaterals and varicosities in the human cortical areas and hippocampus.",
