     "AB": "The developmental processes of maturation in the CNS are the result of specific events including mitogenesis, differentiation, and cell death which occur in a precise spatial and temporal manner. It has been reported that many transcription factors, including forkhead transcription factors, play a key role in these processes. First, we examined the expression pattern of the forkhead transcription factor Foxp1 in the adult CNS. Foxp1 was highly expressed in the striatum and moderately in the cerebral cortex, CA1/2 subfields of the hippocampus, and several thalamic nuclei. In situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry in the striatum of adult mice revealed that Foxp1 mRNA was detected in a subset of projection neurons, not in interneurons. In addition, the expression of Foxp1 mRNA was observed in the developing basal ganglia with the exception of the globus pallidus. Thus, Foxp1 mRNA was expressed in a subset of striatal projection neurons, probably the matrix neurons. The expression pattern of Foxp1 mRNA suggests that Foxp1 may play a role in the development and formation of a circuit in the basal ganglia, which is involving the matrix neurons.",
