     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Electronic conduction, a new treatment approach for epilepsy, has been confirmed to reduce epileptiform discharge on EEG and convulsive behaviors, particularly epileptic discharge propagation and serious behavioral seizures, in rats with kainic acid (KA)-induced acute temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). OBJECTIVE: Hippocampal cell apoptosis was examined to confirm the neuroprotective effect of electronic conduction therapy in rats with KA-induced acute TLE. METHODS: Rats were divided into four groups: control group (right CA3 injection of saline), KA group (right CA3 injection of KA), sham conduction group (KA rats with sham conduction), and conduction group (KA rats with electric conduction). Apoptotic cells were evaluated by flow cytometry, TUNEL staining, and mRNA expression levels of caspase-3, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and glial fibrillary acidic protein measured by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: The frequency of convulsive behaviors in the conduction group decreased significantly compared with the KA group and the sham conduction group. Significantly fewer apoptotic cells were detected in rats with conduction based on flow cytometry and TUNEL staining results. The qRT-PCR results indicated that KA-induced up-regulation of hippocampal caspase-3 mRNA expression was reduced 24 hours after KA injection in rats that received conduction treatment. CONCLUSION: Electronic conduction treatment can reduce seizure frequency and hippocampal cell apoptosis in rats with KA-induced acute TLE.",
