     "AB": "We studied whether noradrenaline release is affected by interleukin-1beta and the neuropeptides urotensin II, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), neuropeptide W (NPW) and neuropeptide FF (NPFF). Rodent tissues preincubated with [3H]noradrenaline were superfused, and the effect of peptides on the electrically-evoked tritium overflow (\"noradrenaline release\") was studied. In mouse brain cortex, interleukin-1beta at 0.3 nM and the prostaglandin E2 analogue sulprostone at 3 nM inhibited noradrenaline release by about 40% the effect of interleukin-1beta developed gradually, whereas the effect of sulprostone occurred promptly. Urotensin II at 0.001-1 muM did not affect noradrenaline release in rat kidney cortex, whereas 0.01 muM angiotensin II increased it (positive control). MCH at 0.01-1 muM did not alter noradrenaline release in the rat brain cortex, and NPW 1 muM did not affect noradrenaline release in the mouse hypothalamus or hippocampus. In each model, 0.1 muM sulprostone inhibited noradrenaline release (positive control). NPFF and the NPFF2 receptor agonist dNPA (1 muM) did not affect noradrenaline release in the mouse atria; the inhibitory effect of the delta opioid receptor agonist 1 muM DPDPE on noradrenaline release in this tissue was not altered by NPFF or dNPA at 0.32 muM but was counteracted by the delta opioid antagonist naltrindole at 0.001 muM. In conclusion, interleukin-1beta inhibits noradrenaline release in the mouse cortex; the effect develops gradually, suggesting that it affects protein biosynthesis. Noradrenergic neurons in various tissues from rodents are devoid of presynaptic receptors for urotensin II, MCH, NPW and NPFF. Finally, an interaction between a delta opioid agonist and NPFF could not be detected.",
