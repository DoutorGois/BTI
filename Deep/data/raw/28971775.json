     "AB": "There are limited studies in the literature evaluating region specific neuroprotective effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in Alzheimer's Disease. Here, we aimed to review the neurochemical correlates of the hippocampal neuroprotective effect of rTMS in various preclinical and clinical studies. Our findings indicate that rTMS may exert a significant neuroprotective effect through acting on the hippocampal Brain Derived Growth Factor (BDNF) levels which may, in turn, slow the progression of Alzheimer's Disease. Clarifying the neuroprotective correlates of hippocampus oriented rTMS protocols may open novel avenues for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) treatment.",
