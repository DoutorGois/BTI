     "AB": "One of the most common and serious co-morbidities in patients with epilepsy is cognitive impairment. While early-life seizures are considered a major cause for cognitive impairment, it is not known whether it is the seizures, the underlying neurological substrate or a combination that has the largest impact on eventual learning and memory. Teasing out the effects of seizures from pre-existing neurological disorder is critical in developing therapeutic strategies. We therefore investigated the additional cognitive effects of seizures on rodents with malformations of cortical development induced with methylazoxymethanol acetate. Pregnant rats were injected with saline or methylazoxymethanol acetate at embryonic Day 15 or 17 to induce differing malformation severity. From the day of birth to 9 days of age, half the pups received 50 flurothyl-induced seizures. All rats underwent testing in the Morris water maze to test spatial memory at 25 days of age (immediate post-weaning) or during adolescence at 45 days of age. Post-weaning rats had severe spatial cognitive deficits in the water maze and seizures worsened performance. In contrast, in animals tested during adolescence, there was no longer an additional adverse effect of seizures. We also investigated whether the severity of the structural abnormality and seizures impacted brain weight, cortical thickness, hippocampal area and cell dispersion area. The mean brain weight in control animals was greater than in rats exposed to methylazoxymethanol acetate at embryonic Day 17, which was greater than rats exposed to methylazoxymethanol acetate at embryonic Day 15. Rats exposed to methylazoxymethanol acetate at embryonic Day 15 had a thinner cortical mantle compared with rats exposed at embryonic Day 17 and control animals. The hippocampal area was similar in rats exposed at embryonic Days 15 and 17 but was smaller compared with controls. Methylazoxymethanol at embryonic Day 17 caused dispersion of the CA1-4 cell layers in the hippocampus, whereas methylazoxymethanol at embryonic Day 15 caused focal nodules in or above the CA1 layer, but the CA1-4 layers were intact and similar to control. Early-life seizures did not have a significant impact on any of these parameters. These observations indicate that the major factor responsible for the cognitive impairment in the rats with cortical dysplasia was the underlying brain substrate, not seizures. These findings have significant implications for the understanding of cognitive impairments in childhood epilepsy and suggest that early aggressive therapy of seizures alone may not be an adequate strategy for minimizing cognitive effects.",
