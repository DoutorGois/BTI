     "AB": "Nonpolio enteroviral encephalitis usually presents as a diffuse, generalized encephalitis. Focal cerebral involvement by nonpolioviruses is uncommon, and neuroradiologic studies in these cases are usually normal. The authors present a case of a 5-year-old male with an acute encephalitic illness and bilateral lesions of the hippocampi on magnetic resonance imaging. Enteroviral nucleic acids were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The findings suggest that enteroviral infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute bilateral hippocampal encephalitis in patients in whom polymerase chain reaction fails to demonstrate the presence of herpes simplex virus.",
