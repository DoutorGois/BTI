     "AB": "The aim of the study was to identify cerebral activation associated with sufficient or insufficient encoding, and with correct or false recognition. Fourteen volunteers performed two paradigms: explicit learning of words; and later retrieval of previously presented words. Items were classified according to the subjects' recognition performance. Echo-planar MRI of blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal changes was performed during encoding and retrieval. Response-related fMRI-analysis was used to compare activation associated with the subjects' retrieval success. During encoding, there was a trend towards increased activation of the left medial cingulate gyrus and of the right fusiform gyrus for later hits (correctly identified, learned target words) in comparison with misses (non-identified targets). During recognition, signal intensities associated with false alarms (falsely identified distractors) were significantly higher in left and right extrastriate cortex than those associated with hits, misses and correct rejections of distractors. Activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus during retrieval was related to reaction time and might be associated with the preparation or performance of motor response. Increased activation during false alarms might reflect a source-monitoring deficit or an increased subjective familiarity with distractors that have been most intensively processed in extrastriate visual cortex.",
