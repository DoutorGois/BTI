     "AB": "Acute and chronic-cocaine administration increase serum levels of progesterone in both male and female rats. This study aimed to determine whether progesterone and its bioactive metabolite allopregnanolone (ALLOP) are altered in the hippocampus and striatum (areas known to modulate cocaine-induced behavioral response) after acute cocaine administration. To this end, male and female rats were administered 20 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg of cocaine, respectively (doses that produce equivalent behavioral responses between the sexes). Thirty minutes after drug treatment, serum and brain were collected and later analyzed for progesterone and ALLOP levels using HPLC measurements. At these cocaine doses, no sex differences in the overall behavioral responses after drug treatment were observed. In saline-treated controls, female rats had overall higher levels of progesterone in the serum than did male rats. After cocaine administration, progesterone and ALLOP levels in serum, hippocampus, and striatum were increased at similar levels in both sexes. In the hippocampus, progesterone levels were increased in both males and females, but ALLOP levels were increased only in females.",
