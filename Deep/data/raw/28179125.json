     "AB": "It is known that regular aerobic exercise has positive effects on hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. We have previously have been able to demonstrate that aerobic exercise increased IGF-1 in hippocampus. Leptin, which is associated with cognitive functions, is also involved in fat metabolism and stimulates energy consumption. While it is known that leptin stimulates IGF-1 production in hepatocytes, little known is on the link between IGF-1 and leptin in brain during aerobic exercise. In this study, we investigated the effects of regular aerobic exercise on leptin, leptin receptor expression levels in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Additionally, we investigated the correlation of IGF-1 levels with leptin and leptin receptor expression. During the experiment, exercise group was run on a treadmill for 30min per session at a speed of 8m/min and 0 degrees slope, five times a week for 6 weeks. Leptin, leptin expression, IGF-1 levels and cell numbers increased in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of exercise groups. Blood leptin levels increased in female rats in exercise group; whereas it did not change in male rats; blood IGF-1 levels were found to be increased in exercised male rats. There was a strong positive correlation between hippocampal leptin levels and hippocampal IGF-1 levels; also a strong positive correlation between hippocampal leptin receptor expression and hippocampal IGF-1. These results indicate that, increased leptin and leptin receptor expression are correlated with IGF-1 in regular aerobic exercised rats. Blood leptin and IGF-1 levels were also found to be associated with gender. Females had high blood leptin levels and males had high blood IGF-1 levels in the exercise groups.",
