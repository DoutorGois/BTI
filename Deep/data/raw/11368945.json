     "AB": "A large body of literature dealing with neurotoxicity has focused on trying to define the exact nature of cell death following a neurological insult. While there is some debate in the field, it has been shown that a number of neurons in a given population can respond to an acute insult stimulus by activating the apoptotic cascade. To what extent, however, these insults result in the classical manifestations of either apoptosis or necrosis, or whether a mixture of the two results, is highly controversial, in part dependent on the particular system utilized. In this paper, we investigate the role of particular apoptotic signals in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, following acute excitotoxicity, metabolic poisoning, and heat stress. In particular, we examine these effects by utilizing a modified herpes simplex viral vector to specifically deliver viral anti-apoptotic genes. We have selected a battery of viral genes (crmA, p35, gamma34.5, KsBcl-2) that have evolved to suppress suicidal host responses to infection. We examine these inhibitors in the face of the above classes of insults and report that each viral agent tested has a unique profile in its ability to protect hippocampal neurons following acute neurological insults. Specifically, the effects of domoic acid excitotoxicity can be alleviated only with crmA, p35 and gamma34.5 whereas all genes tested can protect against heat stress. Conversely, no genes tested can protect against metabolic poisoning by cyanide. Such a study helps us to further understand the nature of apoptotic signals in different insults.",
