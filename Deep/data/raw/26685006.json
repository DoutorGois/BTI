     "AB": "Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) by measuring non-Gaussian diffusion allows an accurate estimation of the distribution of water molecule displacement and may correctly characterize microstructural brain changes caused by neurodegeneration. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of DKI to detect changes induced by alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) accumulation in alpha-Syn overexpressing transgenic mice (TNWT-61) in both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) using region of interest (ROI) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses respectively and to explore the relationship between alpha-Syn accumulation and DKI metrics in our regions of interest. Fourteen-month-old TNWT-61 mice and wild-type (WT) littermates underwent in vivo DKI scanning using the Bruker Avance 9.4 Tesla MRI system. ROI analysis in the GM regions substantia nigra, striatum, hippocampus, sensorimotor cortex, and thalamus and TBSS analysis in WM were performed. Immunohistochemistry for alpha-Syn was performed in TNWT-61 mice and correlated with DKI findings. We found increased kurtosis and decreased diffusivity values in GM regions such as the thalamus and sensorimotor cortex, and in WM regions such as the external and internal capsule, mamillothalamic tract, anterior commissure, cingulum, and corpus callosum in TNWT-61 mice as compared to WT mice. Furthermore, we report for the first time that alpha-Syn accumulation is positively correlated with kurtosis and negatively correlated with diffusivity in the thalamus. The study provides evidence of an association between the amount of alpha-Syn and the magnitude of DKI metric changes in the ROIs, with the potential of improving the clinical diagnosis of PD.
