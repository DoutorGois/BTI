     "AB": "The influence of the new antiparkinsonian drug hemantane on D1 receptors in striatum, 5-HT1A receptors in hippocampus, and 5-HT2A receptors in frontal cortex of intact and MPP+-treated (3 microg/0.6 ml dist., intranigral) rats was studied. Hemantane (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated subchronically for 7 days (beginning a day after MPP+ injection). A modulatory effect of hemantane on D1, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors was revealed. It was found that hemantane increased the binding site density (Bmax) of D1 and 5-HT1A receptors and decreased the binding site density of 5-HT2A receptors without changing the affinity (Kd) to the selective ligands. These results demonstrate that subchronic administration of hemantane leads to the functional rearrangement of dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain of both intact and MPP+-treated rats.",
