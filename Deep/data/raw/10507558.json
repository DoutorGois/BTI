     "AB": "We compared migration of systemically injected microglia into normal brain vs. ischaemic brain using a model of ischaemic hippocampal lesion. Microglia were labeled by a fluorescent dye using our standard phagocytosis procedure of microscopic particles and then injected intra-arterially into Mongolian gerbils subjected to ischaemia reperfusion neuronal injury. Delayed death of pyramidal neurons was confirmed by conventional histological analysis and dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. Clusters of dye-tagged cells migrating into the hippocampal ischaemic lesions were confirmed histochemically to be microglia. Since peripherally injected microglia exhibit specific affinity for ischaemic brain lesions and does not exacerbate ischaemic neuronal injury in the present model, we suggest that microglia may have a potential to be used as a piggy-back ride to deliver therapeutic genes and/or drugs for CNS repair following transitory global ischaemic insult.",
