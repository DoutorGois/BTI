     "AB": "Morris water maze (MWM) was employed to distinguish the aged rats with declined memory to investigate the effect of naloxone on the synaptic plasticity of hippocampus in declined memory aged rats. After administration with naloxone for 7 days, LTP of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) from Schaffer collateral to CA1 region was recorded. The results showed that the maintenance of LTP of EPSPs from Schaffer collateral to CA1 subfield in isolate hippocampal brain slice was prolonged by naloxone with improved Morris water maze performance and reduced threshold of EPSPs. It is suggested that naloxone can improve learning and memory through enhancement of the synaptic plasticity of hippocampus in aged rats with declined memory.",
