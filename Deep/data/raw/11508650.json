     "AB": "Although the aging effect of dopamine D2 receptor in the striatum is well-documented, the effect of age on the extrastriatal dopamine D2 receptor has not been fully examined. Since the density of extrastriatal dopamine D2 receptor is very low, suitable ligands are limited. In this study, we used [11C]FLB 457 to quantify the extrastriatal dopamine D2 receptor in the living human brain. Twenty-seven healthy male subjects aged from 21 to 82 years participated in the positron emission tomography study. Extrastriatal [11C]FLB 457 binding was quantified with a reference tissue model using cerebellum as a reference region. Binding potentials corresponding to Bmax/Kd were used to evaluate age-related change. We found age-related decreases of D2 receptor binding in all measured extrastriatal regions. The decrease of D2 receptor binding was 13.8% per decade in frontal cortex, 12.0% in temporal cortex, 13.4% in parietal cortex, 12.4% in occipital cortex, 12.2% in hippocampus, and 4.8% in thalamus. These findings suggest that the amounts of D2 receptor declines in all brain regions as part of the normal aging process.",
