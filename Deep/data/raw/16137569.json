Requirement of glycolytic and mitochondrial energy supply for loading of Ca2+ stores and InsP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling in rat hippocampus astrocytes. J. Neurosci.

Neuroscience 78, 589-601] equivalent to an impairment of astrocytic energy metabolism and function. Superfusion of fura-2 loaded primary cortical astrocytes with glucose-free solution triggered a slow and progressive, 56-fold increase of the [Ca2+]i from 60 nM up to 3.3 microM within 2 h. Re-addition of glucose led to a rapid drop of [Ca2+]i, yet [Ca2+]i did not fully recover to the low levels recorded prior to glucose deprivation and, moreover, astrocytic Ca2+ signaling was impaired: adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP) were no longer able to trigger a transient Ca2+ response as recorded in controls. 17beta-estradiol protected astrocytes from the glucose deprivation-induced [Ca2+]i increase and the impaired signaling independently of the nuclear estrogen receptor, as the antiestrogen tamoxifen and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not impede the protective effect of 17beta-estradiol.",
