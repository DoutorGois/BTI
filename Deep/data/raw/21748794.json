     "AB": "We aimed to setup a noninvasive and well-controlled methodology for evaluation of the cerebrovascular response in mice (C57BL/6J; 12 weeks). Therefore we applied a normo-, hypo-, and hyperventilation paradigm combined with arterial spin labeling and monitoring of the expired CO(2) (expCO(2)) (n=7) or arterial pCO(2) (apCO(2)) (n=12). Reducing the tidal volume by 25% and the respiratory rate by 20% resulted in hypercapnia (apCO(2) from 33 +/- 6 mmHg to 64 +/- 16 mmHg). Increasing the respiratory rate by 25% and the tidal volume by 20% decreased apCO(2) to 22 +/- 5 mmHg. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was 82 +/- 21, 163 +/- 41 and 64 +/- 18 mL/100 g/min during normo, hypo-, and hyperventilation, respectively (midbrain). The correlation of apCO(2) and CBF levels resulted in a cerebrovascular response of 2.7 +/- 0.3, 2.1 +/- 0.3, 2.1 +/- 0.3, and 3.7 +/- 0.5 mL/100 g/min/mmHg for midbrain, cortex, hippocampus and thalamus, respectively. As expCO(2) levels were correlated with apCO(2) (r(2)=0.86; n=4) and CBF (r(2)=0.67) a cerebrovascular response based on simultaneously recorded CBF and expCO(2) levels could be derived (3.3 +/- 0.5, 2.5 +/- 0.4, 3.0 +/- 0.4, and 4.5 +/- 0.6 mL/100 g/min/mmHg; order as above). A cross-over experiment resulted in similar responses. In conclusion, this protocol allows evaluating basal CBF and cerebrovascular response in mice under well-controlled conditions by simply changing ventilator settings and correlating CBF with apCO(2) and/or simultaneously obtained expCO(2).",
