     "AB": "Rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons in culture, exposed 30 min to Mg(2+)-free, glycine-supplemented medium undergo a selective (about 35%) degeneration over the next 24 h. This neuronal injury appeared to result from excitatory synaptic transmission and subsequent activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, as cell death could be blocked by tetrodotoxin and NMDA, but not non-NMDA, receptor antagonists. Ganglioside GM1, which has recently been described to protect against excitotoxin-induced damage, also prevented the death of hippocampal neurons associated with the above phenomenon. Gangliosides may be a novel therapeutic tool for brain injury associated with epileptic-like activity.",
