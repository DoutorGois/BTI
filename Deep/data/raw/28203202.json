     "AB": "Exosomes, a type of extracellular vesicle, have been shown to be involved in many disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exosomes may contribute to the spread of misfolded proteins such as amyloid-beta (Abeta) and alpha-synuclein. However, the specific diffusion process of exosomes and their final destination in brain are still unclear. In the present study, we isolated exosomes from peripheral plasma and injected them into the hippocampus of an AD mouse model, and investigated exosome diffusion. We found that injected exosomes can spread from the dentate gyrus (DG) to other regions of hippocampus and to the cortex. Exosomes targeted microglia preferentially; this phenomenon is stable and is not affected by age. In AD mice, microglia take up lower levels of exosomes. More interestingly, plasma exosomes cluster around the Abeta plaques and are engulfed by activated microglia nearby. Our data indicate that exosomes can diffuse throughout the brain and may play a role in the dynamics of amyloid deposition in AD through microglia.",
