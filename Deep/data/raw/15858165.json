     "AB": "The integrative properties of dendrites are determined by several factors, including their morphology and the spatio-temporal patterning of their synaptic inputs. One of the great challenges is to discover the interdependency of these two factors and the mechanisms which sculpt dendrites' fine morphological details. We found a novel form of neurite growth behavior in neuronal cultures of the hippocampus and cortex, when axons and dendrites grew directly toward neurite-neurite contact sites and crossed them, forming multi-neurite intersections (MNIs). MNIs were found at a frequency higher than obtained by computer simulations of randomly distributed dendrites, involved many of the dendrites and were stable for days. They were formed specifically by neurites originating from different neurons and were extremely rare among neurites of individual neurons or among astrocytic processes. Axonal terminals were clustered at MNIs and exhibited higher synaptophysin content and release capability than in those located elsewhere. MNI formation, as well as enhancement of axonal terminal clustering and secretion at MNIs, was disrupted by inhibitors of synaptic activity. Thus, convergence of axons and dendrites to form MNIs is a non-random activity-regulated wiring behavior which shapes dendritic trees and affects the location, clustering level and strength of their presynaptic inputs.",
