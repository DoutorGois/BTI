     "AB": "Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase/pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor/visfatin (Nampt/PBEF/visfatin) is an adipocytokine. By synthesizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)), Nampt/PBEF/visfatin functions to maintain an energy supply that has critical roles in cell survival. Cerebral ischemia leads to energy depletion and eventually neuronal death by apoptosis in specific brain regions specially the hippocampus. However, the role of Nampt/PBEF/visfatin in brain and cerebral ischemia remains to be investigated. This study investigated the role of administration Nampt/PBEF/visfatin in hippocampal CA3 area using a transient global cerebral ischemia model. Both common carotid arteries were occluded for 20 min followed by reperfusion. Saline as a vehicle and Nampt/PBEF/visfatin at a dose of 100 ng were injected intracerebroventricularly (ICV) at the time of cerebral reperfusion. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of Nampt/PBEF/visfatin neuroprotection, levels of expression of apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-3 activation, Bax protein levels, and Bcl-2 protein levels) 96 h after ischemia were determined by immunohistochemical staining. The number of active caspase-3-positive neurons in CA3 was significantly increased in the ischemia group, compared with the sham group (P < 0.001), and treatment with Nampt/PBEF/visfatin significantly reduced the ischemia/reperfusion-induced caspase-3 activation, compared to the ischemia group (P < 0.05). Also, results indicated a significant increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the ischemia group, compared with the sham group (P < 0.01). However, treatment with Nampt/PBEF/visfatin significantly attenuated the ischemia/reperfusion-induced increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, compared with the ischemia group (P < 0.05). This study has indicated that Nampt/PBEF/visfatin entails neuroprotective effects against ischemia injury when used at the time of cerebral reperfusion. These neuroprotective mechanisms of Nampt/PBEF/visfatin occur through decrease the expression ofproapoptotic proteins (cleaved caspase-3 and Bax) and, on the other hand, increase the expression ofantiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2). Thus, our findings indicate that Nampt/PBEF/visfatin is a new therapeutic target for cerebral ischemia.",
