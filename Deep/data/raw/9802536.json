     "AB": "Short-Sleep (SS) and Long-Sleep (LS) mice differ in initial sensitivity to ethanol. Ethanol acts as an antagonist at N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Therefore, we tested whether SS and LS mice also differ in initial sensitivity to NMDAR antagonists. Systemic injection (intraperitoneal) of either the noncompetitive NMDAR antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine) or the competitive NMDAR antagonist 2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) produced similar results. At lower drug doses, SS mice showed greater locomotor activation than LS mice; and at higher doses, SS mice continued to be activated whereas LS mice became sedated. Brain levels of [3H]MK-801 were 40% higher in SS, compared with LS, mice. However, blood levels of [3H]MK-801 and [3H]CPP and brain levels of [3H]CPP were similar in the two lines. NMDARs were measured using quantitative autoradiographic analysis of in vitro [3H]MK-801 binding to SS and LS mouse brains. Significantly higher (20 to 30%) receptor densities were observed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of SS mice. Our results support the hypothesis that SS and LS mice differ in initial sensitivity to NMDAR antagonists and suggest that the line differences in the dose-response relationships for MK-801- and CPP-induced locomotor activity are qualitatively similar to those reported for ethanol. Differences in pharmacokinetics and number of NMDARs may contribute to, but are unlikely to entirely account for, the differential behavioral responsiveness of SS and LS mice to MK-801 and CPP.",
