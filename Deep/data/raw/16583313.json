     "AB": "Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), the most common form of epilepsy, is characterised by cytoarchitectural abnormalities including neuronal cell loss and reactive gliosis in hippocampus. Determination of aberrant cytoskeleton protein expression by proteomics techniques may help to understand pathomechanism that is still elusive. We searched for differential expression of hippocampal proteins by an analytical method based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with mass spectrometry unambiguously identifying 77 proteins analysed in eight control and eight MTLE hippocampi. Proteins were quantified and we observed 18 proteins that were altered in MTLE. Cytoskeleton proteins tubulin alpha-1 chain, beta-tubulin, profilin II, neuronal tropomodulin were significantly reduced and one actin spot was missing, whereas ezrin and vinculin were significantly increased in MTLE. Proteins of several classes as e.g. antioxidant proteins (peroxiredoxins 3 and 6), chaperons (T-complex protein 1-alpha, stress-induced-phosphoprotein 1), signaling protein MAP kinase kinase 1, synaptosomal proteins (synaptotagmin I, alpha-synuclein), NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-2 and 26S protease regulatory subunit 7 protein, neuronal-specific septin 3 were altered in MTLE. Taken together, the findings may represent or lead to cytoskeletal impairment; aberrant antioxidant proteins, chaperons, MAP kinase kinase 1 and NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-2 may have been involved in pathogenetic mechanisms and altered synaptosomal protein expression possibly reflects synaptic impairment in MTLE.",
