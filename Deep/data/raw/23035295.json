     "AB": "GABA and GABAA receptors are ubiquitous within the central nervous systems, playing a fundamental role in controlling neural inhibition and timing of neural networks (i.e., gating pyramidal cell synchrony) (Traub et al., 1999; Whitington and Traub, 2003; Whittington et al., 1995). GABAA receptors are pentameric protein complexes constructed from protein subunits named alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, and pi that are derived from a repertoire (cassette) of 21 different proteins/genes (Olsen and Sieghart, 2008). Often these subunits exist as subtypes: alpha has six, beta has three, and gamma has three. The functionality of GABAA receptors is determined by specific subunit configurations. The stoichiometry of GABAA receptors is thought to be 2alpha;2beta and one of the other subunits (gamma, delta, epsilon, pi) is \"chosen\" to complete the pentamer. Although there are many possible subunit combinations that could potentially make up a GABAA receptor, there are two primary classes that have been broadly defined. One class comprises receptors that have a gamma subunit and the other class is one that has a subunit. For insertion into a synaptic site, a GABAA receptor must contain a gamma subunit (which most often is the gamma2 subtype in the adult CNS). Synaptic receptors mediate what is usually termed \"phasic inhibition,\" but those having the delta subunit are not usually located in postsynaptic densities and are important for providing \"tonic (extrasynaptic) inhibition.\" Importantly, the variability of GABAA receptor structure as defined by other subunits (alpha and beta) seems to control the timing of phasic inhibition. The timing is primarily manifested by the variability of the rate of decay of the synaptic currents. It seems that once GABA is released from the synaptic vesicle it saturates the synaptic receptors, activating them within a millisecond (although there are exceptions to this generalization). Although the GABA concentration declines very quickly (within 2 or 3 ms), the synaptic current does not, as GABA tends to unbind relatively slowly from its receptors (Hutcheon et al., 2000; Maconochie et al., 1994). The rate at which it unbinds is controlled by structure (subunit expression) (Burgard et al., 1999; Hutcheon et al., 2000; Verdoorn, 1994). So, depending on the subunits comprising a given receptor, synaptic currents can last from 5 to 10 ms to hundreds of milliseconds. This variability in duration seems to be important in determining neuronal network synchronization. For example, fast phasic inhibition tends to create fast brain rhythms (gamma oscillations in hippocampus and cortex; Klausberger et al., 2002, 2004), whereas slow inhibition produces slow brain rhythms (delta in renticular nucleus; Bentivoglio et al., 1990; Zhang et al., 1997). Finally, to some extent, extrasynaptic/tonic inhibition (which is essentially active continuously) also seems important for controlling brain rhythms. In this regard, a recent report implicated tonic inhibition in controlling hippocampal gamma rhythms (Mann and Mody, 2010). Given the heterogeneous expression of GABAA receptor subunits regionally and even at the subcellular level, the understanding of the potential complexity of how all these factors control normal and abnormal brain function is daunting. Nevertheless, the implications are relatively easy to appreciate; perturbations in the structure of GABAA receptors have the potential to alter neural network activity and thus alter behavior.",
