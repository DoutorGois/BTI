     "AB": "The cortical information flow via the perforant path represents a major excitatory projection to the hippocampus. Lesioning this projection leads to massive degeneration and subsequently to reorganization in its termination zones as well as in primary non-affected subfields of the hippocampus. The molecular mechanisms and factors which are involved in the postlesional events are poorly defined. Using a differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (DDRT-PCR) strategy, we located one band which occurred only in control hippocampus lanes and almost disappeared in the lanes of lesioned hippocampi. By sequencing, we identified the corresponding gene as cholecystokinin (CCK). Northern blot analysis confirmed a decreased transcription of CCK after lesion. In situ hybridization analysis was performed for localization and quantification of altered CCK transcription. We noted a significant downregulation of CCK transcription in the hippocampus (20%) and in the contralateral cortex (12%) 1-day after lesion (dal) and an increased signal in the ipsilateral cortex (10.5%). This pattern was altered, showing upregulation of CCK mRNA expression, reaching its highest level of 70% above control levels at 5 dal. In the hippocampus, the control level was reached again at 21 dal, whereas the cortex reached the control level at 10 dal. In comparison, the mRNA transcripts of the receptors CCK(A) and CCK(B) remained unchanged. Since CCK-containing neurons are involved in the modulation of pyramidal and granule cell excitability, our data indicate a time course correlation between CCK mRNA expression and postlesional axonal sprouting response in the hippocampus.",
