     "AB": "The formation of H2S from cyst(e)ine is catalyzed by three enzymes, cystathionine beta synthase, cystathionase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. In the liver, kidney, enterocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, H2S is principally synthesized by cystathionase. In contrast, it is synthesized by cystathionine beta synthase in the brain and partially by 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase in cardiac tissue. H2S is catabolized, essentially in mitochondria by thiosulfate reductase. The sulfite generated is then oxidized to sulfate by sulfite oxidase. The amount of thiosulfate excreted in the urine is the best indicator of H2S biosynthesis, together with sulfhemoglobin determination in erythrocytes. H2S acts as a neuromodulator in the brain, increasing responses mediated by NMDA receptors, facilitating the induction of long-term potentialization in the hippocampus. H2S also acts as a vasodilator, acting directly on ATP-dependent potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. The concentration of H2S is abnormally low in the brains of subjects with Alzheimer's disease, due to changes in the concentration of the physiological activator of cystathionine beta synthase. The overproduction of H2S described in subjects with Down's syndrome probably results from the overproduction of cystathionine beta synthase, as the gene encoding this protein is located on chromosome 21.",
