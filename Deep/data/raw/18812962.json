     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Meyer's loop, the most vulnerable part of the optic radiations during approaches to the temporomedial region, extends to the tip of the temporal horn and is often encountered in epilepsy surgery. The risk of damaging Meyer's loop during transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomy peaks while accessing the temporal horn through its roof by opening the inferior limiting sulcus of the insula. In this prospective study, we sought to evaluate and identify the incidence of visual field deficits in a homogeneous group of patients who had temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis and who underwent transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomy. METHODS: We studied 30 patients who were referred for epilepsy surgery for intractable complex partial and/or secondary generalized seizures and evaluated according to a noninvasive protocol. All patients underwent selective amygdalohippocampectomy for temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis using the standard transsylvian approach. Visual field deficits were examined preoperatively in 30 patients, by either a confrontation method (n = 18) or standard Goldmann perimetry (n = 12) and postoperatively in all patients using standard Humphrey digital perimetry. RESULTS: Visual field examination was normal in all patients before surgery. Humphrey perimetric measurement revealed visual field deficits in 11 patients (36.6%) after surgery. CONCLUSION: We have shown that there is a considerable risk of having visual field deficits after standard transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomy owing to the interruption of the anterior bundle of the optic radiation fibers, which most likely occurs while opening the temporal horn through the inferior limiting sulcus of the insula.",
