     "AB": "Changes of glutaminase immunoreactivity in rat brain were examined after intracranial injection of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), an irreversible inhibitor of glutaminase. When 1 M DON was injected into the lateral ventricle, a half-lethal dose was 7.5-10 mumol. After intraventricular injection of 2-7.5 mumol DON, glutaminase immunoreactivity was dose dependently enhanced with the maximum enhancement 3-5 days after the injection. The enhanced glutaminase immunoreactivity was recognized by enlarged granular immunodeposits in both perikarya and neuropil in many regions, such as the hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, and some brain stem, cerebellar, and spinal cord regions. Intrathalamic injection of 0.2 mumol DON enhanced glutaminase immunoreactivity in many neuronal perikarya in the thalamus and in some perikarya in layer VI of the cerebral cortex. Intrastriatal injection of the same dose of DON enhanced glutaminase immunoreactivity in neuropil of the caudoputamen and in many neuronal perikarya of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei. These results suggested that DON induced a new massive synthesis of glutaminase in the affected neurons.",
