     "AB": "In order to explore the MRI volume of the amygdala and hippocampus in patients with major depression, quantitative MRI of the amygdala and hippocampus were studied in 22 patients with major depression and compared with 13 age-matched controls. The results showed that both groups exhibited similar significant hippocampal asymmetry (left smaller than right). The volume of the bilateral hippocampus was significantly smaller in the major depression group than that in control group. The patients had significant asymmetry of the amygdalar volumes (right smaller than left). No correlation was found between hippocampal volume abnormalities and ill duration. It was concluded that the hippocampus and amygdala within limbic-cortical networks may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of major depression.",
