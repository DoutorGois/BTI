     "AB": "In a previous study we showed that in vivo treatment with pertussis toxin could inhibit some, but not all, effects of adenosine in the rat hippocampus. In this study we investigated the effect of pertussis toxin on the binding of adenosine analogues to A1 receptors in rat brain. Intraventricular injection of pertussis toxin (10 micrograms into the lateral ventricle) did not affect A1 receptor binding in any brain region studied, as evaluated by autoradiography. In vitro treatment of brain sections (10 microns) with pertussis toxin for 5 h, under conditions when greater than 80% of the G proteins were ADP ribosylated, did not alter radioligand binding to adenosine A1 receptors. GTP (10 microM) virtually abolished the high-affinity agonist binding to the A1 receptor. On the other hand, in solubilized cortical membrane preparations, pertussis toxin pretreatment induced a complete shift of the A1 receptors to the low-affinity state. This suggests that the ability of pertussis toxin to affect G proteins coupled to A1 receptors in brain depends not only on the distribution of the toxin but also on the configuration of receptors and G proteins.",
