     "AB": "K(+)-Cl(-) co-transporter (KCC2) and Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) co-transporter (NKCC1) are the main regulators of neuronal intracellular chloride concentration; altered expression patterns of KCC2 and NKCC1 have been reported in several neurodegenerative diseases. In this paper, we show the effect of repeated stress on KCC2, NKCC1, and serine 940 phosphorylated KCC2 (pKCC2(ser940)) immunoreactivity. The data were obtained from the hippocampus of female mice using single-plane confocal microscopy images. The mean fluorescence intensity of the perisomatic area of neurons, defined as raw fluorescence intensity (RFI) was calculated. Repeated stress (RS) resulted in a decrease in perisomatic area of immunoreactive (IR)-KCC2 and an increase of the IR-NKCC1. In addition, RS decreased perisomatic IR-pKCC2(ser940), corresponding to that of KCC2. The data in this article support the results of a previous study [1] and provide the details of immunohistological methods. Interpretation of the data in this article can be found in \"Repeated stress-induced expression pattern alterations of the hippocampal chloride transporters KCC2 and NKCC1 associated with behavioral abnormalities in female mice\" by Tsukahara et al. [1].",
