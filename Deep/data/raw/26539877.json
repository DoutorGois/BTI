     "AB": "Depression is one of the most common mental disorders, but its etiology is not completely understood. It is assumed that peptidergic system components are involved in the formation of this pathology. Neuropeptides play an important role in the regulation of mental and emotional states. capital ES, Cyrillicarboxypeptidase E is a key enzyme of peptide processing; it regulates neuropeptide levels in the various structures of the nervous system. We have studied effects of a single dose of reboxetine on the activity of carboxypeptidase E in various brain regions and the adrenal glands of rats. The reboxetine injection decreased carboxypeptidase E activity in the pituitary gland (12 h after injection), in the pituitary gland, the quadrigeminal bodies, the medulla oblongata, the hypothalamus, the hippocampus and the amygdala (24 h after injection), in the pituitary gland and striatum (72 h after injection). The enzyme activity in adrenal glands remained basically unchanged. Apparently, the decrease of carboxypeptidase E activity may influence the level of regulatory peptides involved in the pathogenesis of depression.",
