     "AB": "Pharmacological manipulations known to inhibit GABA uptake prolonged GABA-evoked conductance increases in CA1 pyramidal cells in the rat hippocampal slice preparation. Treatments included reduction of extracellular sodium and exposure to cis-4-OH-nipecotic acid, nipecotic acid or L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid (all at 1 mM). These effects contrast with the results obtained with 4-OH-isonipecotic acid, an inactive structural analog of nipecotic acid, which had no effect on the time-course of GABA responses. 4,5,6,7-Tetrahydroisoxazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-3-ol (THPO), an impotent but selective inhibitor of GABA uptake into glia, did not prolong GABA-evoked responses. The effect of sodium reduction depended on the distance between the source of GABA and its receptors, as predicted for an uptake-limited response. GABA-receptor agonists that are poor substrates for GABA uptake (muscimol, thiomuscimol, piperidine-4-sulphonic acid, isoguvacine and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridine-3-ol (THIP) evoked very long conductance changes that were not further prolonged by uptake inhibitors. These results demonstrate the presence of a functional GABA uptake system in the hippocampal slice. The accessibility of hippocampal GABAergic synapses and the known susceptibility of the hippocampus to epileptiform events suggest that the hippocampal slice could be a valuable CNS preparation to study the role of GABA uptake in synaptic physiology.",
