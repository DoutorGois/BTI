     "AB": "The effects of hyperbaric oxygen have been studied on synaptic transmission in the hippocampal brain slice. Oxygen enhances both the prevolley and postsynaptic potential of extracellularly recorded responses following focal stimulation of afferent fiber bundles, but synaptic efficiency is reduced. It is suggested that hyperbaric oxygen causes changes in potassium distribution in the slice.",
