     "AB": "On the hypothesis that schizophrenia is an immunological disorder in which antibody is produced against a unique antigen sequestered principally or exclusively in the septal region of the brain, we used crossed-immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) to evaluate reactivity of a gamma G immunoglobulin (IgG) fraction from serum of schizophrenic patients and nonschizophrenic control subjects with homogenates of tissues of septal region, hippocampus, vermal cerebellum, frontal cortex, and liver of rhesus monkeys. When IgG fractions of unmedicated schizophrenic patients and schizophrenic patients who had received neuroleptic medication for less than 24 hr were tested against septal region homogenate, a precipitin arc was identified, indicating a positive result, with more than 95% of the fractions. In contrast, IgG fractions of schizophrenic patients who had received neuroleptic medication for more than 24 hr were rarely positive. When schizophrenic fractions that tested positive against septal region homogenate were tested against homogenates of the other tissues, they were negative. Fractions of all nonschizophrenic control subjects were negative against all homogenates.",
