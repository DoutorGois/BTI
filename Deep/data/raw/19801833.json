     "PG": "1716-22",
     "AB": "Kososan, a Kampo (Japanese herbal) medicine, has an antidepressive-like effect in behavioral animal models of depression and has been used clinically for the improvement of depressive mood. However, mechanism(s) underlying the antidepressive-like effect of kososan remain unknown. Previous studies showed that orexin-A (OX-A), a neuropeptide that is involved in feeding and arousal, exhibits an antidepressive-like property via hippocampal cell proliferation. Here, we used immunohistochemical analysis with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of proliferating cells, to investigate the effect of long-term treatment with kososan on the orexinergic system and on hippocampal cell proliferation. Oral administration of kososan (1.0 g/kg) or milnacipran (60 mg/kg), a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, for 28 d led to an antidepressive-like effect in the stress-induced depression-like model mice and reversed the stress-induced decrease in the number of OX-A-positive cells in the lateral hypothalamic area. In addition, both kososan and milnacipran alleviated the stress-induced decrease in the number of BrdU-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Moreover, the antidepressive-like effect and the increase in cell proliferation and in the number of neuropeptide Y (NPY, which is closely associated with orexinergic system)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus induced by kososan were blocked by treatment with SB-334867, an orexin receptor 1 antagonist. These results suggest that kososan exerts an antidepressive-like effect via the improvement of the stress-induced decrease in hippocampal cell proliferation and that the mechanism underlying the antidepressive-like effect of kososan, but not of milnacipran, may be associated with the regulation of orexinergic and/or NPYergic transmission.",
