     "AB": "The results of intra-operative cortical EEG recordings (ECoG) were assessed in 30 patients with medically refractory complex partial seizures submitted to temporal lobectomy. Interictal spiking was most frequently recorded from mesial temporal lobe structures (amygdaloid-hippocampal region) and from the temporal neocortex synchronously, as observed in 21/30 patients. In 7 patients, the interictal spiking involved the temporal neocortex exclusively. Electrical stimulation of mesial temporal lobe structures reproduced the patient's habitual warning in 10 patients. The results of this study confirms that ECoG provides reliable intra-operative mapping of the epileptogenic brain tissue to be excised.",
