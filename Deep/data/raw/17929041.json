     "AB": "Although heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) has been suggested to be a stress marker or to play a protective role in brain injury, the relevance of its pathological expression in epilepsy is unclear. We investigated the expression of HSP70 in brain tissue from human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients and from kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure-related neuronal damage in vivo and in vitro. The human TLE tissue showed severe neuronal loss and gliosis in hippocampal CA3 area. The KA-induced neuronal damage was similar to pathological changes of the TLE hippocampus. An increased number of TUNEL-positive cells were observed at day 5 when compared with day 2 after seizure induction. Intense HSP70 immunofluorescence was observed in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons of rat, 2 days following KA administration, which then declined in labeling by day 5. No HSP70 expression was found in Fluoro-Jade B positive dying neurons by double staining. Western blot analysis showed an increased level of p53 and Bax expression following KA treatment. In vitro, there was no apparent difference in the degree of apoptosis between HSP70 siRNA- and control empty vector-transfected primary neurons following KA treatment. Our results revealed that HSP70 was a useful indicator of stressed neurons in acute phase of epilepsy, but not associated with neuronal death, thereby suggesting that HSP70 played no role in neuroprotection during an epileptogenic state.",
