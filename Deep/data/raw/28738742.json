     "AB": "Recently, we demonstrated that inhibition of ERK1/2 activity by SL-327 treatment blocks seizure behavior in Krushinsky-Molodkina (KM) rats, which was mediated by altering of GABA and glutamate release mechanism in the hippocampus. Basal ganglia representing various subcortical cell groups play a significant role in the regulation of motor activity, including epileptiform seizures. OBJECTIVES: To verify if nigrostriatal system could be also affected by SL-327 treatment we analyzed the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, D1 and D2 dopamine receptors, NR2B subunit of NMDA receptor as well as vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2 and glutamic acid decarboxylases GAD65/67 in the striatum and substantia nigra of KM rats. METHODS: Animals were injected i.p. with SL-327 (50 mg/kg) 60 min before audio stimulation. After audiogenic stimulation the brains of control and SL 327 treated rats were removed for further immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis. RESULTS: Obtained results demonstrated a decrease activity in synapsin I, and accumulation of VGLUT2 in the striatum after blockade of audiogenic seizure (AGS) by SL 327 that could lead to inhibition of glutamate release. While in the striatum GAD65/67 level was diminished, in the substantia nigra GAD65/67 was increased showing enhanced inhibitory output to the compact part of the substantia nigra. Analysis of dopaminergic system showed a significant reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and expression in the substantia nigra, and decreased D1 and D2 receptor expression in the striatum. In summary, we propose that changes in the nigrostriatal system could be mediated by inhibitory effect of SL 327 on AGS expression.",
