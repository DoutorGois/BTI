     "AB": "Rasagiline [N-propargyl-l(R)-aminoindan] is a selective irreversible MAO-B inhibitor as is (-)deprenyl. The effect of the drug on antioxidant enzyme activities on dopaminergic tissue was examined in male F-344 rats (8.5-months-old). Two experimental groups were infused subcutaneously with rasagiline saline solutions by means of osmotic minipumps implanted subcutaneously in the back of the rats. Control animals were also similarly implanted with saline filled mini-pumps. Three-and-one-half weeks later, animals were sacrificed and selected tissue samples removed from brain, kidney and heart. Two doses of rasagiline (0.5 mg/kg/day, 1.0 mg/kg/day, both for 3.5 weeks) significantly increased catalase activities about 2-fold in substantia nigra and striatum but not in hippocampus. Interestingly, in both renal cortex and medulla. catalase (CAT) activities were significantly increased. Both Mn- and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were increased 2 to 4 fold in substantia nigra, striatum and renal cortex and heart. Several groups, including our own have reported an extension of survival of deprenyl-treated animals of different species. Although the mechanism(s) of the life extension by deprenyl remains unresolved, it would be interesting to investigate the effect of rasagiline on the survival of animals, since deprenyl also was shown to increase antioxidant enzyme activities in brain dopaminergic regions.",
