     "AB": "Excitatory amino acids are implicated in the development of neuronal cell damage following periods of reversible cerebral ischemia or insulin-induced hypoglycemic coma. To explore the importance of glutamate receptor activation in the posthypoglycemic phase, we exposed rats to 20 min of insulin-induced severe hypoglycemia. The rats were treated immediately after the hypoglycemic insult with four regimes of glutamate receptor antagonists: (1) the AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propriate)-receptor antagonist NBQX [2.3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo (F) quinoxaline] given as a bolus dose of 30 mg.kg-1 i.p., followed by an i.v. infusion of 225 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 6 h; (2) the non-competitive NMDA-receptor antagonist, dizocilpine (MK-801) 1 mg.kg-1 given i.v.; (3) a combined NBQX treatment, (a bolus dose of 10 mg.kg-1 i.p., followed by an i.v. infusion of 225 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 6 h), with dizocilpine 0.33 mg.kg-1 given twice i.p. at 0 and 15 min after recovery and (4) the competitive NMDA-receptor blocker CGP 40,116 [D-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3- pentenoic acid] 10 mg.kg-1 given i.p. In the striatum, all glutamate receptor blockers significantly decreased neuronal damage by approximately 30%. An approximately 50% decrease in neuronal damage was demonstrated in neocortex and hippocampus following the combined treatment with NBQX and dizocilpine, while protection was variable following the treatment with a single glutamate-receptor antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
