     "AB": "Localization and targeting of depth electrodes in specific regions of the human brain is critical for accurate clinical diagnoses and treatment as well as for neuroscientific electrophysiological research. By using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging combined with 2D computational unfolding, the authors present a method that improves electrode localization in the medial temporal lobe. This method permits visualization of electrode placements in subregions of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, allowing for greater specificity in relating electrophysiological and anatomical features in the human medial temporal lobe. Such methods may be extended to therapeutic procedures targeting specific neuronal circuitry in subfields of structures deep in the human brain.",
