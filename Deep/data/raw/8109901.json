     "AB": "Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is capable of determining the spatial distribution in vivo of cerebral metabolites, including N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a compound found only in neurons. We used this technique in 10 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) to determine the location of maximal neuronal/axonal loss or damage and to evaluate the potential of MRSI for presurgical lateralization. Asymmetry of the relative resonance intensity of NAA to creatine was determined for mid and posterior regions of the temporal lobes defined anatomically and also for \"metabolic lesions\" defined as the regions of maximal abnormality on MRSI. MRSI revealed decreased relative signal intensity in at least one temporal lobe of all patients. Two patients had a widespread reduction in NAA in both temporal lobes. The region of maximal abnormality was usually in the posterior temporal lobe but sometimes in the mid temporal lobe. The side of lowest NAA was ipsilateral to the clinical electroencephalographic lateralization in all patients. Lateralization based on NAA to creatine correlated with the atrophy of amygdala and hippocampus in 8 patients who showed this on magnetic resonance imaging volumetric measurements. MRSI can demonstrate regional neuronal loss or damage that correlates with clinical electroencephalographic and structural lateralization in temporal lobe epilepsy. The ability to identify a region of maximal metabolic abnormality on spectroscopic images may confer greater sensitivity than that available from single voxel methods. The maximal metabolic abnormality may not be located in a voxel defined a priori, and based on anatomical considerations, without knowledge of the distribution of the metabolic abnormality.",
