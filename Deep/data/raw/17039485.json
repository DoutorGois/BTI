     "AB": "We investigated the time course of modulation of synaptic transmission by group II and group III metabotropic glutamate receptors in region CA1 of the hippocampus. In the presence of 50 microM picrotoxin, pressure pulse application of 1 mM glutamate resulted in a fast onset of suppression of synaptic transmission in stratum lacunosum moleculare and a slower onset of suppression in stratum radiatum, with both effects returning to baseline over the course of several minutes. Application of 50 microM of the group II agonist (2R,4R)-APDC in stratum lacunosum moleculare resulted in the same fast onset of suppression while having no effect in stratum radiatum. Pressure pulse application of 100 microM DL-AP4 in stratum lacunosum moleculare and stratum radiatum resulted in a much slower onset of suppression of synaptic transmission than (2R,4R)-APDC. Suppression by (2R,4R)-APDC was accompanied by a rapid enhancement of paired pulse facilitation, indicative of a presynaptic mechanism. This demonstrates that activation of group II mGluRs in the hippocampus causes a fast onset of suppression in stratum lacunosum moleculare, while activation of group III mGluRs causes a slower onset of suppression. The difference in time course for group II vs. group III mGluRs suggests a different functional role, with group II playing a potential role in making synapses act as low pass filters.",
