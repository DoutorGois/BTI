     "AB": "The studies outlined here used pharmacological and genetic approaches to attempt to identify the nicotinic receptors that modulate nicotine-induced seizures. Full-blown clonic-tonic seizures were induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of nicotine, the alpha4beta2 selective agonist ABT-418 and the alpha7-selective GTS-21. Cytisine, which is a partial agonist at alpha4beta2-type receptors, produced partial seizures. DHbetaE and MLA did not block nicotine-induced seizures. Instead, both antagonists caused seizures. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) for the alpha7 receptor were identified in two inbred strains (C3H and DBA) that differ in sensitivity to nicotine-induced seizures. F2 mice derived from a C3H x DBA cross that were homozygous for the C3H variant of the alpha7 RFLP were more sensitive to nicotine-induced seizures than were F2 mice that were homozygous for the DBA RFLP. In a study that used RI strains derived from two selectively bred mouse lines (LS and SS), an association between sensitivity to nicotine-induced seizures and an RFLP associated with the alpha4 gene was found. These data support the assertion that both alpha4 and alpha7 receptor types are involved in modulating convulsions produced by nicotine.",
