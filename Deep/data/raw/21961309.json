     "AB": "The C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a chronic combined stress which resulted in the induction of a depressive-like state. The occurrence of a depressive-like state was defined by a decrease in sensitivity to the reward determined by the diminished preference of sweetened solutions over regular drinking water. Such decrease is generally considered as a sign of an unhedonic-like state: one of the key features of clinical depression. Applied here, the paradigm in mice allows unhedonia induction in a subpopulation of stressed animals (54% in the current study); remaining mice are regarded as resilient to stress-induced hedonic deficit. The resilient subgroup is taken, therefore, as a \"functional control\" for those effects of stress that are not accompanied by development of the stress-induced depressive-like state in mice. The analysis of the mRNA extracted from the hippocampi of stress-subjected and home-cage control mice enabled the assessment of gene expression level of over 13 000 genes. This study showed that unhedonic mice are characterized by an up-regulation of 278 and down-regulation of 174 genes related mostly to the CNS development and functions, inter-cellular interactions and signalling, neurological disorders, apoptosis and behavioural regulation. Resilient animals demonstrated up-regulation of 924 and down-regulation of only 29 genes that control formation of cell assemblies, molecular transport, CNS functioning, neurological disorders and various biochemical reactions. Thus, gene expression profiles in the hippocampus of susceptible vs resilient to stress-induced unhedonia inbred subgroups of animals are strictly distinct in both quantity and quality.",
