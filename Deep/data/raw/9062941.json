     "AB": "Ischemia-induced delayed neuronal death can be mediated by apoptosis, and (-)deprenyl has been shown to block apoptosis in dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. This study has investigated whether (-)deprenyl can prevent delayed neuronal death of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Rats were subjected to unilateral hypoxia-ischemia and treated with (-)deprenyl (0.25 mg/kg, s.c.) or saline daily. After sacrifice the left and right hippocampi were examined histologically. Unilateral delayed neuronal death was seen in the CA1, CA3 and CA4 fields up to 14 days after the ischemia. After 14 days' treatment with (-)deprenyl there was 66%, 91% and 96% reduction in delayed neuronal death in the CA1, CA3 and CA4 fields, respectively. (-)Deprenyl was effective when given at the onset or after ischemia, but not when given 2 h before ischemia. The reduction in ischemia-induced delayed neuronal death is consistent with an anti-apoptotic mechanism of (-)deprenyl.",
