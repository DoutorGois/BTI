     "AB": "Depth profiles of hippocampal theta rhythm were investigated in the freely moving rabbit during three behavioral conditions: REM sleep, voluntary movement, and during sensory stimulation applied to the motionless animal. Profiles were found to be the same in all three conditions. Dorsoventral microelectrode penetration of the dorsal hippocampus revealed an approximately uniform amplitude of theta rhythm in strata oriens and pyramidal of CA1. Further microelectrode advancement revealed a sharp reversal of phase and a coincident null in amplitude in the proximal stratum radiatum. There was also a peak of theta rhythm amplitude which occurred in the molecular layer of the dorsal blade of the dentate gyrus. These data imply that in the rabbit, as in the freely moving rat, there are two generators of theta rhythm in the dorsal hippocampus, one in the dentate gyrus and the other in the overlying CA1 layer. The data also indicate the existence of a species difference in generating systems between the rabbit and the rat.",
