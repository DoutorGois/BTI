     "AB": "A monoclonal anti-deltorphin-I antibody specifically recognizing its NH2-terminal region was produced. In the adult rat brain sections, it recognized immunoreactive nerve fibers mainly in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, central nucleus of amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, periaqueductal gray and locus ceruleus. Occasionally, positive somata were localized in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, central nucleus of amygdala, supraoptic and periventricular nuclei. In primarily cultured neurons from various brain regions of new-born rats, the antibody immunostained strongly neuronal somata and processes. The abundant DADTI-immunoreactive substance in the cultured neurons promises to provide an alternative pathway to search for the counterpart of deltorphins in mammals.",
