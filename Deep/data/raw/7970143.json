     "AB": "The extent of RNA editing of the glutamate receptor subunit GluR5 mRNA was evaluated in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of embryonic rat brains, aged 19 days, and adult brains, aged 2-3 months. RNA was isolated and transcribed into cDNA, which was used as template for amplifying a PCR product across the edited region of the GluR5 subunit. Quantification of editing was performed by restriction digest of PCR products with BbvI and image analysis of bands obtained after electrophoresis. The extent of editing was significantly lower in the embryonic state as compared to the adult state. These differences were most pronounced in the cerebellum where the extent of editing amounted to 27 +/- 8% and 78 +/- 2% in the embryonic and adult state, respectively (P < 0.001). Since expression of GluR5 is relatively high in brain areas of neuronal differentiation and synapse formation it is concluded that un-edited GluR5 may play a role in the development of the nervous system.",
