     "AB": "This experiment tested the hypothesis that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) contributes to hippocampal ischemic injury. The antagonist to CRF (alpha-CRF) was administered intraventricularly 15 min prior to 10 min of transient forebrain ischemia in the Wistar rat. alpha-CRF demonstrated a neuroprotective effect in a dose-dependent manner most notable in CA1. There was also an increase in postischemic EEG recovery. It is postulated that CRF contributes to hippocampal ischemic injury through increased neuronal activity.",
