     "AB": "In regard to the phylogenesis and the kindling phenomenon, we reported on the kindling phenomenon in several species, behaviorally and electroencephalographically. In accomplishing the kindling phenomenon, the time courses of the lower animals seem to be faster than that of the higher animals. Afterdischarges and spontaneous hypersynchronous potentials were described electroencephalographically. For the phylogenetic study, the spontaneous hypersynchronous potential (interictal spike) and its secondary epileptogenesis to the secondary site (mirror focus formation) were useful. Secondary epileptogenesis in the lower animals seem to be established faster than in the higher animals. The order in the time courses of the behavioral kindling phenomenon in several species might be presumably concomitant with the order of the secondary epileptogenesis to the contralateral site. Finally we pointed out several factors to influence secondary epileptogenesis.",
