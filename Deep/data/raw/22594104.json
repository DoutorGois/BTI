     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Compound Danshen Tablets (CDST) on spatial cognition and expression of brain b-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was established using D-galactose to cause subacute aging combined with Meynert nucleus damage. Rat behavior was monitored using the Morris water maze, and the expression of beta-APP in rat brain tissue was detected via immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: CDST significantly improved spatial cognition and decreased beta-APP expression in the cortex and hippocampus (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CDST can significantly improve spatial cognition in a rat model of AD. This observation is possibly related to a reduction in beta-APP expression in the rat brain.",
