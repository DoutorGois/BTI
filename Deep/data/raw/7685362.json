     "AB": "The distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was examined in the area dentata of the adult mouse (Mus musculus domesticus). A distinctly stratified distribution of the enzyme was observed and was compared in detail with cytoarchitectural fields and layers. In the stratum moleculare, bands of relatively high AChE activity were seen immediately beneath the pia, at the borders between the outer, middle, and deep portions of the stratum moleculare, and superficial to the granule cell layer. AChE activity was low in the intervening parts of the stratum moleculare. In contrast to the rat, three sublaminae could be discerned in the hilus of the mouse at most septotemporal levels: a limiting subzone, a hilar plexiform layer, and a deep hilar cell mass. Deep to the granule cell layer, AChE activity was high in the limiting subzone and, septally, in the hilar plexiform layer. The deep hilar cell mass stained lightly towards the septal pole of the region but darker at more temporal levels. Numerous AChE-stained cells were seen in the hilus, with the exception of the most temporal levels. A comparative analysis of the AChE pattern of the area dentata reveals that 1) AChE-intense supra- and infragranular bands are found in all mammals, whereas 2) considerable difference between various strains of mice and between species are seen in the stratum moleculare. The functional significance of the AChE pattern is discussed in relation to species differences and connectivity and also with respect to possible activities of the enzyme other than hydrolysis of ACh, which may be involved in growth-related functions and in the plastic and degenerative processes observed in Alzheimer's disease.",
