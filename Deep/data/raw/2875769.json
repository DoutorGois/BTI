     "AB": "Antagonists of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission were tested as antagonists of septal excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) generated by stimulation of the fimbria. Septal EPSPs were depressed in a concentration-dependent manner by kynurenic acid and P-bromobenzoyl piperazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid but not by L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid or D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid. These results indicate that the hippocampal projection to the lateral septum is similar to the Schaffer collateral system and is mediated by an excitatory amino acid or a similar derivative.",
