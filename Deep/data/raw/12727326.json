     "AB": "Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures prepared from newborn rats were maintained in vitro for 9 days. Cultures were then exposed to 30 min of combined oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). After OGD, the area covered by neurites was decreased. The dead cells of hippocampal slices in the ischemia group were 40.4% at day 3 and 41.6% at day 7 after OGD. The ultrastructure of the CA1 region of the slices was seriously damaged. While hippocampal slices were cultured in combination with bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs), the average area covered by neurites was comparatively increased. The dead cells were only 25.2% at day 3 and 27.1% at day 7 after coculture. The damage of the ultrastructure of the CA1 region in the coculture group was reduced significantly. Thus, in an in vitro model of simulated ischemia, MSCs can promote the outgrowth of neurites from hippocampal slices and alleviate cell damage. The neuroprotective effect might be mediated through diffusible neurotrophic factors secreted from MSCs.",
