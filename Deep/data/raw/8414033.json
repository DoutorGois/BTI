     "AB": "We examined the relationship of Wada memory performance and MRI hippocampal volume measurements to laterality of ultimate seizure localization in 20 patients with complex partial seizures who later underwent temporal lobectomy. Discriminant function analysis employing both Wada memory test asymmetries and hippocampal volume asymmetries correctly classified 100% of the patients into left and right temporal lobe groups. Wada memory asymmetries alone correctly classified 90% of the sample (80% of the sample when the discriminant function included all patients except the one being classified), and hippocampal volume asymmetries alone correctly classified 90% of the patients. A significant correlation was present between Wada memory asymmetries and hippocampal volume asymmetries (r = 0.78), indicating that structural evidence of reduced hippocampal volume has a functional correlate reflected by Wada memory performance. These data suggest that the combination of functional and structural measures is of value in the preoperative evaluation for epilepsy surgery.",
