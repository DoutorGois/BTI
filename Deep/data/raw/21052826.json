     "AB": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NR) is involved in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, such as associative long-term potentiation, and in related central functions, such as learning and memory. In this study, we observed effects of treadmill exercise on NR1 and doublecortin (DCX, a marker for neuroblast differentiation) in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG). At 6 weeks of age, rats were put on a treadmill with or without running for 1 h/day for 5 consecutive days at 22 m/min for 5 weeks. Exercise increased NR1 immunoreactivity and protein level in the hippocampus. To identify the correlations between NR and neuroblasts, we intraperitoneally administered a NR antagonist, MK-801, to the exercised rats. MK-801 treatment reduced NR1 protein level in the hippocampus of the exercised rats. In addition, in the MK-801-treated group, the number of DCX cells was significantly decreased in the subgranular zone of the DG. These results suggest that NR may be one of the important factors that modulate neuroblast differentiation during exercise in rats.",
