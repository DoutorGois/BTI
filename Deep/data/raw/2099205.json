     "AB": "In this article we have studied the topography, relationship and projection of the hippocampus in the dog by means of 1 mm thick transverse, horizontal and parasagital sections stained with Mulligan's reagent and 50 microns transverse sections (Nissl). The macroscopical disposition of this part of the CNS was completed by means of a gross dissection. Horizontal sections of 10 microns through the middle or limbic part were used to determine the general microscopic anatomy and to define the morphometry of its cells. From this point of view the Hippocampus of the dog appears to be intermediate between the rat and primates, species better studied.",
