     "AB": "Coffee and nicotine consumption are frequently combined, indicating possible intensifying effect of caffeine on smoking behavior, although neurobiological background of this phenomenon remains unknown. We aimed at determining the effect of caffeine and nicotine, applied separately or simultaneously, on activation of six structures of the brain reward system: nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), amygdala (Amg), hippocampus (Hip), medial prefrontal cortex (mPfr) and dorsal striatum (CdP) in the adult male Wistar rats. Activation of two transcription factors, the phosphorylated form of cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (pCREB) and DeltaFosB (DeltaFosB) was assessed by immunohistochemistry after multiple-dose five-days psychostimulants administration followed by 20min and 24h survival, respectively. Nicotine evoked the highest increase of pCREB-immunoreactivity (-ir) in NAc, while caffeine exerted the weakest effect in mPfr and CdP. Nicotine/caffeine co-administration resulted in decrease of pCREB-ir in NAc and increase in Amg, compared with the effect of each psychostimulant used separately. Nicotine was the strongest psychostimulant activating DeltaFosB-ir in Amg, whereas caffeine - in Hip. Nicotine/caffeine-exerted effect upon DeltaFosB-ir in Amg was weaker, whereas in mPfr stronger, than nicotine-evoked effect in these structures. In summary, pCREB and DeltaFosB activation is dependent on the type of stimulus, brain structure and functional context. Activation of both transcription factors is responsible for caffeine's modifying effect upon nicotine-related behaviors and must be taken into account while quitting cigarette smoking.",
