     "AB": "Male rats were housed in continuous illumination or blinded when 21 day-old and killed 69 days later. The continuous illumination exposure increased the weights of testes and sex accessory organs and reduced the pineal gland weight. Blindness decreased weights of testes, sex accessory organs and anterior pituitary. The oxygen consumption rate of the hypothalamus was higher in the blinded animals than in the controls and lower in the continuously illuminated rats. No one of such groups showed significant changes in the oxygen consumption by either the amygdala or the hippocampus.",
