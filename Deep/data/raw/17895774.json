     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the brain metabolites in the hippocampus of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 0.5 T. METHODS: Absolute concentrations and ratios to creatine of N-acetyl aspartate, myoinositol, glutamate + glutamine, and choline were measured in the right and left hippocampus of 5 MCI patients and 5 control subjects. RESULTS: In MCI subjects, reduced N-acetyl aspartate was found in the right hippocampus (P = 0.01), and increased myoinositol was found in the left hippocampus (P = 0.02). Myoinositol/N-acetyl aspartate ratios were higher in the right (P = 0.03) and left (P = 0.01) hippocampus of MCI subjects. No significant difference in the concentration of glutamate + glutamine was observed between the control and MCI groups. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in myoinositol and a decrease in N-acetyl aspartate may be observed in the preclinical stages of dementia. Ratio measurements of these metabolites may serve as a biomarker for MCI.",
