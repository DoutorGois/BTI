     "AB": "This study investigated the effects of (-)-sesamin on memory deficits induced by chronic electric footshock (EF)-induced stress in mice. Mice were treated with (-)-sesamin (25 and 50mg/kg, p.o., daily for 21day) prior to chronic EF stress (0.6mA, 1s every 5s for 3min, daily for 21day). Transfer retention latencies in the elevated plus maze test and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (type 1) phosphorylation in the hippocampus increased with chronic EF stress, and they were reduced by treatment with (-)-sesamin at both doses. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), which were reduced by chronic EF stress, were increased by treatment with (-)-sesamin. Retention latencies in the passive avoidance test and dopamine levels in the substantia nigra-striatum were also reduced by chronic EF stress, and similarly recovered with (-)-sesamin treatment. These results suggest that (-)-sesamin ameliorates the effects of chronic EF stress-induced spatial and habit learning memory deficits by modulating both NMDA receptor and dopaminergic neuronal systems.",
