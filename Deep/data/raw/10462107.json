     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a popular model for the synaptic changes that may occur during learning and memory; it involves a strengthening of synaptic response and is readily induced in the hippocampus, an area of the brain implicated in learning and memory. Previous research on LTP has focused on 'early' components of the hippocampal circuitry, that is, the dentate gyrus and areas CA1 and CA3. This paper examines the plasticity of the CA1-subiculum pathway; we extend our previous work in this area demonstrating that the projection from area CA1 to subiculum sustains theta-patterned stimulus-induced LTP in vivo. We show that this pathway remains potentiated over a long period (3 h). Furthermore, once this projection is potentiated, it seems resistant to further episodes of high-frequency stimulation. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of hippocampal-cortical interaction during the biological consolidation of memory.",
