     "AB": "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has been postulated to be involved in the regulation of seizures and neural degeneration. We examined the effects of TRH and its stable analogue, RGH-2202, on the kainate-induced seizures and excitotoxicity in mice - a model of a drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. We found that TRH (2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg) and RGH-2202 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) elevated the ED(50) for kainate-induced convulsions and tended to decrease mortality. A histological analysis showed that kainate caused a neuronal loss of CA(1) and CA(3) hippocampal fields. TRH (10, 20 and 50 mg/kg) and RGH-2202 (2.5, 7.5 and 10.0 mg/kg) markedly reduced the excitotoxic effect of kainate. Further studies showed that TRH (1-100 microM) and RGH-2202 (100 microM) significantly attenuated the kainate (150 microM)-induced lactate dehydrogenase release in a primary cortical cell culture from rat embryos. In conclusion, the present study showed that TRH and RGH-2202 attenuated the kainate-induced seizures and inhibited the kainate-evoked neurotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. These results support the hypothesis of a potential utility of TRH and its analogues in the treatment of seizures and some neurodegenerative diseases.",
