     "AB": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are expressed widely in the CNS, and mediate both synaptic and perisynaptic activities of endogenous cholinergic inputs and pharmacological actions of exogenous compounds (e.g., nicotine and choline). Behavioral studies indicate that nicotine improves such cognitive functions as learning and memory, however the cellular mechanism of these actions remains elusive. With help from newly developed biosensors and optogenetic tools, recent studies provide new insights on signaling mechanisms involved in the activation of nAChRs. Here we will review alpha7 nAChR's action in the tri-synaptic pathway in the hippocampus. The effects of alpha7 nAChR activation via either exogenous compounds or endogenous cholinergic innervation are detailed for spontaneous and evoked glutamatergic synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity, as well as the underlying signaling mechanisms. In summary, alpha7 nAChRs trigger intracellular calcium rise and calcium-dependent signaling pathways to enhance glutamate release and induce glutamatergic synaptic plasticity.",
