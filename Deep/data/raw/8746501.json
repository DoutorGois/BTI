     "AB": "Computed tomography (CT) scans provide three-dimensional information about intracranial structures, which can be used to place stereotactically guided radiofrequency (RF) lesions and destroy a targeted volume of tissue. This technique was used for lesioning of the corpus callosum (CC) or the amygdala-hippocampus complex (AHC) in 9 patients with intractable seizures. The procedures were monitored by intraoperative CT scans. Lesions were made in the AHC in 7 patients and the CC in 2 patients. In addition, multiple subpial transection (MST) was performed in 6 patients. The longest follow-up is 29 months with a median of 19 months. Five patients (56%) are free of seizures, 3 patients (33%) have greater than 90% reduction in seizure activity and 1 patient (11%) has greater than 50% but at most 90% reduction in seizure activity. There were no complications except for temporary hemiparesis following MST in 1 patient. The results suggest that stereotactic volumetric RF lesioning of the AHC and the CC may be safe and effective in controlling intractable seizures.",
