     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Baisong tablet on the behaviors and CRHmRNA expression in the chronic stress rats. METHOD: Rats were exposed to different ways of chronic stress. Body weight and behaviors were investigated during the whole procedure, the CRHmRNA expressions in the hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex were semiquantified by the RT-PCR method. RESULT: In comparision with the normal group, rats exposed to chronic stress showed decreased body weight and a significant reduction of consumption of sucrose solution, and the duration of immobility during the forced swimming test was increased significantly. The chronic stress rats was in depression of behavior. CRHmRNA expression in the brain of the chronic stress rats was upregulated significantly, while it was downregulated in the groups of Baisong tablet and the group of fluoxetin. CONCLUSION: Baisong tablet has the effect of antidepressant, and it may be related to the effect of the downregulated CRHmRNA expression in brain.",
