     "AB": "Types of. mechanisms for and stability of synchrony are discussed in the context of two-compartment CA3 pyramidal cell and interneuron model networks. We show how the strength and timing of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs work together to produce either perfectly synchronized or nearly synchronized oscillations, across different burst or spiking modes of firing. The analysis shows how excitatory inputs tend to desynchronize cells, and how common, slowly decaying inhibition can be used to synchronize them. We also introduce the concept of 'equivalent networks' in which networks with different architectures and synaptic connections display identical firing patterns.",
