     "AB": "We have previously demonstrated at the light microscopic level that when embryonic day-15 septal neurons are co-cultured for 21 days with their target cells from the hippocampus, increased numbers of septal cholinergic neurons are present as compared with co-cultures employing cells from the non-target cerebellum. In addition, fine varicose axon-like cholinergic fibers are found to be associated with the hippocampal cells but not with cerebellar cells. We now provide ultrastructural evidence for hippocampal target cell-enhanced cholinergic neuronal survival, axonal proliferation, and synapse formation in this culture system. Dissociated cell suspensions from septal, hippocampal, and cerebellar areas were obtained from 15-day mouse embryos; and hippocampal and cerebellar cells were internally labeled with rhodamine-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin. Combinations of septal and hippocampal cells, and septal and cerebellar cells were allowed to reaggregate in rotation mediated culture for either 15 or 21 days. The reaggregates were then fixed, embedded, sectioned, and processed for acetylcholinesterase-positive acetylcholinesterase-positive cells and fibers, and under fluorescence to locate rhodamine-labeled cell populations. Representative reaggregate profiles were then re-embedded for electron microscopic examination. In both types of reaggregates, either labeled hippocampal target or cerebellar non-target cells segregated from the septal cells so that areas containing each of the respective cell populations could be studied. In sections of septal-hippocampal reaggregates from 15-day cultures, 571 out of 665 (85%) cholinergic neurons examined were intact, whereas 15% of the cells showed some ultrastructural features of degeneration. Similarly, at day 21, 297 out of 335 (88%) of the cholinergic neurons were intact. In sections of septal-cerebellar reaggregates from 15-day cultures, 473 out of 572 (83%) cholinergic neurons were intact. By day 21 of culture, however, only 15 out of 110 (14%) cholinergic neurons examined were intact from the septal-cerebellar reaggregates. In areas of septal-hippocampal reaggregates occupied by rhodamine-labeled hippocampal cells, profiles of acetylcholinesterase-labeled axons were identified, and synaptic specializations were observed between cholinergic terminals and dendrites as well as somata of hippocampal target cells. In contrast, areas of septal-cerebellar reaggregates occupied by rhodamine-labeled cerebellar cells were devoid of cholinergic fibers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
