     "AB": "Effects on monoaminergic and cholinergic transmitter systems as well as neurotrophins were characterized in developing Sprague-Dawley rats directly exposed to 5 ppm cadmium in the drinking water or indirectly via exposed dams. Cadmium was given to dams during the lactation period, from parturition to postnatal day 17, and/or to the offspring until postnatal day 42. Cresyl violet staining and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry did not reveal any obvious neuropathology after cadmium exposure. Following high-power microwave fixation, concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh) and monoamines were determined in cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus using HPLC with electro-chemical detection. ACh, dopamine, and noradrenaline levels were not significantly affected after the different cadmium exposures. Cortical levels of serotonin were significantly reduced in rats exposed to cadmium during lactation as well as in rats exposed to cadmium during both lactation and postweaning. A major decrease in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid was found in cortex and hippocampus in rats exposed to cadmium during lactation. The regional characteristics of cadmium toxicity as reflected in changes of neurotrophins were studied using in situ hybridization histochemistry with oligonucleotide probes and phosphoimaging evaluation. No significant changes in the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3, and the high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor of BDNF, trkB, were detected. The present results demonstrate that exposure to levels of cadmium as low as 5 ppm in the drinking water leads to neurochemical disturbances of the serotonergic system in the offspring during the lactational period.",
