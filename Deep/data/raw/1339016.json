     "AB": "Rapid progress has been made towards understanding the synaptic physiology of excitatory amino acid transmission in the hippocampus. by comparison, the function of opioid peptides localized to some of the same pathways which use glutamate for fast excitation is poorly understood. Here I consider new evidence specifically implicating opioid peptides in long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation of pathways which combine glutamate and opioid neurotransmission. This form of LTP is unique in that it depends on activation of opioid receptors, and unlike many excitatory systems in brain, it does not require activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptor. Thus one of the main functions of opioids in the hippocampus may be to regulate activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength and neuronal excitability. At another level, \"opioid\" LTP may provide basic insights into peptidergic transmission and its functional interactions with classical neurotransmitters in the brain.",
