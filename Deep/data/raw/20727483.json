     "AB": "Febrile status epilepticus occurs in up to 5% of all cases of febrile seizures and has been linked to the development of focal epilepsy. This article reviews the clinical characteristics and treatment issues of febrile status. Controversy exists regarding the relationship of febrile status epilepticus to the subsequent development of epilepsy. This subject is discussed by first reviewing the clinical research literature and then highlighting the basic science research regarding this controversial question. The current literature appears to support a role for febrile status in the development of focal epilepsy but is clearly neither necessary nor sufficient in the focal epileptogenisis process. Multiple insults are likely necessary for a child with febrile status epilepticus to develop epilepsy later in life.",
