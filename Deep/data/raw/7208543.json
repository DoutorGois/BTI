     "AB": "The intraperitoneal or intraventricular application of L-fucose (100 mg/kg or 75 microgram, respectively) prior to training in shuttle box avoidance as well as in shock-motivated brightness discrimination in rats significantly improved the retention of learned behavior 24 hr later. The application of D-fucose was without influence on retention. In naive animals, intraventricularly applied L-fucose (75-200 microgram) caused an increase in the rate of protein synthesis in the hippocampus, resulting in a significant increase in total proteins of this brain structure, mainly attributed to the Tris-insoluble protein fractions. The results are discussed in terms of an activation of glycoprotein formation by increasing supply with L-fucose.",
