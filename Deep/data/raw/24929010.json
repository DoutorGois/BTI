     "AB": "Sex hormones are known to help maintaining the cognitive ability in male and female rats. Hypogonadism results in the reduction of the dendritic spines of central neurons which is believed to undermine memory and cognition and cause fatigue and poor concentration. In our previous studies, we have reported age-related regression in dendrite arbors along with loss of dendritic spines in the primary somatosensory cortical neurons in female rats. Furthermore, castration caused a reduction of dendritic spines in adult male rats. In light of this, it was surmised that dendritic structures might change in normal aging male rats with advancing age. Recently, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) has been reported to have memory-enhancing properties in aged rodents. In this study, normal aging male rats, with a reduced plasma testosterone level of 75-80%, were used to explore the changes in behavioral performance of neuronal dendritic arbor and spine density. Aging rats performed poorer in spatial learning memory (Morris water maze). Concomitantly, these rats showed regressed dendritic arbors and spine loss on the primary somatosensory cortical and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Exogenous DHEAS and testosterone treatment reversed the behavioral deficits and partially restored the spine loss of cortical neurons in aging male rats but had no effects on the dendritic arbor shrinkage of the affected neurons. It is concluded therefore that DHEAS, has the efficacy as testosterone, and that it can exert its effects on the central neuron level to effectively ameliorate aging symptoms.",
