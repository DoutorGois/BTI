     "AB": "In this study, we investigated age-related changes in glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) immunoreactivity and its protein levels in the gerbil hippocampus during normal aging. In the postnatal month 3 (PM 3) group, GLP-1R immunoreaction was well observed in neurons, especially pyramidal and non-pyramidal cells in the hippocampus proper, and granule and polymorphic cells in the dentate gyrus. In the hippocampus proper, GLP-1R immunoreactivity in neurons was maintained until PM 24. In the dentate gyrus, however, GLP-1R immunoreactivity in granule cells, not polymorphic cells, was hardly detected from PM 6. Western blot analysis also showed that age-dependent change patterns in GLP-1R protein levels in the gerbil hippocampus were similar to the immunohistochemical changes. These results indicate that GLP-1R immunoreactivity was markedly decreased in dentate granule cells from PM 6, showing that GLP-1R immunoreactivity and its protein levels were decreased in the adult and aged gerbil hippocampus.",
