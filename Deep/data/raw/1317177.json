     "AB": "We performed experiments to investigate subtypes of opioid receptors in the brain involved in the effect of acute (45 min) pulsed microwave exposure (2,450-MHz, 2-microseconds pulses, 500 pps, average power density 1 mW/cm2, peak-power density, 1 W/cm2, average whole body SAR 0.6 W/kg) on cholinergic activity in the rat brain. Rats were pretreated by microinjection of specific antagonists of mu, delta, and kappa opioid-receptors into the lateral cerebroventricle before exposure to microwaves. The data showed that all three subtypes of opioid receptors are involved in the microwave-induced decrease in cholinergic activity in the hippocampus. However, the microwave-induced decrease in cholinergic activity in the frontal cortex was not significantly affected by any of the drug treatments, confirming our previous conclusion that the effect of microwaves on the frontal cortex is not mediated by endogenous opioids.",
