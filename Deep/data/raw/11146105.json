     "AB": "Histochemical analyses of type II brain 4.1/4.1B/KIAA0987, a member of the protein 4.1 family, were carried out in rat brain. In situ hybridization (ISH) showed that type II brain 4.1 mRNA is expressed in a variety of neuronal cells. In particular, type II brain 4.1 mRNA was actively transcribed in the cells of the mesencephalon and the brainstem, which have large myelinated nerve fibers. Expression of type II brain 4.1 mRNA was not observed at least in glial cells distributed in nerve fiber tracts. In immunohistochemical studies using anti-type II brain 4.1-specific antibody, the major immunosignals appeared as brilliant pairs of dots along nerve fibers. Such immunosignals were detected throughout the brain, but were highly concentrated in nerve fiber tracts. These data suggested that type II brain 4.1 is predominantly localized to neuronal paranodes. Detailed analysis concentrating on the nodal region indicated that type II brain 4.1 is present at the paranodal membrane but not in the axoplasm. Weaker type II brain 4.1-specific immunosignals were observed along the internodal membrane of myelinated axons and in the cytoplasm of some neuronal cells. Finally, comparative immunohistochemical studies using antibodies against the other three protein 4.1 family members, type I brain 4.1/4.1N/KIAA0338, erythroid type 4.1 (4.1R) and 4.1G, demonstrated that each of these proteins is distributed in a unique pattern in the cerebellum. Our results are the first to show that type II brain 4.1 is the only member of the protein 4.1 family localized to neuronal paranodes.",
