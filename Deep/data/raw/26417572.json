     "AB": "We present results from a novel comparative approach to the study of mechanisms of psychiatric disease. Previous work examined neural activity patterns in the hippocampus of a freely behaving mouse model associated with schizophrenia, the calcineurin knockout mouse. Here we examined a genetically distinct mouse that exhibits a similar set of behavioral phenotypes associated with schizophrenia, a transgenic model expressing a putative dominant-negative DISC1 (DN-DISC1). Strikingly, the principal finding of the earlier work is replicated in the DN-DISC1 mice, that is, a selective increase in the numbers of sharp-wave ripple events in the local hippocampal LFP, while at the same time other LFP patterns such as theta and gamma are unaffected. Sharp-wave ripples are thought to arise from hippocampal circuits, and reflect the coordinated activity of the principal excitatory cells of the hippocampus, in specific patterns that represent reactivated memories of previous experiences and imagined future experiences that predict behavior. These findings suggest that multiple genetic alterations could converge on distinct patterns of aberrant neurophysiological function to give rise to common behavioral phenotypes in psychiatric disease.",
