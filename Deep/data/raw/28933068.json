     "AB": "Functional neuroimaging is beginning to yield valuable insights into the neurobiological underpinnings of the effects of obesity on neural circuits. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies have been used to identify aberrant activation patterns in regions implicated in reward (e.g., striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, insula), emotion and memory (e.g., amygdala, hippocampus), sensory and motor processing (e.g., insula, precentral gyrus), and cognitive control and attention (e.g., prefrontal cortex, cingulate) in obese individuals. Although a great amount of research using these techniques has already unveiled the influence of different neural response patterns on obesogenic behaviors, in this chapter we will, otherwise, try to highlight the effects of obesity on specific neuronal circuits and discuss recent developments in fMRI-based neurofeedback approaches as an alternative in obesity treatment.",
