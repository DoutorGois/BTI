     "AB": "Adult rats received intraseptal injections of 192 IgG-saporin and intrahippocampal grafts of septal cells. Between 6 and 10 months later, we assessed baseline and electrically-evoked release of tritium in hippocampal slices preloaded with [(3)H]choline, and the uptake of [(3)H]choline, [(3)H]noradrenaline and [(3)H]serotonin by hippocampal synaptosomes. The lesions reduced the accumulation of [(3)H]choline by approximately 40%, the evoked release of [(3)H]acetylcholine by approximately 90%, and the uptake of [(3)H]choline by synaptosomes by 90% in the dorsal hippocampus, but increased the relative baseline release of [(3)H]choline by +43%, and the synaptosomal uptake of [(3)H]noradrenaline (66%) and [(3)H]serotonin (58%) in the ventral hippocampus. The increased noradrenaline uptake may account for sympathetic ingrowth. Although the grafts of fetal septal neurons produced modest cholinergic effects, these effects were positive and significant.",
