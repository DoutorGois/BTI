     "AB": "Mutations of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a protein and lipid phosphatase, have been associated with gliomas, macrocephaly, and mental deficiencies. We have assessed PTEN's role in the nervous system and find that PTEN is expressed in mouse brain late in development, starting at approximately postnatal day 0. In adult brain, PTEN is preferentially expressed in neurons and is especially evident in Purkinje neurons, olfactory mitral neurons, and large pyramidal neurons. To analyze the function of PTEN in neuronal differentiation, we used two well established model systems-pheochromocytoma cells and cultured CNS stem cells. PTEN is expressed during neurotrophin-induced differentiation and is detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Suppression of PTEN levels with antisense oligonucleotides does not block initiation of neuronal differentiation. Instead, PTEN antisense leads to death of the resulting, immature neurons, probably during neurite extension. In contrast, PTEN is not required for astrocytic differentiation. These observations indicate that PTEN acts at multiple sites in the cell, regulating the transition of differentiating neuroblasts to postmitotic neurons.",
