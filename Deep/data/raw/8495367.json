     "AB": "We have studied amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression in rat brain following transient global ischemia. Ischemic damage 24 h after 30 min of four-vessel occlusion (4VO) was limited to the caudate nucleus; hippocampal pyramidal neurons appeared histologically normal by light microscopy. Consistent with ongoing neurodegeneration in the caudate nucleus, microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) levels assessed by immunoblots were significantly reduced in homogenates of caudate nucleus after 4VO. MAP-2 levels In the hippocampus were comparable to control values. In contrast, full length APP levels in both the caudate nucleus and hippocampal homogenates were significantly decreased following 4VO despite normal hippocampal morphology at 24 h. These findings suggest that decrements in full length APP precede overt neuronal damage and may play a role in the subsequent delayed neurodegeneration in the hippocampus.",
