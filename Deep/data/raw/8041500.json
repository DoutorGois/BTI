     "AB": "We investigated the effects of a representative anti-epileptic or anti-psychotic drug, carbamazepine (CBZ), on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the perforant path-dentate gyrus pathway in 15 chronically prepared rabbits. Pharmacokinetically injected low-dose CBZ, which produced steady serum levels of 2.2-3.3 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.D. 2.85 +/- 0.40), variably affected the induction of LTP, blocking it or showing almost no effect. The high-dose CBZ, which produced steady serum levels of 6.5-8.6 micrograms/ml (8.01 +/- 0.87), always blocked the induction of LTP. These results indicate that CBZ dose-dependently blocks the induction of LTP. The possible mechanisms underlying this blockade are discussed, especially in association with the possible inhibitory action of CBZ on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.",
