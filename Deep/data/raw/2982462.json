     "AB": "Dopamine (DA) application to guinea pig hippocampal CA1 neurons in vitro causes hyperpolarization of the resting potential, increase in conductance, and increase in amplitude and duration of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP). Since these changes could influence repetitive firing, we performed experiments to determine whether DA-induced effects would suppress epileptogenesis in the hippocampus. Epileptiform bursts were induced by adding penicillin (3.4 mM) to the perfusion medium. Focal application of DA (40-160 microns) onto CA1 cells (n = 15) produced a hyperpolarization averaging 4.5 mV beginning in 5-20 s and lasting up to 3 min. DA also caused an increase in the amplitude and duration of slow AHPs. The frequency of spontaneous epileptiform events however was not affected. CA3 neurons (n = 6) responded to DA application with an initial 1-3 mV depolarization beginning within 5-30 s and lasting 1-2 min. In 3 cases a small hyperpolarization lasting several minutes subsequently developed. AHP duration increased 70% and amplitude increased 35% (n = 4). Along with these membrane changes the frequency of epileptiform bursting in CA3 cells slowed for 1-3 min. We added DA (10-80 microM) to the perfusion medium to see whether a significant decrease in epileptiform burst frequency might occur in the follower CA1 region if greater numbers of pacemaker CA2 and CA3 cells were exposed to DA. Spontaneous CA1 bursting was reversibly slowed, the interburst interval became variable and increased from a mean of 4 to a mean of 5-7 s (n = 6). These results suggest that DA may play a role in decreasing the incidence or frequency of epileptogenic discharges in vivo.",
