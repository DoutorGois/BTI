     "AB": "Resveratrol has also been approved for use in enhancing plant disease resistance and reducing pesticide use. A number of studies have shown that the disease resistance of crops treated with resveratrol is markedly improved. The aim of the present study was to examine the protective effect of resveratrol against alcoholinduced neurodegeneration occurred and its association with AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK)/sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/p38 in rats and humans. ELISA, caspase3 activity and western blot analyses were employed in the present study. SpragueDawley rats and human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells were treated with alcohol to establish the alcoholinduced model. Resveratrol protected against alcoholinduced neuron damage in the hippocampus of the rats. Treatment with resveratrol also inhibited the alcoholinduced inflammatory response, oxidative stress, caspase3 activities and Bcell lymphoma (Bcl2)associated X protein/Bcl2 in the alcoholinduced rat. Resveratrol also reduced the upregulated protein expression of AMPK and SIRT1, preventing the proapoptotic alcoholinduced protein expression of p38 in the rats exposed to alcohol. The downregulation of AMPK suppressed the expression of SIRT1 and activated the expression of p38 in the SHSY5Y cell model. Taken together, the data obtained suggested that resveratrol protected against alcoholinduced neurodegeneration via the AMPK/SIRT1/p38 pathway in rats and humans.",
