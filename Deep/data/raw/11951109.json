     "AB": "During the establishment of learning and memory of adult rats with active avoidance reaction expression of nov gene, nov mRNA positive neurons and NOV protein immunoreactive neurons were found in hippocampus, cingulate cortex, globus pallidus, caudate putamen and hypothalamus. The strongest positive reaction of NOV protein was observed in high ability group of learning and memory (HALM). Basic expression was found in pseudoconditioning (PC) group. The expression of NOV protein was higher in low ability group of learning and memory (LALM) than in PC group. No significant difference was detected in nov mRNA positive reaction between the three groups. The results indicate that nov gene may play an important role in learning and memory of adult rats. This regulation occurs at the level of NOV protein translation.",
