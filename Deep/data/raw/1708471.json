     "AB": "Immunohistochemical techniques have been used to assess the distribution of phosphotyrosine-containing compartments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Elevated levels of phosphotyrosine are apparent in the somatodendritic compartment of tangle-bearing neurons, in the neuritic plaque (NP) and in dystrophic neurites coursing through the neuropil. The only neuronal staining observed in non-AD tissue is in developing neurites. This suggests that some neuronal elements involved in AD pathology may be recapitulating a developmental profile or, alternately, that elevated phosphotyrosine levels may reflect a role for tyrosine kinase/phosphatase systems in the degeneration process directly. Cells in the neuritic plaque which strongly resemble microglia also contain elevated levels of phosphotyrosine compared to non-activated ramified microglia in the same tissue section. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation systems may be involved in the response of microglia to degeneration in AD pathology. Implications of these results are discussed.",
