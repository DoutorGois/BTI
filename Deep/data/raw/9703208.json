     "AB": "The effects of the glutamate transporter inhibitor, trans-PDC, on extracellular amino acids, were investigated in the frontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum of rats using in vivo microdialysis. Trans-PDC infusion (0.1, 1, 10 mM) dose-dependently increased Glu and Asp levels, and these increases in the cerebellum were smaller than those in other brain regions. A small but significant dose-dependent increase was observed for Gly and Tau. However, high extracellular Glu induced by trans-PDC was not sufficient to increase extracellular DA in the striatum and frontal cortex.",
