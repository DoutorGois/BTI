     "AB": "We show that hypercholesterolemia contributes to oxidative stress injury progression in brain and simvastatin counteracts the cholesterol-induced peroxidation injury in rabbit hippocampus, and we demonstrate for the first time that the simvastatin is a critical role in brain protection and identify HO-1 and other related antioxidant enzymes as molecular target for active redox compounds. Second, our experiments have pointed out an association between statin treatment and a decrease in the risk of having peroxidation damage of brain. The balance effects of simvastatin to ROS and antioxidants enzymes network are most probably due to improved SOD functional activity, increase in GSH-Px, increase in HO-1 expression, and decrease of MDA generation.",
