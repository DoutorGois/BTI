     "AB": "Separate and combined effects of prenatal and postnatal exposure to ethanol on activity, emotionality, learning, and hippocampal neuroanatomy were examined in infant rats. Neonatal rats from mothers that were fed either a liquid ethanol (E) or control (C) diet on Gestational Days (G) 1-21 were artificially reared during Postnatal Days (P) 4-12 on either 3% ethanol (E) or isocaloric maltose/dextrin (C) in a milk formula. Pups in these treatment groups (EE, EC, CE, and CC) were tested for activity and emotionally in an open field on P19, for acquisition and extinction of an appetitive, straight runaway task on P20-P21, and for the effects of ethanol treatments on alterations in hippocampal neuroanatomy on P21. Differences in activity and emotionally were slight. Ethanol affected both the partial reinforcement acquisition effect and the partial reinforcement extinction effect. Hippocampal cell density (compared with Group CC) showed a 12% reduction in CA1 pyramidal cells and an 11% reduction in mature granule cells in Groups EC and EE; the CA4 area (compared with Group CC) was significantly larger after postnatal exposure (Groups CE and EE). Significant positive correlations were found between rate of extinction after partial reinforcement (PRF) training and CA1 pyramidal cell density in Groups CC and CE. A significant negative correlation was found between extinction rate after PRF training and CA4 area in Group EE.",
