     "AB": "Recent studies have revealed that a heterogeneous population of mRNAs is present in neuronal dendrites (including mRNAs that encode proteins involved in intracellular signaling), that different types of neurons have different assortments of dendritic mRNAs, and that the levels of some dendritic mRNAs are up-regulated by activity. These findings reinforce and extend the hypothesis that the localization of mRNA in dendrites provides a means of synthesizing proteins locally that are important for synaptic function.",
