     "AB": "Bi-hippocampal microinjection treatment (1 microg per side, twice a day for 5 days) with an antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to the rat kappa-opioid receptor, caused hypertension in normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats and increased the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Systolic blood pressure in WKY rats increased from 121+/-4 to 153+/-6 mm Hg, and in SHR systolic blood pressure increased from 153+/-4 to 183+/-5 mm Hg. Similar results were observed with mean blood pressure, however, there were no changes in heart rate. No significant responses were seen with either vehicle or missense injections. Radioligand binding studies indicated that there was a significant decrease in apparent kappa-opioid receptor density due to antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treatment. The results are in accord with our earlier suggestions that the kappa-opioid system in the hippocampus may have a role in the neural control of blood pressure.",
