     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Recently amygdala enlargement has been reported in patients with schizophrenia like psychosis of epilepsy. The effect of antipsychotic medication on amygdala structure has not been investigated so far. There is theoretical evidence to support the assumption that dopaminergic neurotransmission might affect neuronal plasticity. METHODS: In order to analyze the influence of chronic antidopaminergic medication on amygdala structure we compared amygdala volumes in patients with schizophrenia like psychosis of epilepsy (POE) treated with neuroleptic medication (n = 11) to patients with POE not treated with such medication (n = 15), patients with epilepsy alone (n = 24) and healthy control subjects (n = 20). RESULTS: Analyzing our data with a factorial ANOVA approach, we found a significant effect of the factor medication in that patients treated with antipsychotic medication displayed a \"normalization\" of the increased amygdala volumes observed in the untreated patient group. CONCLUSION: This observation supports the assumption that antidopaminergic medication might affect the amygdala structure.",
