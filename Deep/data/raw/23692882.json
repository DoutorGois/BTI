     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: In the present study, the effect of stimulation of the Po-shen and Shen-hun scalp-acupuncture bands on tissue amino acid concentrations in several brain regions in awake and pentobarbital-sedated immature rats was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats (aged 15 days) were organized in four groups of at least eight animals: control groups received saline solution 0.9% or sodium pentobarbital at 30mg/kg dosage via intraperitoneal. Experimental groups received saline solution or sodium pentobarbital plus stimulation in Po-shen and Shen-hun scalp-acupuncture bands for one continuous hour during 10 sessions by using scalp-acupuncture. RESULTS: As compared to rats receiving saline solution, scalp-acupuncture produced significant changes in amino acid concentrations, depending on the analyzed region, as follows: in inhibitory amino acids, a GABA increase was observed in amygdala and hippocampus (491 and 184%, respectively), but a decrease in the substantia nigra (80%); glycine showed decrease in all the analyzed regions, except for an increase in brainstem(78%); glutamine presented an increase in hippocampus and cortex (42 and 149%, respectively). In the case of excitatory amino acids, glutamate decreased in all the analyzed regions; whereas aspartate decreased in substantia nigra and brainstem (77.08 and 35%, correspondingly) but increased in hippocampus and cortex (32 and 54%, respectively). The combined treatment of scalp-acupuncture and a GABAergic depressant drug like pentobarbital resulted in almost all changes induced in amino acids for scalp-acupuncture alone being significantly reverted. CONCLUSION: Stimulation of the Po-shen and Shen-hun scalp-acupuncture bands by using scalp-acupuncture alone might produce depressant activity by changes in amino acids, but the combination with a GABAergic tranquilizer like sodium pentobarbital can interfere with this response.",
