     "AB": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by cerebral accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta), which are proteolytically derived from beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP). betaAPP metabolism is highly regulated via various signal transduction systems, e.g., several serine/threonine kinases and phosphatases. Several growth factors known to act via receptor tyrosine kinases also have been demonstrated to regulate sbetaAPP secretion. Among these receptors, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors are highly expressed in brain, especially in hippocampus and cortex. Emerging evidence indicates that insulin has important functions in brain regions involved in learning and memory. Here we present evidence that insulin significantly reduces intracellular accumulation of Abeta and that it does so by accelerating betaAPP/Abeta trafficking from the trans-Golgi network, a major cellular site for Abeta generation, to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, insulin increases the extracellular level of Abeta both by promoting its secretion and by inhibiting its degradation via insulin-degrading enzyme. The action of insulin on betaAPP metabolism is mediated via a receptor tyrosine kinase/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase pathway. The results suggest cell biological and signal transduction mechanisms by which insulin modulates betaAPP and Abeta trafficking in neuronal cultures.",
