     "AB": "Cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) is not only related to inflammation but also plays critical roles in brain development and synaptic signaling. In the present study, we investigated age-related changes in COX-2 immunoreactivity and protein levels in the gerbil hippocampus. In the hippocampal CA1 region (CA1) and dentate gyrus (DG), weak COX-2 immunoreactivity was observed at postnatal month 1 (PM 1), and COX-2 immunoreactivity was markedly increased at PM 18 and 24. In the CA2/3, COX-2 immunoreactivity was strong at PM 1. COX-2 immunoreactivities in the PM 3, 6 and 12 groups were decreased compared to that in the PM 1 group, and it was increased at PM 18 and 24. In addition, age-related changes in COX-2 levels were similar with immunohistochemical results in the CA2/3. These results suggest that COX-2 immunoreactivity and levels were high in the hippocampus of aged gerbils.",
