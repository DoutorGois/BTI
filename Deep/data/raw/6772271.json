     "AB": "Iontophoretic deposit of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the hypophysial neural lobe (NL) of the toad labeled neurons in the classical neurosecretory preoptic magnocellular nucleus. Further, a number of labeled neurons appeared in the whole extension of the periventricular and medial preoptic nuclei. The latter were continuous dorsally with two other labeled areas known as the bed nucleus of the hippocampal commissure (which appears to be homologous to the subfornical organ in mammals) and the ventromedial thalamic area of Frontera. The possible functional role of many of these afferents to the neural lobe is unknown because all types of neurons were labeled in the projecting zones and, in addition, many are outside of the generally recognized neurosecretory groups.",
