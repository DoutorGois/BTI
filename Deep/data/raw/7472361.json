     "AB": "1. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) were compared in young and aged rats in CA1 area of the rat hippocampus, with the use of the in vitro intracellular recording technique. D-2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) were used to suppress synaptic potentials mediated by the excitatory amino acids. 2. Under these conditions, stimulation of the stratum radiatum elicited a monosynaptic fast GABAA (fIPSP) and a slow GABAB (sIPSP)-mediated IPSP. The fIPSP and the sIPSP were further isolated in the presence of the GABAB antagonist CGP 35348 or the GABAA antagonists bicuculline or picrotoxin. No age-related changes were observed in the amplitude and the duration of the fIPSP. In contrast, the amplitude (but not the duration) of the sIPSP was significantly reduced in the aged rat. 3. The postsynaptic hyperpolarization and increase in membrane conductance induced in pyramidal cells by bath application of the GABAB agonist baclofen were comparable in both groups of animals, indicating that the postsynaptic GABAB receptors are not altered in the aged rats. 4. Paired-pulse depression of IPSPs was used in young and aged rats to study possible alterations in GABA release or in presynaptic GABAB receptors that control GABA release. When fIPSPs were isolated by bath application of tetrahydro-9-aminoacridine (THA), no significant difference in the magnitude of the paired-pulse depression was observed between young and aged rats. A similar result was found with the paired-pulse depression of isolated sIPSPs in the presence of bicuculline or picrotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
