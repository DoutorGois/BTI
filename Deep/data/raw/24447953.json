     "AB": "We previously showed that inhibition of protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) improves brain perfusion 24 hours after asphyxial cardiac arrest (ACA) and confers neuroprotection in the cortex and CA1 region of the hippocampus 7 days after arrest. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the mechanism of action of PKCdelta-mediated hypoperfusion after ACA in the rat by using the two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) to observe cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) detecting regional CBF in the presence/absence of deltaV1-1 (specific PKCdelta inhibitor), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) substrate (L-arginine, L-arg) and inhibitor (N(omega)-Nitro-L-arginine, NLA), and nitric oxide (NO) donor (sodium nitroprusside, SNP). There was an increase in regional LDF and local (TPLSM) CBF in the presence of deltaV1-1+L-arg, but only an increase in regional CBF under deltaV1-1+SNP treatments. Systemic blood nitrite levels were measured 15 minutes and 24 hours after ACA. Nitrite levels were enhanced by pretreatment with deltaV1-1 30 minutes before ACA possibly attributable to enhanced endothelial NOS protein levels. Our results suggest that PKCdelta can modulate NO machinery in cerebral vasculature. Protein kinase C delta can depress endothelial NOS blunting CBF resulting in hypoperfusion, but can be reversed with deltaV1-1 improving brain perfusion, thus providing subsequent neuroprotection after ACA.",
