     "AB": "In this study, a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) based on the P300 oddball paradigm has been developed for spatial navigation control in virtual environments. Functionality and efficacy of the system were analyzed with results from nine healthy volunteers. Each participant was asked to gaze at an individual target in a 3x3 P300 matrix containing different symbolic navigational icons while EEG signals were collected. Resulting ERPs were processed online and classification commands were executed to control spatial movements within the MazeSuite virtual environment and presented to the user online during an experiment. Subjects demonstrated on average, approximately 89% online accuracy for simple mazes and approximately 82% online accuracy in longer more complex mazes. Results suggest that this BCI setup enables guided free-form navigation in virtual 3D environments.",
