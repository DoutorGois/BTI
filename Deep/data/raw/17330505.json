     "AB": "We investigated the effects of dietary supplementation of zinc (Zn) with or without vitamin A (Vit. A), to elucidate any cross activity between the two micronutrients, on memory and nerve growth factor (NGF) production in ddY male mice depleted for the two elements. After 3 mo-feeding with a Zn and Vit. A deficient (VAD) diet, mice were divided into three groups and replenished with normal Zn with VAD diet (NZ-VAD), high Zn with VAD diet (HZ-VAD) or normal Zn + normal Vit. A (NZ-NVA) for additional 2 mo. One more group was made and given the normal diet for the same period (Control group). Levels of NGF were measured from extracts of hippocampus, cerebellum and cortex at the end of the 3rd and 5th month. In addition, a radial arm maze task was performed at the end of the 5th month. The two Zn supplemented groups (NZ-VAD and HZ-VAD) tended to show high NGF concentration but memory was not improved. However, improved memory was observed in the NZ-NVA group. From these results we concluded that Zn may increase NGF; however, memory was improved only when Vit. A was sufficient.",
