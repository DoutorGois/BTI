Immediately after CR elaboration or the 20th session of its training, AChE activity in the motor and visual cortex and the hippocampus decreased, increasing again in 24 hours. Animals used as active control which received non-paired photic and electric stimuli, exhibited opposite changes of AChE activity.",
