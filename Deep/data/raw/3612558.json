     "AB": "The effect of the psychotropic drug minaprine on brain ischemia induced by a 5-min bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries in the mongolian gerbil was studied. Severe impairment of memory was apparent when the passive avoidance test was carried out 2 days after the bilaterally induced ischemia. When minaprine in a dose of 50 mg/kg was given p.o. 30 min before the 5-min occlusion, there was a significant improvement in the memory impairment. The amplitude of the hippocampal theta waves decreased and Nissl's degradation was apparent in the CA1 neurons in the hippocampus from 2 days after the 5-min occlusion. Changes in the hippocampal neurons were exacerbated with time. When minaprine in a dose of 50 mg/kg was given there was no decrease in the amplitude of hippocampal theta waves, and Nissl's degradation and the destruction and disappearance of the CA1 neurons diminished considerably. All these findings indicate that minaprine warrants further study for possible clinical prescription.",
