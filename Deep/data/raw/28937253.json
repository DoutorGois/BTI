     "AB": "Hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning (HBO-PC) has been proposed as a safe and practical approach for neuroprotection in ischemic stroke. However, it is not known whether HPO-PC can improve cognitive deficits induced by cerebral ischemia, and the mechanistic basis for any beneficial effects remains unclear. We addressed this in the present study using rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as an ischemic stroke model following HBO-PC. Cognitive function and expression of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy polypeptide (pNF-H) and doublecortin (DCX) in the hippocampus were evaluated 14 days after reperfusion and after short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of sirtuin1 (Sirt1). HBO-PC increased pNF-H and DCX expression and mitigated cognitive deficits in MCAO rats. However, these effects were abolished by Sirt1 knockdown. Our results suggest that HBO-PC can protect the brain from injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion and that Sirt1 is a potential molecular target for therapeutic approaches designed to minimize cognitive deficits caused by cerebral ischemia.",
