     "AB": "Recent studies have shown the co-existence of alpha-synuclein and phosphorylated tau (pTau) in several neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report two autopsy cases of combined multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In both cases, abundant alpha-synuclein-positive glial and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were found in the brainstem, amygdala and hippocampal formation. pTau-positive neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) were widely distributed in case 1 (Braak stage VI) and moderate in case 2 (Braak stage III). Although alpha-synuclein and pTau pathology co-occurred in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, only a few neurons showed co-existence of these two proteins. Immunoreactivity for p62, a ubiquitin proteasome system related protein, was found in the majority of NFTs, but in only a small proportion of neuronal alpha-synuclein inclusions. In addition, UBB+1, a mutant form of ubiquitin and a marker for proteasomal dysfunction, was present in the majority of NFTs, whereas co-existence of alpha-synuclein and UBB+1 was found in only a few neurons. These findings indicate that alpha-synuclein and phosphorylated tau co-occur in certain brain regions in cases of combined MSA and AD and that the proteasomal pathways differ between alpha-synuclein- and pTau-bearing neurons.",
