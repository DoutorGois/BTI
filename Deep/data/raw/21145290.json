     "AB": "One of the most important components of presurgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy is structural imaging, predominantly using magnetic resonance imaging. This study is now part of the basic assessment of patients with epilepsy and is as important as the electroencephalogram. Epilepsy protocol magnetic resonance imaging studies must be part of the overall assessment of the patient. To understand the basis of the epileptic disorder, interpretation of these investigations relies on knowledge of the clinical details and features of the seizures, the functional abnormality in the brain as shown on the electroencephalogram, and structural assessment of the brain with a magnetic resonance imaging study optimized for epilepsy. This review considers the essential elements of this issue and gives a broad overview of what imaging options are available for the investigation of the patient with epilepsy from the perspective of the practicing epileptologist.",
