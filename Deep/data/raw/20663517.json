     "AB": "Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) is a group of chronic disorders characterized by prominent neuronal loss and gliosis in the hippocampus and amygdala. Newly published data indicate that it may be a progressive disease, but the mechanism underlying the progressive nature remains unknown. Recently, substantial evidence for an inflammatory mechanism in MTLE has been documented. We are therefore presenting a review of literature concerning the effects of uncontrolled inflammation on the disease progression of MTLE-HS. We found that increasing amounts of evidence support the association between uncontrolled inflammation and progression of the disease. Uncontrolled inflammatory processes may be a main mechanism underlying the self-propagating cycle of uncontrolled inflammation, blood-brain barrier damage, and seizures that drive the progressive nature. Thus it is important to unravel the principles of communication between the different factors in this cycle. The dynamic modulation of inflammatory processes aimed at preventing or interrupting this cycle has the potential to emerge as a novel therapeutic strategy. This line of therapy might offer new perspectives on the pharmacologic treatment of seizures, and possibly on delaying disease progression or retarding epileptogenesis as well.",
