     "AB": "Following cholinergic denervation of the hippocampal formation, peripheral sympathetic nerves originating from the superior cervical ganglia grow into the hippocampus. As gender is known to alter the anatomy of hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth, we assessed the effect of this variable on the behavioral recovery following ingrowth. Adult male or female rats were trained on a standard version of a radial-8-arm maze task until they reached a specific learning criterion. Animals from each sex then underwent one of three surgical procedures: sham surgery, medial septal lesions plus superior cervical ganglionectomy, or medial septal lesion plus sham ganglionectomy. Reacquisition of the maze was then assessed. Prior to surgery, male animals acquired the task significantly faster than female animals. Following surgery male and female rats recovered overall performance at similar rates. However, marked group differences were observed. In males, the control group recovered faster than the group with medial septal lesion plus ganglionectomy, which recovered faster than the medial septal lesion group. In females, the control group recovered faster than the medial septal lesion group, which in turn recovered faster than the medial septal ganglionectomy group. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that gender can influence the behavioral effects of hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth. We believe that this is the first report in which gender has been shown to alter the behavioral effect of a neuronal reorganization.",
