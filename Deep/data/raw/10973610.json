In contrast, no significant potentiation was seen following the same tetanus in animals chronically exposed to 1000 ppm of lead acetate during development. Gender differences were observed in animals exposed to 500 ppm of lead. In females, LTP was significantly attenuated, while in males the LTP was identical to that of controls.",
