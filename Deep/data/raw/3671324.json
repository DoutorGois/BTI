     "AB": "Using several concentrations of eight anticonvulsant drugs in clinical use (carbamazepine, clonazepam, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ethosuximide, primidone, sodium valproate, and D,L-gamma-vinyl GABA), we studied their abilities in vitro to displace (35S)t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (35S-TBPS) from its binding site in a homogenate of rat brain. Thereafter ethosuximide (150 mg/kg), phenobarbital (30 mg/kg), clonazepam (0.3 mg/kg), or phenytoin (100 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into rats for 16-20 days; and the effect of drug administration on 35S-TBPS binding was studied in the cortex and hippocampus ex vivo. Phenobarbital (100 microM, P less than 0.001), ethosuximide (500 microM, P less than 0.001), and phenytoin (40 microM, P less than 0.001) decreased the specific 35S-TBPS binding in vitro by 10-16%. After drug administration of phenobarbital (concentration in plasma 168 microM), the number of binding sites decreased and the binding affinity (P less than 0.05) in the cortex increased. Other anticonvulsants did not modulate 35S-TBPS binding in vitro at the concentration analogous to therapeutic plasma levels or ex vivo at the dose used. These results suggest that the use of phenobarbital may modulate the TBPS binding site, but the role of the present findings in the anticonvulsant action of phenobarbital needs to be further studied.",
