     "AB": "15 patients aged 1-39 years with documented neurofibromatosis had MR examinations of the cerebrum within the scope of a basic diagnosis and therapy programme. Clinical examination did not lead to pathologic findings for 7 of the patients; 3 patients suffered from general developmental disabilities. A neurologico-psychiatric examination showed pathological findings in 5 patients. Signal-intense foci in proton density and T2-weighted MR images were found in the globus pallidus, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum and midbrain. In 2 patients, these foci could be found as well in T1-weighted images. Differentiation between gliosis areas and low grade astrocytomas was not possible in MR.",
