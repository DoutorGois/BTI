     "AB": "Epigenetic modification of DNA by methylation of the cytosine present in CG dinucleotides constitutes a key regulatory mechanism in the control of gene expression in neurological diseases. In this chapter, we describe an in-depth methodology of methylated DNA immunoprecipitation used in combination with tiling microarrays (MeDIP-chip) in order to analyze genome-wide gene promoter methylation in the hippocampus of mice following status epilepticus (prolonged seizure). While a specific mouse model and array format are described, the method can be applied to DNA from many tissues to analyze the methylation status of promoter regions across whole genomes, using a wide range of available array formats (both custom designed and commercially catalogued). We conclude the chapter with the description of bisulfite sequencing validation of MeDIP-chip results.",
