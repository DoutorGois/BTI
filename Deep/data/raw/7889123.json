     "AB": "In this study we describe a model of connectivity linking the different neurons in the CA3 and CA1 areas of the young male rat hippocampus. The anatomical and electrophysiological values of the parameters used in the model were selected from the available literature. Each type of synapse was characterized by its spatial location on the dendritic tree, its weight, its probability of activation, and the ionotropic receptors involved. We have shown that the degree of convergence and divergence of inputs is highly dependent upon the type of neuron and its spatial location. The different gradients of connectivity we describe support the lamellar hypothesis from a functional point of view, even if the anatomical patterns seem diffuse. The analysis of the proportion of common afferents to a class of neurons further confirmed this point. It is suggested that the circuitry creates local coherence in terms of processing of information by establishing restricted areas where information is preferentially treated. The functional consequences and limitations of these findings are also discussed. This model is the first step in the development of a network model of the hippocampus with realistic architecture.",
