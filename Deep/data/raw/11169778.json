     "AB": "Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were chronically treated with the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) until stable parkinsonism was reached. Two months later, monkeys were sacrificed and monoamine content was measured in different brain regions of the lesioned monkeys and of age-matched controls. 5-HT(1A) serotonin receptor density was measured in coronal sections labeled with [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT. As expected, dopamine was virtually nonexistent in the caudate nucleus and putamen of MPTP-treated monkeys. Serotonin levels were significantly reduced in different brain regions, particularly in the raphe nuclei. 5-HT(1A) receptor density of control animals was high in the hippocampus, notably in the CA1 field and also in the raphe nuclei, and much lower in the striatum, where 5-HT(1A) receptors showed a patchy distribution which corresponded to striosomes with poor calbindin immunostaining. 5-HT(1A) receptor density was reduced in hippocampal fields and in the raphe nuclei of parkinsonian monkeys. Conversely, in the severely lesioned striatal nuclei 5-HT(1A) receptor density was increased at caudal levels of the striatum, particularly in the putamen. The results tend to support the possibility of an increased synthesis of 5-HT(1A) receptors in brain regions with higher neuronal cell death. Upregulation of this 5-HT receptor subtype in the limbic compartment of the striatum may represent a compensatory event for the serotonergic dysfunction and associated mental disorders in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease.",
