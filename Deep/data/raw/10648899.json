     "AB": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a pleiotropic neuropeptide and its specific receptor (the PAC(1) receptor) is widely distributed in the rat brain. It has been reported that alternative splicing of the region encoding the third intracellular loop of the PAC(1) receptor generates six isoforms which are differentially coupled to signal transduction pathways, but the precise distribution and localization of these splice isoforms in the brain remain to be determined. Using the initial specific primer pairs which correspond to the 'hip' or 'hop' types of receptors for the solution-phase reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we demonstrated that the major splice variants of the PAC(1) receptor in various regions of the rat brain are the short splice isoform 'PAC(1)-R-s' which does not contain either the 'hip' or 'hop' cassette and the another splice isoform, 'PAC(1)-R-hop', which contains the 'hop' cassette. With an innovative molecular histochemical technique, in situ RT-PCR, we determined that these two splice isoforms are both intensely expressed in the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and neocortex, and many neurons in the nuclei of hypothalamus and thalamus as well as other regions. The initial mapping of the cell type-specific expression of these two splice variants of the PAC(1) receptor provides the basis for a better understanding of the functional significance of the PAC(1)-R and its ligand PACAP in various brain regions.",
