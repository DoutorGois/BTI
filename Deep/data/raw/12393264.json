     "AB": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) is involved in the development of the nervous system and neuronal process outgrowth, and it regulates several intracellular processes including cytoskeletal dynamics. Dysregulation of cdk5 has been implicated in many disorders of the nervous system. The activity of the kinase is regulated by binding of cdk5 activators (p35, p39, p67). We examined the phosphorylation of p35, and the role of phosphorylation in regulating the proteolysis of the p35 protein. By detecting changes in electrophoretic mobility, we observed that a significant proportion of p35 is phosphorylated in rat brain tissue. In cultured neurons, the phosphorylation was prevented by roscovitine, an inhibitor of cdk5 and some other cdks. The phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid induced p35 degradation in neuronal cultures which was sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. These latter results agree with some previous studies showing that phosphorylation regulates proteasomal degradation of p35. Treatment of brain homogenate with okadaic acid in the presence of ATP led to accumulation of p35 phosphorylated also by a kinase that was not inhibited by roscovitine. This implies that the effect of okadaic acid on p35 degradation could also be contributed by a non-cdk kinase. The calpain protease has been shown to cleave p35. Our results suggest that this process may also be modulated by p35 phosphorylation under some conditions. We conclude that p35 phosphorylation influences the proteasome-mediated degradation of p35 and calpain-mediated cleavage of p35 to p25.",
