     "AB": "The distributions of adenosine A1 receptors, as demonstrated by 3H-cyclohexyladenosine (3H-CHA) binding, and the adenosine-producing enzyme 5'-nucleotidase were examined in the hippocampal formation of the rat, mouse, gerbil, cat, hamster, rabbit, and guinea pig. The enzyme and binding sites were restricted to subregions and often individual layers of this structure. The distribution of 3H-CHA binding was consistent among the species with the strata radiatum and oriens of fields CA1 and CA3 exhibiting the highest levels of binding. A distinct band of 3H-CHA binding was observed in the stratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus; and in most species, this band was restricted to the inner one-third of the stratum moleculare (i.e., proximal to the stratum granulosum). The strata pyramidale, granulosum, and lucidum were in general only weakly positive for 3H-CHA binding. The binding to the stratum lacunosum/moleculare (or the distinct strata lacunosum and moleculare in the rabbit and cat) was moderate. In contrast to the relative consistency of the patterns of 3H-CHA binding in these species, 5'-nucleotidase exhibited wide variations in both the absolute amount of activity and its localization. In all species, the strata granulosum and pyramidale appeared devoid of 5'-nucleotidase activity. The only clear exception to this rule was the CA3 region of the cat where activity was seen between the cell bodies of stratum pyramidale. The strata radiatum and oriens of CA1 were strongly positive in the rat and hamster but only low to moderately stained in the other species examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
