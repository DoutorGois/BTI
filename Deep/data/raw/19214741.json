     "AB": "Regulated exocytosis of secretory vesicles is a fundamental process in neurotransmission and the release of hormones and growth factors. The F-actin-binding motor protein myosin Va was recently shown to be involved in exocytosis of peptide-containing large dense core vesicles of neuroendocrine cells. It has not previously been discussed whether it plays a similar role in neurons. We performed live-cell imaging of cultured hippocampal neurons to measure the exocytosis of large dense core vesicles containing fluorescently labelled neuropeptide Y. To address the role of myosin Va in this process, neurons were transfected with the dominant-negative tail domain of myosin Va (myosinVa-tail). Under control conditions, about 0.75% of the labelled large dense core vesicles underwent exocytosis during 5 min of stimulation. This value was doubled to 1.80% of the vesicles when myosinVa-tail was expressed. Depolymerization of F-actin using latrunculin B resulted in a similar increase in exocytosis in both control and myosinVa-tail expressing cells. Interestingly, the increase in exocytosis caused by myosinVa-tail expression was completely abolished in the presence of KN-62, an inhibitor of calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II. We suggest that myosinVa-tail causes the liberation of large dense core vesicles from the actin cytoskeleton, leading to an increase in exocytosis in the cultured hippocampal neurons.",
