     "AB": "Long-Evans rats received septal lesions or sham operations and were tested for performance in a radial arm maze, level of activity and water intake in order to test whether recovery of function was mediated by sprouting of peripheral sympathetic fibers. Animals receiving septal lesions displayed an initial deficit in radial arm maze performance followed by recovery. No critical changes occurred in activity level and no recovery was seen in water intake. Subsequent superior cervical ganglionectomies had no effect on recovery of radial arm maze performance. There was a significant relationship between behavioral recovery and the degree of hippocampal AChE depletion. It is concluded that recovery of radial arm maze performance is not mediated by sympathetic sprouting following septal lesions but might be mediated by residual septohippocampal fibers.",
