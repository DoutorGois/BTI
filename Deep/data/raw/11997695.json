     "AB": "One mechanism by which estrogen may modulate cognitive function is through potentiation of glutamate-mediated rises in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) with resultant effects on neuronal morphology and signaling. Since progesterone is a component of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), we sought to determine whether therapeutically relevant progestins attenuated or blocked estrogen potentiation of glutamate-induced [Ca2+]i rises. 17beta-estradiol and progesterone, alone or in combination, significantly potentiated the rise in [Ca2+]i. When co-administered, progesterone attenuated the estrogen response to the level seen with progesterone alone. In contrast, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) had no effect when administered alone and completely blocked the 17beta-estradiol-induced potentiation when co-administered. These results may have important implications for effective use of HRT to maintain cognitive function during menopause and aging.",
