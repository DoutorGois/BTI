     "AB": "Information on the consequences of perinatal asphyxia (PA) on brain morphology and function in the aging rat is missing although several groups have hypothesized that PA may be responsible for neurological and psychiatric deficits in the adult. We therefore decided to study the effects of PA on the central nervous system (CNS) in terms of morphology, immunohistochemistry, neurology and behavior in the aging animal. Hippocampus and cerebellum were evaluated morphologically by histological, immunohistochemical and magnetic resonance imaging and cerebellum also by stereological tests. Neurological function was tested by an observational test battery and rota rod test. Cognitive functions were examined by multiple-T-maze and the Morris water maze (MWM). Increased serotonin transporter (SERT) immunoreactivity in the CA2 region of the hippocampus and a significant difference in the escape latency, when the platform of the MWM was moved to a new location, were observed in asphyxiated rats. We showed that deteriorated cognitive functions accompanied by aberrant expression of hippocampal SERT and impaired relearning are long-term sequelae of perinatal asphyxia, a finding that may form the basis for understanding CNS pathology in the aging subject, animal or human.",
