     "AB": "We investigated the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat hippocampus. Rats were magnetically stimulated at a rate of 1000 pulses/day for 7 days by a round coil, in which the peak magnetic fields at the center of the coil were 0.75 and 1.00 T. LTP enhancement was observed only in the 0.75-T rTMS group, while no change was observed in the 1.00-T rTMS group. These results suggest that the effect of rTMS on LTP depends on the stimulus intensity.",
