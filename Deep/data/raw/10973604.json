     "AB": "Mounting evidence suggests that ethanol exerts effects on learning and memory by altering cellular activity in the hippocampus and related structures. However, little is actually known regarding ethanol's effects on hippocampal function in awake, freely-behaving animals. The present study examines the effects of ethanol on hippocampal place-cell and interneuron activity in freely-behaving rats. Signals from individual hippocampal neurons were isolated while subjects traversed a symmetric Y-maze for food reward. Following 15 min of baseline recording, subjects were injected with one of four doses of ethanol (0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 g/kg), and cellular activity was monitored for a 1-h time period. Following sufficient time for recovery (minimum of 3 h post injection), cellular activity was monitored for an additional 15-min period. Both 1.0 and 1.5 g/kg ethanol potently suppressed the firing of hippocampal place-cells without altering place-field locations. Ethanol did not significantly suppress out-of-field firing rates, leading to a decrease in spatial specificity (i.e. the ratio of in-field/out-of-field firing rates). Interneuron activity was not altered by 1.0 g/kg ethanol, but was occasionally suppressed by 1.5 g/kg ethanol. Results are interpreted in light of recent behavioral and electrophysiological studies examining the effects of ethanol on hippocampal function.",
