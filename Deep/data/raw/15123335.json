     "AB": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been suggested as a useful tool in early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Based on MRI-derived volumes, we studied the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (ERC) in 59 controls, 65 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 48 patients with AD. The controls and individuals with MCI were derived from population-based cohorts. Volumes of the hippocampus and ERC were significantly reduced in the following order: control > MCI > AD. Stepwise discriminant function analysis showed that the most efficient overall classification between controls and individuals with MCI subjects was achieved with ERC measurements (65.9%). However, the best overall classification between controls and AD patients (90.7%), and between individuals with MCI and AD patients (82.3%) was achieved with hippocampal volumes. Our results suggest that the ERC atrophy precedes hippocampal atrophy in AD. The ERC volume loss is dominant over the hippocampal volume loss in MCI, whereas more pronounced hippocampal volume loss appears in mild AD.",
