     "AB": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to morbidity in children, and boys are disproportionately represented. Cerebral autoregulation is impaired after TBI, contributing to poor outcome. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is often normalized by use of vasoactive agents to increase mean arterial pressure (MAP). In prior studies of 1- to 5-day-old newborn piglets, we observed that norepinephrine (NE) preferentially protected cerebral autoregulation and prevented hippocampal necrosis in females but not males after fluid percussion injury (FPI). The ERK isoform of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) produces hemodynamic impairment after FPI, but less is known about the role of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). We investigated whether NE protects autoregulation and limits histopathology after FPI in older juvenile (4-week-old) pigs and the role of ERK and IL-6 in that outcome by sex. Results show that NE significantly protects autoregulation and prevents reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in both male and female juvenile pigs after FPI; co-administration of the ERK antagonist U 0126 with NE fully protects both indices of outcome. Papaverine induced dilation was unchanged by FPI and NE. NE blunted ERK MAPK and IL-6 upregulation in both males and females after FPI. NE attenuated loss of neurons in CA1 and CA3 hippocampus of males and females after FPI. These data indicate that NE protects autoregulation and limits hippocampal neuronal cell necrosis via blockade of ERK and IL-6 after FPI in both male and female juvenile pigs. These data suggest that use of NE to improve outcome after TBI is both sex and age dependent.",
