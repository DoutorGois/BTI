     "AB": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat depression has been thoroughly investigated in recent years. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm was applied to male Sprague Dawley rats. Then rTMS was performed for 7 consecutive days, and the anti-depressive effects were evaluated by the sucrose preference test (SPT), the forced swimming test (FST), and the open-field test (OFT). Hippocampal cannabinoid type I receptor (CB1) expression was measured, and the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Bcl-2, and Bax and the number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells were also investigated. These parameters were also observed after the selective CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 was used as a blocking agent. The results showed that CUMS induced a significant decrease in sucrose preference, a significant increase in immobility time in the FST, and a significantly decreased horizontal distance in the OFT. In addition, reduced hippocampal CB1 receptor, BDNF, and Bcl-2/Bax protein expression levels in CUMS rats, as well as decreased cell proliferation were also observed in the dentate gyrus. Meanwhile, rTMS treatment up-regulated cell proliferation; elevated CB1 receptor, BDNF, and Bcl-2/Bax expression levels in the hippocampus; and ameliorated depressive-like behaviors. All of these beneficial effects were abolished by AM251. These results indicate that rTMS increases BDNF production and hippocampal cell proliferation to protect against CUMS-induced changes through its effect on CB1 receptors.",
