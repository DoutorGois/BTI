     "AB": "For cell-based biosensor applications, dissociated neurons have been cultured on planar microelectrode arrays (MEAs) to measure the network activity with substrate-embedded microelectrodes. There has been a need for a multi-well type platform to reduce the data collection time and increase the statistical power for data analysis. This study presents a novel method to convert a conventional MEA into a multi-well MEA with an array of micrometre-sized neuronal culture ('neuronal micro-circuit array'). An MEA was coated first with cell-adhesive layer (poly-D-lysine) which was subsequently patterned with a cell-repulsive layer (agarose hydrogel) to both pattern the cell adhesive region and isolate neuronal micro-circuits from each other. For a few weeks, primary hippocampal neurons were cultured on the agarose microwell MEA and the development of spontaneous electrical activities were characterized with extracellular action potentials. Using neurotransmission modulators, the simultaneous monitoring of drug responses from neuronal micro-circuit arrays was also demonstrated. The proposed approach will be powerful for neurobiological functional assay studies or neuron-based biosensor fields which require repeated trials to obtain a single data point due to biological variations.",
