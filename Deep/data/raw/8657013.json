     "AB": "The kinetics of human monoclonal antibody (anti-gB) to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) were investigated after intravenous injection of anti-gB into an HSV-1 encephalitis animal model. Immunohistochemical study revealed specific deposition of passively transferred anti-gB in the hippocampus and thalamus of the infected rat brain, and it bound to the same neurons in which HSV-1 antigen was positively stained. To examine the macroscopic distribution of anti-gB in the infected brain, we undertook an 125I-labeled anti-gB injection study, and the same distribution of 125I-labeled anti-gB deposition was observed by brain semimicroautoradiography as in the immunohistochemical study. These results suggest that anti-gB easily permeates the capillary wall and is deposited in the inflammatory site where HSV-1-specific antigen is detectable. The use of radioisotope-labeled anti-gB injection and external brain imaging could lead to a noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of HSV-1 antigen in cases of suspected HSV-1 encephalitis.",
