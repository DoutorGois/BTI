     "AB": "Acute stress impairs memory retrieval and facilitates the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampal CA1 region of the adult rodent brain. However, whether such alterations in synaptic plasticity cause the behavioral effects of stress is not known. Here, we report that two selective inhibitors of the induction or expression of stress-enabled, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent hippocampal LTD also block spatial memory retrieval impairments caused by acute stress. Additionally, we demonstrate that facilitating the induction of hippocampal LTD in vivo by blockade of glutamate transport mimics the behavioral effects of acute stress by impairing spatial memory retrieval. Thus, the present study demonstrates that hippocampal LTD is both necessary and sufficient to cause acute stress-induced impairment of spatial memory retrieval and provides a new perspective from which to consider the nature of cognitive deficits in disorders whose symptoms are aggravated by stress.",
