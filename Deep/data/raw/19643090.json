     "AB": "Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism and inactivation of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). EETs are produced by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism and tend to be anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory and protective against ischemic injury. Since the metabolism of EETs by sEH reduces or eliminates their bioactivity, inhibition of sEH has become a therapeutic strategy for hypertension and inflammation. sEH is found in nearly all tissues so the systemic application of inhibitors is likely to affect more than blood pressure and inflammation. In the central nervous system, EETs are thought to play a role in the regulation of local blood flow, protection from ischemic injury, inhibition of inflammation, the release of peptide hormones and modulation of fever. However, little is known about region- and cell-specific expression of sEH in the brain. In the mouse brain, expression of sEH was found widely in cortical and hippocampal astrocytes and also in a few specific neuron types in the cortex, cerebellum, and medulla. To assess the functional significance of neuronal sEH, we generated a transgenic mouse model, which over-expresses sEH specifically in neurons. Transgenic mice showed increased neuron labeling in cortex and hippocampus with little change in labeling of other brain regions. Despite a 3-fold increase in sEH activity in the brain, there was no change in arterial pressure. This data provides new information required for studying the central roles of the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway.",
