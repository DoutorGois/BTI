     "AB": "An extremely low-frequency magnetic field (50 Hz, 0.5 mT) was used to investigate its possible effect on the brain of adult male Wistar rats following a 7-day exposure. The control rats were sham-exposed. Superoxide dismutase activities and production of superoxide radicals, lipid peroxidation, and nitric oxide were examined in the frontal cortex, striatum, basal forebrain, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum. Significantly increased superoxide radical contents were registered in all the structures examined. Production of nitric oxide, which can oppose superoxide radical activities, was significantly increased in some structures: the frontal cortex, basal forebrain, hippocampus, and brainstem. Augmentation of lipid peroxydation was also observed, with significance only in the basal forebrain and frontal cortex, in spite of the significantly increased superoxide dismutase activities and nitric oxide production in the basal forebrain, and increased production of nitric oxide in the frontal cortex. The results obtained indicate that a 7-day exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic field can be harmful to the brain, especially to the basal forebrain and frontal cortex due to development of lipid peroxidation. Also, high production of superoxide anion in all regions may compromise nitric oxide signaling processes, due to nitric oxide consumption in the reaction with the superoxide radical.",
