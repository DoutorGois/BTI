     "AB": "Nowadays, more and more studies have focused on the physiological and pathological effect of nitric oxide (NO). In this study, we directly measured extracellular NO levels in the hippocampus of rats using NO probe. Simultaneously, the artery blood pressure was recorded. It was found that after the administration of N - nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), the NO signal came down and the artery blood pressure rose. This result is coincident with the theory that the decreasing release of nitric oxide in hippocampus results in vasoconstriction and an increase in artery blood pressure. Furthermore, the release of NO is quantitatively estimated. It shows that NO decreased in 4.5-6nM after the intravenous administration of L-NAME (4-6mg/ kg).",
