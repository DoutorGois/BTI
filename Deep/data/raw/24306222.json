     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia and cognitive impairment is usually characterized by neuritic amyloid plaques, cerebrovascular amyloidosis and neurofibrillary tangles. In order to find out the pathological protein expression, a quantitative proteome analysis of AD hippocampus, substantia nigra and cortex was performed and the extent of protein expression variation not only in contrast to age-matched controls but also among the understudied regions was analyzed. Expression alterations of 48 proteins were observed in each region along with significant co/contra regulation of malate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase B chain, aconitate hydratase, protein NipSnap homolog 2, actin cytoplasmic 1, creatine kinase U-type and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. These differentially expressed proteins are mainly involved in energy metabolism, cytoskeleton integration, apoptosis and several other potent cellular/molecular processes. Interaction association network analysis further confirms the close interacting relationship between the co/contra regulated differentially expressed proteins among all the three regions. Elucidation of co/contra regulation of differentially expressed proteins will be helpful to understand disease progression and functional alterations associated with AD.",
