     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Yangxue Qingnao Granule (YQG) on the expression of CD11b in CA1 region of hippocampus of vascular dementia rats, and to explore its regulation on microglias. METHODS: Totally 144 SD rats were randomly divided into the sham-operation group, the vascular dementia model group (model), and the YQG treated group (treated). The vascular dementia rat model was prepared by modified Pulsinelli's four-vessel occlusion. Rats in the sham-operation group and the model group were administered with normal saline -(at the daily dose of 10 mL/kg) by gastrogavage, while those in the treated group were administered with YQG (0.32 g/mL, at the daily dose of 10 mL/kg) by gastrogavage. All administration was performed once per day for 8 successive weeks. The expression of CD11b in CA1 region of hippocampus of vascular dementia rats was detected at week 1, 2, 4, and 8, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the sham-operation group, the expression of CD11b in CA1 region of hippocampus of vascular dementia rats were significantly enhanced in the model group at each time point (P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, the expression of CD11b in CA1 region of hippocampus of vascular dementia rats significantly decreased in the treated group at each time point (P < 0.01), especially at week 2. CONCLUSION: Obvious activation and proliferation of microglias could be seen in CA1 region of hippocampus of vascular dementia rats, and YQG could inhibit activation and proliferation of microglias.",
