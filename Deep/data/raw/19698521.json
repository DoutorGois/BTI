     "AB": "Memory loss is the most common early symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this study, we chose the hippocampi as regions of interest. The hippocampus, which is closely associated with memory processing, is known to be vulnerable to damage in the early stage of AD. We considered both inter-group (patients vs controls) and intra-group (right vs left hippocampus) comparisons. We examined seven patients meeting the DSM-III-R criteria of senile dementia and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS - ADRDA) criteria of probable AD, and II aged controls. This study focused on the measurement of phosphorus 31 ((31)P) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy metabolites in each hippocampus. We found significant differences in phosphorus metabolites for both intra-group comparison (pH shifted towards relative alkalosis in the left hippocampus of patients) and inter-group consideration (reduced phosphodiesters [Pde]and elevated gamma adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the right hippocampus, higher inorganic phosphate (pHi) in the left hippocampus for patients as compared to controls). We suggest energy failure and membrane functional breakdown in patients compared to aged controls.",
