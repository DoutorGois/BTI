     "AB": "Verbal recent memory disturbance was observed in a patient with a malignant glioma associated with left hippocampal atrophy. A 25 year-old male was admitted because of seizures. CT scan and MRI showed enhanced mass lesions in the left temporal lobe associated with ipsilateral hippocampal atrophy. Neurological examination disclosed right homonymous hemianopsia, word amnesia, alexia, agraphia and acalculia. Neuropsychological examination disclosed verbal recent memory disturbance, which consisted of impaired recall of the precisely memorized words after some interruption. Although hippocampal lesions are known to be often associated with cerebrovascular disease, hippocampal atrophy due to brain tumor is quite unusual. This case suggested that the left hippocampus is closely related to verbal recent memory. Hippocampal atrophy in this case conceivably derived from the decreased arterial flow due to perifocal edema or obstructive hydrocephalus.",
