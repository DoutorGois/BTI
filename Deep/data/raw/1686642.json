     "AB": "In order to examine temporal changes in enhancement of transmitter release during long-term potentiation (LTP), we examined amplitude fluctuation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) for longer periods than 2 h after tetanic stimulation (up to 4 h in the longest observation). The relative magnitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentiation (EPSP) fluctuation (coefficient of variation, CV) reduced throughout the observation periods in association with an increase in EPSP amplitude after tetanic stimulation. The reciprocals of squared CVs (= mean2/variance) were almost in proportion to the magnitude of LTP, and the ratio of 1/CV2 and the LTP magnitude did not change significantly for up to 4 h. These findings suggest that a prolonged enhancement of transmitter release from presynaptic terminals underlies LTP, and the relative contribution of this presynaptic enhancement does not change significantly for 2 h (maybe up to 4 h, or longer) after tetanic stimulation.",
