     "AB": "Cannabinoid (CB(1)) receptor activation produced differential effects on voltage-gated outward potassium currents in whole-cell recordings from cultured (7-15 days) rat hippocampal neurons. Voltage-dependent potassium currents A (I(A)) and D (I(D)) were isolated from a composite tetraethylammonium-insensitive current (I(comp)) by blockade with either 4-aminopyridine (500 microM) or dendrotoxin (2 microM) and subtraction of the residual I(A) from I(comp) to reveal I(D). The time constants of inactivation (tau) of I(A) and I(D) as determined in this manner were found to be quite different. The CB(1) agonist WIN 55,212-2 produced a 15- to 20-mV positive shift in voltage-dependent inactivation of I(A) and a simultaneous voltage-independent reduction in the amplitude of I(D) in the same neurons. The EC(50) value for the effect of WIN 55,212-2 on I(D) amplitude (13.9 nM) was slightly lower than the EC(50) value for its effect on I(A) voltage dependence (20.6 nM). Pretreatment with either the CB(1) antagonist SR141716A or pertussis toxin completely blocked the differential effects of WIN 55,212-2 on I(A) and I(D), whereas cellular dialysis with guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate mimicked the action of cannabinoids but blocked the action of simultaneously administered cannabinoid receptor ligands. Finally, the differential effects of cannabinoids on I(A) and I(D) were both shown to be mediated via the well documented cannabinoid receptor inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and subsequent modulation of cAMP and protein kinase. These actions are considered in terms of cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of separate I(A) and I(D) channels and the contribution of each to composite voltage-gated potassium currents in these cells.",
