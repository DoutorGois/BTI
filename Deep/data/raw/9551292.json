     "AB": "Over the past year evidence has accumulated against the idea that seizures require re-entrant activity between spatially separate structures. Seizures in vivo typically do involve interconnected, spatially separate brain regions, but they often show no net phase lag around the putative circuit. In many cases seizure-like events can arise from localized regions such as the entorhinal cortex or hippocampus proper, through mechanisms that are starting to be identified.",
