     "AB": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and rotenone induced oxidative stress was investigated in homogenates of rat brain regions - striatum, mid brain, frontal cortex and hippocampus. LPS at concentration 1, 25 and 50mug and rotenone 1, 2 and 4mM was incubated with the brain homogenates and caused decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) and rise in malondialdehyde (MDA) in different brain regions but in a varied manner. Anti-oxidants melatonin and nimesulide (0.75, 1.5 and 3mM) were incubated concurrently with LPS (50mug) and rotenone (4mM) in the homogenates. Melatonin as well as nimesulide (3mM) suppressed the LPS and rotenone induced increase in MDA but their effect on GSH differed. Lack of uniform response by different brain areas to LPS, rotenone and antioxidants indicate that sensitivity to oxidative stress may differ among the brain areas; this variability in sensitivity may be of significance in relation to free radicals induced selective neuronal degeneration.",
