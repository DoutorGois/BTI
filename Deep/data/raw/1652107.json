     "AB": "Calcium currents were recorded in cultured (5-7 days) hippocampal neurons isolated from one-day rats. The animals were intraperitoneally injected L-phenylalanine which induced in their brain biochemical changes typical of phenylketonuria. It has been found that in neurons from injected animals the amplitude of the high-threshold calcium current was substantially inhibited and amounted to 40 +/- 30% at Vt = +20 mV (amplitude of calcium currents at Vt = -10 mV taken as 100%). Addition of L-tyrosine to the cultivation medium (50 mumol/l) restored the high-voltage calcium current, its relative amplitude reaching 280 +/- 57%.",
