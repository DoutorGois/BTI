     "AB": "Polyclonal antiserum against a high molecular weight glycosylated protease, purified from calf brain cytosol, was raised in rabbit and purified by immunoaffinity. The antibody specifically immunoreacted with the M(r) = 165,000 and 155,000 polypeptides of the protease. Immunocytochemical localization data revealed that the protease is localized in the pyramidal neurons, granular and glial cells of the hippocampus. Microscopic analysis of the pyramidal neurons indicates that the protease is present in the cytoplasm and extends to the dendrite and axon. The nuclei of these neurons remain unstained.",
