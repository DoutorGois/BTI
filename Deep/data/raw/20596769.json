     "AB": "The heterodimeric sweet taste receptors, T1R2 and T1R3, have recently been proposed to be associated with the brain glucose sensor. To identify whether sweet taste signaling is regulated in response to an ischemic injury inducing acute impairment of glucose metabolism, we investigated the spatiotemporal expression of the sweet taste receptors and their associated taste-specific G-protein alpha-gustducin in the rat hippocampus after ischemia. The expression profiles of both receptor subunits and alpha-gustducin shared overlapping expression patterns in sham-operated and ischemic hippocampi. Constitutive expression of both receptors and alpha-gustducin was localized in neurons of the pyramidal cell and granule cell layers, but their upregulation was detected in reactive astrocytes in ischemic hippocampi. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the immmunohistochemically determined temporal patterns of sweet-taste signaling proteins. These results suggest that the expression of sweet taste signaling proteins in astrocytes might be regulated in response to altered extracellular levels of glucose following an ischemic insult.",
