     "AB": "Effects of repeated swim stress on the binding of 125I-iomazenil were examined in the brains of diazepam-treated and non-treated mice. The mice were orally administered diazepam or vehicle (0.5% ethylene glycol) and subjected to daily swim stress (at 20 degrees C for 10 min) for seven consecutive days. The distribution and the amount of 125I-iomazenil binding were analyzed autoradiographically after in vivo and in vitro binding experiments. Repeated swim stress decreased the in vivo binding in the hippocampus (p < 0.05) and cerebral cortex (p < 0.05) of vehicle-treated mice but caused no significant changes in diazepam-treated mice. Subchronic treatment with diazepam decreased the in vivo binding approximately 50% in all brain regions examined (p < 0.01). The in vitro experiment, however, revealed no significant changes except in the hippocampus, where a small but significant decrease in the binding was observed after subchronic treatment with diazepam (p < 0.01). The stress- or diazepam-induced reductions seem to represent alterations in the in vivo environment related to 125I-iomazenil binding. These results suggest that we can investigate the pathophysiology of stress and anxiety with 123I-iomazenil SPECT. Care must be taken concerning the effects of benzodiazepines.",
