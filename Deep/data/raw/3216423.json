     "AB": "In this paper we present evidence that the 48-kD intermediate filament-associated protein (IFAP) is expressed relatively late in maturation of astrocytes, after they have acquired the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In the astrocytes of white matter in the cerebellum the GFAP is detected at P3, whereas the 48-kD IFAP is detected only at P11. In the periventricular region and the hippocampus the 48-kD IFAP was detected at P6, long after the appearance of GFAP. In adult mice the 48-kD IFAP was observed in GFAP-positive astrocytes in the white matter of cerebellum, spinal cord, brainstem, and corpus callosum as well as in GFAP-positive cells in the grey matter of cerebral cortex and spinal cord. The 48-kD IFAP was not, however, detected in radial glia and their derivatives, in Bergmann glia or in Muller glia. Thus, not all the GFAP-positive astroglia express the 48-kD IFAP. Similarly, 48-kD IFAP was not detected in cells which were GFAP-negative.",
