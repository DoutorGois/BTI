     "AB": "The sympathetic sprouting response that occurs in the rat hippocampal formation following septal denervation is reduced in aged rats. Since considerable evidence implicates NGF-like activity in eliciting the sprouting, the simplest explanation for the age-related decline in sympathetic sprouting is a reduction in hippocampal NGF levels. In the present study, hippocampal NGF levels were measured using a 2-site ELISA in four different age groups of Fischer 344 rats. There was no decline in NGF levels with age, nor did we find any differences between male and female rats. This contradicts an earlier report in which a 40% reduction in hippocampal NGF protein levels was found in aged rats. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. The present results do not support the hypothesis that the age-related decline in sympathetic sprouting is due to a reduction in total hippocampal NGF levels.",
