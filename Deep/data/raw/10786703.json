     "AB": "We examined the neuroprotective effects of oren-gedoku-to (TJ15), a herbal medicine, after transient forebrain ischemia. Transient forebrain ischemia was induced by occlusion of both common carotid arteries for 15 min in C57BL/6 mice treated with TJ15. In the control ischemic group without TJ15 treatment, histologic examination of brain tissue collected seven days after reperfusion showed death of pyramidal cells in CA2-3 area of the hippocampus, unilaterally or bilaterally. In mice treated with oral TJ15 (845 mg/kg/day) for five weeks, the frequency of ischemic neuronal death was significantly lower. Immunohistochemistry for Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) showed strongly reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus of ischemic mice treated with TJ15. Damage to nerve cells by free radicals plays an important role in the induction of neuronal death by ischemia-reperfusion injury. Our results suggest that TJ15 protects against ischemic neuronal death by increasing the expression of Cu/Zn-SOD and suggest that oren-gedoku-to reduces the exposure of hippocampal neurons to oxidative stress.",
