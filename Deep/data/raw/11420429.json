     "AB": "A robust standardized method for segmentation, quantification, and normalization of pediatric hippocampal volumes using magnetic resonance imaging is presented. The method will find application in time course measurements of hippocampal volumes in pediatric patients who suffer from temporal lobe epilepsy and was tested prospectively on six control patients (13-60 mo of age). The un-normalized hippocampal volumes obtained using our segmentation method ranged from 3.85 to 6.38 mL, in agreement with previously published results. Inter- and intraobserver variability of the segmentation method was determined to be 13.3% and 2.8%, respectively. Four different methods of volume normalization were tested. Normalization is required to adjust for age-related increases in hippocampal volume. The normalization approach that seemed to compensate best for growth-related hippocampal volume changes was based on a simple estimation of intracranial volumes. This is the first report of a consistent and reliable method for segmentation and normalization of hippocampi from pediatric patients that can be used to study the progression of neurologic diseases in children.",
