     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Rg1-induced NSCs in treatment of neonatal rat model with hypoxiaischemia. METHOD: The neonatal rat model of HIE was established and assessed by using TTC staining and behavioral observation, then Rg1-induced NSCs was transplanted into the neonatal rat of HIE by lateral ventricle injection. Water maze test and somatosensory evoked potential were detected to observe brain function and the immunohistochemistry was done to assess growth and differentiation about transplanted NSCs a month after transplanted. RESULT: The transplantation of Rg1-induced NSCs could significantly shorten incubation period, swimming distance, exploration time of target quadrants of water maze test and incubation period and amplitude of somatosensory evoked potentials. Additionally, the concentrated expression appeared in the hippocampus and grew around the ischemic injury area in transplantation group. CONCLUSION: Transplantation of Rg1-induced NSCs play a better role in the treatment of neonatal HIE rats.",
