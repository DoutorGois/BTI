     "AB": "P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (VGCC) regulate neurotransmitter release in the hippocampus and molecular alterations of their alpha(1A) pore-forming subunits are involved in various animal and human CNS diseases. We evaluated, using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, the spatio-temporal activation of two alpha(1A) subunits splice variants (alpha(1A-a) and alpha(1A-b)) in control and kainic acid (KA)-treated rats. Six hours after KA treatment, alpha(1A-a) and alpha(1A-b) mRNAs increased, decreased or remained unchanged with area specific patterns. These changes were evidenced in the hippocampus and the dentatus gyrus and absent in the cerebellum. The alpha(1A) mRNA upregulation lasted for at least 7 days after KA treatment. Altogether, these results indicate that alpha(1A-a) and alpha(1A-b) mRNAs following seizure onset exhibit a complex and specific spatio-temporal pattern. The long-lasting changes in alpha(1A) subunit mRNA contents suggests that VGCC may be involved in the mechanisms generating chronic focal hyperexcitability and/or cellular damage in temporal lobe epilepsy.",
