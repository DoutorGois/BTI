     "AB": "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) mRNA-containing neurons were found in normal neonate and adult human hippocampus with a localization pattern consistently similar among different ages. They were numerous in proximal CA1 to CA3 pyramidal layer, granular layer and hilus, and sparse in oriens and molecular layers. The present data provide a map of GDNF-producing neurons in the human archicortex and suggest a role for GDNF in neuronal function throughout life.",
