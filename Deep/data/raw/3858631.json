     "AB": "In the present study, the relationship between central catecholamine levels and the anorexia induced by Walker 256 carcinoma was investigated. Results indicate that the anorexia is not due to depletion of central catecholamines. Tumor bearing rats sacrificed at night, when spontaneous food intake is selectively depressed, showed increased norepinephrine levels in the hypothalamus, cortex and hippocampus and increased dopamine levels in the striatum, midbrain, and cortex. Increased nighttime hypothalamic norepinephrine levels were positively correlated with the magnitude of spontaneous food intake in tumor rats.",
