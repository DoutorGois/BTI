     "AB": "CO2 production from exogenous glucose of cortical, whole hippocampal, and CA3 region hippocampal slices, as well as O2 consumption of whole hippocampal slices, were measured in the presence of different concentrations of kainic acid. A moderate, significant increase of CO2 production was seen only in the CA3 region hippocampal preparation at kainic acid concentrations of 10(-4)-10(-2) M. The O2 consumption, at the expense of endogenous energy stores of whole hippocampal slices, was substantially increased by 10(-3) M kainic acid when the slices were incubated without exogenous glucose. The effect was partly paralleled by the use of high (50 mM) K+ concentration. Some of the possible factors involved in the differential metabolic responses of brain slices to the action of kainic acid are discussed briefly.",
