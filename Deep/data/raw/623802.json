It has been shown that the main generator layers of spontaneous EEG are the I layer--the layer of apical dendrites and the V--the layer of pyramidal neuron somas. To perform a quantitative estimation of passive penetration of the electric fields from deep-seated structures, chiefly from the hippocampus, biopotentials studied were recorded from I, V cortex layers and hippocampus simultaneously, the cortex being disengaged by the method of propagating depression. Significant suppression of surface-activity of the motor cortex was achieved with its preservation in the hippocampus.",
