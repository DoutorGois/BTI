     "PG": "139-42",
     "AB": "Whole-cell recordings were made from pyramidal cells visually identified in the CA1 field of adult rat hippocampal slices, and the effects of subanesthetic concentrations of halothane on excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by non-N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype glutamate receptors were investigated. Halothane concentrations were measured by gas chromatography. At concentrations of 0.2 mM and 0.6 mM, halothane reversibly decreased the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by electrical stimulation of Schaffer collateral fibers, and the decrease was accompanied by enhanced paired-pulse facilitation, consistent with the previously reported presynaptic site of halothane's inhibitory action. By contrast, at lower concentrations (0.02 mM and 0.05 mM), halothane increased the amplitude of EPSCs without any appreciable changes in paired-pulse facilitation. Moreover, the frequency of miniature EPSCs arising spontaneously in the presence of tetrodotoxin (mEPSCs) was increased by subanesthetic halothane, but the amplitude of the mEPSCs did not change significantly. These observations suggest that at subanesthetic concentrations halothane postsynaptically enhances glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission. This may provide a vital clue to elucidation of the neural mechanisms of the nociceptive reflex enhancement and excitatory state that occur at light levels of anesthesia.",
