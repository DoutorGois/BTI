     "AB": "Jieyu chufan (JYCF) is a well-known Chinese traditional medicine used for depression; however, the molecular mechanism underlying its anti-depressant action has remained elusive. In the present study, the anti-depressant effects of JYCF and the potential mechanisms were investigated in a mouse model. Five groups of 12 C57BL/6 mice each were used in the study, including a normal control group (NC group), a model control group (MC group) and three groups, which received different doses of JYCF (1.25, 2.5 and 5 g/kg) orally for 21 days (JYCF groups). The MC group and the three JYCF groups were subjected to 3 weeks of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) to induce depression-like behavior. All groups were subjected to a sucrose consumption test along with a forced swimming test to confirm depression-like behavior, an open-field test and an elevated plus maze test to confirm anxiety-like behavior, and a Morris water maze test to evaluate spatial learning and memory. In addition, synaptic density in the hippocampus was evaluated and western blot and immunostaining were used to analyze hippocampal expression of postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95), synaptophysin (Syn), cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Akt and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta as well as their phosphorylated (p) versions. The results showed that JYCF (2.5 and 5 g/kg) alleviated depressive-like behaviors and increased synaptic density in UCMS mice. Moreover, JYCF upregulated the expression of PSD95, Syn and BDNF and increased phosphorylated Akt, CREB and GSK-3beta in the hippocampus. These results suggested that JYCF exerts an anti-depressant-like activity in UCMS-induced mice, which is likely to be mediated by reversing the stress-induced disruption of BDNF and GSK-3beta activity.",
