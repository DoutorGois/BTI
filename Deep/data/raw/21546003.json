     "AB": "In the present study we investigated the regulation of S100B expression during tetanization-induced hippocampal long term potentiation, one of the best characterized forms of synaptic plasticity. Tetanization resulted in time-dependent change in S100B gene expression and protein content in hippocampal CA1 area. We analyzed the promoter region of the rat S100B gene and identified response elements for the tumor suppressor p53. ChIP assay revealed that p53 could bind to putative p53-binding sites of the S100B promoter. The time-dependent recruitment of p53 to its putative binding sites in the S100B gene promoter paralleled the time-course change of S100B mRNA and protein levels. Thus, these results strongly support the view that S100B gene may be a target of p53. Moreover, we demonstrated that the increase of S100B protein content was accompanied with the decrease of p53 protein content, and it seems that the decrease is regulated on post-translational level. Thus, our results may help to understand the physiological function of the p53-S100B-p53 loop in the process of synaptic plasticity.",
