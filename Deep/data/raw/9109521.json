     "AB": "The ability of ethanol to enhance GABA(A) receptor function remains controversial; conflicting observations have been made even in the same brain region, and when using apparently similar methodologies. In this study we characterized a single protocol variable, the initial incubation temperature of brain slices, that had dramatic effects on the ethanol sensitivity of GABA(A) inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) recorded from rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Incubation of hippocampal slices at relatively low temperatures (11-15 degrees C) immediately after slice preparation significantly affected a number of physiological and biochemical parameters. Such slices showed a decrease in extracellular inhibitory postsynaptic potential amplitude, a significant increase in the ethanol sensitivity of GABA(A) IPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons, no change in pentobarbital or flunitrazepam potentiation of IPSCs, and an increase in basal protein kinase C (PKC) activity relative to slices incubated at 31-33 degrees C. In addition, the increase in ethanol sensitivity of GABA(A) IPSCs was blocked by chelerythrine, a selective inhibitor of PKC. These results suggest that differences in hippocampal slice incubation protocols may have contributed to the disparate results of previous investigations of ethanol modulation of GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus. In addition, these findings provide further evidence that PKC activity positively modulates the interaction between ethanol and GABA(A) receptors in the mammalian brain.",
