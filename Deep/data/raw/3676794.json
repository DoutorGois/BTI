     "AB": "Synapses on dendritic shafts were examined in electron micrographs of serial sections obtained from the molecular layer of the rat dentate gyrus. Some of these synapses have been found to exhibit profiles of a discontinuous postsynaptic density (PSD). PSD reconstructions from serial sections were performed in a plane perpendicular to that of the sections. The results obtained indicate that profiles of discontinuous PSDs observed in random sections of dendritic shaft synapses are generated by sectioning of PSD plates that contain 1-3 holes or perforations. Earlier serial section studies of osmicated material have demonstrated that a proportion of axospinous synapses also exhibit a perforated PSD. It appears, therefore, that the presence of PSD perforations is a general phenomenon shared by subpopulations of different types of synapses, both those involving dendritic shafts and those involving dendritic spines.",
