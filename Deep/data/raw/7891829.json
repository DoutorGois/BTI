     "AB": "The concentrations of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and their metabolites were measured in the prefrontal cortex, caudate-putamen, and hippocampus in young (3 months) and aged (27-31 months) Wistar rats of both sexes. Age-related changes were found in prefrontal NA and HVA/DA ratio, striatal DA and DOPAC/DA ratio, and striatal and hippocampal 5-HT and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio. Age and sex dependent changes were found in striatal DA and DOPAC/DA ratio, and hippocampal MHPG-SO4/NA ratio. The aged rats were tested in spatial discrimination and reversal tasks in a T maze. The effects of alpha 2-agonist medetomidine (3 micrograms/kg) on the task performance were assessed in relation to individual variation in monoamine metabolism. Medetomidine impaired spatial discrimination learning of the aged rats by interacting with the hippocampal 5-HT turnover. Medetomidine improved reversal learning through an interaction with the striatal DA turnover and reduced the number of perseverative errors after reversal, mainly due to its interaction with the prefrontal NA turnover. It is concluded that the memory enhancing effect of drugs acting through the brain monoamine systems is highly dependent on the stage of degeneration of these systems that show considerable individual variation in aged animals.",
