     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of positron emission tomography (PET) in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) rat model verification and in monitoring the therapeutic effectiveness of cell transplantation. METHODS: A beta(1-40) hippocampus injected rat model was successfully established and neural stem cells were injected into hippocampus. Results of behavior tests and histological examinations were compared between model group and graft group, and then the N-methyl-[(11)C]2-(4 methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole ((11)C-PIB) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) imaging were performed to observe whether the result of imaging was matched with behavior test and histological examination. RESULTS: The Morris water maze showed that the latent period of the escape was significantly longer in model group than in control group (P<0.01). In histological examinations, the neuron loss and A beta deposition were found in hippocampus CA1 and dentate gyrus of rat model. (11)C-PIB imaging showed increased uptake in model rat hippocampus district (P<0.05), while (18)F-FDG imaging showed that the uptake in the injected side of hippocampus in model group was significantly lower than that in the same side in control group (P<0.001). After cell transplantation, the latent period of the escape was significantly shorter in graft group than in model group (P<0.01). Histological examinations showed that there was no obvious changes in A beta deposition; in addition, the neural stem cells differentiated and expressed neuronal nuclei-positive cells, and continuously expressed 5-bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells for six weeks. (11)C-PIB imaging and (18)F-FDG imaging showed the uptakes were not significantly different between between model group and transplantation group(P>0.05). CONCLUSION: (11)C-PIB imaging is useful in diagnosing AD and monitoring the pathological change of AD model in vivo, while (18)F-FDG imaging provides useful visual information for monitoring short-term therapeutic effectiveness of stem cell transplantation.",
