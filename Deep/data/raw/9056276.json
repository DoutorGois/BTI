     "AB": "We studied the functional effect of injection of sodium amobarbital (SA) in 10 patients with intractable epilepsy. During the intracarotid amobarbital procedure, we measured delta activity in EEG recording from implanted electrodes and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using HMPAO-SPECT co-registered with MRI. SA injection resulted in an increase in delta activity and a decrease in rCBF in all areas examined. Direct functional changes were observed in structures perfused by the carotid artery injected. In addition, we observed indirect effects, probably owing to deafferentation of neuronal pathways connecting these structures to ipsilateral and contralateral regions, including middle and posterior hippocampus.",
