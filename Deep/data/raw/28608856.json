     "AB": "Antenatal administration of synthetic glucocorticoids (sGC) is the standard of care for women at risk for preterm labor before 34 gestational weeks. Despite their widespread use, the type of sGC used and their dose or the dosing regimens are not standardized in the United States of America or worldwide. Several studies have identified neural deficits and the increased risk for cognitive and psychiatric disease later in life for children administered sGC prenatally. However, the precise molecular and cellular targets of GC action in the developing brain remain largely undefined. In this study, we demonstrate that a single dose of glucocorticoid during mid-gestation in mice leads to enhanced proliferation in select cerebral cortical neural stem/progenitor cell populations. These alterations are mediated by dose-dependent changes in the expression of cell cycle inhibitors and in genes that promote cell cycle re-entry. This leads to changes in neuronal number and density in the cerebral cortex at birth, coupled to long-term alterations in neurite complexity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in adolescents, and changes in anxiety and depressive-like behaviors in adults.",
