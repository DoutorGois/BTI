     "AB": "The distribution of Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptors in large cryosections of human brain hemispheres (80-microns) was studied by quantitative autoradiography using 125I-IGF-1 as ligand. Postmortem tissue only from individuals free from neurological diseases was used. The highest densities of IGF-1 receptors were found in the hippocampus, amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus. Intermediate densities were observed in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex and caudate nucleus, whereas low densities of IGF-1 receptors were obtained in the substantia nigra, red nucleus, white matter and cerebral pedunculus. The cartography of IGF-1 receptors in the normal human brain will hopefully be of use in the study of the alteration of these receptors in diseased brain.",
