     "AB": "SAMP1TA/Ngs, a substrain of senescence accelerated mouse, is a useful animal model for research on brain dysfunction due to senescence. In a previous study it was reported that the age-related changes in basal dendrites and spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons coincide with the behavioral characteristics found in SAMP1TA/Ngs. The goal of the present study was to investigate morphological changes in apical dendrites and dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons among 3-, 5-, 7-month-old SAMP1TA/Ngs. Pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus were stained by the rapid Golgi method, and the number of apical dendrites, the number of their spines and the density of the dendritic spines were evaluated. The number and density of the spines of apical dendrites were significantly higher at 5 months than at 3 or 7 months of age. We propose that the low number of dendritic spines in 3-month-old animals was caused by immaturity, while the changes in the density and number of dendritic spines in 7-month-old mice were due to accelerated aging. The data on the morphology of apical dendrites are a useful complement to the results reported previously. The findings of the present study also support the hypothesis that this model mouse demonstrates changes in respective developmental stages, i.e. immaturity, adulthood and senescence. This pattern of postnatal growth has special meaning because it indicates the usefulness of the strain in the study of geriatric disorders in humans.",
