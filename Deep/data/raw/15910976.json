     "AB": "Neuroinflammation is one of the events occurring after acute brain injuries. The aim of the present report was to characterize a rat model to study acute neuroinflammation on the histopathological, biochemical and functional outcomes. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), known as a strong immunostimulant, was directly injected into the hippocampus. The spatiotemporal evolution of inducible NOS (iNOS) and cell death was studied from 6 h to 7 days. A perfect time course correlation was observed between iNOS immunoreactivity and iNOS activity showing an acute, expansive and transient iNOS induction in the hippocampus with a peak at 24 h. It was associated with a marked increase in NO metabolite (NO(x)) levels, and a high level of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. This inflammation precedes a massive cellular loss including at least neurons and astrocytes, and a drop of constitutive NOS activity, restrictive to the ipsilateral hippocampus from 48 h after LPS injection. Moreover, sensorimotor function impairment occurred from 24 h to 7 days with a maximum at 24 h post-LPS injection. Therefore, we characterized an in vivo model of acute neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, in relation with a neurological deficit, which may be a powerful tool for mechanistic studies and for further evaluation of the potential neuroprotective agents.",
