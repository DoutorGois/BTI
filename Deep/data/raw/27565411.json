     "AB": "Dysregulation in the glutamatergic function is considered a major contributor to hyperexcitatory neuronal networks in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Studies in animal models of MTLE have shown positive outcomes of augmenting group 2-metabotropic receptor functions that can regulate neuronal excitability from extrasynaptic locations. To assist in efficient translation of these findings to the clinical settings, we aimed to characterise the expression of mGluR2/3 receptors in the brain areas relevant to MTLE. mGluR2/3 density was determined by autoradiographic techniques using [(3)H]-LY341495 at various cross-sectional timepoints following kainic acid-induced status epilepticus (KASE) covering the acute, latent and chronic phases of epilepsy pathogenesis. We found a significant reduction in the mGluR density in the CA1 and temporal cortex during the acute (2day) timepoint after SE in KASE rats whereas a reduced receptor density was only found in temporal cortex during the latent period (7day). During the late latent phase (14day), a generalised increase in the receptor density was found in widely distributed brain areas of KASE rats. Finally, in the chronic periods (day 42 and 84) a significant decrease was seen in the stratum lacunosum moleculare in the KASE rats. Moreover, mGluR2/3 density in the CA1 regions strongly correlated with the neuronal cell scores in the hippocampal regions. Our findings suggest a time dependent evolving pattern of mGluR2/3 density during the pathogenesis of MTLE and provide insights for utilising this data for in vivo imaging to predict the specific timepoints and responsiveness to the therapy targeting mGluR2/3.",
