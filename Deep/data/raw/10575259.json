     "AB": "Seizures, particularly multiple episodes and/or status epilepticus (SE) are prevalent in pediatric patients. Pediatric SE is associated with brain changes that have been hypothesized to contribute to the onset of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In order to gain insight into the effects of seizures on the immature brain and the risk for later TLE, we have developed a model of limbic SE in the pigtailed macaque monkey. In separate studies, bicuculline methiodide or a bicuculline 'cocktail' was infused into three regions of the brain (area tempestas, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex) to induce seizures. Measures included MRI, electrophysiology, behavior and morphology. Our results suggest that monkey models of SE may provide useful tools for understanding the effects of prolonged seizures during infancy and the origins of TLE in humans.",
