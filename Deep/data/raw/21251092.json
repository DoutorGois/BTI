     "AB": "The ovarian hormone oestradiol promotes neuritic outgrowth in different neuronal types, by mechanisms that remain elusive. Recent studies have shown that the Notch-regulated transcription factor neurogenin 3 controls neuritogenesis. In the present study, we assessed whether oestradiol regulates neurogenin 3 in primary hippocampal neurones. As expected, neuritogenesis was increased in the cultures treated with oestradiol. However, the neuritogenic action of oestradiol was not prevented by ICI 182,780, an antagonist of classical oestrogen receptors (ERs). Oestradiol decreased the expression of Hairy and Enhancer of Split-1, a Notch-regulated gene that negatively controls the expression on neurogenin 3. Furthermore, oestradiol increased the expression of neurogenin 3 and regulated its distribution between the neuronal cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. The effect of oestradiol on neurogenin 3 expression was not blocked by antagonists of classical nuclear ER-mediated transcription and was not imitated by selective agonists of nuclear ERs. By contrast, G1, a ligand of G protein receptor 30/G protein-coupled ER, fully reproduced the effect of oestradiol on neuritogenesis, neurogenin 3 expression and neurogenin 3 subcellular localisation. Moreover, knockdown of neurogenin 3 in neurones by transfection with small interference RNA for neurogenin 3 completely abrogated the neuritogenic actions of oestradiol and G1. These results suggest that oestradiol regulates neurogenin 3 in primary hippocampal neurones by a nonclassical steroid signalling mechanism, which involves the down-regulation of Notch activity and the activation of G protein receptor 30/G protein-coupled ER or of other unknown G1 targets. In addition, our findings indicate that neurogenin 3 participates in the neuritogenic mechanisms of oestradiol in hippocampal neurones.",
