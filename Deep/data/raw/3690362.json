     "AB": "Immunohistochemical and subcellular fractionation techniques were employed to compare the cellular and subcellular localization of adenosine deaminase (ADA) in various brain regions of several mammalian species. A relatively restricted distribution of ADA-immunoreactive neurons in rat brain was previously reported. Mouse brain exhibited a pattern similar in many respects to rat and, in addition, contained intensely immunostained neurons in lateral habenula and hippocampus. Glial immunostaining was absent or very light in rat but evident in mouse. Prominent immunoreactive fibers and neurons were observed in hamster spinal cord and anterior hypothalamus, respectively. ADA-immunostaining in guinea-pig was localized to presumptive fibers in the superficial layers of spinal cord dorsal horn and to glial cells throughout the brain. Demonstration of specific immunostaining in rabbit was not possible. ADA activity was far more heterogeneously distributed in rat and most brain areas in guinea-pig and rabbit contained up to 5-fold and 10-fold higher levels of activity, respectively, compared with rat. Crude synaptosomal (P2) fractions of rat cortex contained a greater proportion of ADA activity than those of rabbit cortex. Within rat, relatively high activity was found in P2 fractions of whole hypothalamus, cerebellum, and hippocampus. ADA activity was greater in P2 fractions of rat anterior compared with whole hypothalamus and the greatest proportion of the enzyme in this fraction was localized to purified synaptosomes. The large variations in the activity and cellular location of ADA in the animals examined suggest species differences in mechanisms governing adenosine metabolism in brain and possible differences in the relationships between cellular metabolism, ADA and the neuroregulatory role of adenosine in the CNS.",
