     "AB": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a human neurodegenerative disease characterized by co-existence of extracellular senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) associated with an extensive neuronal loss, primarily in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Several studies suggest that caspase(s)-mediated neuronal death occurs in cellular and animal AD models as well as in human brains of affected patients, although an etiologic role of apoptosis in such neurodegenerative disorder is still debated. This review summarizes the experimental evidences corroborating the possible involvement of apoptosis in AD pathogenesis and discusses the usefulness of ad hoc devised in vitro approaches to study how caspase(s), amyloidogenic processing and tau metabolism might reciprocally interact leading to neuronal death.",
