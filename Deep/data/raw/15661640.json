     "AB": "We studied the expression pattern of the major renal protein Podocalyxin during the development of mouse brain using in situ hybridization. Podocalyxin mRNA was widely expressed at least from E14, the first age we studied, and expression remained high until adulthood. The highest levels of expression were postnatal. Podocalyxin expression was particularly elevated in the cortical plate, the hippocampus and cerebellum, and in several basal forebrain nuclei.",
