     "AB": "The Ret receptor tyrosine kinase is part of a functional receptor complex for the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family. We examined the expression of Ret mRNA after transient forebrain ischemia, and explored the effect of local GDNF-pretreatment in rat hippocampus on Ret mRNA expression. Transient forebrain ischemia induced Ret mRNA expression in the hippocampus, with a peak effect at 12 h. Whereas intrahippocampal microinjection of GDNF (1.0 microg) in sham-operated rats induced the expression of Ret mRNA (peak at 6 to 12 h), the expected increase of Ret mRNA induced by ischemia was blunted by local GDNF-pretreatment. Immunohistochemical investigation revealed that ischemia-induced Ret receptor expression in the hippocampal CA1 region was also reduced by local GDNF-pretreatment. These findings suggest that GDNF modulates the expression of Ret, and that GDNF signaling pathways that involve the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase might play an important role in brain injury induced by ischemia.",
