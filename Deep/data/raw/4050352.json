     "AB": "Male Mongolian gerbils were subjected to bilateral carotid occlusion for 5 and 10 min, followed by 7 days of recirculation. After this interval, serial sections were made of the posterior region of the dorsal hippocampus, and the number of surviving neurons was determined per mm length of CA1 sector. In halothane-anesthetized animals only 21.1% of CA1 neurons survived 5-min ischemia, but this percentage could be raised to 78.6% when animals were pretreated with 25 mg/kg pentobarbital before ischemia. Pretreatment with 50 mg/kg pentobarbital before 5-min ischemia or pretreatment with 25 mg/kg pentobarbital before 10-min ischemia did not reduce CA1 lesions. It is concluded that a non-anesthetic dose of barbiturates is able to prevent selective vulnerability of CA1 sector, but that this effect is limited to the initial 5 min of ischemia.",
