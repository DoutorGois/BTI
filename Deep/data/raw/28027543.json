     "AB": "Recently, an increasing interest has been directed towards the investigation of brain effects of ionizing radiation (IR), as it is now evident that, depending on the doses, the damages character and severity, as well as clinical man ifestations are different. They are generally considered to be the result of a blending of atherosclerotic, cardiovas cular, cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative processes. Further, an ongoing debate has been opened on the pos sible brain abnormalities following medical radiation from X ray in interventional radiology and nuclear medicine procedures that would involve both patients and medical workers. The aim of the present paper is to summarize literature data on brain effects of IR exposure, with a special focus on those gathered by some of the authors after the Chornobyl nuclear plant disaster, and how they can be related to the pathophysiology of different neuropsy chiatric disorders.",
