     "AB": "In situ hybridization and Northern blot assay were used to evaluate the effects of exogenous AVP(4-8) on the transcription of mRNAs for nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) in the adult rat brain. NGF and BDNF expression was found to be significantly enhanced by AVP(4-8) administration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, but NT-3 expression was not changed. In the same conditions, behavior-active arginine-vasopressin (AVP) showed a small effect and its behavior-inactive homologue, oxytocin did not. Our results suggest that selective regulation of neurotrophin gene expression by the peptides may be responsible for its memory-enhancing function.",
