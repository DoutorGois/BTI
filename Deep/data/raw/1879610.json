     "AB": "Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is believed to play a role in the regulation of brain growth. The identity of cells responsible for its synthesis in the immature brain, however, has not been established. To identify potential sites of IGF-1 synthesis, in situ hybridization has been utilized to localize IGF-1 mRNA in the murine brain during the first postnatal month. Although IGF-1 mRNA was detected in all regions of the neonatal brain, there was considerable regional variation in the level of expression. Neurons were the principle sites IGF-1 mRNA expression and expression was typically restricted to one or two neuronal cell types within each region. In the cerebellar cortex, for example, only Purkinje cells hybridized to the IGF-1 probe. In contrast to gray matter, IGF-1 labeled cells were rarely found in presumptive white matter tracts of the forebrain. The hybridization signal was most prominent in regions where neurogenesis persisted after birth, including the cerebellum, olfactory bulb, and hippocampal complex. The timing of IGF-1 mRNA expression appeared to be temporally related to local neuronal proliferation. The number of labeled cells and intensity of hybridization signal was greatest during the first 2 postnatal weeks, a period of rapid neuronal proliferation in these regions. At the end of the first month, when neurogenesis had essentially ceased, IGF-1 signal strength had declined to background levels. The temporal and spatial pattern IGF-1 mRNA expression in the immature CNS was consistent with a role for locally produced IGF-1 in the regulation of brain development.",
