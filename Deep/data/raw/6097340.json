In this study we describe the pharmacological characteristics and anatomical distribution of [3H]AMPA binding sites in rat brain using quantitative autoradiography. These binding sites exhibit the appropriate pharmacological characteristics and are found in high concentrations in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex (especially layers I-III), induseum griseum, and dorsal lateral septum. Intermediate concentrations are found in the corpus striatum and deeper layers of cerebral cortex. Lower concentrations are found in the diencephalon, midbrain and brainstem. These results demonstrate that [3H]AMPA binding sites are found throughout the CNS and suggest brain regions which may use quisqualate receptors as glutamate neurotransmitter receptors.",
