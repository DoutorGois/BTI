     "AB": "The aim of this research was to determine whether early maturation of the dorsal hippocampal cholinergic system mediates behavior exhibited by preweanling rats in the presence or absence of an unfamiliar adult male rat, a threatening stimulus. The behavioral responses that were examined included behavioral inhibition or freezing which emerges at 2 weeks of age and ultrasonic vocalizations. Prior to behavioral testing, oxotremorine, an M2 muscarinic receptor agonist that reduces cholinergic release from presynaptic terminals, was infused into the dorsal hippocampal dentate gyrus. Results demonstrated that 14-day-old rats with bilateral hippocampal infusions of a 1 microgram dose of oxotremorine exhibited significant deficits in freezing when exposed to the adult male rat. Importantly, oxotremorine had no significant effects on ultrasound emission and ambulatory activity when rat pups were tested in social isolation. Thus, effects of oxotremorine in the hippocampal dentate gyrus do not produce global changes in behavior. Results suggest that cholinergic release into the dorsal hippocampus facilitates the display of behavioral inhibition at the end of the second postnatal week. Behavioral deficits in freezing may reflect an oxotremorine-induced disruption of hippocampal cholinergic function underlying the processing of biologically relevant olfactory stimuli as well as mechanisms associated with attention.",
