     "AB": "The NCP family of cell-recognition molecules represents a distinct subgroup of the neurexins that includes Caspr and Caspr2, as well as Drosophila Neurexin-IV and axotactin. Here, we report the identification of Caspr3 and Caspr4, two new NCPs expressed in nervous system. Caspr3 was detected along axons in the corpus callosum, spinal cord, basket cells in the cerebellum and in peripheral nerves, as well as in oligodendrocytes. In contrast, expression of Caspr4 was more restricted to specific neuronal subpopulations in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, deep cerebellar nuclei, and the substantia nigra. Similar to the neurexins, the cytoplasmic tails of Caspr3 and Caspr4 interacted differentially with PDZ domain-containing proteins of the CASK/Lin2-Veli/Lin7-Mint1/Lin10 complex. The structural organization and distinct cellular distribution of Caspr3 and Caspr4 suggest a potential role of these proteins in cell recognition within the nervous system.",
