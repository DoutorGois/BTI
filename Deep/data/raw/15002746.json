     "AB": "Free fatty acids (FFA) and lactic acid are markers of secondary cellular injury following traumatic brain injury (TBI). We previously showed that animals fed a creatine (Cr)-enriched diet are afforded neuroprotection following TBI. To further characterize the neuroprotective Cr diet, we studied neurochemical changes in cortex and hippocampus following a moderate injury. Adult rats were fed either a control or Cr-supplemented diet (0.5%, 1%) for 2 weeks before TBI. At 30 min or 6 h after injury, tissue was processed for quantitative analysis of neurochemical changes. Both lactate and FFA were significantly increased in all tissues ipsilateral to the injury. Cr-fed animals had significantly lower levels, although the levels were elevated compared to sham controls. Animals fed a 1% Cr-diet were afforded greater neuroprotection than animals fed a 0.5% Cr diet. These results support the idea that a Cr-enriched diet can provide substantial neuroprotection in part by suppressing secondary brain injury.",
