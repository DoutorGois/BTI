     "AB": "Within the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus is the subgranular zone, which contains a neurogenic niche for radial-glia like cells, the most primitive neural stem cells in the adult brain. The quiescence of neural stem cells is maintained by tonic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) released from local interneurons. Once these cells differentiate into neural progenitor cells, GABA continues to regulate their development into mature granule cells, the principal cell type of the dentate gyrus. Here, we review the role of GABA circuits, signaling, and receptors in regulating development of adult-born cells, as well as the molecular players that modulate GABA signaling. Furthermore, we review recent findings linking dysregulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis to the altered GABAergic circuitry and signaling under various pathological conditions.",
