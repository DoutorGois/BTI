     "AB": "The cells of the entorhinal cortex receive a dense innervation of serotonergic fibres from the Raphe nuclei and express a high density of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptors. We investigated the effects of serotonin on excitatory synaptic transmission in principal cells from entorhinal cortex layers II and III within hippocampal-entorhinal cortex combined slices. Although serotonin had an effect upon the membrane conductance of some, but not all cells, its most pronounced action was to reduce stimulus evoked excitatory synaptic potentials and currents (EPSP/Cs). Both alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated EPSPs were reduced to similar extents over a range of concentrations. Since the principal cells in layer II and layer III are the main projection cells of the entorhinal cortex, these inhibitory effects of serotonin may have implications for the transfer of information to the hippocampus.",
