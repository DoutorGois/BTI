     "AB": "Peripheral administration of adenosine A(1) receptor selective agonists is generally thought to protect the hippocampus against ischemic damage via central actions. We examined the effects of two peripherally administered A(1) agonists, cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) and adenosine amine congener (ADAC), on synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and on indices of cardiovascular function. We conclude that the permeability of these agonists is not sufficient to result in concentrations necessary to activate central adenosine A(1) receptors within the hippocampus.",
