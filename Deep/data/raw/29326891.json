     "AB": "Regular exercise reduces depressive-like behavior activation. In this study, we look for exact roles of exercise on molecular and neuronal mechanisms for antidepressant action by studying the hippocampal neuroplasticity and proliferation. Increased hippocampal neurogenesis with exercise has potential significance for depression. Exercise promotes brain health in the molecular levels in the hippocampus and also affects behavior in a similar way to chronic antidepressant treatment. Wingless (Wnt) and frizzled signaling system plays an important role in cell proliferation, growth, and differentiation during development. Our results demonstrate complicated, differential effects of antidepressants on Wnt signaling system, and assume a role for selected signaling molecules in the neurogenic activity of antidepressant care. Our review suggests that exercise may preserve brain function by increasing neurogenesis through activating Wnt signaling pathway in the psychiatric disorders, such as depression.",
