     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative dementing disorder which is characterised by a progressive atrophy of several brain regions. This process may be visualised in vivo by the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in combination with appropriate volumetric post-processing techniques. Recent volumetric MRI studies in AD consistently found an extensive volume loss of the medial temporal lobe structures including amygdala and hippocampus which appeared already in the early clinical stages of the disorder. This finding is progressive during the clinical course of AD and is associated with other biological markers of the disease such as cerebrospinal fluid beta A 4 levels and apolipoprotein E genotype. With respect to the extent and the distribution of the structural changes, AD may be differentiated from other neuropsychiatric disorders which could facilitate the differential diagnosis in vivo.",
