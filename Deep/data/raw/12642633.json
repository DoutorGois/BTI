     "AB": "We investigated the intracellular distribution of the mRNAs corresponding to the three non-allelic CaM genes in cultured hippocampal cells by in situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled gene-specific riboprobes. In neurons the perikaryon was heavily stained and strong dendritic mRNA targeting was detected for all three CaM genes. The color labeling exhibited a punctate distribution, suggesting that CaM mRNAs are transported in RNA granules. Immunocytochemistry for S100 demonstrated that glial cells express CaM mRNAs at a very low level. A minority of the cultured cells were negative for either labeling.",
