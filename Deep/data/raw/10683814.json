     "AB": "Prolonged depletion of dietary n-3 fatty acid induces a neurological disturbance. To ascertain the deficit of neurotransmission at the time of n-3 deficiency, the concentrations of cAMP and inositol triphosphate, and the activities of protein kinases A and C were examined in vitro in rat hippocampus. Furthermore, the saturation binding study of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, a specific antagonist to muscarinic cholinergic receptor, was performed. Rats were fed a safflower oil diet as the deficient group and a soybean oil diet as the control group. Hippocampi were obtained from rats in the 3rd generation in the deficient group and in the 2nd generation in the control group. Dietary effect was not observed in the parameters except for the concentration of cAMP, which was significantly higher in the deficient group than in the control group.",
