     "AB": "Effect of norepinephrine (NE) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) upon the background activity of neurons in hippocampal slices (field CA3) was investigated during injection transmitter substances to the incubation medium. Both NE and 5-HT may suppress (32 and 49%, respectively) or activate (52 and 35%) the background activity. Activation was observed mainly in the cells without background discharges or with single spike irregular activity. Suppression of activity was observed in the units with \"complex spikes\". Activatory effects of NE, but not of 5-HT, could be imitated by NE against phenylephrine and blocked by alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker phentolamine. Effects of transmitter substances were maintained in the medium with increased Mg2+ concentration.",
