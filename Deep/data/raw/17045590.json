     "AB": "Activity-dependent alteration in synaptic efficacy is referred to as synaptic plasticity and is the believed hallmark of any learning process. Here we employed a recently validated complex maze for spatial training and investigated the impact of repeated and extensive training on basal synaptic transmission of the hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 synaptic connection in vitro. In the present experiments, male CD-1 mice were trained in a complex maze for eight consecutive days five times a day. Subsequently, input-output functions of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) recorded in the CA1 area following stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural fiber pathway were analyzed in acute hippocampal slices. We found a marked right shift of the fEPSP response in trained compared to untrained animals while fiber volley size remained unchanged. The findings provide evidence for a direct implication of homosynaptic hippocampal long-term depression in a spatial learning paradigm.",
