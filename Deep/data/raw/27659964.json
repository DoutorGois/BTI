     "AB": "Erythropoietin (EPO) is important for angiogenesis after hypoxia/ischemia. In this study, we investigated whether recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) can enhance angiogenesis, and promote cognitive function through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling pathway in a rat model of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). RhEPO, selective VEGFR2 inhibitor (SU5416) or vehicle was administrated by intraperitoneal injection. The assessment for cognitive function begins on day 60 after anoxia. Vascular density in hippocampus and white matter damage within corpus callosum were examined on day 28 after anoxia. The expression of erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), VEGF, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma 1 (Raf1), and extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in hippocampus were evaluated on day 7 after anoxia. RhEPO-treated anoxia rats had better cognitive recovery, higher vascular density, and less white matter damage than in the vehicle anoxia rats. These protective effects associated with increased expression of EPOR, VEGF; and increased phosphorylation of Raf1 and ERK1/2. While this up-regulation, and changes in the histopathologic and functional outcomes were abolished by SU5416. Our data indicate that rhEPO can enhance angiogenesis, reduce white matter damage, and promote cognitive recovery through VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway in anoxia rats.",
