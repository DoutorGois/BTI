     "AB": "Synaptic vesicles are organelles that specialize in the storage of a neurotransmitter that continuously undergo an exo-endocytotic cycle. During this cycle vesicles change their positions within a presynaptic terminal and their numbers as well as spatial arrangement can provide insight into a neurotransmitter turnover. This article introduces a technique based on the nearest-neighbor formalism to quantify the proximity of vesicles to active zones and vesicle clustering in different regions of a terminal. The technique, implemented in a software package, uses the two-dimensional coordinates of features identified in digitized electron micrographs as an input. It has been validated in the analysis of asymmetric synapses of the rat hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum affected by transient cerebral ischemia. It was shown that a 15-minute-long ischemic episode influenced the spatial arrangement of vesicles that were more distant from active zones and had larger intervesicle spacings with respect to the control. The latter effect was apparently stronger within 200 nm distance of active zones.",
