     "AB": "Octylphenol (OP) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical that accumulates in various organs. It has also been shown to exert noxious effects on the central nervous system. In the present study, we measured in Sprague-Dawley rats the degree of OP accumulation in different areas of the brain and investigated the effect of OP in pain modulation. Two groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 20 days with 50mg/kg BW/day of OP (group 1) or vehicle (group 2). At the end of the treatment, the formalin test was performed to evaluate the effect of OP exposure on pain. Soon after, rats were sacrificed, and the accumulation of OP in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, thalamus, striatum, mesencephalus and ventral hindbrain was measured by HPLC analysis. The results showed a greater accumulation of OP in the cerebral cortex compared to all the other areas; there was also more accumulation in the cerebellum compared to the mesencephalus and thalamus. No accumulation was found in the striatum. These results suggest that there is a preferential accumulation of OP in different areas of the brain with consequences to neural behaviour. On the contrary, experiments on facial grooming did not show significant effects of OP on pain.",
