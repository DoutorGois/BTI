     "AB": "Substance P (SP) is known to be involved in processes related to learning and memory, fear, anxiety and stress. SP and NK1 receptors are localized in the hippocampus, a brain structure involved in learning and memory as well as emotional processes. As there is evidence for differential functions of the ventral (VH) and dorsal (DH) hippocampus in a variety of behaviors, we here evaluated the effects of injections of SP into the VH and DH in rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and open field (OF) tests. The results obtained showed that infusions of 100 and 1000 ng of SP into the DH, but not VH, increased open arm activity in the EPM and in the central zone of the OF, indicative of anxiolytic-like action. These effects were observed in the absence of significant changes in general motor activity. In an additional experiment to examine whether these effects of SP are mediated by local serotoninergic mechanisms, extracellular concentrations of this monoamine were assessed by use of in vivo microdialysis. Infusions of SP into the DH did not influence the extracellular concentration of serotonin. These data indicate that neurokinins in the DH, but not VH, are involved in mechanisms associated with anxiety and that the mediation of SP in anxiety-related behaviors is independent of local serotonergic mechanisms.",
