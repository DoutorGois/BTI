     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer neuropathology (AD) is found in almost half of patients with non-semantic primary progressive aphasia (PPA). This study examined hippocampal abnormalities in PPA to determine similarities to those described in amnestic AD. METHODS: In 37 PPA patients and 32 healthy controls, we generated hippocampal subfield surface maps from structural MRIs and administered a face memory test. We analyzed group and hemisphere differences for surface shape measures and their relationship with test scores and ApoE genotype. RESULTS: The hippocampus in PPA showed inward deformity (CA1 and subiculum subfields) and outward deformity (CA2-4+DG subfield) and smaller left than right volumes. Memory performance was related to hippocampal shape abnormalities in PPA patients, but not controls, even in the absence of memory impairments. CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal deformity in PPA is related to memory test scores. This may reflect a combination of intrinsic degenerative phenomena with transsynaptic or Wallerian effects of neocortical neuronal loss.",
