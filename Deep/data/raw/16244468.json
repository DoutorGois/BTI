     "AB": "In non-avian reptiles the medial and dorsal cortices are putative homologues of the hippocampal formation in mammals and birds. Studies on mammals and birds commonly report neuro-ecological correlations between hippocampal volume and aspects of spatial ecology. We examined the relationship between putative homologous cortical volumes and spatial use in a population of the squamate reptile, Agkistrodon piscivorus, that exhibits sex differences in spatial use. Do male A. piscivorus that inhabit larger home ranges than females also have larger putative hippocampal volumes? Male and female brains were sectioned and digitized to quantify regional cortical volumes. Although sex differences in dorsal cortex volume were not observed, males had a significantly larger medial cortex relative to telencephalon volume. Similar to studies on mammals and birds, relative hippocampal or medial cortex volume was positively correlated with patterns of spatial use. We demonstrate volumetric sex differences within a reptilian putative hippocampal homologue.",
