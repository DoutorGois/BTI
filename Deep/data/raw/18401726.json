     "AB": "Quantitative analysis of the main cells and interneurons in different layers and fields of Ammon's horn, the hilus, and dentate gyrus was performed two weeks and one month after kindling, i.e., specific electrical stimulation of the ventral hippocampus. At both experimental time points, cells numbers were significantly decreased at all levels of the areas studied except the marginal layer of field CA4. Thus, in this model of experimental epilepsy, the process of epileptogenesis involved both interneurons and main cells in the hippocampus. The possible reorganization of intrahippocampal circuits and their involvement in the increased excitability characteristic of epilepsy are discussed.",
