     "AB": "Creatine (Cr) is required to maintain ATP levels in the brain. The transport of Cr across the blood-brain barrier and into neurones requires a specific creatine transporter (CRT). Mutations in the CRT gene (SLC6A8) result in a novel form of X-linked mental retardation, characterised by developmental delays, seizures and a complete absence of Cr from the brain. To identify cell types and regions that depend on Cr for energy metabolism we have determined the regional and cellular localisation of CRT protein in the rat brain using immunohistochemical techniques with a highly specific, affinity-purified, CRT antibody. The results show high levels of CRT localisation is associated with specific brain regions and certain cell types. The CRT is predominantly found in neurones. CRT immunoreactivity is particularly abundant in the olfactory bulb, granule cells of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, pyramidal neurones of the cerebral cortex, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, motor and sensory cranial nerve nuclei in the brainstem and the dorsal and ventral horns of the spinal cord. Low levels of CRT were seen in the basal ganglia and white matter. Overall, CRT was found to show high intensities of labelling in the major motor and sensory regions of the forebrain, brainstem and spinal cord and forebrain regions associated with learning, memory and limbic functions. It is hypothesised that regions with high CRT expression are likely to have high metabolic ATP requirements and that areas with low CRT levels are those regions which are particularly vulnerable in neurodegenerative diseases.",
