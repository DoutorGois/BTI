     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The deposition of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) is one of the pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and can disrupt circadian rhythm and impair learning and memory. Exendin-4, a therapeutic drug for type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), exerts neuroprotective effects from the toxicity of Abeta. However, it is not clear whether Exendin-4 protects against Abeta-induced disruption of circadian rhythm. The neuroprotective effects of Exendin-4 have been studied using injection of Exendin-4 into the lateral ventricle and abdomen. However, these procedures are not suitable for clinical application. METHODS: First, male C57BL/6 mice received triple distilled water or Exendin-4 (0.1 nmol, 0.5 nmol) by intranasal administration. Exendin-4 levels were measured in the hippocampal samples using an ELISA Kit. Then, the study examined whether intranasal or hippocampal administration of Exendin-4 antagonized Abeta-induced disruption of circadian rhythm as well as impairment of learning and memory using the wheel-running activity assay and the Morris water maze test. RESULTS: The study showed that intranasally administered Exendin-4 passed through the blood-brain barrier. Abeta31-35 given by intrahippocampal injection disrupted circadian rhythm and impaired learning and memory in C57BL/6 mice, and Exendin-4 given by nasal cavity or hippocampal administration ameliorated Abeta31-35-induced circadian rhythm disturbance of locomotor activity and impairment of learning and memory. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide pivotal experimental support for further study of the neuroprotective effects and clinical application of Exendin-4.",
