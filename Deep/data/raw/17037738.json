     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the expression rule of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1alpha) and erythropoietion (EPO) in the formation of vascular dementia (VD) and investigate the possible pathogenesis of VD. METHODS: Rats of experimental group were treated with a permanent bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA) occlusion (2-VO) for establishing vascular dementia model. Rats were evaluated on learning-memory ability by Y-type water maze test. The dynamic expression of HIF-1alpha and EPO in hippocampal CA1 region were measured by immunohistochemical assay method. RESULTS: (1) The learning-memory ability of rats in VD groups was progressively decreased as the ischemic duration prolonged (P < 0.05); (2) In VD group, the expression of HIF-1alpha and EPO in hippocampal CA1 region were most obvious at 1 w, and then declined progressively but still above the normal level (P < 0.01); (3) In VD group, the expression of HIF-1alpha and EPO at each ischemic point and their corresponding learning-memory ability were in significant correlation at the 0.01 level. CONCLUSION: Both HIF-1alpha and EPO contribute to the formation of VD, and HIF-1/EPO anoxic signal transduction may play a protecting role in this process.",
