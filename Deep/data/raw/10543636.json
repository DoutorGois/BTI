     "AB": "We compared two MR imaging sequences, fast inversion recovery for myelin suppression (FIRMS) and echo-planar FIRMS (EP-FIRMS), for depicting gray/white matter contrast. In 18 patients, the frequency bandwidth (BW) was optimized for each sequence; in nine patients, the BW was held constant. In the BW-optimized group, the mean contrast-to-noise ratio (C/N) was three times higher with the FIRMS sequence. In the BW-constant group, the mean C/N was 27% higher with the EP-FIRMS sequence; however, geometric distortion degraded the EP-FIRMS images excessively. For optimal gray/white contrast, FIRMS appears to be the superior pulse sequence.",
