     "AB": "The immunophilin homolog FKBP8 has been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis. Here we show that the 38-kDa form of FKBP8 (FKBP38) derives from a truncated ORF. The extended FKBP8 ORFs are 46 and 44 kDa in mouse and 45 kDa in human. Although the genomic organization of mouse and human FKBP8 is evolutionarily conserved, additional first exons are encoded by the murine locus. A 4.4-kb murine Fkbp8 gene fragment, containing a GC-rich potential promoter, directed expression of a LacZ reporter gene to forebrain neurons in transgenic mice. Expression of the transgene was observed in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus in transgenic mice from three lines. One transgenic founder mouse exhibited widespread forebrain expression of the LacZ transgene that resembles the pattern for the endogenous Fkbp8 gene. Thus promoter/enhancer elements for forebrain expression are located around the first exons of the mouse Fkbp8 gene.",
