     "AB": "The novel compound 2-amino-4,5-(1,2-cyclohexyl)-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (NPC 12626) was evaluated for activity in a variety of tests associated with receptors for excitatory amino acids. NPC 12626 failed to inhibit the specific binding of RS-[3H] amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid or [3H] kainic acid to brain membranes in vitro but displaced both agonist and antagonist binding to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. Like cis-(+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid, NPC 12626 competitively blocked NMDA-induced enhancement of [3H]-1-thienylcyclohexyl)piperidine binding. In the voltage-clamped frog oocyte expression system, NPC 12626 was a competitive inhibitor of NMDA-evoked inward current with a pA2 of 6.24. After both i.c.v. or i.p. administration, NPC 12626 was a potent anticonvulsant in the pentylenetetrazol, maximal electroshock and NMDA seizure models. Furthermore, low doses (25 mg/kg) of NPC 12626 given i.v. were effective in preventing damage to the CA1 region of hippocampus in the gerbil model of global ischemia. Unlike the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, phencyclidine, but like cis-(+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid and pentobarbital, NPC 12626 only partially substituted for phencyclidine in a drug discrimination study. The results of the current study indicate that NPC 12626 is a novel, systemically active and competitive NMDA receptor antagonist.",
