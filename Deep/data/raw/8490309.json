     "AB": "The protective effect of astrocytes on hippocampal neurons against kainate-induced toxicity was investigated using neuron-specific enolase as an indicator of neuronal death. Astrocyte-rich and astrocyte-poor mixed rat hippocampal cultures were submitted to various concentrations of kainate. At each kainate concentration, the amount of NSE released by neurons was significantly greater in astrocyte-poor than in astrocyte-rich cultures (p < 0.05). This protective effect was not observed when neuronal survival was tested on astrocyte-poor cultures in astrocyte-conditioned culture medium with or without 10(-4) M kainate. In conclusion, astrocytes significantly attenuate kainate toxicity on hippocampal neurons, and this effect is not mediated by a diffusible factor.",
