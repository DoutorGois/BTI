     "AB": "Although several advances have occurred concerning the use of electroconvulsive therapy, little progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic or side effects. Na(+),K(+)-ATPase is an important enzyme of central nervous system, responsible for ionic gradient maintenance and consumption of approximately 40-50% of brain ATP. This work was performed in order to determine Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity after acute and chronic electroconvulsive shock. Results showed an inhibition of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in the hippocampus 48 h, 7, 30, 60 and 90 days after a single electroconvulsive shock. Chronic treatment diminished the enzyme activity in the hippocampus 7 and 30 days after electroconvulsive (ECS) sessions. Our findings demonstrated that Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity is altered by ECS.",
