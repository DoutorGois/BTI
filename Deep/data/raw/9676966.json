     "AB": "To assess the working memory system for egocentric distance and place information, delayed matching-to-sample (DMTS) go/no-go tasks were run for each rat. To assess the reference memory system, and to serve as a control for nonmemory deficits, successive discrimination go/no-go tasks were then conducted using the same rats. Rats with hippocampal, but not parietal cortex, lesions were impaired relative to controls in the working memory (DMTS) task for both egocentric distance and place information, although the deficit observed in the working memory task for egocentric distance information by rats with hippocampal lesions was mild. Neither hippocampal nor parietal cortex lesioned rats were impaired relative to controls in the reference memory (successive discrimination) task for either cue. The hippocampus appears to be involved in working memory for egocentric distance and in spatial location information, whereas the parietal cortex is not.",
