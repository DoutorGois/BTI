     "AB": "Changes in the morphology of dendritic spines are prominent during learning and in different neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, including those in which glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) has been implicated. Despite much evidence of the involvement of GSK-3beta in functional synaptic plasticity, it is unclear how GSK-3beta controls structural synaptic plasticity (i.e., the number and shape of dendritic spines). In the present study, we used two mouse models overexpressing and lacking GSK-3beta in neurons to investigate how GSK-3beta affects the structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Following visualization of dendritic spines with DiI dye, we found that increasing GSK-3beta activity increased the number of thin spines, whereas lacking GSK-3beta increased the number of stubby spines in the dentate gyrus. Under conditions of neuronal excitation, increasing GSK-3beta activity caused higher activity of extracellularly acting matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and MMP inhibition normalized thin spines in GSK-3beta overexpressing mice. Administration of the nonspecific GSK-3beta inhibitor lithium in animals with active MMP-9 and animals lacking MMP-9 revealed that GSK-3beta and MMP-9 act in concert to control dendritic spine morphology. Altogether, our data demonstrate that the dysregulation of GSK-3beta activity has dramatic consequences on dendritic spine morphology, implicating MMP-9 as a mediator of GSK-3beta-induced synaptic alterations.",
