Investigation of the pathomorphology of the experimental infection in white mice with with manifest clinical picture revealed acute meningoencephalomyelitis characterized by marked disorders in the central nervous system. In white rats and rabbits showing no symptoms of disease chronic affection of the CNS was established characterized by signs of encephalomyelopathy pathomorphologically similar to lesions observed in human cases of encephalopathy.",
