     "AB": "Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is associated with reduced overall brain volume. Although this has been reported consistently across studies, the status of cortical thickness after PAE is more variable. The cortex is asymmetric in typical controls, but it is unclear whether the left and right counter parts of the cortical gray matter are unevenly influenced in postpartum brain development after PAE. Brain MRI was acquired in a newly recruited sample of 157 participants (PAE: N = 78, 5.5-18.9 years, 40 females and controls: N = 79, 5.8-18.5 years, 44 females) across four Canadian sites in the NeuroDevNet project. The PAE group had other confounds such as psychiatric co-morbidity, different living environment, and so on, not present in the control group. In agreement with previous studies, the volumes of all brain structures were reduced in PAE compared to controls, including gray and white matter of cerebrum and cerebellum, and all deep gray matter including the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, caudate, putamen, and pallidum. The PAE group showed reductions in global and regional cortical thickness, while the pattern and degree of cortical thickness asymmetry were preserved in PAE participants with the greatest rightward asymmetry in the lateral parietal lobe and the greatest leftward asymmetry in the lateral frontal cortex. This persistent asymmetry reflects that the homologous left and right cortical regions followed typical relative developmental patterns in the PAE group despite being thinner bilaterally than controls.
