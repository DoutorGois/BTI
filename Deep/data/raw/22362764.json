     "AB": "Polymorphisms within intron 2 of the CNR1 gene, which encodes cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB(1)), have been associated with addiction, obesity, and brain volume deficits. We used comparative genomics to identify a polymorphic (rs9444584-C/T) sequence (ECR1) in intron 2 of the CNR1 gene that had been conserved for 310 million years. The C-allele of ECR1 (ECR1(C)) acted as an enhancer in hypothalamic and dorsal root ganglia cells and responded to MAPK activation through the MEKK pathway but not in hippocampal cells. However, ECR1(T) was significantly more active in hypothalamic and dorsal root ganglia cells but, significantly, and in contrast to ECR1(C), was highly active in hippocampal cells where it also responded strongly to activation of MAPK. Intriguingly, rs9444584 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with two other SNPs (rs9450898 (r(2) = 0.841) and rs2023239 (r(2) = 0.920)) that have been associated with addiction, obesity (rs2023239), and reduced fronto-temporal white matter volumes in schizophrenia patients as a result of cannabis misuse (rs9450898). Considering their high linkage disequilibrium and the increased response of ECR1(T) to MAPK signaling when compared with ECR1(C), it is possible that the functional effects of the different alleles of rs9444584 may play a role in the conditions associated with rs9450898 and rs2023239. Further analysis of the different alleles of ECR1 may lead to a greater understanding of the role of CNR1 gene misregulation in these conditions as well as chronic inflammatory pain.",
