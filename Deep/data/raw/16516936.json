     "AB": "In the Morris Water Maze (MWM), an animal learns the location of a hidden platform relative to distal visual cues in a process known as spatial learning. The visual cues used in MWM experiments are invariably salient in nature, and non-salient cues, such as subtle environmental variations, have not traditionally been considered to play a significant role. However, the role of non-salient cues in spatial navigation has not been adequately investigated experimentally. The objective of this experiment was therefore to determine the relative contribution of salient and non-salient visual cues to spatial navigation in the MWM. Animals were presented with an environment containing both types of visual cues, and were tested in three successive phases of water maze testing, each with a new platform location. Probe tests were used to assess spatial accuracy, and several cue variation trials were run in which both salient and non-salient visual cues were manipulated. It was observed that removal of the salient visual cues did not cause a significant deterioration in performance unless accompanied by disruption of the non-salient visual cues, and that spatial navigation was unimpaired when only the salient visual cues were removed from view. This suggests that during place learning in Long-Evans rats, non-salient visual cues may play a dominant role, at least when salient cue presentation is limited to four cues.",
