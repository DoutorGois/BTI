     "AB": "Nucleoside transporters may play a role in regulating levels of extracellular adenosine and adenosine receptor activity. Two members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family have recently been cloned. ENT1 is potently inhibited by nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) (K(i) approximately 1 nM) and was previously found to have a wide distribution in rat and human brain. ENT2 is insensitive to inhibition by NBMPR at low nanomolar concentrations and there is limited information describing its distribution in rat brain. The present study used RT-PCR, northern blot and in situ hybridization and detected rENT2 transcript in several brain regions including hippocampus, cortex, striatum and cerebellum. Our results indicate a wide cellular and regional distribution for ENT2 in rat brain, similar to ENT1, indicating that control of adenosine levels in brain is achieved by multiple transport processes.",
