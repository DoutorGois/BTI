     "AB": "Head direction (HD) cells located in several regions of the brain, including the postsubiculum, retrosplenial cortex, lateral dorsal thalamic nucleus, anterior dorsal thalamic nucleus, and lateral mammillary nucleus, provide a signal of the rat's momentary directional heading. Experimental evidence suggests that vestibular inputs are critical for the maintenance these cells' directional sensitivity. However, it is still unclear how vestibular information is conveyed to the HD cell-related circuitry. In a recent study, the supragenual nucleus (SG) was suggested as a putative relay of vestibular inputs to this circuitry. In the present study, using anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing methods, we first investigated whether the SG is in a position to convey vestibular inputs. Next, we examined the projections of the SG with the Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin method. Our results indicate that the SG receives direct inputs from the medial vestibular nucleus and projects to elements of the HD cell-related circuitry, providing a massive input to the contralateral dorsal tegmental nucleus and a moderately dense projection to the shell region of the lateral mammillary nucleus. Overall, the present findings serve to clarify how vestibular inputs reach the HD cell-related circuit and point out the SG as an important interface to this end.",
