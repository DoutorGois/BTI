     "AB": "The expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2, mGluR3, mGluR4, and mGluR5) and dendritic cytoplasmic BC1 RNA in the hippocampus and frontal neocortex of Wistar rats was studied 1 and 4 weeks after intrahippocampal microinjection of kainic acid. The efficiency of glutamatergic transmission was shown to change not only in the injured hippocampus, but also in the neocortex. It was associated with variations in the expression of presynaptic (mGluR2, mGluR3, and mGluR4) and postsynaptic receptors (mGluR5).",
