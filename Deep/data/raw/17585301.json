     "AB": "Recent advances in the neural stem cell field have provided a wealth of methods for generating large amounts of purified neuronal precursor cells. It has become a question of paramount importance to determine whether these cells integrate and interact with established neural circuitry after engraftment. In principle, neurons have to fulfill three basic functions: receive incoming signals via synapses, compute and forward processed information to other neurons or effector cells. It is anticipated that functionally integrating stem cell-derived donor neurons perform accordingly. Here we provide protocols for the efficient electrophysiological evaluation of engrafted cells and highlight current limitations thereof.",
