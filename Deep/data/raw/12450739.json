     "AB": "The activity of soluble and membrane-bound pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase Type-1 (PAP I) was evaluated in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus, brain cortex, and pituitary gland of rats after applying certain hydromineral challenges. Compared to euhydrated rats, decreased enzyme activity was found in the hypophysis of rats deprived of water for 48 h, or rats drinking ad libitum hypertonic sodium chloride solution (2%) for 6 days or distilled water for 6 days and then submitted to acute water overload. PAP I cleaves the pGlu-amino acid bond of neuropeptides such as thyroliberin, luliberin, neurotensin, and bombesin. The decay of particulate PAP I activity may cause an increase of these pyroglutamate peptides in the whole pituitary. Although the deleterious or pro-homeostatic influence of this decay remains to be elucidated, the present data provide evidence for the involvement of this enzyme activity at this anatomical location in the water-electrolyte imbalance.",
