     "AB": "Development of the hippocampus is not entirely preprogrammed; its structure and function are sensitive to postnatal experience. For instance, neonatal handling/exposure to novelty and peripubertal environmental enrichment enhance hippocampal function and related memory abilities. However, these complex environmental manipulations make it difficult to deduce the primary stimuli that drive more rapid hippocampal maturation, and few experiments have studied the neural mechanisms that support the behavioral modifications. To address these issues, I performed early eyelid opening in rat pups and examined developmental alterations in exploration of a Y-maze and in synaptic transmission measured in hippocampal slices. Early eyelid opening accelerated development of spontaneous alternation. Additionally, early eyelid opening promoted more rapid remodeling of afferent input to the dentate gyrus and area CA1 as well as earlier maturation of perforant path synaptic physiology. These findings implicate visual input as an extrinsic factor that drives hippocampal development and the emergence of hippocampal-dependent behavior.",
