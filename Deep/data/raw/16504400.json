     "AB": "It is known that maternal deprivation induces hippocampal damage in the developing brains. In the present study, we examined the effects of melatonin on maternal deprivation-induced hippocampal damage both during and after stress-hyporesponsive period (SHRP). Hippocampal damage was examined by cresyl violet staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The results showed that a single episode of maternal deprivation for 24 h at post-SHRP induced neuronal loss in hippocampus regions of the brain in the infant rats, while it did not influence hippocampal neurons in SHRP. Melatonin prevented maternal deprivation-induced hippocampal damage in the infant rats at post-SHRP. These results suggest that melatonin is a potentially beneficial agent to improve the neurobehavioral outcomes of maternal deprivation in later developmental period.",
