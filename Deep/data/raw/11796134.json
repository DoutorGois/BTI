     "AB": "Postnatal development in the expression of dopamine D1-like and D2-like receptors was investigated in peripheral blood lymphocytes of male Wistar rats aged 1, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age by radioligand binding assay techniques. Sample of frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus were also investigated as reference tissues. The dopamine D1-like receptor antagonist [3H]SCH 23390 and the dopamine D2-like receptor agonist [3H]7-OH-DPAT were used as radioligands. The affinity (K(d)) of [3H]SCH 23390 or of [3H]7-OH-DPAT binding was unchanged in lymphocytes of rats of different age groups. The density (B(max)) of [3H]SCH 23390 binding sites increased from the 1st to the 3rd week of age, remained constant from the 3rd to the 8th week of age, and then increased slightly at 12 and 16 weeks of age. The B(max) value of [3H]7-OH-DPAT binding to lymphocytes increased from the 1st to the 3rd week of age, remained constant from the 3rd to the 4th week, increased again until the 12th week and then plateaued. Dopamine D1-like and D2-like receptor maturation in frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum revealed an increased receptor density until the 4th week of age and a relative stabilization of receptor density values between the 4th to the 12th week depending on the area considered. Comparatively postnatal maturation of lymphocyte dopamine D1-like receptors displayed a pattern different from that of brain areas investigated, whereas maturation of D2-like receptors displayed a pattern similar to that of striatum. The quantitative and/or qualitative dissimilarities between development of lymphocyte and brain dopamine receptors suggest that from a developmental point of view lymphocyte dopamine receptors probably cannot be considered as a marker of homologous brain receptors.",
