     "AB": "The effects of barium on stimulus-induced rises in [K+]o were studied in the dentate gyrus (DG) and area CA1 of human hippocampal slices. Rises in [K+]o elicited by repetitive stimulation of the hilus, stratum moleculare, alveus, or stratum radiatum were dependent on stimulus intensity and frequency. Barium augmented rises in [K+]o in the DG by about 120% but failed to do so in area CA1. In both DG and area CA1 barium had no effects on population spikes whereas stimulus-induced slow field potentials were reduced. Since barium interferes with K+ uptake and redistribution by blocking leak conductances and inwardly-rectifying currents in astrocytes, our findings suggest that glial cells in the sclerotic hippocampal area CA1 may contribute less to K+ regulation.",
