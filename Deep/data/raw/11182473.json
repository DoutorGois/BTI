     "AB": "Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in eleven elderly subjects during pairings of tone and air puff were compared to rCBF changes during pairings in young subjects. Although all subjects reported being aware of the relationship between tone and air puff, elderly subjects did not condition as well as young subjects and their rCBF measures were attenuated. Covarying the performance differences between young and old subjects did not change this conclusion suggesting that differences in neural activation during learning are related to binding of CS-US information prior to the impact of the association on performance. Both groups showed learning-specific rCBF changes in cerebellum, inferior right prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate. However, only in young subjects were there learning-specific changes in rCBF in left temporal cortex, midbrain, caudate, and inferior left prefrontal cortex. Analysis of learning-dependent patterns of functional connectivity of inferior left prefrontal cortex showed only young subjects had a strong left prefrontal functional connectivity with cerebellum, hippocampus, thalamus and temporal cortex. Thus, beyond changes in regional activity, these data also suggest that age may alter the operations of functional networks underlying learning and memory.",
