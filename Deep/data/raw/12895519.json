     "AB": "Abnormal corticosteroid release is extensively associated with mood disorders. This association may result from the toxic actions of endogenous corticosteroids which can induce apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Similarly, dexamethasone, a synthetic corticosteroid, can induce lethal and sublethal damage to rat hippocampal and striatal neurons and can result in steroid-induced psychoses in humans. The experiments reported here tested the hypothesis that pre-treatment with oestrogen would also attenuate dexamethasone-induced neuronal damage as oestrogens have neuroprotective actions against a variety of insults and falling levels of oestrogen are associated with increased vulnerability to mood disorders. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received three systemic injections which were a combination of vehicle, 17-beta-oestradiol (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.), the oestrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen (10 mg/kg, s.c.) and dexamethasone (0.7 mg/kg, i.p.) and were killed 24 h after the final injection. Injections of dexamethasone (when preceded by vehicle injections) resulted in elevated levels of apoptosis and sub-lethal damage, as demonstrated by reduced levels of microtubule-associated protein-2-immunopositive neurons, in the striatum and hippocampus. This damage was regional with the dorsomedial caudate putamen and the dentate gyrus and CA1 and CA3 hippocampal sub-fields being particularly affected. Pretreatment with oestrogen substantially attenuated the dexamethasone-induced neuronal damage. This oestrogen-induced neuronal protection was in turn virtually eliminated by giving an initial injection of tamoxifen. These results suggest, therefore, that oestrogens can protect from corticosteroid-induced neuronal damage via an oestrogen receptor-mediated process.",
