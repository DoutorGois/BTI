     "AB": "4,4'-Butylidenebis(6-t-butyl-m-cresol) (BBBC) can be eluted from disposable gloves made of nitrile-butadiene rubber and possibly also detected in food. We have reported that BBBC is an androgen and estrogen antagonist. In this report, BBBC (0.1, 1.0 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day) was subcutaneously administered to pregnant rats from gestation days 11 through 18 and the effects on male offspring (postnatal day (PND) 102) were examined. Body weight at lactation and brain weight at PND 102 were decreased in the 1.0 mg/kg bw BBBC-treated group. Altered levels and turnover of the monoamines dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and noradrenalin (NA) as well as their metabolites were detected. In the prefrontal cortex DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) levels were significantly increased, but homovanillic acid (HVA)/DA was decreased. In the striatum NA level, DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA were significantly increased, but 3-methoxy-4-hydrophenylglycol hemipiperazinium (MHPG) level and MHPG/NA were decreased. In hippocampus MHPG level was significantly decreased. In hypothalamus 5-HIAA level and 5-HIAA/5-HT were significantly increased. These results suggested that prenatal exposure to BBBC affects the central nervous system of male rat offspring, and BBBC may be an endocrine disrupting-chemical during the fetal periods.",
