     "AB": "Ifenprodil, a cerebral vasodilator and non-competitive glutamate antagonist, is also an anti-ischaemic agent; it has been shown to inhibit both forms of MAO in rat brain and lung (with slightly greater potency towards MAO-A), but it does not inhibit SSAO. The effects of ifenprodil on rat brain regional levels of monoamines and their principal metabolites following transient global ischaemia have been investigated 1 h after reperfusion. Among the three most ischaemically vulnerable brain regions (striatum, hippocampus and cortex), striatal DA, DOPAC, HVA, 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels were the most markedly increased. Simultaneous treatment with ifenprodil during reperfusion reversed the increases in the striatum, except for HVA, to the level similar to those of sham-operated controls. In contrast to the striatum, ifenprodil failed to reverse the increases seen in the cortex and hippocampus.",
