     "AB": "The effect of MK-801 (0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg) on the extracellular concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in rat hippocampus and striatum was studied using intracerebral dialysis. The dialysate 5-HT concentration was dose-dependently increased by MK-801 in both regions. In the hippocampus, at the higher drug dose a slow increase in the 5-HIAA level was observed, and this became significant 3 h after treatment. In contrast to this, the extracellular 5-HIAA content in the striatum was significantly decreased 150 min after administration of both doses of MK-801. The data are discussed in the light of the known behavioural effects of MK-801 and possible N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor regulation of 5-HT release.",
