     "AB": "The beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) aggregation in the brain, known as amyloid plaques, is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aberrant interaction of Cu(2+) ion with Abeta potentiates AD by inducing Abeta aggregation and generating neurotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, the biosynthesized recombinant Abeta(1-40) was, for the first time, used to investigate the mechanism for heme to prevent Abeta(1-40) aggregation and its cytotoxicity. Cell viability studies of SH-SY5Y cells and rat primary hippocampal neurons showed that exogenous heme can protect the cells by reducing cytotoxicity in the presence of Cu(2+) and/or Abeta(1-40). UV-vis spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and differential pulse voltammetry were applied to examine the interaction between heme and Abeta(1-40). It was proven that a heme-Abeta(1-40) complex is formed and can stabilize the alpha-helix structure of Abeta(1-40) to inhibit Abeta(1-40) aggregation. The heme-Abeta(1-40) complex possesses peroxidase activity and it may catalyze the decomposition of H(2)O(2), reduce the generation of ROS downstream, and ultimately protect the cells. These results indicated that exogenous heme is able to alleviate the cytotoxicity induced by Abeta(1-40) and Cu(2+). This information may be a foundation to develop a potential strategy to treat AD.",
