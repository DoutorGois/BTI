     "AB": "We previously showed that the initial acquisition session of a spatial discrimination (mixed reference/working memory) test in an 8-arm radial maze induced differential activations in the ascending cholinergic septo-hippocampal and nBM-cortical pathways in mice. This data showed that the duration of post-test cholinergic activation was longer in the nBM-cortical pathway than in the septo-hippocampal projection. Moreover, the post-test durations but not the immediate post-test amplitudes of activation in each pathway decreased progressively as a function of repeated daily acquisition sessions. In the present study we have thus tested the hypotheses that the time-courses of post-test cholinergic activation in the septo-hippocampal and nBM-cortical pathways may vary both as a function of the type of memory used (working vs. reference) and according to the duration of repeated daily testing. Cholinergic activity in vivo in the hippocampus or frontal cortex of mice was quantified using measures of sodium-dependent high-affinity choline uptake at two different times (30 s and 15 min) following specific spatial working or reference memory testing in an 8-arm radial maze. The memory tests were administered daily over a 13-day period to attain high levels of performance in each type of task. In comparison to control groups both types of memory testing induced significant post-test cholinergic activations in each brain region on Day 15. However, cholinergic activity remained elevated in frontal cortex at 15 min post-test following reference memory testing, whereas significantly shorter durations of cortical and hippocampal cholinergic activation were observed following working memory testing using short (1 min) retention intervals. The possible significance of these differential modifications to the time-course of the post-test activations in these cholinergic pathways in working and reference memory processes and the putative transsynaptic mechanisms involved are discussed.",
