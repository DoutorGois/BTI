     "AB": "Neuronal degeneration followed by glial activation (microglia and astrocytes) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression in the hippocampus was investigated at 3 months after domoic acid (DA) administration and compared with DA treated rats at 5 days time interval which was reported earlier. Massive degeneration with complete absence of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions and hypertrophied microglial cells showing intense immunoreaction with the antibody OX-42 was observed at 3 months after DA administration. Sparsely distributed OX-42 positive microglial cells were observed in the hippocampus of control rats at 3 months after saline treatment No apparent changes could be observed in the immunoreactivity of GFAP at 3 months after saline and DA administration. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase immunoreactive neurons were completely absent in the hippocampus at 3 months after DA administration. In contrast, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemical analysis revealed absence of NADPH-d reactivity in the neurons, but positive reactivity in the microglial cells of CA1-CA3 regions in the hippocampus after DA treatment. Double immunofluorescense revealed co-expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase with immunoreactive OX-42 positive microglial cells in the hippocampal subfields at 3 months after DA administration. The microglia-produced NO appears to be a secondary phenomenon in the prolonged inflammatory process following DA-induced neuronal degeneration.",
