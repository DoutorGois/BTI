     "AB": "Neurotoxic effects of the combined exposure of rats to carbon disulphide (CS2) and ethanol (EtOH) were studied. Biochemical and ultrastructural evaluation of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) was performed. Male Wistar rats were exposed to CS2 vapour (0.8 mg/l air) and to 10% alcohol in the drinking water for 8 months. EtOH elevated the increase in beta-glucuronidase activity caused by CS2 in the hippocampus and in the cerebral cortex. No effect on the high-affinity synaptosomal uptake of L-glutamate and GABA was observed and no marked ultrastructural changes in the tested brain regions were found. In the peripheral nerves CS2 alone evoked axonal degeneration whereas CS2 combined with EtOH caused disturbances in myelin. Ultrastructural changes preceded biochemical alterations in the PNS and the biochemical indicators of peripheral neuropathy such as beta-glucuronidase activity and cholesterol ester content were not significantly affected. It is suggested that CS2 and EtOH combined affect both PNS and CNS to a higher extent than each of these substances alone.",
