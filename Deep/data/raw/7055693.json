     "PG": "162-70",
     "AB": "The projection of the septum to the dentate gyrus has been demonstrated autoradiographically and the pattern of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining in the dentate gyrus has been mapped histochemically, in a series of normal young adult rats and in a group of animals in which the entorhinal cortex had been ablated or its efferents to the dentate gyrus interrupted, some weeks earlier. It is clear from this material that the normal disposition of the septal projection to the dentate gyrus differs significantly from the pattern of AChE staining; however, in the denervated region of the molecular layer in the experimental animals there is a marked increase in the density of the septal projection which precisely coincides with the zone of intensification of AChE staining. It follows from this that although the distribution AChE does not accurately reflect the organization of the septo-dentate projection in normal animals, the intensification of AChE staining provides a good indication of the reorganization which occurs in this pathway following entorhinal deafferentation.",
