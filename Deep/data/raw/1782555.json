In groups with lesions in either bilateral dorsal or ventral hippocampus, stimulations required for kindling were almost the same as those of controls. In the group with lesion of the entire hippocampus, kindling development was remarkably slow especially in the early stage of the kindling process. However, kindling effect was finally established in all groups.",
