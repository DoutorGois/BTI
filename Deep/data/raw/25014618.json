     "AB": "Located on 6q15 and 1p36.11, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CNR2) genes are considered to be a positional and functional candidate gene for the development of mental disorders such as schizophrenia because CNR1 is known as a regulator of dopamine signaling in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. However, few genetic studies have been carried out to investigate an association of CNR1 and CNR2 polymorphisms and the risk of schizophrenia. In this study, although the result indicates that CNR1 and CNR2 variations are unlikely to influence schizophrenia susceptibility in a Korean population, the findings would provide meaningful information for further genetic studies.",
