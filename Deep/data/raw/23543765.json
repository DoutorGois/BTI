     "AB": "Lead is found in small but appreciable quantities in air, soil drinking water and food. Exposure to such amounts of lead does not cause acute lead toxicity, but produces subtle effects, particularly in children. The CDC advocates \"safe\" or \"acceptable\" levels of blood lead up to 10 mug/dl, while OSHA declares blood lead levels up to 40 mug/dl as \"safe\" or \"acceptable\" in the occupationally exposed. The objective of the study was to see if blood levels considered \"safe\" can cause changes in the biogenic neurotransmitters in the developing brain which may cause neurobehavioral defects like hyperactivity and other cognitive disorders. Albino Wistar rats were divided into the control and lead-treated groups. The control group was given unleaded water, while the lead-treated group was fed with 50 ppm lead acetate in drinking water. On day 45 the animals were subjected to a passive avoidance test, their blood analysed for ZPP and lead. They were then sacrificed and the neurotransmitters-Norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolite-methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) estimated in the brain areas associated with learning and memory-the frontal cortex, hippocampus and the striatum by HPLC-ECD. Our results showed significant increases in blood lead, NE and MHPG, while ZPP increase was insignificant. The rats showed neurobehavioral abnormalities as assessed by the passive avoidance test. We concluded that low blood levels of lead cannot be considered \"safe\" or \"acceptable\" as it causes neurotransmitter alterations. Increased NE turnover is implicated in hyperactivity disorders such as ADHD and Tourette syndrome.",
