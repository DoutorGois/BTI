     "AB": "Previously we have shown that low-dose domoic acid (DA) preconditioning produces tolerance to the behavioral effects of high-dose DA. In this study, we used electrocorticography (ECoG) to monitor subtle CNS changes during and after preconditioning. Young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with a left cortical electrode, and acute recordings were obtained during preconditioning by contralateral intrahippocampal administration of either low-dose DA (15 pmoles) or saline, followed by a high-dose DA (100 pmoles) challenge. ECoG data were analyzed by fast Fourier transformation to obtain the percentage of baseline power spectral density (PSD) for delta to gamma frequencies (range: 1.25-100 Hz). Consistent with previous results, behavioral analysis confirmed that low-dose DA preconditioning 60 min before a high-dose DA challenge produced significant reductions in cumulative seizure scores and high level seizure behaviors. ECoG analysis revealed significant reductions in power spectral density across all frequency bands, and high-frequency/high-amplitude spiking in DA preconditioned animals, relative to saline controls. Significant correlations between seizure scores and ECoG power confirmed that behavioral analysis is a reliable marker for seizure analysis. The reduction of power in delta to gamma frequency bands in contralateral cortex does not allow a clear distinction between seizure initiation and seizure propagation, but does provide objective confirmation that pharmacological preconditioning by DA reduces network seizure activity.",
