     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with decreased serum levels of thyroid hormones (THs), increased levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and decreased protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and reelin in the hippocampus. In this study, we have evaluated the effect of subcutaneous administration of levothyroxine (L-T4) on levels of THs and TSH as well as protein expression of BDNF and reelin in AD rats. To make an animal model of AD, amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plus ibotenic acid were infused intrahippocampally, and rats were treated with L-T4 and (or) saline for 10 days. The levels of THs and TSH were measured by ELISA kits. Protein synthesis was detected by Western blotting method. Results have been shown that serum level of THs, BDNF, and reelin protein expression in the hippocampus were significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in AD animals and elevated significantly in AD rats treated with L-T4 (P < 0.01). Data showed that TSH level significantly decreased in AD rats treated with L-T4 (P < 0.05). These findings indicated that L-T4 increased BDNF and reelin protein expression by regulation of serum THs and TSH level in Abeta-induced AD rats.",
