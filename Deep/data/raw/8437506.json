     "AB": "Recently, a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor has been described, whose pharmacology was distinct from that of the already known serotonergic receptors, so that it has been called 5-HT4. Because the lack of a high affinity radioligand, the identification of this receptor depends entirely on functional pharmacological analysis. Its stimulation leads to an increase in cyclic AMP accumulation in mouse embryo colliculi neurons, in guinea pig hippocampus and in human heart. We studied the effect of two indoleamines, 5-HT and 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeO-T), and a benzimidazolone derivative, BIMU 8, in stimulating basal adenylyl cyclase activity in human frontal cortex, and characterized the receptor subtype involved. In membranes prepared from this tissue, 5-HT, 5-MeO-T and BIMU 8 dose-dependently stimulated (13-25%) the basal enzyme activity (220 pmoles cyclic AMP/min/mg protein). 5-MeO-T behaved as a full agonist, BIMU 8 elicited about 60% of the maximal 5-HT effect. The selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT, was devoid of any stimulating activity. ICS 205-930, a low affinity 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, completely reversed the effect of all three agonists at high concentrations. Therefore, the present data are consistent with the 5-HT-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in human frontal cortex resulting by the activation of a 5-HT4 receptor subtype.",
