     "AB": "A significant challenge in modern neuroscience lies in determining the functional connectivity between discrete populations of neurones and brain regions. In this study, a variation of partial directed coherence, the generalized partial directed coherence (gPDC), along with a newly proposed critical value for gPDC, were applied on recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and single-unit activity, in order to assess information flow between medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus and within the hippocampus of the rat brain, under isoflurane anesthesia and kainic acid-induced enhanced neuronal activity. Our findings suggest that, under anesthesia, there exists a continuous information flow from hippocampus towards mPFC, reversed mostly during activity bursts occurring in the mPFC. Moreover, there was a clear directional connection from the lateral towards medial dorsal hippocampus, most prominent in the beta frequency band (10-30 Hz). Kainic acid resulted in partially disrupting the reciprocal cortico-hippocampal connectivity and reversing the intra-hippocampal one. The biological implications of these findings on the effects of anesthesia and kainic acid in brain connectivity, along with implementation issues of gPDC analysis on field potentials and spike trains, are extensively discussed.",
