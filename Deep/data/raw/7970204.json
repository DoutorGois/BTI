     "AB": "The effects of cyclothiazide, a drug which potentiates AMPA receptor-mediated responses and GYKI 52466, a non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, were studied on fast glutamatergic transmission in rat hippocampal slices. Cyclothiazide prolonged the decay of AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs (AMPA-EPSCs) in a concentration-dependent manner. GYKI 52466 reduced the peak amplitude of AMPA-EPSCs and blocked the induction of LTP. When GYKI 52466 was applied in the presence of cyclothiazide it still reduced the peak amplitude of AMPA-EPSCs but was not able to reverse the cyclothiazide induced prolongation of AMPA-EPSC duration. These data suggest that GYKI 52466 and cyclothiazide probably mediate their effects on the AMPA receptor via different binding sites.",
