     "AB": "The effect of castration combined with either long-term treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant drug desipramine or the sex steroid 17 beta-estradiol on serotonin responses in area CA1 of the hippocampus of male and female rats was examined. Using single-electrode current and voltage-clamp techniques serotonin-induced hyperpolarizations and outward currents were recorded from hippocampal pyramidal cells. Neither in male nor in female castrated rats treatment effects were observed on the magnitude of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A mediated outward currents (0.26 nA) and membrane hyperpolarizations (11 mV) induced by superfusion of serotonin (15 microM), or on the effect of serotonin on the afterhyperpolarization and extracellularly recorded population spike. In voltage-clamp experiments using microelectrodes filled with potassium-chloride, but not with potassium-acetate, the sole observable effect was that the membrane resistance drop due to application of serotonin was significantly larger in the ovariectomized group (31% approximately 19 M omega) as compared to the ovariectomized/estrogen supplemented group (23% approximately 15 M omega). Spiperone (3 microM) completely antagonized the serotonin-induced outward currents and input resistance changes under all treatments. Apart from these changes the majority of passive and active membrane properties of cells from ovariectomized animals were not affected by chronic desipramine or steroid treatment. Neither did castration alone, nor in combination with long-term 17 beta-estradiol treatment, affect CA1 pyramidal cell membrane properties of male rats. Since we attained physiological levels of 17 beta-estradiol in the blood plasma (30-50 pg/ml) using subcutaneous silastic implants containing a mixture of cholesterol/estrogen, we conclude that both long-term estrogen and long-term desipramine treatment do not affect serotonergic neurotransmission in CA1 of the rat hippocampus.",
