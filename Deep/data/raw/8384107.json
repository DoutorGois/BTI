     "AB": "We previously demonstrated that metaphit (a phencyclidine analogue with an acylating isothiocyanate group) induces occurrence of audiogenic seizures in mice exposed to audio stimulation 24 h after metaphit administration. We have studied various receptor systems associated with excitatory and inhibitory networks: sites for competitive and noncompetitive antagonists of the N-methyl D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor complex, for [3H]muscimol on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex, and for [3H]batrachotoxinin A20-alpha-benzoate on the voltage-dependent sodium channel. Mice were examined for neurochemical changes at 24 h after pretreatment with metaphit, when susceptibility to audiogenic seizures is greatest. Ex vivo receptor binding studies detected no changes; in vivo labeling of the phencyclidine site in the NMDA receptor complex was reduced by 20% in cortical and midbrain regions. A separate group of experiments was aimed at measuring brain levels of metaphit. One minute after retroorbital administration of [3H]metaphit at a dose sufficient to produce susceptibility to audiogenic seizures 24 h later, the brain level of [3H]metaphit (determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, HPLC) was 49 pmol/mg tissue; at 1, 4, and 24 h, the level was 12, 6, and 1.4 pmol/mg tissue or microM if metaphit was evenly distributed throughout the brain. Although the observed metaphit concentrations during the first 4 h are high enough to acylate receptors, no firm evidence for acylation was found for most of the examined receptors. Finally, the time course of the brain level of metaphit showing a continuous decrease is entirely different from that of development of the seizure susceptibility, which peaks at 18-24 h.",
