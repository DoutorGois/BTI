     "AB": "The neuroprotective efficacy of 2-aminobicyclo[2.1.1]hexane-2,5-dicarboxylic acid-I (ABHxD-I), a rigid agonist of metabotropic glutamate receptors, was studied using a 3-min global cerebral ischaemia model in Mongolian gerbils and the hypoxia/ischaemia model in 7-day-old rats. The effects on brain damage of ABHxD-I (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally or 7.5 microg intracerebroventricularly) administered 30 min before global ischaemia or 30 min after hypoxia/ischaemia was evaluated 14 days after the insults. Treatment of adult gerbils with ABHxD-I injected i.c.v. but not systemically, prevented post-ischaemic hyperthermia and substantially reduced brain damage. These effects may reflect low permeability of the adult blood-brain barrier to ABHxD-I, and the role of reduced body and brain temperature in neuroprotection after its i.c.v. administration. ABHxD-I given either i.p. or i.c.v. to developing rats reduced brain damage by 55 and 37%, respectively, without affecting the body temperature. Due to immaturity and increased post-ischaemic permeability of the blood-brain barrier in developing rats, ABHxD-I may induce neuroprotection by direct interference with brain metabotropic glutamate receptors.",
