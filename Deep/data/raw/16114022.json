     "AB": "We studied electrophysiological and morphological properties of astrocytes in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus in slices. Intracellular application of Lucifer yellow revealed two types of morphology: one with a long process extruding from the cell body, and the other with numerous short processes surrounding the cell body. Their electrophysiological properties were either passive, that is, no detectable voltage-dependent conductance, or complex, with Na+/K+ currents similar to those reported in the Ammon's horn astrocytes. We did not find any morphological correlate to the types of electrophysiological profile or dye coupling. Chelation of cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]i) by BAPTA increased the incidence of detecting a low Na+) conductance and transient outward K+ currents. However, an inwardly rectifying K+ current (Kir), a hallmark of differentiated CA1/3 astrocytes, was not a representative K+-current in the complex dentate astrocytes, suggesting that these astrocytes could retain an immature form of K-currents. Dentate astrocytes may possess a distinct current profile that is different from those in CA1/3 Ammon's horn.",
