     "AB": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC) on exploratory behaviour and memory, independent of its locomotor suppressive effects. Dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) contents were determined in the areas of the brain directly related to such behaviours (hippocampus, striatum and amygdala). An acute dose of delta9-THC led to a decrease in exploratory parameters and motor activity during the holeboard test. The radial arm maze was used to evaluate the effects of this cannabinoid substance on memory. Animals treated with delta9-THC committed more errors in the maze test compared to control, particularly when the retention process was put to test. Furthermore, treatment with delta9-THC led to reduced NA contents in the hippocampus and increased DA contents in the amygdala, without changes in the striatum.",
