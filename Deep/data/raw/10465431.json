     "AB": "Significant changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient of water are observed in nuclear magnetic resonance images of patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, the underlying mechanisms of these apparent diffusion coefficient changes are still unresolved. To analyse possible mechanisms, this study applies nuclear magnetic resonance imaging on a 14.1 Tesla narrow-bore magnet to quantitatively study water diffusion in individually perfused brain slices following exposure to N-methyl-D-aspartate excitotoxicity. The results indicate that brain slices have at least two distinct diffusing water compartments with apparent diffusion coefficients of 0.96+/-0.10x10(-3) mm2/s and 0.06+/-0.01x10(-3) mm2/s. When excitotoxicity was induced with N-methyl-D-aspartate, there was a significant decrease in the fraction of the fast diffusing water component in the slices (P<0.001). However, neither apparent diffusion coefficient changed significantly. Prior treatment with dizocilpine maleate (MK-801) depressed the effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (P<0.01, ANOVA). The results demonstrate brain slice compartmental changes resulting from direct receptor stimulation and provide evidence for tissue water redistribution as an important mechanism for changes in apparent diffusion coefficient seen in clinical magnetic resonance imaging. The brain slice preparation affords a well-controlled method to study the mechanisms of tissue nuclear magnetic resonance contrast, bridging the gap between basic nuclear magnetic resonance studies and clinical magnetic resonance imaging. The brain slice model also offers a new way to test the utility of potential anti-stroke drugs using high field nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.",
