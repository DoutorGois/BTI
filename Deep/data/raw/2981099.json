     "AB": "The effects of guanyl nucleotides on the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to rat hippocampal synaptic membranes were studied. In equilibrium binding studies, gamma-amino-n-butyric acid (GABA) increased and GTP decreased the binding affinity of [3H]flunitrazepam; GTP also caused a decrease in binding capacity. The effect, however, is variable. In studies of the dissociation kinetics of [3H]flunitrazepam using diazepam and the antagonist Ro 15-1788 as the displacers, there was evidence of two dissociation rate constants. GTP increased both the fast- and slow-dissociation rate constants and increased the ratio of the slow-dissociation binding state. The effect of GTP was mimicked by its nonhydrolyzable analogue 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate but not by ATP and occurred when diazepam, but not when Ro 15-1788, was used as the displacer. GABA antagonized the effect of GTP on the dissociation of [3H]flunitrazepam. The nature of the benzodiazepine receptor, its actions, and the possible role of cyclic AMP as a second messenger are discussed.",
