     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the neuroprotective effects of Naoxintong and Zhongfenghuichunwan on neuronal injury in CA1 region of rat hippocampus following transient forebrain ischemia. METHODS: Transient rat forebrain ischemia for 15 min was induced by modified four-vessel occlusion method. The density of survived pyramidal cells (neurons per 1 mm linear length) in CA1 region of the hippocampus was measured under light microscope. RESULTS: In Naoxintong or nimodipine-treated rats, the density of survived pyramidal cells in CA1 region was significantly greater than that of saline group (P<0.05, P<0.001, respectively), but oral administration of Zhongfenghuichunwan had no obvious effect on ischemia-induced neuronal damage in CA1 region. CONCLUSION: Naoxintong can protect CA1 neurons against ischemic insult in rats.",
