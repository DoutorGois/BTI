     "AB": "Electrophysiological characteristics of hippocampal neurones cultured with Pro-Gly-Pro peptide were studied using glutamate excitotoxisity model (excitotoxic damage was induced by 100 mkM glutamate application during 5 min). It was found that negative changes in neurones cultured with 10 mcM Pro-Gly-Pro were less prominent if compared with control ones. Culturing with the peptide significantly affected the following parameters: resting potential (-55 +/- 4 mV in control; -29 +/- 6 MV after glutamate application; -38 +/- 5 MV cultured after glutamate application), action potential amplitude (91 +/- 4; 65 +/- 5; 84 +/- 5 mV), duration (4,3 +/- 0,4; 9,5 +/- 1,6; 5,2 +/- 0,7 ms), depolarization (56 [38, 84]; 27 [21, 35]; 46 [28, 62] MV/Ms) and repolarization (-29 [-38, -27]; -20 [-21, -18]; -29 [-33, -22] M(V)/MS) rates. The data obtained suggest that PGP exhibit its neuroprotective properties on a level of basic electrophysiological characteristics, appropriate cellular mechanisms require further investigations.",
