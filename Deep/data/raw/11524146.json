     "AB": "Status epilepticus (SE) triggers neuronal degeneration comprised of both necrotic and apoptotic components. Here we determined whether internucleosomal DNA fragmentation reflects the severity of SE-induced neuronal damage. We utilized both a systemic (kainic acid) and a focally-induced model of SE in rats. DNA fragmentation was analyzed in rhinal cortex and hippocampus at various time points following SE episodes of varying durations (30-120 min). Radioactively labeled DNA fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The spatial and temporal characteristics of the SE-evoked DNA fragmentation indicated that this marker of apoptosis appears as early as 8 h after SE and reaches peak expression at 48 h. This method permitted us to quantitatively monitor the evolution of the apoptotic component of cell death over the acute post-injury period (8-72 h). Moreover, in both models of SE, the DNA fragmentation varied directly as a linear function of the duration of SE between 30 and 120 min suggesting that this marker should be highly responsive to neuroprotective intervention.",
