     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis if repetition of mild mechanical brain injury induces the pathological process related to Alzheimer's disease. After defining the magnitude of the subthreshold brain injury which does not induce brain tissue damage by a single hit, the subthreshold mild impact (1.0 atm) was repeated 7 times every 24 h. One week after the last impact, abnormal accumulation of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and phosphorylated neurofilament 200 kD (p-NFH) was observed in neuronal perikarya and dendrites. One month after percussion, the number of MAP2-and p-NFH-positive neuronal perikarya was increased and observed in remote areas including the contralateral cortex and the hippocampus. Tau-1 immunoreactivity was increased in deep cortical neurons of the ipsilateral side after dephosphorylation, indicating the accumulation of phosphorylated tau in neuronal perikarya. The abnormal accumulation of cytoskeletal proteins in neuronal perikarya may be due to impaired axonal transport caused by mechanical brain injury. The behavioral study revealed that after repetitive mild percussion, rats show less efficient habituation to a new environment. It is suggested that the repetition of subthreshold mechanical brain injury may trigger cytoskeletal alteration related to neuronal degeneration.",
