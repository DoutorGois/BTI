     "AB": "The hippocampus is a prominent structure to study mechanisms of learning and memory at the cellular level. Long-term potentiation (LTP) as well as long-term depression (LTD) are the major cellular models which could underlie learning and memory formation. LTP and LTD consist of at least two phases, an early protein synthesis-independent transient stage (<4 h; E-LTP, E-LTD) as well as a prolonged phase (>4 h; L-LTP, L-LTD) requiring the synthesis of new proteins. It is known that during E-LTP the further induction of longer lasting LTP is precluded. However, if E-LTP is transformed into L-LTP, the same synapses now allow the induction of LTP again. We reproduced the LTP-results first and then investigated whether hippocampal LTP or LTD also prevents the establishment of subsequent LTD-induction in the same synaptic input. We show that the prior induction of LTP or LTD does not prevent a short-term depression (STD) but occludes LTD in apical dendrites of CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices in vitro during the early phase of LTP or LTD. However, LTD can again be induced in addition to STD after the establishment of L-LTP or L-LTD, that is about 4 h after the induction of the first event in the same synaptic input. We suggest that the neuronal input preserves the capacity for STD immediately after an initial potentiation or depression, but for the onset of additional longer lasting LTD in the same synaptic input, the establishment of the late plasticity form of the preceding event is critical.",
