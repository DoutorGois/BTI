     "AB": "Light- and electron-microscopic investigations of kainic acid-induced lesions revealed a marked macrophage response and \"microgliocytosis\". The hematogenous origin of reactive elements, such as brain macrophages and \"'microglia-like reactive cells\", was demonstrated when blood phagocytes were labeled with carbon particles or horseradish peroxidase prior to induction of the kainic acid-lesion. The induced lesion showed a proliferation of microglial cells, which led to a state of \"microgliocytosis\" in the later stage of lesioning. Since it is now generally accepted that microglial cells in the state of \"microgliocytosis\" are derived from the \"microglia-like reactive cells\", proliferated microglial cells in the brain lesions are probably of hematogenous origin. The relationships among the brain macrophages, the \"microglia-like reactive cells\" and the intrinsic microglial cells are discussed.",
