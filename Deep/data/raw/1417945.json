The reduced carbon monoxide binding spectra of cortical microsomes showed two absorption maxima at 449 and 425 nm. On solubilization of the microsomes, essentially a single peak was observed at 449 nm. The P450 levels in human brain cortical microsomes varied from 0.03 to 0.12 nmol/mg protein among the seven samples examined. The concentration of the hemeprotein present as nmol/g tissue was highest in the brain stem and cerebellum and lowest in the striatum and hippocampus.",
