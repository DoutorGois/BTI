     "AB": "In this study, we investigated the effects of intrahippocampal infusion of indomethacin as a non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor and celecoxib as a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor on spatial memory in the Morris water maze. Rats were trained for 3 days; each day included two blocks, and each block contained 4 trials. Tests were performed 48 h after surgery. Bilateral intrahippocampal infusion of indomethacin (0.01, 0.1, or 1 M) did not show any significant effect on spatial memory retention at these concentrations in rats. We also examined effects of infusion of celecoxib (0.02, 0.06, or 0.1 M) on memory retention. Bilateral infusion of 0.1 M celecoxib significantly altered escape latency and traveled distance in rats. These results strongly suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 is involved in spatial memory retention.",
