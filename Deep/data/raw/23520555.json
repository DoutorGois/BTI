     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The present study was designed to examine the effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) in the hippocampus of rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to determine how ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) decreases Abeta levels in AD. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Experimental AD was induced in rats by a bilateral injection of 10 microg soluble beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta(1-42)) into the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and the rats were treated with Rg1 (10 mg.kg(-1), intraperitoneally) for 28 days. The Morris water maze was used to test spatial learning and memory performance. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to analyze the hippocampal histopathological damage. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and real-time PCR were used to detect Abeta(1-42), PPARgamma, and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression in the hippocampus. KEY RESULTS: Injection of soluble Abeta(1-42) into the hippocampus led to significant dysfunction of learning and memory, hippocampal histopathological abnormalities and increased Abeta(1-42) levels in the hippocampus. Rg1 treatment significantly improved learning and memory function, attenuated hippocampal histopathological abnormalities, reduced Abeta(1-42) levels and increased PPARgamma and IDE expression in the hippocampus; these effects of Rg1 could be effectively inhibited by GW9662, a PPARgamma antagonist. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Given that PPARgamma can upregulate IDE expression and IDE can degrade Abeta(1-42), these results indicate that Rg1 can increase IDE expression in the hippocampus by upregulating PPARgamma, leading to decreased Abeta levels, attenuated hippocampal histopathological abnormalities and improved learning and memory in a rat model of AD.",
