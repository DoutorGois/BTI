     "AB": "Ethanol and nerve growth factor (NGF) affect the survival of septohippocampal (SH) neurons. The effect of ethanol and NGF on calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis in these neurons was investigated in this study. Changes in intracellular-free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were measured using indo-1 in cultured embryonic (E21) SH neurons before stimulation (basal) and during stimulation with 30 mM potassium cloride (KCl+). SH neurons were treated with 0, 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg% ethanol with NGF (+NGF) or without NGF (-NGF). NGF treatment decreased, while ethanol did not affect basal [Ca2+]i. The combination of ethanol and NGF treatment led to increases in basal [Ca2+]i. While [Ca2+]i was lower during stimulation with KCl+ following ethanol or NGF treatment, ethanol and NGF treatment together led to significantly greater increases or decreases in [Ca2+]i compared to similarly treated NGF neurons. Responses of SH neurons were compared to those of medial septal (MS) neurons. Changes in [Ca2+]i during treatment with ethanol and/or NGF were reduced in SH neurons compared with MS neurons. We conclude that changes in Ca2+ homeostasis can occur in SH neurons in the presence of ethanol and/or NGF. The changes following ethanol treatment are enhanced by NGF. By altering Ca2+ homeostasis, NGF may enhance the survival of SH neurons during ethanol-induced neurotoxicity.",
