     "AB": "Our previous studies found that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and estrogen had synergistic antidepressant-like effects. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that three major n-3 PUFAs, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), individually had antidepressant effects combined with 17beta-estradiol-3-benzoate (E) through a neurobiological pathway in ovariectomized rats. Rats were fed a modified American Institute of Nutrition-93G diet with 0% n-3 PUFAs and 1% ALA, EPA and DHA relative to total energy intake for 12 weeks and were injected with corn oil or E every 4 days during the last 3 weeks. Supplementation of EPA, DHA and E increased serum concentrations of serotonin and climbing behavior, and decreased immobility during a forced swimming test. Supplementation with EPA, DHA and E also decreased hippocampal expressions of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and increased cAMP response element binding protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and estrogen receptor-alpha. Immunofluorescence staining consistently showed elevated expressions of BDNF. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that E increased glucose and decreased glutamate, glutamine and myo-inositol concentrations regardless of n-3 PUFA supplementation. In addition, supplementation with EPA, DHA and E decreased levels of nitrite and nitrate. However, ALA had no antidepressant effect. The present study suggested that the antidepressant-like effects of EPA and DHA supplementation and E injection could be due to the regulation of serotonergic neurotransmission and inflammatory cytokines rather than due to the antioxidative system. Supplementation with n-3 PUFA and E had the additional function of modulating neurometabolites in the hippocampus.",
