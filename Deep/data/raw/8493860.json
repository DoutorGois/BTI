     "AB": "The regional distribution of the postsynaptic microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and the presynaptic marker protein synaptophysin was investigated by immunohistochemistry in brains of rats submitted to 30-min forebrain ischemia by four-vessel occlusion. The following brain temperature profiles during ischemia were compared: (1) constant brain temperature of 36 degrees C (normothermia; n = 5); (2) spontaneous temperature decline from 36 degrees to 31 degrees C (spontaneous hypothermia; n = 5) and (3) constant temperature of 30 degrees C (induced hypothermia; n = 5). Normothermia was produced by exposing the ischemic head to an external heat source, and induced hypothermia by cooling the head with liquid nitrogen vapours. Sham-operated animals were either kept at ambient temperature or exposed to the same heat source, as required for maintaining normothermia during ischemia. Seven days after sham operation or ischemia, brains were fixed by perfusion and processed for immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against MAP2 and synaptic vesicle-specific protein (synaptophysin). Normothermic ischemia resulted in complete loss of MAP2 immunostaining in the whole hippocampus, spontaneous hypothermic ischemia in complete loss of MAP2 in CA1 sector, and induced hypothermic ischemia only in variable loss of MAP2 in CA1 sector. Post-ischemic immunostaining of synaptophysin revealed a temperature-dependent increase in stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1 sector, the density of which correlated inversely with MAP2 staining. Comparison with morphological alterations showed a close relationship between loss of MAP2 staining and histological injury. The post-ischemic activation of synaptophysin may reflect regenerative processes associated with synaptic remodelling and, therefore, is an indirect marker of the severity of ischemic injury.",
