     "AB": "Protein synthesis was studied in the pyramidal nerve cells of the CA3 region in the hippocampus of rats uring a behavioral test involving transfer of handedness. A new electrophoretic technique was used for separation of 10(-7) to 10(-9) gram of protein and radiometric determination of the various protein fractions. After interventricular administration of (3)H-leucine, protein synthesis of two fast-moving fractions was significantly higher bilaterally in the hippocampus of the trained rats. There was also a trend to lateralization of the highest protein synthesis to the learning side.",
