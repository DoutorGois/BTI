     "AB": "The neurobehavioral toxicity of developmental exposure to lead (Pb) was investigated by conducting tests of spatial learning in the Morris water maze. Female Long-Evans rats were exposed to 0 or 250 ppm Pb acetate in the diet beginning 10 days prior to breeding and continued throughout gestation and lactation. Pups were weaned onto the same diets as the dams at postnatal day 20 (PN20). Increased levels of Pb were detected in the hippocampus of the 250 ppm Pb acetate group relative to controls. The highest concentration of Pb measured in the hippocampus was at PN21 with decreasing levels at older ages. In the Morris Water Maze, a statistically significant (p < 0.03; female rats) or near significant (p < 0.07; male rats) increase in the time required to find the hidden platform (escape latency) was observed when Pb-treated rats were tested in a reference memory paradigm. This effect was only observed when rats were tested at PN21 and not at older ages. No significant effects of developmental Pb exposure were measured when rats were tested in a working memory paradigm of the Morris water maze at any age. These initial studies indicate an impairment of performance in the swim task in PN21 rats exposed to Pb during development. The age-dependent effect of Pb in this learning paradigm is consistent with previous studies in experimental animals and with the observation that children are more susceptible to Pb-induced cognitive deficits than adults. The Morris water maze may be useful for studying the effects of Pb on learning and memory, and their neurochemical basis.",
