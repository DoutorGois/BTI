     "AB": "Administration of kainate or pentylenetetrazole increased c-fos, c-jun, junB, and junD mRNA levels in rat brain in a dose-dependent manner. Kainate increased these mRNA levels predominantly in the hippocampus, and pentylenetetrazole was more effective in the cortex. Adrenalectomy (3 days) was used to eliminate endogenous glucocorticoid hormones. Adrenalectomy significantly potentiated kainate-induced increases, compared with increases caused by kainate (4 mg/kg) alone, in the hippocampal mRNA levels of c-fos and junB by 6.5-fold and of junD by twofold and tended to augment c-jun mRNA. Corticosterone administration blocked the potentiated stimulation of these mRNA levels caused by adrenalectomy. Adrenalectomy also significantly increased pentylenetetrazole-induced levels of c-fos mRNA in the cortex. These results demonstrate that glucocorticoids modulate immediate early gene expression in the brain, raising the possibility that this interaction contributes to interneuronal and interindividual differences in responses to stimuli and to the effects of stress- or disease-induced changes in glucocorticoid concentrations.",
