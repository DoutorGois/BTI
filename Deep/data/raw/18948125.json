     "AB": "Lithium reduced striatal neurodegeneration induced in rats by 3-nitropropionic acid inhibiting calpain activation. Lithium prevented an increase in cdk5 activity, as shown by the levels of the co-activator p35. Myocite enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), a downstream substrate for cdk5 with pro-survival activity, showed increased phosphorylation. In primary cultures of neurons treated with 3-NP, lithium also reduced protease activity mediated by calpain, cdk5 activation and cellular death. These observations indicate that lithium has a neuroprotective effect. Lithium treatment also reduced the intracellular increase in calcium induced by 3-NP. The finding that lithium mediates the modulation of the calpain/cdk5 pathway further supports its use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",
