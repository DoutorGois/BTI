     "AB": "The effect of glutamate and lack of external Ca2+ on the phosphorylation of the astrocyte cell marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was studied in slices of hippocampus and thoracic spinal cord from immature (P12-16) rats. Confirming previous work with immature hippocampal slices (Wofchuk, S.T. and Rodnight, R., Neurochem. Int., 24 (1994) 517-523; Wofchuk, S.T. and Rodnight, R., Dev. Brain Res., 85 (1995) 181-186), glutamate strongly stimulated GFAP phosphorylation in media with Ca2+ and in media lacking Ca2+ a quantitatively similar stimulation of basal GFAP phosphorylation was observed. By contrast in slices of immature thoracic spinal cord, glutamate had no effect on GFAP phosphorylation and in media lacking Ca2+ phosphorylation of GFAP was inhibited. Since GFAP phosphorylation is Ca2+-dependent and is not stimulated by glutamate in slices of adult hippocampus, the present results suggest that astrocytic functions in the rat spinal cord mature more rapidly than in the hippocampus. The possibility that the difference in the control of GFAP phosphorylation in the two structures is related to differences in the control of GFAP dephosphorylation was investigated by incubating spinal cord slices with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 in the presence of Ca2+. In contrast to results obtained with hippocampal slices FK506 had no effect on the phosphorylation state of GFAP in spinal cord slices.",
