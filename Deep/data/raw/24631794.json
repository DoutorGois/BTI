     "AB": "Effect of a new acetylcholine-esterase reactivator, K203 as a new potential antidote in organophosphate intoxications was studied on dopamine (DA), homovanillic acid (HVA), serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in seven brain regions (cerebellum, spinal cord, hippocampus, hypothalamus, striatum, medulla oblongata and frontal cortex) of rats by an optimized and validated HPLC method. No significant change in brain level of these neurotransmitters was found either 15 or 60 min following treatment. However, when 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios were calculated as measure of turnover, significant decreases were found in the cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus and the frontal cortex 15 min following K203 administration, but after 60 min only in the frontal cortex.",
