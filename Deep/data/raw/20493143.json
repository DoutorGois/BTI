Significant reductions in serotonin S1 receptors were observed in putamen and hippocampus but not in frontal and temporal cortices. Serotonin S2 receptors were unchanged in all four brain regions. The results suggest that S1 receptors may be located on susceptible cells in both the putamen and hippocampus in Huntington's disease.",
