     "AB": "We previously reported that the dried peel powder of Citrus kawachiensis, one of the citrus products of Ehime, Japan, exerted anti-inflammatory effects in the brain of a lipopolysaccharide-injected systemic inflammation animal model. Inflammation is one of the main mechanisms underlying aging in the brain; therefore, we herein evaluated the anti-inflammatory and other effects of the dried peel powder of C. kawachiensis in the senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) model. The C. kawachiensis treatment inhibited microglial activation in the hippocampus, the hyper-phosphorylation of tau at 231 of threonine in hippocampal neurons, and ameliorated the suppression of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These results suggest that the dried peel powder of C. kawachiensis exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects.",
