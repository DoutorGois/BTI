     "AB": "To determine what effect ovariectomy and the accompanying sudden loss of circulating gonadal hormones has on spatial learning performance in the adult rat, two groups of rats were tested on the Lashley III simple alley maze following surgery. Ovariectomized animals were compared with a control group of animals that underwent laparotomy at the same time. The ovariectomized group evidenced superior performance on the maze task, as measured by latency to reach goal (running times) and error scores. It is suggested that this finding provides further evidence for the role of gonadal steroid hormones in the manipulation of functions related to learning and memory, especially in the hippocampus.",
