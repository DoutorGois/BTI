     "AB": "Cytosolic androgen receptor levels were measured in different brain regions of fetal male and female rhesus monkeys (day 135 post-conception). The hypothalamus-preoptic area, amygdala and cerebellum exhibited higher receptor concentration in comparison to the cerebral cortex (parietal, temporal frontal, and occipital lobes), hippocampus and cingulate gyrus (P less than 0.001). No sexual difference in receptor concentrations was found except in the amygdala where fetal males exhibited slightly higher levels than females. The similarity in androgen receptor levels suggests that the developing brain of both sexes could be influenced by circulating androgens under normal or pathological conditions.",
