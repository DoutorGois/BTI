     "AB": "Responses of selected neuroregulatory proteins that promote (Caspase 3 and Bax) or inhibit (Bcl-2, high Bcl-2/Bax ratio) apoptotic cell death were measured in the brain of piglets subjected to precisely controlled hypoxic and ischemic insults: 1 h hypoxia (decreasing FiO(2) from 21 to 6%) or ischemia (ligation of carotid arteries and hemorrhage), followed by 0, 2 and 4 h recovery with 21% FiO(2). Protein expression was measured in cortex, hippocampus and striatum by Western blot. There were no significant differences in expression of Caspase-3 between sham operated, hypoxic and ischemic groups. There were significant regional differences in expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in response to hypoxia and ischemia. The changes in Bcl-2/Bax ratio were similar for hypoxia and ischemia except for striatum at zero time recovery, with ischemia giving lower ratios than hypoxia. The Bcl-2/Bax ratio was also lower for the striatum than for the other regions of the brain, suggesting this region is the more susceptible to apoptotic injury.",
