     "AB": "Conventional and functional proteomics have significant potential to expand our understanding of traumatic brain injury (TBI) but have not yet been used. The purpose of the present study was to examine global hippocampal protein changes in postnatal day (PND) 17 immature rats 24 h after moderate controlled cortical impact (CCI). Silver nitrate stains or protein kinase B (PKB) phosphoprotein substrate antibodies were used to evaluate high abundance or PKB pathway signal transduction proteins representing conventional and functional proteomic approaches, respectively. Isoelectric focusing was performed over a nonlinear pH range of 3-10 with immobilized pH gradients (IPG strips) using supernatant from the most soluble cellular protein fraction of hippocampal tissue protein lysates from six paired sham and injured PND 17 rats. Approximately 1,500 proteins were found in each silver stained gel with 40% matching of proteins. Of these 600 proteins, 52% showed a twofold, 20% a fivefold, and 10% a 10-fold decrease or increase. Spot matching with existing protein databases revealed changes in important cytoskeletal and cell signalling proteins. PKB substrate protein phosphorylation was best seen in large format two-dimensional blots and known substrates of PKB such as glucose transporter proteins 3 and 4 and forkhead transcription factors, identified based upon molecular mass and charge, showed altered phosphorylation 24 h after injury. These results suggest that combined conventional and functional proteomic approaches are powerful, complementary and synergistic tools revealing multiple protein changes and posttranslational protein modifications that allow for more specific and comprehensive functional assessments after pediatric TBI.",
