     "AB": "Neurons from various brain regions of postnatal (15 days after birth) and fetal (16 days gestation) rats were cultured in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). bFGF increased the survival of neurons from postnatal septum, striatum, midbrain, and hippocampus. Fetal neurons derived from cerebral cortex, septum, striatum, midbrain, thalamus, and colliculus were far more dependent on bFGF for survival in comparison with postnatal neurons. In contrast, cerebellum neurons of postnatal and fetal rat brain did not respond to bFGF. The increase of postnatal and fetal neuronal survival with bFGF treatment (0.01-10 ng/ml) was dose-dependent and reached 2-4-fold and 5-10-fold more than the control, respectively. Fetal cortical neurons showed almost complete dependence on bFGF since almost all neurons died in control cultures. Nerve growth factor was slightly effective only on postnatal septal and striatal neurons, being ineffective on the other neurons tested. These results indicate that bFGF can function as a neurotrophic factor not only on fetal but also on postnatal neurons of the central nervous system, and that bFGF has great potential for application in vivo.",
