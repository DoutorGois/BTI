(-)-Deprenyl and (+)-deprenyl were orally administered to rats either in a single dose of 10 mg/kg, or three times a week for three weeks. The metabolites were determined in four different parts of the rat brain, such as in the frontal cortex, corpus striatum, hippocampus, and hypophysis. The ratio of methylamphetamine to amphetamine was also compared after (-)-deprenyl and (+)-deprenyl treatments.",
