     "AB": "Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor beta (LIFRbeta) is a receptor for a variety of neurotrophic cytokines, including LIF, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). These cytokines play an essential role for the survival and maintenance of developing and postnatal somatic motoneurons. CNTF may also serve the maintenance of autonomic, preganglionic sympathetic neurons (PSNs) in the spinal cord, as suggested by its capacity to prevent their death after destruction of one of their major targets, the adrenal medulla. Although somatic motoneurons and PSNs share a common embryonic origin, they are distinct in several respects, including responses to lesions. We have studied PSNs in mice with targeted deletions of the LIFRbeta or CT-1 genes, respectively. We show that LIF, CNTF, and CT-1 are synthesized in embryonic adrenal gland and spinal cord and that PSNs express LIFRbeta. In embryonic day 18.5 LIFRbeta (-/-) and CT-1 (-/-) mice, PSNs were reduced by approximately 20%. PSNs projecting to the adrenal medulla were more severely affected (-55%). Although LIFRbeta (-/-) mice revealed normal numbers of adrenal chromaffin cells and axons terminating on chromaffin cells, levels of adrenaline and numbers of adrenaline-synthesizing cells were significantly reduced. We conclude that activation of LIFRbeta is required for normal development of PSNs and one of their prominent targets, the adrenal medulla. Thus, both somatic motoneurons and PSNs in the spinal cord depend on LIFRbeta signaling for their development and maintenance, although PSNs seem to be overall less affected than somatic motoneurons by LIFRbeta deprivation.",
