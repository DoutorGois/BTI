     "AB": "This study tested for the presence of androgen receptor-immunoreactivity in somatostatin, galanin, vasopressin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and oxytocin neurons in the rat forebrain. The brains of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Androgen receptor was visualized in coronal sections using nickel intensification of diaminobenzidine, and the neuropeptides were identified using a brown diaminobenzidine reaction product. Androgen receptor was localized to the nuclei of neurons in the septum, amygdala, cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. The majority of somatostatin-containing neurons in the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus also contained androgen receptor. Androgen receptor was also found within galanin-expressing cells in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and in the amygdala. Androgen receptor was not observed in corticotropin-releasing hormone, vasopressin, or oxytocin neurons in all areas examined. The data suggest that androgens may be capable of directly regulating somatostatin-expressing neurons of the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and galanin-containing neurons of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and amygdala.",
