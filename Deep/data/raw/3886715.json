     "AB": "We have examined the location of cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons that project to the rat basolateral amygdaloid nucleus by using choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry in combination with retrograde fluorescent tracing on the same tissue section. Since many tracer-and ChAT-positive neurons were identified in basal forebrain areas, including the ventral pallidum, we also stained many of the sections for glutamate decarboxylase, a suitable marker for the delineation of pallidal areas. Cholinergic neurons projecting to the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus were observed in a continuous territory stretching from the dorsal part of ventral pallidum, through sublenticular substantia innominata to ventral parts of globus pallidus and peripallidal areas. Non-cholinergic neurons projecting to the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus were found intermixed within the same structures and constitute approximately 25% of the amygdalopetal projection neurons in these ventral forebrain structures. Since amygdalopetal cholinergic neurons were demonstrated in areas generally recognized as giving rise to cholinergic projections to cerebral cortex, several retrograde double-labeling experiments with two different fluorescent tracers were performed for the purpose of detecting the possible existence of collateral projections. The results obtained showed that the cholinergic basal forebrain neurons in general project to only one forebrain region, and, furthermore, that the cholinergic system consists of partially overlapping subsets of neurons that project to various neocortical and allocortical areas and to the amygdaloid body.",
