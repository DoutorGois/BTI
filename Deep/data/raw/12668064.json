     "AB": "Adult hippocampal progenitor cells (AHPCs) derived from mature rats were studied in mixed co-cultures and shown not to elicit a proliferative response from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or allogeneic spleen cells. FACS analysis revealed low class I and no detectable class II (Ia) MHC expression by these cells. RT-PCR showed that AHPCs express the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-beta1. AHPCs did not, however, significantly impede the proliferation of OKT3- or PHA-stimulated PBMCs. Taken together, these results indicate that AHPCs are non-immunogenic in vitro. This is consistent with their pattern of MHC expression and does not require an active immunosuppressive mechanism.",
