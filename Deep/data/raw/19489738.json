     "AB": "Cholesterol 24-hydroxylase is a highly conserved cytochrome P450 that is responsible for the majority of cholesterol turnover in the vertebrate central nervous system. The enzyme is expressed in neurons, including hippocampal and cortical neurons that are important for learning and memory formation. Disruption of the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase gene in the mouse reduces both cholesterol turnover and synthesis in the brain but does not alter steady-state levels of cholesterol in the tissue. The decline in synthesis reduces the flow of metabolites through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, of which one, geranylgeraniol diphosphate, is required for learning in the whole animal and for synaptic plasticity in vitro. This review focuses on how the link between cholesterol metabolism and higher-order brain function was experimentally established.",
