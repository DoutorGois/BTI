     "AB": "We did a systematic review on the outcome of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) and investigated the role of biological and non-biological variables in reported outcomes. The methodological quality of the 63 studies that met our inclusion criteria was assessed. Study design, type of study, and length of follow-up influenced the outcome. The studies with highest methodological quality are associated with better outcome: short-term mortality between 2.7% and 5.2% and morbidity other than epilepsy less than 15%. The incidence of subsequent epilepsy is not increased after cryptogenic CSE. Causal factor is the main determinant of outcome and the effect of age or duration is difficult to separate from the underlying cause. The risk of sequelae in unprovoked and febrile CSE is low. There is some evidence that CSE, especially febrile CSE, might cause hippocampal injury, although its role in the development of mesial temporal sclerosis is unknown.",
