     "AB": "Deep tissue bioimaging with three-photon (3P) excitation using near-infrared (NIR) light in the second IR window (1.0-1.4 mum) could provide high resolution images with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. Herein, we report a photostable and nontoxic 3P excitable donor-pi-acceptor system (GMP) having 3P cross-section (sigma3 ) of 1.78x10(-80) cm(6) s(2) photon(-2) and action cross-section (sigma3 eta3 ) of 2.31x10(-81) cm(6) s(2) photon(-2) , which provides ratiometric fluorescence response with divalent zinc ions in aqueous conditions. The probe signals the Zn(2+) binding at 530 and 600 nm, respectively, upon 1150 nm excitation with enhanced sigma3 of 1.85x10(-80) cm(6) s(2) photon(-2) and sigma3 eta3 of 3.33x10(-81) cm(6) s(2) photon(-2) . The application of this probe is demonstrated for ratiometric 3P imaging of Zn(2+) in vitro using HuH-7 cell lines. Furthermore, the Zn(2+) concentration in rat hippocampal slices was imaged at 1150 nm excitation after incubation with GMP, illustrating its potential as a 3P ratiometric probe for deep tissue Zn(2+) ion imaging.",
