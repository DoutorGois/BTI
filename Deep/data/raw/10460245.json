     "AB": "Agrin plays a key role in directing the differentiation of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction. Understanding agrin function at the neuromuscular junction has come via molecular genetic analyses of agrin as well as identification of its receptor and associated signal transduction pathways. Agrin is also expressed by many populations of neurons in brain, but its role remains unknown. Here we show, in cultured cortical neurons, that agrin induces expression of the immediate early gene c-fos in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner, as expected for a signal transduction pathway activated by a cell surface receptor. Agrin is active in cortical neurons at picomolar concentrations, is Ca(2+) dependent, and is inhibited by heparin and staurosporine. Despite marked differences in acetylcholine receptor (AChR)-clustering activity, all alternatively spliced forms of agrin are equally potent inducers of c-fos in cortical neurons. A similar, isoform-independent response to agrin was also observed in cultures prepared from the hippocampus and cerebellum. Only agrin with high AChR-clustering activity was effective in cultured muscle, whereas non-neuronal cells were agrin insensitive. Although consistent with a receptor tyrosine kinase model similar to the muscle-specific kinase-myotube-associated specificity component complex in muscle, our data suggest that CNS neurons express a unique agrin receptor. Evidence that neuronal signal transduction is mediated via an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) means that agrin is well situated to influence important Ca(2+)-dependent functions in brain, including neuronal growth, differentiation, and adaptive changes in gene expression associated with synaptic remodeling.",
