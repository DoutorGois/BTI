The great majority of transplants were from normal donors to normal hosts. A single case each of a reeler transplant into a normal host and a normal transplant into a reeler host is described. Reeler hippocampus transplanted into normal tissue retained the phenotype of reeler; normal hippocampus transplanted into reeler hippocampus was phenotypically normal.",
