     "AB": "Quantitative autoradiography using [3H] gamma-hydroxybutyrate was used in combination with anatomic and neurotoxic lesions to localize the gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) receptors in the striatum and hippocampus of rat brain. 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the nigro-striatal pathway failed to reduce [3H] gamma-hydroxybutyrate binding in the striatum. In contrast, kainic acid (KA) lesions of the caudate-putamen (CPu) resulted in about 45% loss of binding. For hippocampus, lesions of septo-hippocampal pathway did not modify receptor density but intrahippocampal kainic acid injection largely attenuated (50%) [3H] GHB binding. These results demonstrate that gamma-hydroxybutyrate receptors in the CPu and dorsal hippocampus are principally located on intrinsic neurons which may participate in the functional expression of the role gamma-hydroxybutyrate has in these structures.",
