     "AB": "Hippocampal insults involving neuroimmune mechanisms can impair learning and memory in a variety of tasks. The present study was designed to assess the effect of pentoxifylline, an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) on kainate (KA)-induced impairment in spatial memory. Male mice received a subcutaneous injection of a dose of KA (15 mg/kg) that had no cytotoxic effect on hippocampal neurons as confirmed by Fluorojade B staining. This dose resulted in an impairment of spatial memory in a two-trial recognition task 11 days later. Intraperitoneal administration of pentoxifylline (200 mg/kg) abrogated this effect. Repeated intracerebroventricular injection of IGF-I (2 microg/mouse on day 1 followed by 1 microg/mouse on days 2-5) abrogated KA-induced deficits in spatial memory whereas acute IGF-I (2 microg/mouse on day 1 only) had mixed effects. These findings indicate that endogenous TNFalpha is probably involved in the detrimental effects of kainate on cognition and that exogenous IGF-I can oppose these effects, probably by antagonizing TNFalpha-induced neurotoxicity.",
