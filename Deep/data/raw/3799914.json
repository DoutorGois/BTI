     "AB": "When the amygdaloid complex was electrically stimulated, polysynaptic evoked potentials were produced in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Twenty-four hours after tetanic stimulation of the amygdala, the dentate response to single test pulses was found to be increased in amplitude. Stimulation trains presented at a rate of 1/day had a cumulative effect on the dentate evoked potential, which attained 5-10 times the original response in amplitude. The results imply that the efficiency of synaptic transmission in the amygdalo-hippocampal pathway can be modified, associated with amygdaloid kindling.",
