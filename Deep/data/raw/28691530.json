     "AB": "Background The relationship between hippocampal and amygdaloid volumes and depression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is a controversial issue. Purpose To investigate the correlation between the 15-item shortened version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and gray matter volume in PD. Material and Methods In the present study, 46 participants with PD were scanned with 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to obtain three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted (T1W) images. Neurologists specializing in movement disorders performed clinical evaluations of the participants (e.g. GDS-15, Mini-Mental State Examination, PD duration, age, sex). Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 software was used for image gray matter segmentation and for a correlation analysis between gray matter volume and GDS-15 score. Results The results showed a significant negative correlation between GDS-15 score and left hippocampal volume, and between GDS-15 score and right parahippocampal gyrus volume. No significant positive correlations were found in the whole brain. Conclusion The current results provide new evidence regarding the relationship between depression in PD and hippocampal volume.",
