     "AB": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to look for the response to strabismus images in the limbic network (amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus) of healthy volunteers and to compare it with their reaction to viewing normal eyes. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one healthy volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging data and blood oxygen level-dependent signal changes were analyzed using the BrainVoyager QX software package (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Responses to viewing strabismus images were compared with those observed while viewing normal eye images. RESULTS: Strabismus images led to significant activation of the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal, and fusiform gyri in 30 of 31 subjects compared with normal eye images, indicating a negative emotional response. CONCLUSIONS: These fMRI results confirm that strabismus influences organically not only the patient with nonparallel eyes but also observers. Treatment of strabismus therefore changes the interpersonal dynamic for patients with strabismus on a demonstrable organic basis.
