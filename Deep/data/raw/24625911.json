     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of BDNF on F-actin during the stimulation of IL-1beta in hippocampal neurons. MATERIALS & METHODS: We cultured hippocampal neurons from rat embryos. Cell stimulation was induced by IL-1beta. Cell culture success was evaluated by an activity analysis of CCK-8, staining of gliocyte by immunohistochemistry. Changes in F-actin, BDNF and NF-kB were examined using molecular analyses. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that a high concentration of IL-1beta exaggerates the stimulation-induced degradation of F-actin by BDNF, whereas a low concentration of IL-1beta protects F-actin against this degradation. These beneficial effects might be associated with the inhibition or exaggeration of the NF-kB signaling cascade. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings indicate that BDNF acts as an F-actin-protective regulator during stimulation by IL-1beta and that this function largely occurs via the regulation of NF- kB signaling. These results suggest that interventions targeting the BDNF signaling system may be of therapeutic value against major depressive disorder (MDD).",
