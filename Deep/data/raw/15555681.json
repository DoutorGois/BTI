     "AB": "Various research problems are presented to illustrate the utility of using the interactive multiple learning and memory systems view to better understand normal and abnormal manifestations of mammalian behaviour. Evidence for incidental learning and memory processes is presented and various implications of this work are discussed. Empirical and theoretical work directed at understanding the cognitive and non-cognitive processes associated with place learning in the water task and context conditioning during aversive events is also presented.",
