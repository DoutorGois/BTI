     "AB": "During development neuronal circuitries are refined by activity. Here we studied the role of spontaneous electrical activity in the regulation of synapse formation in the intact newborn (Postnatal Day 3; P3) rat hippocampus in vitro. The blockade of the spontaneous network activity with TTX led to an increase in the number of functional excitatory synapses in the CA3 area of the developing hippocampus. In parallel, there was a substantial increase in the expression levels of the presynaptic markers synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, and synapsin I and of GluR1 AMPA receptor subunits. These changes were associated with an increase in the frequency and amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). Our correlated immunocytochemical, electronmicroscopical, and electrophysiological experiments indicate that in the developing hippocampus spontaneous network activity controls the number of functional synapses.",
