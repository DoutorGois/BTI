     "AB": "Hippocampal population discharges such as sharp waves, epileptiform firing, and GDPs recur at long and variable intervals. The mechanisms for their precise timing are not well understood. Here, we show that population bursts in the disinhibited CA3 region are initiated at a threshold level of population firing after recovery from a previous event. Each population discharge follows an active buildup period when synaptic traffic and cell firing increase to threshold levels. Single-cell firing can advance burst onset by increasing population firing to suprathreshold values. Population synchrony is suppressed when threshold frequencies cannot be reached due to reduced cellular excitability or synaptic efficacy. Reducing synaptic strength reveals partially synchronous population bursts that are curtailed by GABA(B)-mediated conductances. Excitatory glutamatergic transmission and delayed GABA(B)-mediated signals have opposing feedback effects on CA3 cell firing and so determine threshold behavior for population synchrony.",
