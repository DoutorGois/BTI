     "AB": "RATIONALE: Neonatal administration of methamphetamine (MA) to rats from postnatal day (P) 11 to 20, but not from P1 to P10, produces lasting deficits in spatial learning and memory. The preweaning period of development in the rat corresponds to human third trimester hippocampal development and because of the increased use of MA in women of childbearing age, there is a greater likelihood that fetuses will be exposed to this drug. Development of the hippocampus is dependent upon many factors, including an optimal level of corticosterone (CORT). We have demonstrated that the CORT response of animals on P11 to MA is protracted relative to administration on P15 or P20. Interestingly, the P11 animals are still in the stress hyporesponsive period. OBJECTIVES: We postulated that because of the prolonged CORT response on P11, the effects of MA on spatial learning and memory may be confined to a shorter period of exposure. METHODS: Neonatal rats were administered MA (10 mg/kg) 4 times daily from either P11 to P15 or from P16 to P20, raised to adulthood and tested against animals only administered saline (SAL) from P11 to P20 for anxiety, swimming ability, and spatial learning and memory. RESULTS: Animals exposed to MA, regardless of exposure period, tended to be less anxious in the Zero maze relative to SAL animals. No differences were noted for swimming ability. Only animals exposed to MA from P11 to P15 demonstrated deficits in spatial learning and memory during acquisition as well as during a shifted platform phase where learning a new position was required. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that spatial learning and memory deficits produced by MA administration are dependent upon when the exposure of the animal occurs and appears to be during the period of development in the rat when the response to threatening environments, stressors, is greatly reduced.",
