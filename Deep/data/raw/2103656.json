With magnetic resonance imaging, severe atrophy of amygdala and hippocampus in both Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia was observed. There was no essential difference on the atrophic findings between Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia. This result therefore suggest that the quantitative measurement of amygdaloid and hippocampal atrophy predicts dementia.",
