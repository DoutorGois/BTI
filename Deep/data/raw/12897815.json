     "AB": "Nicaraven is an agent that is especially beneficial in vasospasm or brain damage caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage. It ameliorates neurological deficits of patients and protects the central nervous system from ischemia. We investigated the neuroprotective effect of nicaraven against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) induced or N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) induced hippocampal neuronal cell death in organotypic brain slice cultures. The effect of nicaraven on hippocampal neuronal injury was evaluated by inhibition of uptake of propidium iodide (PI) into dead cells. The results demonstrated that nicaraven protected neuronal cells from both OGD- and NMDA-induced cell death. While nicaraven has a strong hydroxyl radical scavenging effect, another radical scavenger, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), inhibited cell death only caused by OGD. In contrast, the poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase (PARS) inhibitors 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) and theophylline protected cells from both OGD- and NMDA-induced cell death. Since nicaraven has an inhibitory effect in PARS, as well as a radical scavenging effect, these results suggest that inhibition of hippocampal cell death caused by NMDA may be attributable to PARS inhibition by nicaraven.",
