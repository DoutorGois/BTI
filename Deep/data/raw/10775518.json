     "AB": "The entorhinal cortex (Brodmann's area 28) is located at the anterior aspect of the parahippocampal gyrus ventral to the amygdala and the hippocampus. It is reciprocally interconnected with the hippocampus via glutamatergic pathways. We investigated whether the entorhinal cortex is damaged in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The volume of the entorhinal cortex was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 36 patients with cryptogenic TLE and in 21 controls. The mean volumes of the entorhinal cortex on the focal side did not differ from controls. In 11 of 36 patients, however, the entorhinal cortex volume was reduced by 25%. Entorhinal volume correlated with hippocampal volume in TLE (ipsilaterally, r= 0.454, P<0.01; contralaterally, r = 0.340, P<0.05). Further, 64% of patients with 25% entorhinal cortex damage had ipsilateral hippocampal atrophy. On the other hand, right focal TLE patients with hippocampal atrophy had a 19% volume reduction of the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex (P<0.05). The volume of the entorhinal cortex correlated with the duration of TLE (r= -0.335, P< 0.05). The present study indicates that the entorhinal cortex might be damaged in a subpopulation of patients with cryptogenic TLE. In most cases, volume reduction was associated with hippocampal damage. These data suggest that entorhinal damage contributes to the symptomatology in TLE.",
