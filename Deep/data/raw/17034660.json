     "AB": "New generation antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin and tiagabine, are used in monotherapy or in combination with other drugs for specific seizure types. The multidirectional mechanism of activity and varied pharmacological properties of these drugs suggest that they could also be used in the therapy of other diseases. A possible limitation of new generation antiepileptic drugs is the incidence of CNS-related adverse effects. Few studies have assessed the effect of new antiepileptic drugs on electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in subjects using these drugs for diseases other than epilepsy. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of tiagabine and gabapentin on EEG recordings from the midbrain reticular formation, dorsal hippocampus and frontal cortex in rabbits. Tiagabine was administered orally at a single dose of 5 and 20 mg kg(-1), or repeatedly at a dose of 5 mg kg(-1) (twice a day) for 14 days. Gabapentin was administered orally at a single dose of 25 and 100 mg kg(-1), or repeatedly at a dose of 25 mg kg(-1) (twice a day) for 14 days. Both tiagabine and gabapentin caused changes indicative of CNS inhibitory properties, which may be associated with the adverse effects of the drugs. After repeated doses of the drugs, the changes in EEG recordings were less pronounced than after single doses, which may indicate adaptive changes. The hippocampus was found to be the least sensitive to the effect of gabapentin.",
