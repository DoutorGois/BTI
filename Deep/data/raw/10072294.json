     "AB": "This paper is to study the participation of cathepsin in ischemic neuronal death of the monkey hippocampal cornu ammonis (CA) 1 sector and also to clarify whether its selective inhibitor epoxysuccinyl peptides such as CA-074 and E-64c can inhibit the neuronal death or not. In the preceding reports, we demonstrated mu-calpain activation and subsequent rupturing of the lysosomal membrane of postischemic CA1 neurons and also increase of enzyme activity of cathepsins B and L in monkeys undergoing a complete 20-min whole brain ischemia. Here, morphological, immunohistochemical and enzymatical analyses were performed to examine the efficacy of two selective cathepsin inhibitors in the postictal blockade of delayed neuronal death in the monkey hippocampus. Both inhibitors could significantly decrease enzyme activities of cathepsins B and L in all hippocampal sectors. When CA-074 was intravenously administered immediately after the ischemic insult, approximately 67% of CA1 neurons were saved from delayed neuronal death on day 5 after ischemia. In contrast, when E-64c was similarly administered, approximately 84% of CA1 neurons were saved from delayed neuronal death on day 5. The surviving neurons showed mild central chromatolysis and negligible immunoreactivity for cathepsins B and L. These observations indicate that the use of cathepsin inhibitors may become novel strategy for prevention of ischemic delayed neuronal death in the primate hippocampus.",
