     "AB": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders in humans, and the role of cerebellum in its physiopathology remains the subject of study. Bergmann glia in the cerebellar cortex regulates the homeostasis of Purkinje cells, the axons of which target the dentate and interpositus nuclei, which form the main cerebellar output to other structures in the central nervous system involved in Epilepsy. Sox-1 is a transcription factor expressed in Bergmann glia and its binding to beta-Catenin further inhibits the Wnt pathway. beta-Catenin is widely expressed in cerebellum. It has been reported that beta-Catenin signaling is increased as the hippocampus receives repeated electrical stimuli and this is related with apoptosis of neurons. In the cerebellum, the recurrence of seizures results in Purkinje cells death, although the mechanisms remain unclear.",
