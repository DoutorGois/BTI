     "AB": "Endoluminal infusion and incubation of elastase with or without collagenase into the rabbit common carotid artery is an established model of arterial saccular aneurysm. The model mimics naturally occurring human cerebral aneurysms in many ways, including histologic and morphologic characteristics, hemodynamic pressures, and shear stresses. However, complications have been associated with the model. Here, we report 2 complications: 1) the first known case of iatrogenic laryngeal hemiplegia in a rabbit; and 2) histopathologically confirmed iatrogenic hippocampal and cerebellar infarcts (stroke). Finally, we present and review data from current literature on the morbidity and mortality associated with this model.",
