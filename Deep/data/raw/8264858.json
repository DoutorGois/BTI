     "AB": "Cholecystokinin (CCK), a gastrointestinal (GI) hormone, is also present in structures of the central nervous system such as cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory tubercle and in regions involved in the regulation of the pituitary function. Although a number of studies have evaluated the effects of CCK on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and on arginine vasopressin (AVP), prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) plasma levels in the laboratory animal, its role in humans has not been explored. Hence, we examined the effects of the exogenous administration of this GI hormone on corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, AVP, PRL and GH plasma levels in humans. To accomplish this, graded doses (0, 50, 140 and 420 ng/kg) of sulfated CCK octapeptide (CCK-8), the full biologically active peptide, were infused intravenously to healthy men in 30 min. Blood samples were collected 30 min and immediately before the infusion was started (baseline) and 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min thereafter. CRH, ACTH, and AVP were extracted from plasma proteins using cartridges of SepPak C18. These hormones and cortisol were measured by radioimmunoassay whereas PRL and GH were measured by immunoradiometric assay. CCK-8 increased plasma ACTH and cortisol levels only at the dose of 420 ng/kg, whereas it had no detectable effect on plasma CRH levels. It increased also plasma AVP levels at the doses of 140 and 420 ng/kg. However, this effect reached the statistical significance only at the highest dose tested. CCK-8 stimulated PRL and GH release in a dose-dependent fashion. The lowest stimulatory dose was 140 ng/kg for both hormones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
