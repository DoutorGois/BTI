     "AB": "Clinical results of stereotactical destruction in the amygdalar complex and, in certain cases, in the hippocampus show that this manipulation is very important for the correction of behavioral disorders in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. SEEG studies demonstrated that in cases of epilepsy with paroxysmal affective states an epileptical electrical activity can be demonstrated in the amygdalar complex. Our investigations also show that stereotactical operations for epilepsy are more effective for the control of behavioral and emotional disorders, than for seizures. It was suggested that a combination of classical (resection) and stereotactical methods gives a new possibility for the surgical treatment of severe forms of temporal lobe epilepsy.",
