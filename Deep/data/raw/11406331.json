     "AB": "It has been suggested that stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) show vulnerability to neuronal damage following transient ischemia. To observe the effect of hydroxyl radicals on neuronal damage in the hippocampus of SHRSP during ischemia and recirculation, we measured the levels of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA), as a biological marker of hydroxyl radicals in the hippocampus of SHRSP, by high pressure liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection. The production of hydroxyl radicals in the hippocampus during the first 20 min of recirculation was a peak in all intervals. The changes in 2,3-DHBA levels during ischemia and recirculation in SHRSP were significantly higher than in Wistar-Kyoto rats. These results suggest that neuronal damage following ischemia and recirculation is, in part, caused by the increase in hydroxyl radicals during ischemia and recirculation.",
