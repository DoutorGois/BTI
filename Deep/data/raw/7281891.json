     "AB": "The activities of lactate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase, originating from rat hippocampus were determined 3, 10, 20 and 40 days post partum. Hemispheric asymmetry was tested using tetrazolium salt MTT-bromide and the elution technique. It could be revealed that significant differences between enzymatic activities occur between both hemispheres of the hippocampus. The greatest difference observed was 14%. Our dates show that a predominantly left-side dominance takes place in the hippocampus.",
