     "AB": "The concentrations of dopamine, noradrenaline, and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were determined in the amygdala, neostriatum, neocortex, hippocampus, brain stem, and hypothalamus of cats, which had had 9 to 14 tonic-clonic kindled seizures. No significant biochemical changes were observed compared to control cats. Pharmacological manipulations of dopamine receptors (haloperidol, apomorphine) did not modify the kindling procedure. According to the data it seems unlikely that dopamine plays a major role in amygdaloid kindling.",
