     "AB": "Using RH155 voltage-sensitive dye and photodiode array for optical recording, responses to electrical stimuli were investigated in rat brain slices, which included hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. It was shown that single electrical stimulation of the entorhinal cortex, subiculum, or dentate gyrus evoked a potential consecutively spreading from the dentate gyrus to the CA3 and then CA1 hippocampal areas. When the GABAergic inhibition was partially blocked by picrotoxin, the first excitation wave was followed by additional several waves. Such secondary waves were observed in all the hippocampal areas with a constant trial-to-trial latency shift increasing in the direction from the dentate gyrus to CA3 and CA1 areas. Reverberation of activity between the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex is regarded as the most probable cause of appearance of the secondary excitation waves.",
