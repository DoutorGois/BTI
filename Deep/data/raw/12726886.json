     "AB": "We previously reported that an eight hour phase advance in the light-dark (LD) cycle increases sleep in rats. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is suggested to be one of the sleep and circadian regulating factors. We have therefore observed the responses of BDNF protein in the hippocampus, cerebellum and brainstem under conditions of LD change. BDNF protein was quantitatively measured using an ELISA kit. Under an 8-h LD phase advance, the levels of hippocampal BDNF were significantly increased on the day of the phase change, while the levels in the cerebellum and brainstem remained constant. Plasma corticosterone levels were not largely affected. Thus, a single LD shift acutely affects hippocampal BDNF metabolism with no large stress response.",
