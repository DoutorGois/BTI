     "AB": "The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated non-selective cation (HCN) channels play a vital role in the neurological basis underlying nervous system diseases. However, the role of HCN channels in drug addiction is not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the expression of HCN1 and HCN2 subunits in hippocampal CA1 and the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of HCN channels in rats with chronic morphine exposure with approaches of electrophysiology, water maze, and Western blotting. We found that chronic morphine exposure (5 mg/kg, sc, for 7 days) caused an inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) and impairment of spatial learning and memory, which is associated with a decrease in HCN1, and an increase in HCN2 on cell membrane of hippocampal CA1 area. Additional experiments showed that the imbalance of cell membrane HCN1 and HCN2 expression under chronic morphine exposure was related to an increase in expression of TPR containing Rab8b interacting protein (TRIP8b) (1a-4) and TRIP8b (1b-2), and phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) and adaptor protein 2 mu2 (AP2 mu2). Our results demonstrate the novel information that drug addiction-induced impairment of learning and memory is involved in the imbalance of HCN1 and HCN2 subunits, which is mediated by activation of TRIP8b (1a-4), TRIP8b (1b-2), PKA and AP2 mu2.",
