     "AB": "The JNK/SAPK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase) cascade is activated by a variety of stress stimuli and by the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-I (IL-I) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). Four splice variants of the mouse JNK/SAPKalpha isoform, which differ in a region located in subdomains IX-X of the protein, were previously identified. Analysis of the sequence of the central region of the mouse JNK/SAPKalpha gene indicates that splice variants I and II are generated by a typical alternative splicing mechanism, while splice variants III and IV are generated by a less common mechanism, where alternative 3' splice sites located inside an exon (cryptic sites) are selected. The major splice variants alphaI and all have a wide and similar distribution in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, caudate-putamen, amygdala and the granule cell layer of cerebellum, although their expression is specifically regulated in certain cell types.",
