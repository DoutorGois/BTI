The data obtained in this study indicate the following: 1. Substance P stimulates the activities of (Na, K) and (Ca, Mg) ATPases more effectively in synaptosomal membranes from hippocampus than cerebral cortex. 2. Heptapeptide SP(5-11) (pyroGlu5, Tyr8) causes a more distinct increase of (Ca, Mg) ATPase activity in cortical synaptosomal membranes than SP does. 3. The change of L-Phe conformation to D in position 7 in hexapeptide induces reduction of enzymes activities in hippocampus. 4. Especially important for the maintenance of biological activity of drugs is the replacement of Gln5 with pyroGlu6 and conformation of Phe residues. 5. SP and shorter analogues of fragments SP C-terminal SP regulate the active cation transport in synaptosomal membranes of cerebral cortex and hippocampus.",
