     "AB": "We studied the effect of culturing conditions on the fate of human neural stem cells after transplantation into rat brain. Human neural stem cells cultured in the presence of mitogens without LIF migrated along the ependyma and cerebral vessels of recipients, but to a great extent degenerated by the 20th day after transplantation. Neural stem cells cultured with LIF migrated, apart from the above mentioned pathways, in the cortex and hippocampus, well survived; proliferating cells were retained 30 days after transplantation.",
