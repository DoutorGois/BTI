In this paper, an integrated model of LTP is constructed based on hypotheses about both the mechanism of LTP induction and that of LTP maintenance, that is, the NMDA-receptor channel, protein phosphorylation and protein turnover. The validity of the model is discussed based on the results of computer simulations.",
