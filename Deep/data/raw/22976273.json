     "AB": "The last two decades cytogenic processes (both neurogenic and gliogenic) driven by neural stem cells surviving within the adult mammalian brain have been extensively investigated. It is now well established that within at least two cytogenic niches, the subependymal zone of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone in the dentate gyrus, new neurons are born everyday with a fraction of them being finally incorporated into established neuronal networks in the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus, respectively. But how significant is adult neurogenesis in the context of the mature brain and what are the possibilities that these niches can contribute significantly in tissue repair after degenerative insults, or in the restoration of normal hippocampal function in the context of mental and cognitive disorders? Here, we summarise the available data on the normal behaviour of adult neural stem cells in the young and the aged brain and on their response to degeneration. Focus will be given, whenever possible, to numbers: how many stem cells survive in the adult brain, how many cells they can generate and at what ratios do they produce neurons and glia?",
