     "AB": "The mammillary body (MB) and the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) are closely related structures, which take part in learning and memory processes. However, the exact role of these structures has remained unclear. In both structures neurons firing according to hippocampal theta rhythm have been found, mainly in the medial mammillary nucleus (MM) and anteroventral thalamic nucleus (AV). These neurons are driven by descending projections from the hippocampal formation and are thought to convey theta rhythm back to the hippocampus (HP). We argue that the MB-ATN axis not only relays theta signal, but may also modulate it. To examine it, we performed a pharmacological inactivation of the MM and AV by local infusion of procaine, and measured changes in theta activity in selected structures of the extended hippocampal system in urethane-anesthetized rats. The inactivation of the MM resulted in decrease in EEG power in the HP and AV, the most evidently in the lower theta frequency bands, i.e. 3-5Hz in the HP (down to 9.2% in 3- to 4-Hz band and 37.6% in 4- to 5-Hz band, in comparison to the power in the control conditions) and 3-4Hz in the AV (down to 24.9%). After the AV inactivation, hippocampal EEG power decreased in theta frequency bands of 3-8Hz (down to 61.6% in 6- to 7-Hz band and 69.4% in 7- to 8-Hz band). Our results suggest that the role of the MB-ATN axis in regulating theta rhythm signaling may be much more important than has been speculated so far.",
