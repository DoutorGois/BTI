     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of the active site of Xiangshia Liujunzitang on behavior, injury of hippocampal neurons and Ca2+ ion in hippocampal synaptic in the depression model mice. METHOD: Sixty male Kunming mice were randomly divided into 5 group, the control group, the model group and the active site of Xiangshia Liujunzitang groups (400, 600, 800 mg x kg(-1) body weight). The model was established by separation and chronic unpredictable mild stimulation. The increased weight and crossing scores, rearing scores were measured by open-field and sweet water consumption of mice. Cone cell and configuration of neuron in CA1, CA3 region of hippocampus were observed by Nissl. The concentration of Hippocampal synaptic Ca2+ was detected by fluorimetry. RESULT: Comparing with the mice of control, the increased weight was slowed (P < 0.001), the scores of rearing and crossing were decreased (P < 0.001), sweet water consumption were decreased, too. Numbers of cone cells in CA3 region of hippocampus were decreased obviously (P < 0.001), and Ca2+ ion in hippocampal synaptic was increased obviously. Comparing with the mice of model, the active site of Xiangshia Liujunzitang could increase the increased weight on the 14 th and 21 st day obviously. The active site of Xiangshia Liujunzitang could increase the scores of crossing obviously (P < 0.05), with no dose-effect relationship. The active site of Xiangshia Liujunzitang (800 mg x kg(-1)) could increase the scores of rearing obviously (P < 0.001); The active site of Xiangshia Liujunzitang (400, 600, 800 mg x kg(-1)) could increase sweet water consumption obviously (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P < 0.001); The active site of Xiangshia Liujunzitang (600, 800 mg x kg(-1)) could increase numbers of cone cell in CA3 region of hippocampus obviously (P < 0.001); The active site of Xiangshia Liujunzitang (600, 800 mg x kg(-1)) could decreased Ca2+ in hippocampal synaptic with dose-effect relationship (P < 0.01, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The active site of Xiangshia Liujunzitang can improve all the symptoms of the depression model mice and protect the injury of hippocampal neurons in the depression model mice. The possible mechanism of action is to restrict Ca2+ ion overfreight.",
