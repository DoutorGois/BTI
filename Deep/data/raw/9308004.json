     "AB": "The Na+K+ ATPase (Na+ pump) plays a central role in regulating cation homeostasis and is thought to have an important role in cell proliferation. The multitude of subunit isoforms comprising the functional Na+K+ ATPase has raised the possibility that specific subunit isoform combinations may be involved in different cellular processes. We have investigated the involvement of the specific isoforms in neurons and glia at the site of a CNS lesion. Intracerebroventricular injection of kainic acid was used to induce neuronal cell loss and reactive gliosis in rat hippocampus and levels of Na+K+ ATPase subunit isoform mRNA levels were determined in cells of rat hippocampus using in situ hybridization. alpha 2 mRNA levels increased 35-40% in CA1 and CA3 astrocytes between 1-3 weeks after KA injection with no significant change in other subunit isoform mRNA levels. In addition alpha 3 mRNA levels in CA1 pyramidal neurons were decreased by approx. 35%. Small neurons in the CA1 and CA3 region showed no changes in mRNA levels for any of the Na+K+ ATPase subunit isoforms. These results may indicate a possible role for alpha 2 subunit isoform in the conversion of glial cells from a normal phenotype to the reactive phenotype characteristic in this model of CNS injury.",
