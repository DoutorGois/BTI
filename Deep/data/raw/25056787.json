     "AB": "According to a recent study, mercury (Hg) exposure contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms are not understood. This study investigated the effect of methylmercury (MeHg) treatment on the generation, degradation, and transport of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in the brain. Wistar rats were administered MeHg by gavage (0, 20, 200, and 2,000 mug Hg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. The total Hg in the blood and brain regions was measured, and the levels of Abeta42 in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain regions were estimated. The expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and neprilysin (NEP) in the brain regions was determined, in addition to the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in the brain capillary endothelium (BCE). Finally, the amount of soluble low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (sLRP) in the plasma was determined. Abeta42 levels were decreased in the CSF of the 2,000 mug Hg/kg/day group compared with controls, and Abeta42 levels increased in the hippocampus (HC) in a dose-dependent manner. MeHg decreased LRP1 expression but increased RAGE levels in BCE. sLRP levels were decreased in the plasma of the MeHg-treated rats. They were positively correlated with CSF Abeta42 and negatively correlated with Abeta42 and Hg levels in HC. These results imply that MeHg reduces the transportation of Abeta, thereby resulting in the accumulation of the protein in the HC. Plasma sLRP levels may be an early biomarker of Hg-induced Abeta accumulation in the brain.",
