     "AB": "Genetic deletion of NMDA glutamate receptors disrupts development of whisker-related neuronal patterns in the somatosensory system. Independent studies have shown that NMDA receptor antagonists increase cell death among developing neurons. Here, we report that a dramatic feature of the developing somatosensory system in newborn NMDA receptor 1 (NMDAR1) knock-out mice is increased cell death in the ventrobasal nucleus (VB) of the thalamus. Sections were subject to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining for apoptotic DNA fragmentation, thionine staining for pyknotic nuclei, silver staining for degenerating cells, and immunostaining for caspase-3. All four methods demonstrated that deletion of NMDAR1 causes a large (on the order of threefold to fivefold) increase in cell death in the VB. The NMDA receptor antagonists dizocilpine maleate (MK-801) and phencyclidine also increase cell death in this structure. The onset of increased cell death in the VB in the absence of NMDA receptor function is approximately the time of birth, overlaps with naturally occurring cell death and synaptogenesis, and displays some anatomical specificity. For example, there was no increase in cell death in the hippocampus or neocortex of NMDAR1 knock-out mice at any of the time points examined: embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5), E17.5, and postnatal day 0. We also report a significant reduction in the size of the VB that is evident starting at E17.5. The results indicate that NMDA receptors play a major role in cell survival during naturally occurring cell death in the VB and demonstrate that cell death is a consideration in NMDA receptor knock-out studies.",
