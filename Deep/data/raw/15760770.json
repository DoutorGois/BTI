     "AB": "cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling has a key role in memory processes and has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for memory disorders. The activation of PKA signaling is crucial for the consolidation of long-term memories dependent on the hippocampus and/or the amygdala, By contrast, initial studies indicate that cAMP-PKA activation might impair the working memory and executive functions of the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, PKA activation in the nucleus accumbens might increase sensitivity to addiction. These complexities must be heeded when designing medications aimed at altering PKA activity. PKA might be most practical as a therapeutic target in disorders with global alterations in cAMP-PKA activity due to genetic or environmental factors.",
