     "PG": "374-80",
     "AB": "1. We investigated how manipulations of the degree of activation of adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors influences the action of the neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices. Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) from the CA1 area were recorded. 2. When applied alone, CGRP (1 - 30 nM) was without effect on field EPSPs. However, CGRP (10 - 30 nM) significantly increased the field EPSP slope when applied to hippocampal slices in the presence of the A(1) receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopenthyl xanthine (DPCPX, 10 nM), or in the presence of the A(2A) adenosine receptor agonist CGS 21680 (10 nM). 3. The A(2A) receptor antagonist, ZM 241385 (10 nM) as well as adenosine deaminase (ADA, 2 U ml(-1)), prevented the enhancement of field EPSP slope caused by CGRP (30 nM) in the presence of DPCPX (10 nM), suggesting that this effect of CGRP requires the concomitant activation of A(2A) adenosine receptors by endogenous adenosine. 4. The protein kinase-A inhibitors, N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA-1004, 10 microM) and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer (Rp-cAMPS, 50 microM), as well as the inhibitor of ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels, glibenclamide (30 microM), prevented the facilitation of synaptic transmission caused by CGRP (30 nM) in the presence of DPCPX (10 nM), suggesting that this effect of CGRP involves both K(ATP) channels and protein kinase-A. 5. It is concluded that the ability of CGRP to facilitate synaptic transmission in the CA1 area of the hippocampus is under tight control by adenosine, with tonic A(1) receptor activation by endogenous adenosine 'braking' the action of CGRP, and the A(2A) receptors triggering this action.",
