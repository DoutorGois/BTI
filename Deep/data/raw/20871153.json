     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Naoling decoction on the expression of iNOS in hippocamal CA3 region in rats with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to explore the potential mechanism. METHODS: Forty SD rats were classified into 5 groups: a normal group, a sham-operated group, an AD group, a Naoling decoction group, and a Naofukang group. The Alzheimer's disease model was established by injecting Abeta1-42 into the hippocamal in the rats. Expression of iNOS in the CA3 region was measured with immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, the expression of iNOS protein in the hippocampal CA3 fields in the AD group increased (P<0.05). Naoling decoction decreased the iNOS expression. CONCLUSION: Naoling decoction can significantly reduce the expression of iNOS in the AD model rats, suggesting that Naoling decoction can be used for AD rats.",
