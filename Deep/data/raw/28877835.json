     "AB": "Objective To explore the efficacy of ganoderma lucidum preparation(Ling Zhi) in treating APP/PS-1 transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease(AD).Methods APP/PS-1 transgenic mice of 4 months were randomly divided into model group,ganoderma lucidum treatment groups,including high [2250 mg/(kg.d)] and middle [750 mg/(kg.d)] dose groups,i.e.LZ-H and LZ-M groups,and the positive control group(treated with donepezil hydrochloride [2 mg/(kg.d)]).In addition,C57BL/6J wild mice were selected as normal group.The animals were administered for 4 months.Histopathological examinations including hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining,immunohistochemistry,special staining,and electron microscopy were applied,and then the pathological morphology and structures in different groups were compared. Results The senile plaques and neurofibrillar tangles in the cerebrum and cerebellum were dissolved or disappeared in LZ-H and LZ-M groups.Decrease of amyloid angiopathy was found in LZ-H and LZ-M groups.The immature neurons appeared more in hippocampus and dentate nucleus of LZ-H and LZ-M groups than those in AD model and donepezil hydrochloride groups(hippcampus:F=1.738,P=0.016;dentate nucleus:F=1.924,P=0.026),and these immature neurons differentiated to be neurons.More Purkinje cells loss occurred in AD model mice than that in LZ-H and LZ-M groups(F=9.46,P=0.007;F=9.46,P=0.010).The LZ-H and LZ-M groups had more new neuron stem cells grown up in cerebellum.Electromicroscopic examination showed the hippocampal neurons in LZ-H and LZ-M group were integrated,the nuclear membrane was intact,and the mitochondria in the cytoplasm,endoplasmic reticulum,Golgi bodies,microtubules,and synapses were also complete.The microglial cell showed no abnormality.No toxicity appeared in the pathological specimens of mice treated with ganoderma lucidum preparation.Conclusion The ganoderma lucidum preparation can dissolve and decline or dismiss the senile plaques and neurofibrillar tangles in the brain of AD mice and also reduce the amyloid angiopathy.",
