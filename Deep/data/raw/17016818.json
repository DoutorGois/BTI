     "AB": "The subiculum has long been considered as a simple bidirectional relay region interposed between the hippocampus and the temporal cortex. Recent evidence, however, suggests that this region has specific roles in the cognitive functions and pathological deficits of the hippocampal formation. A group of 20 researchers participated in an ESF-sponsored meeting in Oxford in September, 2005 focusing on the neurobiology of the subiculum. Each brought a distinct expertise and approach to the anatomy, physiology, psychology, and pathologies of the subiculum. Here, we review the recent findings that were presented at the meeting.",
