     "AB": "GABAergic projections terminate on numerous hippocampal interneurons containing calcium binding proteins (CBPs), including calbindin D28k (CB), calretinin (CR) and parvalbumin (PV). Memory deficits and expression levels of CB, CR, and PV were examined in the hippocampal subregions following systemic scopolamine (Scop; 1 mg/kg) treatment for 4 weeks in mice. Scop treatment induced significant memory deficits from 1 week after Scop treatment. CB, CR and PV immunoreactivities distributions were in hippocampal subregions [CA1 and CA3 regions, and the dentate gyrus (DG)]. CB immunoreactivity (CB+) was gradually decreased in all subregions until 2 weeks after Scop treatment, and CB+ was decreased to the lowest level in all subregions at 3 and 4 weeks. CR+ in the CA1 region was gradually decreased until 2 weeks and hardly observed at 3 and 4 weeks; in the CA3 region, CR+ was not altered in all subregions at any time. In the DG, CR+ was gradually decreased until 2 weeks and lowest at 3 and 4 weeks. PV+ in the CA1 region was not altered at 1 week, and gradually decreased from 2 weeks. In the CA3 region, PV+ did not change in any subregions at any time. In the DG, PV+ was not altered at 1 week, decreased at 2 weeks, and lowest at 3 and 4 weeks. In brief, Scop significantly decreased CBPs expressions in the hippocampus >/=3 weeks after the treatment although memory deficits had developed at 1 week. Therefore, it is suggested that Scop (1 mg/kg) must be systemically treated for >/=3 weeks to investigate changes in expression levels of CBPs in the hippocampus.",
