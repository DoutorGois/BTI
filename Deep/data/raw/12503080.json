     "AB": "Traditionally, the sources of guidance cues for dendritic outgrowth are mainly associated with external bodies (A) rather than with the same neuron from which dendrites originate (B). To quantify the relationship between factors A and B as determinants of the adult dendritic shape, the morphology of 83 intracellularly characterized, stained, completely reconstructed, and digitized principal neurons of the rat hippocampus was statistically analyzed using Bayesian optimization. It was found that the dominant directional preference (tropism) manifested in dendritic turns is to grow away from the soma rather than toward the incoming fibers or in any other fixed direction; therefore, B is predominant. Results are robust and consistent for all examined morphological classes (dentate gyrus granule cells, basal and apical trees of CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells). In addition, computer remodeling of neurons based on the measured parameters produced virtual structures consistent with real morphologies, as confirmed by measurement of several global emergent parameters. Thus, the simple description of dendritic shape based on dendrites' tendency to grow straight, away from their own soma, and with additional random deflections, proves remarkably accurate and complete. Although based on adult neurons, these results suggest that dendritic guidance during development may be associated primarily with the host cell. This possibility challenges the traditional concept of dendritic guidance: in that hippocampal cells are densely packed and have highly overlapping dendritic fields, the somatodendritic repulsion must be cell specific. Plausible mechanisms involving extracellular effects of spikes are discussed, together with feasible experimental tests and predicted results.",
