     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: Several lines of evidence suggest that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in weight regulation and eating behaviors as well as in the activity-dependent neuroplasticity underlying learning and memory behaviors involving the hippocampus. In anorexia nervosa (AN) patients, abnormal serum BDNF concentrations, cognitive impairments and specific personality traits have been traditionally observed. This study explores the levels of four serum neurotrophins [BDNF, neurotrophin 3 (NTF3), neurotrophin 4 (NTF4) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)] with respect to their use as potential biomarkers for AN. This study also investigates any associations that might exist between serum neurotrophin levels and neurocognitive impairment or personality traits. METHODS: Serum neurotrophin concentrations were measured in 60 AN patients (AN group) and 45 healthy controls (HC group). We correlated the serum levels of the four neurotrophins BDNF, NTF3, NTF4 and GDNF and the clinical type of anorexia. We also analyzed the relationship between serum neurotrophin levels and the Beck Depression Inventory, body mass index, executive functions by the Wisconsin Card Sorting test (WCST) and personality dimensions by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) test. RESULTS: Serum NTF4 concentrations were significantly lower when comparing all AN patients (34.7 +/- 72.5 pg/ml) or restriction type AN patients (29.1 +/- 62.5 pg/ml) with the HC group (58.4 +/- 135.8 pg/ml; p = 0.004 and p = 0.005, respectively). A significant correlation (p < 0.005) between BDNF serum levels and patient personality dimensions as measured by the TCI test was observed. Furthermore, significant correlations were observed between NTF4 and GDNF serum levels and executive function as measured by the WCST. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that NTF4 might serve as a biomarker for AN. Furthermore, BDNF and GDNF serum levels appear to be associated with personality traits and executive function.",
