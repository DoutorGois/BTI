     "AB": "This study was to examine the effects of treadmill exercise on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rat hippocampus. After 1-wk treadmill familiarization, animals in exercise groups received a 4-wk exercise training or an acute exercise. They were sacrificed 2 h or 2 d after exercise and their hippocampal BDNF mRNA and protein levels were determined. We demonstrated that 1) hippocampal BDNF mRNA and protein levels were both elevated in response to exercise training at 2 h after the last run but not after 2 d; 2) an acute moderate exercise (1 or 3 d) increased BDNF protein levels; 3) acute severe exercise increased BDNF protein and mRNA levels in animals under a familiarization regimen, while suppressed the BDNF mRNA level in rats without treadmill familiarization, paralleling the stress effect of immobilization/water exposure. We conclude that compulsive treadmill exercise with pre-familiarization acutely upregulates rat hippocampal BDNF gene expression.",
