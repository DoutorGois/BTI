     "AB": "Synaptic strength is modified by the temporal coincidence of synaptic inputs without back-propagating action potentials (BPAPs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons. In order to clarify the interactive mechanisms of associative long-term potentiation (LTP) without BPAPs, local paired stimuli were applied to the dendrites using high-speed laser uncaging stimulation equipment. When the spatial distance between the paired stimuli was <10 micrometer, nonlinear amplification in excitatory postsynaptic potential summation was observed. In the time window from -20 to 20 ms, supralinear amplification was observed. Supralinear amplification was modulated by antagonist of voltage-gated Na(+)/Ca(2+) channels and NMDA-type glutamate receptors. These results are closely related to the spatiotemporal-characteristics of associative LTP without BPAPs. This study proposes an essential aspect of dendritic information processing.",
