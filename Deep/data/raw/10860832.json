     "AB": "To elucidate the mechanism regulating the selective transport of mRNAs to synaptic sites, we compared the synaptosomal mRNAs with those from the forebrain using the differential display method. The ferritin H chain mRNA was found to be highly enriched in the synaptosomes. In situ hybridization for the ferritin H chain mRNA in the cultured dissociated neurons and in the hippocampal brain slices demonstrated its existence in the dendritic region. These data clearly indicate the selective translocation of the ferritin H chain mRNA into the dendrites and suggested the local expression of ferritin at the synapse.",
