     "AB": "Brief oxygen deprivation causes reversible, rapid and large scale redistribution of ions in hippocampal slice preparations. Intracellular recordings revealed remarkable increases of membrane conductance in neurons restricted for the period of hypoxic spreading depression (SD). Voltage-clamp technique was applied to explore further details of the SD-associated conductance changes. Patch-clamp recording in whole-cell configuration allowed better control of membrane potentials. High resolution current-voltage (I-V) plots were obtained by ramp command technique. Limitations of the techniques and various test protocols are evaluated.",
