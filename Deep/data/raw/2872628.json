     "AB": "Changes in the activities of enzymes responsible for the active transport of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ in synaptosomal membrane (SM) preparations from the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and thalamus with hypothalamus after incubation with L-glutamate (Glu) or kainic acid (KA) were investigated. Glu stimulated Ca,Mg- and Na,K-ATPase activities in cortex but reduced the activities of all the investigated ATPases, except Na,K-ATPase in the hippocampus and thalamus with hypothalamus. KA reduced distinctly the activity of ATPases in the cortex and only slightly in the thalamus with hypothalamus, but stimulated the enzyme activities in the hippocampus. Both, Glu and KA in vitro altered the processes of active transport of cations in SM preparations.",
