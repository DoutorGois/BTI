     "AB": "We have demonstrated that kainate (KA) induces a reduction in mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) expression in the rat hippocampus and that KA-induced oxidative damage is more prominent in senile-prone (SAM-P8) than senile-resistant (SAM-R1) mice. To extend this, we examined whether KA seizure sensitivity contributed to mitochondrial degeneration in these mouse strains. KA-induced seizure susceptibility in SAM-P8 mice paralleled prominent increases in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation and was accompanied by significant impairment in glutathione homeostasis in the hippocampus. These findings were more pronounced in the mitochondrial fraction than in the hippocampal homogenate. Consistently, KA-induced decreases in Mn-SOD protein expression, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 expression were more prominent in SAM-P8 than SAM-R1 mice. Marked release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol and a higher level of caspase-3 cleavage were observed in KA-treated SAM-P8 mice. Additionally, electron microscopic evaluation indicated that KA-induced increases in mitochondrial damage and lipofuscin-like substances were more pronounced in SAM-P8 than SAM-R1 animals. These results suggest that KA-mediated mitochondrial oxidative stress contributed to hippocampal degeneration in the senile-prone mouse.",
