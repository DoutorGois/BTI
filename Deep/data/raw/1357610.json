     "AB": "We assessed, by quantitative autoradiography, the density of high-affinity alpha 2-adrenoceptors in hippocampus and frontal cortex sections from 18 patients dying with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in comparison with a control group of 13 matched cases. The full agonist [3H]bromoxidine (UK-14304) was used as a ligand. In AD brains, the specific binding of [3H]bromoxidine was markedly decreased both in frontal cortex, the reduction ranging from 55% on layer I (P less than 0.0005) to 40% loss on layers IV-VI (P less than 0.01), and in the hippocampus where the mean of alpha 2-receptor loss was 53% both for the CA1 (P less than 0.0005) and the dentate gyrus (P less than 0.005). This dramatic decrease in the density of functional, high-affinity alpha 2-adrenoceptors very probably reflects the neuronal loss described in locus coeruleus of AD brains. The important implications of these findings for the pharmacological treatment of AD are discussed.",
