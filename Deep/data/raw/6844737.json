     "AB": "Electrical stimulation of the hippocampus evoked body shaking in both control and reserpinized rats. The incidence of shaking induced by hippocampal stimulation was higher in reserpine-treated rats than in control rats. Stimulation of the amygdala, striatum and substantia nigra failed to elicit shaking. Body shaking induced by hippocampal stimulation was inhibited by phentolamine but not by methysergide, atropine and haloperidol. The results indicate that hippocampal stimulation elicits body shaking in which noradrenergic function may be involved.",
