     "AB": "We investigated the neuropharmacological effects of the methanolic extract from Lactuca capensis Thunb. leaves (100 and 200 mg/kg) for 21 days on memory impairment in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) rat model produced by direct intraventricular delivery of amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42). Behavioural assays such as Y-maze and radial arm maze test were used for assessing memory performance. Abeta1-42 decreased cognitive performance in the behavioural tests which were ameliorated by pre-treatment with the methanolic extract. Acetylcholinesterase activity and oxidant-antioxidant balance in the rat hippocampus were abnormally altered by Abeta1-42 treatment while these deficits were recovered by pre-treatment with the methanolic extract. In addition, rats were given Abeta1-42 exhibited in the hippocampus decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA copy number and increased IL-1beta mRNA copy number which was reversed by the methanolic extract administration. These findings suggest that the methanolic extract could be a potent neuropharmacological agent against dementia via modulating cholinergic activity, increasing of BDNF levels and promoting antioxidant action in the rat hippocampus.",
