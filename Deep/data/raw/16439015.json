     "AB": "Using radioactive in situ hybridisation, the distribution of prodynorphin mRNA in the brains of C57Bl/6 mice was systemically investigated, and double-labelling in situ hybridisation was used to determine the extent to which neuropeptide Y (NPY) and prodynorphin mRNAs were co-expressed. Our results demonstrate that prodynorphin mRNA expression in the mouse brain is localised at specific subregions of the olfactory bulb, cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, mesencephalon and myelencephalon. Among the regions displaying the most intense labelling were the olfactory tubercle, lateral septum (LS), caudate putamen (Cpu), central amygdaloid nucleus (Ce), paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus (SO), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), lateral reticular nucleus (LRt) and solitary tract nucleus (NTS). In the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (Arc), double-labelling in situ hybridisation revealed that prodynorphin expressing neurons also contained NPY mRNA, with a co-localisation rate of approximately 88% in the lateral part of the Arc, and 79% in the dorsal part of the Arc, respectively, suggesting potential overlapping functions of these two neurotransmitters in feeding type behaviour.",
