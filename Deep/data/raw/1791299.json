     "AB": "The ultrastructural changes of neurons following in situ injection of biotenic acid into the adult rat hippocampus were investigated. Independent from the localization of the injection site, swelling and subsequent vacuolar degeneration was seen in the center of the induced lesion, in the periphery the nerve cells degenerated electrondense and shrunk. In the center of the lesion all perikarya degenerated, whereas a considerable amount of different hippocampal interneurons survived in the lesion's periphery. Furthermore, the extent of the lesion sites suggested that CA1 pyramids were more sensitive than CA3 perikarya and the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. The different vulnerability of the various hippocampal neurons to the in situ exposure of ibotenic acid can tentatively be interpreted by their differing receptor equipment.",
