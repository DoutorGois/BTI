     "AB": "The entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, the hippocampus and the amygdala are heavily interconnected limbic structures that are implicated in memory, and under pathological conditions, in seizure generation and propagation of temporal lobe epilepsy. In-vitro coronal preparations have been limited by the anatomical disposition of these structures. Here we describe a modified horizontal slice preparation that includes all these structures in the same plane. To evaluate whether axonal connectivities are preserved, fluorescent tracers were used. Most of the connections known from in-vivo studies within and between the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, the amygdala (basolateral nucleus, lateral nucleus, and amygdalopiriform transition area) and the hippocampus were preserved in the 400 microm-thick horizontal slices employed.",
