     "AB": "Cortical projections to subdivisions of the cingulate cortex in the rhesus monkey were analyzed with horseradish peroxidase and tritiated amino acid tracers. These projections were evaluated in terms of an expanded cytoarchitectural scheme in which areas 24 and 23 were divided into three ventrodorsal parts, i.e., areas 24a-c and 23a-c. Most cortical input to area 25 originated in the frontal lobe in lateral areas 46 and 9 and orbitofrontal areas 11 and 14. Area 25 also received afferents from cingulate areas 24b, 24c, and 23b, from rostral auditory association areas TS2 and TS3, from the subiculum and CA1 sector of the hippocampus, and from the lateral and accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala (LB and AB, respectively). Areas 24a and 24b received afferents from areas 25 and 23b of cingulate cortex, but most were from frontal and temporal cortices. These included the following areas: frontal areas 9, 11, 12, 13, and 46; temporal polar area TG as well as LB and AB; superior temporal sulcus area TPO; agranular insular cortex; posterior parahippocampal cortex including areas TF, TL, and TH and the subiculum. Autoradiographic cases indicated that area 24c received input from the insula, parietal areas PG and PGm, area TG of the temporal pole, and frontal areas 12 and 46. Additionally, caudal area 24 was the recipient of area PG input but not amygdalar afferents. It was also the primary site of areas TF, TL, and TH projections. The following projections were observed both to and within posterior cingulate cortex. Area 29a-c received inputs from area 46 of the frontal lobe and the subiculum and in turn it projected to area 30. Area 30 had afferents from the posterior parietal cortex (area Opt) and temporal area TF. Areas 23a and 23b received inputs mainly from frontal areas 46, 9, 11, and 14, parietal areas Opt and PGm, area TPO of superior temporal cortex, and areas TH, TL, and TF. Anterior cingulate areas 24a and 24b and posterior areas 29d and 30 projected to area 23. Finally, a rostromedial part of visual association area 19 also projected to area 23. The origin and termination of these connections were expressed in a number of different laminar patterns. Most corticocortical connections arose in layer III and to a lesser extent layer V, while others, e.g., those from the cortex of the superior temporal sulcus, had an equal density of cells in both layers III and V.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
