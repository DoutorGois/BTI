     "AB": "The effect of single and repeated (19 days) intragastric ethanol administration on prodynorphin mRNA and alpha-neoendorphin levels in the hippocampus of the rat was studied using in situ hybridization and RIA methods, respectively. Single ethanol administration had no effect on either of these two parameters. Repeated ethanol administration decreased both immunoreactive (ir) alpha-neoendorphin (by ca. 37%) and prodynorphin mRNA (by ca. 57%) levels. Two days after the last dose of ethanol no changes in the ir-alpha-neoendorphin tissue content were found, whereas the level of prodynorphin mRNA remained decreased (by ca. 44%). These results suggest that repeated ethanol evokes a long-lasting decrease in the biosynthesis of hippocampal prodynorphin, this effect that may play some role in the ethanol-induced deficiency of neuronal functions.",
