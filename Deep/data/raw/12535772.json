     "AB": "This study investigates the effects of cerebral microembolism on motor performance and risk assessment behavior in the rat. Cerebral infarcts were produced in rats by injecting small plastic beads into the left heart ventricle under short-acting anesthesia. The functional outcome was tested 24 h later by subjecting the animals to a series of consecutive behavioral tests. Thereafter, the rats were anesthetized and underwent magnetic resonance imaging. On average about seven infarcts per brain were found. The volume of the individual infarcts was largest in the hippocampus (mean=4.26 mm(3)) and smallest in the white matter (mean=0.83 mm(3)). Embolized animals performed spontaneous and evident locomotion. The activity was, however, significantly decreased compared to rats treated with vehicle. More specific tests for motor ability revealed reduced gait capacity and muscular strength. A significant relationship was found between behaviors reflecting motor ability and the total volume of infarcted tissue in the brain stem, cortex and cerebellum. Also the behavioral profile of risk and benefit assessment was found to be altered by the microembolization. It is concluded that the combination of the microembolization method and behavioral tests provides a valuable tool for further studies of the pathophysiology of, and potential treatment for, cerebral infarction.",
