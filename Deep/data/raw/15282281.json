     "PG": "6765-75",
     "AB": "Voltage-gated sodium channels interact with cytosolic proteins that regulate channel trafficking and/or modulate the biophysical properties of the channels. Na(v)1.6 is heavily expressed at the nodes of Ranvier along adult CNS and PNS axons and along unmyelinated fibers in the PNS. In an initial yeast two-hybrid screen using the C terminus of Na(v)1.6 as a bait, we identified FHF2B, a member of the FGF homologous factor (FHF) subfamily, as an interacting partner of Na(v)1.6. Members of the FHF subfamily share approximately 70% sequence identity, and individual members demonstrate a cell- and tissue-specific expression pattern. FHF2 is abundantly expressed in the hippocampus and DRG neurons and colocalizes with Na(v)1.6 at mature nodes of Ranvier in myelinated sensory fibers in the dorsal root of the sciatic nerve. However, retinal ganglion cells and spinal ventral horn motor neurons show very low levels of FHF2 expression, and their axons exhibit no nodal FHF2 staining within the optic nerve and ventral root, respectively. Thus, FHF2 is selectively localized at nodes of dorsal root sensory but not ventral root motor axons. The coexpression of FHF2B and Na(v)1.6 in the DRG-derived cell line ND7/23 significantly increases the peak current amplitude and causes a 4 mV depolarizing shift of voltage-dependent inactivation of the channel. The preferential expression of FHF2B in sensory neurons may provide a basis for physiological differences in sodium currents that have been reported at the nodes of Ranvier in sensory versus motor axons.",
