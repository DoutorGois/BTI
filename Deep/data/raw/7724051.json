     "AB": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats were continuously infused with morphine through subcutaneously implanted mini-osmotic pumps over a period of 5 days. The binding of rat growth hormone (rGH) to specific sites in choroid plexus, cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus and striatum was determined. It was found that in the acute phase of morphine administration the density of growth hormone-binding sites was significantly decreased in choroid plexus and in hypothalamus, but not in any other of the tissues studied. When tolerance to morphine was developed, the level of growth hormone-binding was restored to control level. In the acute phase, the plasma levels of GH, as measured by radioimmunoassay, correlated negatively with the density of the binding sites in choroid plexus and hypothalamus. The decrease in growth hormone-binding in these regions of the rat brain was also confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cross-linked complexes of the binding entities to 125I-labelled rGH as visualized by autoradiography. In experiments, where morphine was administrated by intermittent injections, a similar decrease in rGH-binding was observed. However, the time-course of this decrease seemed to be dependent upon the route of administration. Following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections, the binding of the hormone was already affected after 30 min, whereas the binding of rGH in brain areas after subcutaneous (s.c.) injections was affected at a later stage.",
