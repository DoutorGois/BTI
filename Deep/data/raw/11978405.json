     "AB": "Previous data proved that NSF* was an epilepsy related gene (ERG1). In this study, using phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (PS-ODN), an antisense of NSF to downregulate the function of NSF in vitro cultured hippocampus neurons and PC12, this treatment simultaneously induced enhancement of the neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons and PC12, a phenomenon similar to the structural changes following epilepsy. Immunocytochemistry analysis showed that the enhancement of neurite outgrowth was in a sequence-specific manner and Northern blot confirmed that the decrease of NSF mRNA levels in PC12 was in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover the expression of NSF was downregulated during differentiation of PC12 induced by NGF and high KCl. Therefore, providing more evidence to support the fact that NSF was an ERG1.",
