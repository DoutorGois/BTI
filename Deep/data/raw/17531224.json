     "AB": "In the present study, we investigated ischemia-induced changes of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate synthesizing enzyme and degrading enzyme and neuroprotective effects and roles of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate against ischemic damage in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate oxidase and pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase immunoreactivities were changed in neurons up to 2 days after ischemia, while 4 days after ischemia their immunoreactivities were expressed in astrocytes. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate oxidase immunoreactivity and its protein level were highest 12 h after ischemia, while those in pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase were highest 2 days after ischemia. Total activities of these enzymes were changed after ischemia, but specific activities of the enzymes were not altered. Treatment with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate into brains (4 microg/5 microl, i.c.v.) at 30 min before transient ischemia protected about 80% of CA1 pyramidal cells 4 days after ischemia and induced elevation of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 immunoreactivity in the CA1 region. However, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate treatment into ischemic brains decreased GABA transaminase immunoreactivity in the CA1 region after ischemia. These results indicate that pyridoxal 5'-phosphate may be associated with the inhibitory discharge of GABA in the hippocampal CA1 neurons, and the increased level of GABA may protect hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells from ischemic damage.",
