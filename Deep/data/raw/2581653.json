     "AB": "The binding of [125I]physalaemin to rat brain slices was investigated. Radiolabeled physalaemin bound with high affinity (Kd = 0.3 nM) to a single class of sites (Bmax = 22 fmol/mg protein). Kinetic studies indicated that binding was time-dependent and all specific binding was reversible. Pharmacology studies indicated that specific [125I]physalaemin binding was inhibited by structurally related peptides such as substance P and eledoisin. Biochemical studies indicated that specific binding of radiolabeled physalaemin was greatly reduced if the brain slices were pretreated with heat, trypsin or N-ethyl maleimide. Autoradiographic studies indicated that the [125I]physalaemin binding sites were discretely distributed throughout the brain. Highest grain densities were present in the olfactory bulb, dentate gyrus, amygdala, superficial layers of the superior colliculus, subiculum, dorsal parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, nucleus tractus solitarii and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Moderate grain densities were present in the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, pyriform cortex, striatum, hippocampus, inferior colliculus and central gray of the midbrain. Low grain densities were present in most thalamic nuclei, the substantia nigra and cerebellum. The corpus callosum and controls treated with 1 microM unlabeled physalaemin had negligible levels of binding. The unique pharmacological and regional distribution data obtained suggest that [125I]physalaemin may serve as a valuable probe to study central substance P receptors.",
