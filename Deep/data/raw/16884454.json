     "AB": "Interferon-alpha therapy is associated with a high rate of depression, but the pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of i.p. administered interferon-alpha on monoaminergic neurotransmission in the brain. The levels of monoamines and associated metabolites were measured in various regions of the rat brain using a high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection system. The serotonin transporter mRNA levels were also measured using in situ hybridization. After 1 day, dopamine turnover was diminished in the cortex. Norepinephrine turnover was decreased in most regions tested after 4 days. However, these changes were transient. After 14 days, serotonin turnover was increased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus in rats given a dose of 20 000 IU/kg; in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus and brainstem in those on 200 000 IU/kg; and in the thalamus and hypothalamus in those on 2 000 000 IU/kg (all P < 0.05). However, 14-day treatment did not significantly change serotonin transporter mRNA levels. Next, the question of whether interferon-alpha affects monoamine levels via induction of nitric oxide (NO), was investigated. However, there were no changes in either NO2- or NO3-, as markers of NO production, in any brain regions after 14-day treatment. These results suggest that chronic peripheral administration of interferon-alpha induces metabolic changes in the central serotonin system. Further investigation is needed to determine exactly how this cytokine affects the central serotonin system and to assess whether a central serotonin abnormality is involved in interferon-induced depression.",
