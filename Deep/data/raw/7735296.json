     "AB": "Administration of exogenous glucocorticoids is known to suppress the HPA axis and has been reported to occupy brain glucocorticoid receptors, eventually leading to down-regulation. To determine the effects of chronic corticosterone administration on HPA axis function, corticosterone was administered as both 25% and 50% corticosterone/cholesterol pellets. Rats were sacrificed 6 days after corticosterone pellet implantation. The 25% corticosterone pellets produced a small increase in morning corticosterone concentrations but no change in evening ACTH or corticosterone secretion. The 50% corticosterone pellets produced constant corticosterone concentrations of 5-6 micrograms/dl, with no circadian variation in corticosterone, indicating inhibition of evening ACTH and corticosterone secretion. The 25% corticosterone pellets produced no significant decrease in thymus weight or in adrenal weight; 50% corticosterone pellets produced significant decreases in thymus weight and adrenal weight. Neither 25% nor 50% corticosterone pellets produced significant decreases in GR in hippocampus and cortex. The 50% corticosterone pellets treatment resulted in a decrease in anterior pituitary POMC mRNA levels, a decrease in baseline and oCRH stimulated ACTH release from the anterior pituitary, and a near complete inhibition of the AM and PM response to restraint stress. These results suggest that: 1) the HPA axis was able to adjust to the small increase in glucocorticoids produced by the 25% cort pellets with minimal disturbances in function and 2) 50% corticosterone pellets exert a significant inhibitory effect on stress and diurnal ACTH secretion which appears to be exerted at the pituitary as well as possible inhibitory effects on brain.",
