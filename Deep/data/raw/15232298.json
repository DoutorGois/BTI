     "AB": "Experimentally induced heterotopia exhibit many of the anatomical features characteristic of cortical malformations in children with early-onset epilepsy. We used extracellular field potential recordings from the dorsal hippocampus of intact adult rats to determine whether the excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells was enhanced in rats with experimentally induced hippocampal dysplasia. Electrical stimulation of afferent fibers resulted in more robust population responses in the CA1 region of methylazoxymethanol (MAM)-treated rats vs the controls. The local population of CA1 pyramidal neurons was more excitable in the MAM-treated rat than in the control animals after synaptic activation. These results suggest that the excitability of the CA1 region in rats with hippocampal dysplasia is greater than that in control animals.",
