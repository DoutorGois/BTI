     "AB": "1. In the present study we investigated the role of A2A adenosine receptors in hippocampal synaptic transmission under in vitro ischaemia-like conditions. 2. The effects of adenosine, of the selective A2A receptor agonist, CGS 21680 (2-[p-(2-carboxyethyl)-phenethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoade nos ine ), and of selective A2A receptor antagonists, ZM 241385 (4-(2-[7-amino-2-(2-furyl)- inverted question mark1,2,4 inverted question mark-triazolo inverted question mark2,3-a inverted question mark inverted question mark1,3, 5 inverted question marktriazin-5-ylamino]ethyl)phenol) and SCH 58261 (7-(2-phenylethyl)-5-amino-2-(2-furyl)-pyrazolo-[4,3-e]-1,2, 4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine), have been evaluated on the depression of field e.p.s.ps induced by an in vitro ischaemic episode. 3. The application of 2 min of in vitro ischaemia brought about a rapid and reversible depression of field e.p.s.ps, which was completely prevented in the presence of the A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX (1, 3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine) (100 nM). On the other hand both A2A receptor antagonists, ZM 241385 and SCH 58261, by themselves did not modify the field e.p.s.ps depression induced by in vitro ischaemia. 4. A prolonged application of either adenosine (100 micronM) or CGS 21680 (30, 100 nM) before the in vitro ischaemic episode, significantly reduced the synaptic depression. These effects were antagonized in the presence of ZM 241385 (100 nM). 5. SCH 58261 (1 and 50 nM) did not antagonize the effect of 30 nM CGS 21680 on the ischaemia-induced depression. 6. These results indicate that in the CA1 area of the hippocampus the stimulation of A2A adenosine receptors attenuates the A1-mediated depression of synaptic transmission induced by in vitro ischaemia.",
