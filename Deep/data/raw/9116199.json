     "AB": "This study aimed to examine the functional coupling between midbrain raphe and the septohippocampal system at the level of neuronal firing. Raphe unit activity and hippocampal EEG were simultaneously recorded in urethane-anaesthetized rats and their relationship was examined in the frequency domain. Subsets of presumably non-serotonergic neurones in both the dorsal and median raphe nuclei fired rhythmically in synchrony with hippocampal theta activity. Theta cells in the median raphe showed higher coherence than those in dorsal raphe and formed a more homogeneous group of cells, according to their firing rates. Since the raphe-septal serotonergic system is known to desynchronize the hippocampal EEG, activation of a subset of nonserotonergic cells during theta in this nucleus indicates a feedback from the limbic circuitry on the ascending raphe control of forebrain activity.",
