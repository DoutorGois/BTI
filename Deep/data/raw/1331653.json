     "AB": "Unilateral carotid ligation in immature rats, followed by either 15 min (moderate group) or 90 min (severe group) of hypoxia were used to assess the effects of hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) on the accumulation of the neuropeptide calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP). Severe, but not moderate, HI produced a massive time-dependent increase in CGRP-like immunoreactivity throughout the damaged regions of the brain (neocortex, caudate-putamen, hippocampus) beginning at 24 h and maximal at 3-5 days after HI. By 11 days after HI levels appeared to have returned to baseline. The increased immunoreactivity was largely localized to presumed axon terminals contacting neurons, blood vessels and non-nerve cells. Scattered neurons in the cingulate cortex, piriform cortex and striatum also showed increased immunoreactivity in their soma. These results raise the possibility that CGRP may be involved in neuronal repair after HI in the infant brain.",
