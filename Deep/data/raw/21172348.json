     "AB": "Neuroactive steroids are synthesized in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of environmental enrichment on neuroactive steroidogenesis in the rat hippocampus. Environmental enrichment rats were housed in a group of nine in a large cage and three groups of pair-housed rats were housed in a standard cage for 8 weeks. The levels of mRNAs for steroidogenic enzymes and proteins in hippocampus were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Environmental enrichment increased the mRNA expression levels of 5alpha-reductase-1 and 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which catalyze synthesis of allopregnanolone from progesterone. Hence, environmental enrichment appears to affect allopregnanolone synthesis.",
