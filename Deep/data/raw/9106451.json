     "AB": "We previously reported a modified fluid percussion device capable of consistently producing experimental cortical contusion (CC) and diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in separate groups of rats by lateral and midline fluid percussion, respectively. The purpose of the present study was to compare the differences in learning acquisition and memory retention impairments between these two types of injured rats in the chronic stage using the Morris water maze technique. We also compared the histological differences between these two different types of traumatic brain injury. The results showed a statistically significant difference in learning acquisition impairment between the sham and CC rats and also between the sham and DAI rats. However, a significant difference in memory retention impairment was observed only between the sham and DAI rats. Histologically, the neuronal cell loss of CA3 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus was observed on the ipsilateral side in the CC and bilaterally in DAI. The neuronal cell loss was seen in bilateral entorhinal cortex layer II in DAI, but it was not seen in CC. From these results, we speculate that the marked cell loss in the hippocampus CA3 region in both CC and DAI rats was related to the impairment of spatial learning acquisition. The marked cell loss in entorhinal cortex layer II in DAI rats may be one of the important factors in the impairment of spatial memory retention.",
