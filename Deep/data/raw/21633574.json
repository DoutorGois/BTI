     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Lead poisoning is a potential factor in brain damage, neurochemical dysfunction and severe behavioral problems. Considering this effect, our study was carried out to investigate the effects of wormwood to restore enzymes activities, lipid peroxidation and behavioral changes induced by lead. METHODS: Thirty Wistar rats were divided into five groups (n = 6 in each group): three groups exposed to 750 ppm of lead acetate in the drinking water for 11 weeks and two groups as control. Aqueous wormwood extract (200 mg/kg body weight) was administrated to intoxicated (Pb(-)+A.AB) and control groups (A.AB) for four supplemental weeks. Activities of acetylcholinesterase (AchE), monoamine oxidase (MAO) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) level were determined in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, cortex and striatum of male rats and the grooming and locomotors activity were defined in all groups. RESULTS: The intoxicated group (Pb) has a significantly increased TBARS value compared with the control in all regions (P < 0.05) and, after treatment with the wormwood extract, a significant reduction was noted. The enzyme activity decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in the Pb group compared with the control, essentially for the hippocampus (AchE: -57%, MAO: -41%) and the striatum (AchE: -43%, MAO: -51%). After wormwood extract administration, the AchE and MAO activity were significantly increased in all brain regions compared with the Pb group (P < 0.05). The behavioral test (locomotors and grooming test) indicates a significant hyperactivity in the Pb group compared with the control group. After treatment with wormwood extract, the Pb(-)+A.Ab indicates a lower activity compared with Pb. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that wormwood extract may play a very useful role in reduction of the neurotoxicological damage induced by lead.",
