     "AB": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) density has been found to be sensitive to stress. We set out to compare the influences of acute and repeated swim stress on behavior and PBR density. Following acute and repeated swim stress, rats were tested in an elevated plus-maze and an open-field test for anxiety levels, and tissues were collected from the adrenal gland, kidney, and hippocampus for measurements of PBR density. The acute rather than the repeated stress led to robust alterations in PBR density. The largest reduction in hippocampal and adrenal gland PBR density was found one hour after acute stress. In the hippocampus, acute stress caused a biphasic change in PBR density: a robust reduction in PBR density one hour after the acute stress and a distinct elevation in PBR density at 24 hours, while 72 hours after stress the elevation in PBR density appeared to be reduced.",
