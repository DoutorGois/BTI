     "AB": "The brain was studied in 11 cases of delirium tremens. Cytochemistry of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein levels in the neurons of the frontal and parietal cortex and the hippocampus was analysed. The findings were compared with the results of examinations in the control group (cases of sudden death of mentally healthy people). Examination of the brain from patients with delirium tremens revealed heterogeneous changes: a statistically significant reduction of protein levels in the neuronal cytoplasm in the frontal and parietal cortex and a negligible elevation of protein levels in the cytoplasm of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons. A considerable increase in protein levels was found in the nuclei of the hippocampus whereas cytochemical alterations in neuronal nuclei in the frontal and parietal cortex were less pronounced. The functional importance of the results obtained is discussed.",
