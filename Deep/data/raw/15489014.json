     "AB": "The expression of the polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) is increased in the hippocampus after chronic restraint stress (CRS) and may play a permissive role in structural changes that include dendrite reorganization in dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 pyramidal neurons and suppression of neurogenesis in DG. We report that chronic oral corticosterone (CORT) administration decreases the number of PSA-NCAM immunoreactive granule neurons in the adult rat dentate gyrus, and the available evidence suggests that this is an indirect effect of CORT, possibly involving excitatory amino acids, that may not be directly related to neurogenesis. Because CORT treatment reduces but does not eliminate PSA-NCAM expression, the present results do not exclude a permissive role for PSA-NCAM in CORT or CRS-induced structural plasticity in hippocampus.",
