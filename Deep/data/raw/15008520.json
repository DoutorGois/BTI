     "AB": "Adult male ICR mice were treated by intraperitoneal injection with 250 mg/kg of bodyweight of commercial malathion (a dose corresponding to 1/12 the LD50). After 6 h, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in blood, liver, and six brain regions was determined. A statistically significant inhibition was observed in whole blood (23%), liver (21%), and, in particular, the central nervous system; the greatest degree of AChE inhibition was observed in the cerebellum (45%), followed by the hippocampus (29%). There was no significant change in AChE activity in the caudate putamen, frontal cortex, midbrain, or pons medulla. These results demonstrate that the magnitude of AChE inhibition in peripheral tissues does not accurately reflect the central-inhibitory effects of malathion on AChE activity in specific brain regions.",
