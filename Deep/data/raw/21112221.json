     "AB": "PURPOSE: We present the electroclinical features, treatment, and evolution of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed the charts of forty-two patients who met the diagnostic criteria of MTLE-HS. The mean follow-up after seizure onset was 10.5 years. RESULTS: According to age, we defined three groups. The first group included nine patients that started with seizures before 2 years of age. Motor seizures were the hallmark clinical manifestation. All patients of this group also presented with motor arrest and oro-alimentary automatisms. In three of them, the interictal EEG recordings showed bilateral paroxysms predominantly in anterior regions, in addition to focal abnormalities, and two had an apparently generalized ictal pattern. The second group included 17 patients that started with seizures between 2 and 10 years of age. In this group the automatisms were also oroalimentary, but more complex and the patients had less motor manifestations. The interictal EEG recordings showed temporal abnormalities. The ictal EEG recordings showed lateralized abnormalities with a maximum in the temporal electrodes. The third group included 16 patients that started with seizures between 10 and 16 years of age. The most common clinical manifestation was abdominal aura followed by oroalimentary, gestural, and verbal automatisms. The interictal and ictal EEG recordings showed well-localized abnormalities in temporal lobes. Thirty-eight patients underwent surgical treatment. Thirty-five patients are seizure free. CONCLUSION: MTLE-HS represents a well-defined and distinct symptomatic epileptic syndrome. Surgical treatment was successful in most patients.",
