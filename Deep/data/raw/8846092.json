     "AB": "Using retrograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated colloidal gold (WGA-gold) combined with immunoreactivity for glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), a specific synthesizing enzyme for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), local projections of GABAergic neurons in the dentate gyrus and CA1 were examined. In the hilus of the dentate gyrus, it was found that GABAergic neurons in the granule cell layer projected to the ipsilateral upper leaf of the molecular layer, with a mediolateral extension of more than 1.2 mm and a rostrocaudal extension of over 0.8 mm. Non-GABAergic neurons in nearly the entire hilar area were found to project to the ipsilateral upper leaf of the molecular layer. In the dorsal CA1 region, GABAergic neurons in the stratum pyramidale and radiatum converged onto the ipsilateral stratum pyramidal/oriens, with a mediolateral extension of over 1 mm and a rostrocaudal extension of over 0.7 mm. These results provide direct evidence that in both the dentate gyrus and CA1, GABAergic interneurons from a fairly large field converge onto a very small target area. This suggests that the output signals from GABAergic neurons in the dentate gyrus and CA1, and non-GABAergic neurons in the dentate gyrus, may propagate beyond the anatomical limits contained in conventional slice preparations of the hippocampal formation.",
