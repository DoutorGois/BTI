     "AB": "Sex hormones such as estrogen (17ss-estradiol) may modulate the zinc content of the hippocampus during the female estrous cycle. The mossy fiber system is highly plastic in the adult brain and is influenced by multiple factors including learning, memory, and stress. However, whether 17ss-estradiol is able to modulate the morphological plasticity of the mossy fibers throughout the estrous cycle remains unknown. Ovariectomized (Ovx) female 70- to 90-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats without or with estrogen supplement (OvxE) were compared with control rats in three stages of the estrous cycle: diestrus, proestrus, and estrus. The brain tissue from each of the five groups was processed with Timm's silver sulfide technique using the Image J program to measure the mossy fiber area in the stratum lucidum of CA3. Total zinc in the hippocampus was measured using Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. Two additional (Ovx and OvxE) groups were examined in spatial learning and memory tasks using the Morris water maze. Similar increases in total zinc content and mossy fiber area were observed. The mossy fiber area decreased by 26 +/- 2 % (difference +/- SEM percentages) in Ovx and 23 +/- 4 % in estrus as compared to the proestrus group and by 18 +/- 2 % in Ovx compared to OvxE. Additionally, only the OvxE group learned and remembered the task. These results suggest that estradiol has a significant effect on zinc content in hippocampal CA3 during the proestrus stage of the estrous cycle and is associated with correct performance in learning and memory.",
