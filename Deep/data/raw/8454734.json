     "AB": "This study assessed interspecies differences in regional brain distribution of [3H]QNB binding, [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin binding and acetylcholinesterase activity, by autoradiographic and histochemical methods. Eleven mammalian species were examined, including carnivores (cat, dog), a lagomorph (rabbit), and rodents (squirrel, guinea pig, gerbil, hamster, vole, lemming, rat, mouse). Comparisons were based on primary visual system structures (superior colliculus, lateral geniculate nucleus, primary visual cortex) and the hippocampal formation. The two radioligands differed greatly in the degree of interspecies variation: while the pattern of [3H]QNB binding was quite similar across species, [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin showed striking interspecies diversity. This contrast was most obvious in laminar patterns of the visual cortex and hippocampal formation. Regional distributions of acetylcholinesterase staining were fairly diverse, and were unlike the patterns of either [3H]QNB or [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin. The two ligands showed more consistency in overall levels across species than did acetylcholinesterase. Possible correlates of the differences in interspecies diversity are discussed.",
