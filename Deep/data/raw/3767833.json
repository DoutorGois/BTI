     "AB": "The objectives of the present study are to assess the import of gene-imposed structural alterations on behavioral performance and obtain performance data preliminary to studies of experimental mouse chimera behavior. Reeler, staggerer, and weaver neurological mutant, and control B6C3 and ichthyosis mice were tested on radial arm maze and active avoidance tasks. Weaver mice had incapacitating seizures while performing the radial arm maze task and were, therefore, removed from further testing. Staggerer mice displayed a significant deficit on both tasks compared to control mice. Homozygous reeler mice (rl/rl) also had a significant deficit on the active avoidance task compared to +/rl control mice but not significantly poorer than ichthyosis mice. However, their performance on the radial arm maze task, while initially poor, improved so that they performed the task similar to wild-type controls. Three of the reeler mice reached criterion for solving the radial arm maze task. None of the staggerer mice reached criterion. These data are discussed in terms of the value of using neurologically mutant mice in dissecting structural-functional relationships. It is suggested that the behavior of these mutants might point toward specific components of cerebellar involvement in behavioral acts.",
