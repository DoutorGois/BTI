     "AB": "In this study, we focused on age-dependent changes in intracellular iron deposition in the gerbil hippocampus. At 1 month of age (PM 1), iron reactivity was weak in the gerbil hippocampus. At this time, cells in the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus showed weak iron reactivity. At PM 3, iron reactivity in cells had not changed significantly. Thereafter, iron reactivity in the CA1-3 regions and in the dentate gyrus increased with time until PM 18. At PM 24, iron reactivity in all the subfields was similar to that at PM 18. In animals aged PM 18-24, iron positive cells had various shapes, and had processes which contained iron. These results suggest that the increase of iron deposition may be associated with normal aging and that the iron deposition in the aged hippocampus is different according to hippocampal subfields.",
