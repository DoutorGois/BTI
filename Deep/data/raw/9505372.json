     "AB": "The activity of carboxypeptidase (CP) H, the enzyme taking part in neuropeptide formation, and activity of recently described phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)--inhibiting CP in males and females of white mongrel rats were studied. Minor differences between the CPH activities in brain regions were found in hippocampus. PMSF-inhibited activity of carboxypeptidase was significantly higher in females than in males in pituitary gland, adrenal gland, olfactory bulbus, optic and auditory bills, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, cerebral hemispheres and spleen. The CPH activity was 5-fold higher in ovaries than in testicles. PMSF-inhibited CP activity in testicles was 3.7-fold lower than in ovaries. Possible participation of basic CP in determination of sexual differences of some neuropeptide level and protein catabolism is studied.",
