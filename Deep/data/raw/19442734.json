     "AB": "In this study, we demonstrate that gamma oscillations (30-50 Hz) recorded in the local field potentials (LFP) of the hippocampus are a marker of temporal lobe seizure propagation and that the level of LFP synchrony in the amygdalo-hippocampal network, during these oscillations, is related to the severity of seizures. Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single systemic dose of kainic acid (KA; 6 mg/kg, i.p.) and local field potential activity (1-475 Hz) of the dorsal hippocampus, the amygdala and the neocortex was recorded. Of 135 ictal discharges, 55 (40.7%) involved both limbic structures. We demonstrated that 78.2% of seizures involving both the hippocampus and amygdala showed hippocampal gamma oscillations. Seizure duration was also significantly correlated with the frequency of hippocampal gamma oscillations (r2=0.31, p<0.01) and LFP synchrony in the amygdalo-hippocampal network (r2=0.21, p<0.05). These results suggest that gamma oscillations in the amygdalo-hippocampal network could facilitate long-range synchrony and participate in the propagation of seizures.",
