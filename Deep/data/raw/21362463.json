     "AB": "Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) is a transcriptional regulator involved in a broad range of cellular processes. To date, however, the expression of KLF6 in brains with pathophysiological conditions, such as epilepsy, has not been reported. Therefore, the present study investigated the temporal pattern of KLF6 expression in the mouse hippocampus and identified cell types expressing KLF6 after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). Seizures were induced by administrating pilocarpine hydrochloride (280 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min after an injection of atropine methyl nitrate (3 mg/kg, i.p.). Pilocarpine- and saline-injected animals were sacrificed 1, 3, 7, 14, or 28 days after the onset of SE. Immunohistochemistry showed that the proportion of KLF6-positive cells increased in the hippocampus 1 day after SE onset, peaked at 3 days after SE, and then gradually decreased until 28 days after SE, consistent with the results from our immunoblot analysis. Cells expressing increased levels of KLF6 following pilocarpine-induced SE also expressed GFAP and Ox-42, markers for astrocytes and microglia, respectively. Quantitative analysis revealed that astrocytes were the major type of KLF6-expressing glial cells. These cells also expressed heat shock protein 47 (HSP47), a collagen-specific molecular chaperone. This is the first report showing that KLF6 is inducible in the hippocampus and may be associated with glial responses, especially HSP47-related tissue remodeling after pilocarpine-induced SE.",
