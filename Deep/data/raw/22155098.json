     "AB": "Abnormally hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau is the main component of the neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), a hallmark pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A lot of studies suggested that there is highly neurobiological correlation between olfactory dysfunction and AD-like pathology, but the effect of the odor stimulation on tau phosphorylation remains unknown. Here, we examined the effect of short-term and long-term enriched odor exposure on the alterations of tau phosphorylation at multiple sites in the rat brains. We found that short-term odor enrichment did not affect the phosphorylation of tau, while long-term odor enrichment dramatically reduce the phosphorylation level of tau at Ser198/199/202, Thr231, Ser396, and Ser404 sites both in the hippocampus and cortex. These data suggest that long-term odor exposure prevent tau phosphorylation and may be a new therapeutic strategy of AD.",
