     "AB": "Selective removal of the medio-basal temporal structures has been introduced as an alternative to standard temporal lobectomy in the treatment of intractable temporal lobe epilepsy not related to gross structural lesions. Various approaches have been described for the surgical excision of the amygdalo-hippocampal complex, each of them presenting advantages and limitations. The recently introduced computer-assisted technique of volumetric stereotactic excision of deep-seated intracerebral lesions combines precision of targeting with elimination of unnecessary cortical trauma and may potentially provide an alternative method in the treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy. We present our experience of stereotactic volumetric selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy in six patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The criteria for selection, the pre-operative evaluation and the operative technique are discussed. All patients had a cessation or considerable reduction in seizure frequency while the morbidity was minimal.",
