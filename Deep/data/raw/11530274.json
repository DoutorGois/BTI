     "AB": "Verbal memory deficits have been related to reduced volume of medial temporal structures in several neurological and psychiatric populations, including schizophrenic patients. Impairments in verbal memory have been proposed to be a marker of risk for schizophrenia. Recently, relatives of schizophrenic patients have been reported to have reduced volume of the amygdala-hippocampal complex. In this study, we evaluate the possibility that amygdala-hippocampal volume reductions may constitute one neural substrate of verbal memory deficits in first-degree relatives. Subjects were 20 healthy first-degree relatives of schizophrenic patients and 14 demographically similar controls. Verbal memory was assessed with the Logical Memory Test. Subjects were scanned with high-resolution MRI and the images were transformed into Talairach space. Volumes of interest were amygdala-anterior hippocampus and posterior hippocampus. Relatives of schizophrenic patients had intact immediate verbal memory but significantly poorer delayed verbal memory than controls. Relatives also had significantly reduced amygdala-anterior hippocampus volumes. Across all subjects, delayed verbal memory was significantly correlated with amygdala-anterior hippocampus volume. The magnitude of the correlation did not differ between the groups. These data provide an empirical link between memory performance and volumetric abnormalities in the amygdala-hippocampal complex in the relatives of schizophrenic patients.",
