     "AB": "We studied neuroprotective properties of 12 structurally different sigma site ligands in primary rat hippocampal cell cultures and analyzed whether they interfere with glutamate-induced activation of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway. Neurotoxicity was triggered with 1 mM glutamate on day 8 of culture. Cells were treated with various concentrations of the compounds for 7 days before glutamate exposure (prolonged pretreatment), or during glutamate exposure (acute treatment). Protection was seen after prolonged pretreatment (long-term protection) with sabeluzole, opipramole, haloperidol, ifenprodil, fenpropimorph, carbetapentane, and tiospirone, with pIC50s of 7.30, 7.15, 6.87, 6.68, 6.66, 6.39, and 6.34, respectively. There was no protection with PD 128298, 1,3-ortho-di-tolylguanidine, BMY-14802, (+)3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-1(propyl) piperidine, or dextromethorphan. Upon acute treatment, only ifenprodil was protective. Interference of the drugs with glutamate activation of the NOS pathway was determined by measuring glutamate-activated cGMP formation and citrulline levels. Glutamate-activated cGMP formation was reduced by all neuroprotective sigma ligands after prolonged pretreatment but not after acute treatment. Sigma ligands added to cell culture lysate did not reduce citrulline formation, evidence that there was no direct effect on the NOS enzyme. We conclude that some but not all sigma ligands exert long-term protective properties against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in primary hippocampal cultures, and that this protection is accompanied by attenuation of cGMP formation in the NOS pathway. However, inhibition of cGMP formation by itself appeared not sufficient for obtaining neuroprotective effects, as inhibition of glutamate-activated cGMP formation by N omega-nitro-L-arginine, haemoglobin, or PD128298 did not provide neuroprotection.",
