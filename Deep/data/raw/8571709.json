     "AB": "The APC gene was identified in 1991 at chromosome 5 q 21, which is responsible for the familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The gene has been classified as one of the tumor suppressor genes. The APC gene mutations were suggested to initiate sporadic as well as inherited colorectal neoplasia and to be related to mental retardation. The different forms of APC gene expression and their association to carcinogenesis have been carefully studied. However, the function of APC gene in the central nervous system has not been known. In this study, on the basis of the cDNA cloning of APC homologue in the guinea pig by Dr. Fan Meng, we rescued this fragment including the full length encoding region from plasmid pMe 18s and then subcloned it into the polylink site of the plasmid pBluscript KS. Both digoxigenin labeled sense and anti-sense RNA were synthesized by in vitro transcription. RNase protection assay and in situ hybridization enable us to examine the distribution of APC transcripts in guinea pig brain. Strong signals were detected in hippocampus. APC mRNA was mainly localized in the pyramidal neurons of CA 1, CA 3, as well as in the dentate granule cells; the cerebellum granular cells also showed strong staining; in the cerebrum, the parietal and primary olfactory cortex showed stronger signals than the frontal cortex; in olfactory bulb, positive cells with strong signals were observed: the brain stem showed a relatively weaker staining. Very similar expression pattern was also shown in embryonic guinea pig brain; except that the expression of APC gene in frontal cortex and olfactory bulb was stronger than that in adult animals. The results suggest that the APC transcripts in brain may play an important role during the early development of the central nervous system. Further study may enable us to take a deeper insight into the mechanism underlying inherited mental deficiency.",
