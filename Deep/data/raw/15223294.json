     "AB": "Specific agonists of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) provide powerful tools to discriminate afferent fibers originating from different presynaptic neurons. The group II mGluR agonists L-CCG-I ((2S,1'S,2'S)-2-(2-carboxycyclopropyl)glycine) and DCG-IV ((2S,2'R,3'R)-2-(2',3'-dicarboxy-cyclopropyl)glycine) are commonly used to distinguish between mossy fiber and associational-commissural (A/C) fiber input to the hippocampal CA3 region because only on the former group II mGluRs are expressed. Since previous reports indicated that L-CCG-I can activate group III mGluRs as well, we investigated whether L-CCG-I depresses A/C field potentials. L-CCG-I (10-300 microM) exhibited a significant dose-dependent and reversible reduction of A/C field potentials by 8 +/- 4% (10 microM), by 32 +/- 4% (100 microM, p < 0.001) and by 38 +/- 7% (300 microM, p < 0.05) that was accompanied by a concomitant increase in paired-pulse facilitation. Moreover, the selective group III antagonist (R,S)-alpha-methylserine-O-phosphate (MSOP; 100 microM) significantly reduced the field potential inhibition by L-CCG-I (100 microM) to 9 +/- 4% (p < 0.05). In contrast, DCG-IV did not affect A/C field potentials. In conclusion, the purported group II mGluR agonist L-CCG-I depresses A/C synaptic transmission by activation of group III mGluRs. For this reason, DCG-IV should be the drug of choice when aiming to discriminate between mossy fiber and A/C input to CA3 pyramidal cells.",
