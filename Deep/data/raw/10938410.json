     "AB": "Previous studies have demonstrated that cerebral ischemia stimulated the increased abundance of immunoreactive PGHS-2, but not PGHS-1, in brain tissue homogenates in late-gestation fetal sheep. The goal of the present study was to detect PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 mRNA in specific fetal brain regions, and to semi-quantitatively detect changes in the abundance of the respective mRNA's in response to cerebral hypoperfusion. Fetal brain tissues were collected from control fetuses and from fetuses 30 min and 2 h after cerebral hypoperfusion (produced by brachiocephalic occlusion). Messenger RNA was studied by RT-PCR, and expressed semiquantitatively as a ratio of PGHS-1 or PGHS-2 mRNA abundance to beta-actin mRNA abundance. PGHS-2 mRNA was only detected in the fetal hippocampus, hypothalamus, and brain stem and it was induced by cerebral hypoperfusion. In contrast, PGHS-1 mRNA was detected in all fetal brain tissues but was not induced. We conclude that cerebral hypoperfusion induced PGHS-2 gene expression in hippocampus, hypothalamus, and brainstem, and we speculate that the increased abundance of the enzyme is likely to be important for control of reflex responses to hypotension in the fetus.",
