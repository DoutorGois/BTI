     "AB": "We have examined by immunoassay and immunohistochemistry, the expression of nerve growth factor in the rat hippocampus, one to 28 days after transient forebrain ischemia. In the CA1 area, the overall level of nerve growth factor expression remained constant over the first three days of reperfusion while it increased by about 45% of control levels after longer postischemic periods. In contrast, a slight decrease in nerve growth factor levels, which was most prominent at three days postlesion, was observed in the other hippocampal regions. Immunohistochemical analysis of the distribution of nerve growth factor showed that its expression was up-regulated in astrocytes but not in microglia of the postischemic CA1 region and that the intensity and temporal profile of the changes in nerve growth factor immunostaining in these cells, was consistent with that observed in the immunoassay. Interestingly, the regulation of the nerve growth factor expression in reactive astrocytes of the postischemic CA1 area closely parallels that of kainate receptor subunits GluR5-7, raising the possibility of a cause-effect relationship. These results indicate that after ischemia nerve growth factor expression is up-regulated in reactive astrocytes suggesting that these cells may contribute to rescuing damaged neurons by means of increasing nerve growth factor production.",
