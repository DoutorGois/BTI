     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Brief heat stimuli that excite nociceptors innervated by finely myelinated (Adelta) fibers evoke an initial, sharp, well-localized pain (\"first pain\") that is distinguishable from the delayed, less intense, more prolonged dull pain attributed to nociceptors innervated by unmyelinated (C) fibers (\"second pain\"). In the present study, we address the question of whether a brief, noxious heat stimulus that excites cutaneous Adelta fibers activates a distinct set of forebrain structures preferentially in addition to those with similar responses to converging input from C fibers. Heat stimuli at two temperatures were applied to the dorsum of the left hand of healthy volunteers in a functional brain imaging (fMRI) paradigm and responses analyzed in a set of volumes of interest (VOI). RESULTS: Brief 41 degrees C stimuli were painless and evoked only C fiber responses, but 51 degrees C stimuli were at pain threshold and preferentially evoked Adelta fiber responses. Most VOI responded to both intensities of stimulation. However, within volumes of interest, a contrast analysis and comparison of BOLD response latencies showed that the bilateral anterior insulae, the contralateral hippocampus, and the ipsilateral posterior insula were preferentially activated by painful heat stimulation that excited Adelta fibers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that two sets of forebrain structures mediate the initial sharp pain evoked by brief cutaneous heat stimulation: those responding preferentially to the brief stimulation of Adelta heat nociceptors and those with similar responses to converging inputs from the painless stimulation of C fibers. Our results suggest a unique and specific physiological basis, at the forebrain level, for the \"first pain\" sensation that has long been attributed to Adelta fiber stimulation and support the concept that both specific and convergent mechanisms act concurrently to mediate pain.",
