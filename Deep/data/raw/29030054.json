     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The CD38/cADPR pathway has been found to play roles in various inflammatory conditions. However, whether CD38 plays a protective or detrimental effect in the central nervous system (CNS) is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of CD38/cADPR pathway in sepsis associated brain injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were undergone cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham laparotomies. NAD(+), cADPR and CD38 were measured in the hippocampus of septic rats at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48h after CLP surgery. Rats were divided into the sham, CLP group, CLP+ CD38 expression lentivirus (CLP+ CD38 LV), CLP+ CD38 interference lentivirus (CLP+ CD38 Ri), CLP+ negative control lentivirus (CLP+NC) and the CLP+8-Br-cADPR groups. The Western blots of Bcl-2, Bax and iNOS, TUNEL assays, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assays, transmission electron microscope analysis were performed in the hippocampus of rats. RESULTS: NAD(+), cADPR and CD38 levels increased significantly in the hippocampus of septic rats as early as 12-24h after CLP surgery. CD38 knockdown or blocking cADPR with 8-Br-cADPR significantly reduced apoptosis, MDA and SOD activity, iNOS expression and ultrastructural morphology damages in the hippocampus of septic rats. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that the CD38/cADPR pathway was activated in sepsis associated brain injury. Blocking this pathway protected the hippocampus from apoptosis, oxidative stress and ultrastructural morphology damages in septic rats.",
