     "AB": "These experiments show that blockade of a late inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in rat hippocampus by injection of GTP gamma s into a single monitored neuron, or by injection of pertussis toxin into the hippocampus, exposed a synaptic potential that was depolarizing relative to the early, GABAA mediated IPSP. The reversal potential of this late depolarizing potential (LDP) was 10-12 mV positive to that of the early IPSP. The response was augmented by 40-60 microM pentobarbital, and the augmented response appeared to be sensitive to picrotoxin, an antagonist of GABAA action. The LDP is comparable to a depolarizing GABAA synaptic response that had been previously observed only when synaptic behavior of slices was grossly altered by exposure to pentobarbital or 4-aminopyridine.",
