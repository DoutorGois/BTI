     "AB": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors have been characterized in mouse pituitary and brain. Previous studies have demonstrated that IL-1 receptor density is high in the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus and that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection caused an 80% decrease in the number of hippocampal IL-1 receptors, while pituitary receptors in the anterior pituitary were unaffected. In order to investigate on the role of glucocorticoids (GC) in the control of IL-1 receptor expression in the brain and pituitary, the effect of stress, exogenous GC administration or adrenalectomy (ADX) on IL-1 receptor density was determined. Assays were achieved under basal and LPS-stimulated conditions by in situ quantitative autoradiography technique using human recombinant 125I-IL-1 alpha as a tracer. An increase of GC concentration in serum, following immobilization stress or dexamethasone (DEX) treatment (short and long term), did not modify, in the hippocampus, the density of IL-1 receptors under basal conditions or after peripheral LPS injection. On the contrary, ADX significantly decreased IL-1 receptor density in LPS-treated animals. In the anterior pituitary, a significant increase in the density of basal IL-1 receptors was observed 6 h following immobilization stress or after 7 days of DEX treatment while short-term DEX treatments are ineffective. In contrast to what was observed in the hippocampus, no changes in pituitary receptor densities were observed in ADX mice. These results indicate that hippocampal and pituitary IL-1 receptor expressions are differentially regulated by GC. Therefore, this report constitutes the first demonstration of an in vivo regulation of IL-2 receptors in the pituitary.",
