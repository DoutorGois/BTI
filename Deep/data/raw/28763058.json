     "AB": "Chemotherapy-induced central nervous system (CNS) neurotoxicity presents an unmet medical need. Patients often report a cognitive decline in temporal correlation to chemotherapy, particularly for hippocampus-dependent verbal and visuo-spatial abilities. We treated adult C57Bl/6 mice with 12 x 20 mg kg(-1) paclitaxel (PTX), mimicking clinical conditions of dose-dense chemotherapy, followed by a pulse of bromodesoxyuridine (BrdU) to label dividing cells. In this model, mice developed visuo-spatial memory impairments, and we measured peak PTX concentrations in the hippocampus of 230 nm l(-1), which was sevenfold higher compared with the neocortex. Histologic analysis revealed a reduced hippocampal cell proliferation. In vitro, we observed severe toxicity in slowly proliferating neural stem cells (NSC) as well as human neuronal progenitor cells after 2 h exposure to low nanomolar concentrations of PTX. In comparison, mature post-mitotic hippocampal neurons and cell lines of malignant cells were less vulnerable. In PTX-treated NSC, we observed an increase of intracellular calcium levels, as well as an increased activity of calpain- and caspase 3/7, suggesting a calcium-dependent mechanism. This cell death pathway could be specifically inhibited with lithium, but not glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitors, which protected NSC in vitro. In vivo, preemptive treatment of mice with lithium prevented PTX-induced memory deficits and abnormal adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In summary, we identified a molecular pathomechanism, which invokes PTX-induced cytotoxicity in NSC independent of cell cycle status. This pathway could be pharmacologically inhibited with lithium without impairing paclitaxel's tubulin-dependent cytostatic mode of action, enabling a potential translational clinical approach.",
