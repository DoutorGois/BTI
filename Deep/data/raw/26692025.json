     "AB": "The glutamatergic projection from the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus (vSUB) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell has been reported to play a key role in drug-related behavior. The GluN2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the NAc can be selectively elevated after the retrieval of drug-conditioned memory. However, whether the increased GluN2B-containing NMDARs (GluN2B-NMDARs) are able to alter the synaptic plasticity of the vSUB-NAc glutamatergic pathway remains unclear. Here, we found that the long-term potentiation (LTP) in the vSUB-NAc pathway was facilitated and the GluN2B subunit protein level was elevated in synaptoneurosomes of the NAc shell, but not in the core, following morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) expression in rats. The facilitated LTP was prevented by the GluN2B-NMDAR antagonist RO25-6981. Also, a neurochemical disconnection following microinjection of RO25-6981 into the NAc shell, plus microinfusion of GABA agonist baclofen and muscimol into the contralateral vSUB prevented the expression of morphine-induced CPP. These findings suggest that the retrieval of drug-associated memory potentiated synaptic plasticity in the vSUB-NAc pathway, which was dependent on GluN2B-NMDAR activation in the NAc shell. These findings provide a new explanation for the mechanisms that underlie the morphine-associated-context memory. The GluN2B-NMDARs may be regarded as a potential target for erasing morphine-related memory.",
