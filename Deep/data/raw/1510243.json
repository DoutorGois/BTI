     "AB": "A statistical method is described to show the distribution of neuroanatomical structures within a Cartesian coordinate system from any given number of examinations. The algorithm is based on polygons derived from the outlines of neuroanatomical structures in parallel canthomeatal-orientated cutting planes. These polygons are transformed in virtual voxels, rotated into the bicommissural coordinate system, and projected onto the three main planes of this coordinate system. Areas with the same probability for the structures examined are given in these planes. As an example this method is applied to the hippocampal formation and the results attained are shown.",
