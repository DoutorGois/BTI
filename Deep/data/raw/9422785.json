     "AB": "1-Methylthiodihydroceramide (10 microM) decreased de novo ceramide biosynthesis by about 90% in primary cultured cerebellar neurons. Accordingly, de novo formation of sphingomyelin and of glycosphingolipids, all of which contain ceramide in their backbone, was reduced in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by up to 80%. Complex sphingolipid synthesis was restored upon addition of dihydroceramide or ceramide, in micromolar concentrations, to the culture medium, suggesting that none of the glycosyltransferases involved in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis is inhibited by this analog. Assays of the enzymes catalyzing sphinganine biosynthesis, as well as its N-acylation to form dihydroceramide, revealed that they were also not affected. In contrast, there was a 2.5-fold increase in the activity of sphinganine kinase. Reduction of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis by 1-methylthiodihydroceramide is therefore due to its ability to deplete cells of newly formed free sphinganine. As a consequence of depletion of sphinganine levels, 1-methylthiodihydroceramide disrupted axonal growth in cultured hippocampal neurons in a manner similar to that reported for direct inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis; thus, there was essentially no axon growth after incubation with 1-methylthiodihydroceramide between days 2 and 3, and co-incubation with short acyl chain analogs of ceramide (5 microM) antagonized the inhibition of growth. Interestingly, the D-erythro and the L-threo isomere were equally effective, but the corresponding free base as well as other structurally related compounds did not affect either sphingolipid biosynthesis or neuronal growth.",
