     "AB": "Wistar rat pups (female) were exposed to methylparathion (MPTH) by gastric intubation in single doses, or in a chronic regimen of different durations. A single dose of 1 mg MPTH/kg body weight in 15-day-old pups caused a significant decrease of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in cerebellum (CE), motor cortex (MC) and brain stem (BS). The effect began to appear in about 20 min after administration, the peak effect was attained in 120 min and later on this waned off completely by 24 h. The effect was similar in young (15 days) and in adult (70 days) rats. A single dose of 0.2 mg MPTH/kg in 15 day old pups caused a reduction of AChE activity only in the BS, while a 0.1 mg MPTH/kg single dose given to 15-day-old pups caused no effect even in seven regions of the brain examined. Effect of low dose chronic administration of MPTH on AChE activity was also studied in CE, MC, BS, hippocampus (HI), striatum-accumbens (SA), spinal cord (SC) and also in the hypothalamus (HY). Administration of 0.1 mg MPTH/kg from second day to 15 days of age caused significant reduction of AChE activity in only 2 of the 7 brain regions studied. Administration of double the dose (0.2 mg MPTH/kg) and for a longer duration (2nd day to 150 days of age), caused a depression in all the brain regions studied. In all these regions, the levels of NA, DA and 5HT did practically not change. The results suggest that chronic consumption of MPTH leads to a moderate decrease of AChE activity in several brain regions.",
