     "AB": "Intra-hippocampal kainate injection induces the emergence of recurrent seizures after a delay of 3-4 weeks. We examined the cellular and synaptic basis of this activity in vitro using extracellular and intracellular records from longitudinal hippocampal slices. These slices permitted recordings from the dentate gyrus, the CA3 and CA1 regions and the subiculum of both the injected and the contralateral non-injected hippocampus. A sclerotic zone was evident in dorsal regions of slices from the injected hippocampus, while ventral regions and tissue from the contralateral hippocampus were not sclerotic. Interictal field potentials of duration 50-200 ms were generated spontaneously in both ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampal slices, but not in the sclerotic region, at 3-12 months after injection. They were initiated in the CA1 and CA3 regions and the subiculum. They were blocked by antagonists at glutamatergic receptors and were transformed into prolonged epileptiform events by GABAergic receptor antagonists. The membrane potential and the reversal potential of GABAergic synaptic events were more depolarized in CA1 pyramidal cells from kainate-treated animals than in control animals. Ictal-like events of duration 8-80 s were induced by tetanic stimulation (50 Hz, 0.2-1 s) preferentially in dorsal contralateral and ventral ipsilateral slices. Similar events were initiated by focal application of a combination of high K(+) and GABA. These data show that both interictal and ictal-like activities can be induced in slices of both ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus from kainate-treated animals and suggest that changes in cellular excitability and inhibitory synaptic signalling may contribute to their generation.",
