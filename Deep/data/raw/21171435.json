     "AB": "AIM AND METHODS: The death types of rat hippocampal neuronal cells in primary culture under various doses of corticosterone were questioned by in situ staining methods. RESULTS: CORT triggered two cellular death pathways: necrosis and apoptosis. Moreover, high concentrations of CORT increased the necrotic and apoptotic percentages in dose-dependent and time-dependent manners. CONCLUSION: The factors that lead to hippocampal neuronal cells necrosis or apoptosis induced by CORT may be contributed by the impaired of energy metabolism and the vulnerability of neurons to the excess glutamate neurotoxicity.",
