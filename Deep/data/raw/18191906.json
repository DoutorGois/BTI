     "AB": "The beacon gene is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism, food intake, and obesity. We localized its gene product, beacon-/ubiquitin 5-like immunoreactivity in brains of normal-weight, non-psychotic individuals, adipose (BMI over 32), non-psychotic individuals, and haloperidol-treated schizophrenics. The protein was found to be highly expressed in many neurons of the paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei. Besides, it was detected in neurons of other hypothalamic areas (suprachiasmatic, arcuate, and ventromedial nuclei) as well as outside the hypothalamus (Nuc. basalis Meynert, thalamus, hippocampus, and some neocortical areas). A morphometric analysis of beacon-immunoreactive hypothalamic and neocortical neurons revealed that compared to normal-weight controls in haloperidol-treated schizophrenics, there was a significant increase of protein-expressing supraoptic, paraventricular, and orbitofrontal neurons. However, a significant increase in beacon-expressing supraoptic neurons was also seen in adipose, non-psychotic individuals in comparison with normal-weight controls. Haloperidol at different doses has no effect on beacon expression in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which makes the assumption unlikely that haloperidol per se is responsible for the increased neuronal expression of the peptide in schizophrenics. In rats with a neonatal lesion of the ventral hippocampus (a widely used animal model of schizophrenia), we found an increased neuronal expression of beacon in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. We suppose that elevated hypothalamic expression of beacon-like protein in non-obese schizophrenics is not primarily related to metabolic alterations, but to a certain role in schizophrenia, which is possibly unrelated to aspects of weight gain and obesity. The latter assumption finds some support by data obtained in rats with ventral hippocampus lesion.",
