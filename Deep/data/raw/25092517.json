     "AB": "4-para-Nonylphenol (NP) is a non-ionic surfactant that has widespread and uncontrolled distribution in the environment. Little is known, however, about its actions on neuronal cells during critical developmental periods. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the apoptotic and toxic actions of NP on mouse embryonic neuronal cells and the possible interactions of NP with estrogen receptor (ER)- and retinoid X receptor (RXR)-mediated intracellular signaling. Treatment of mouse hippocampal neuronal cell cultures with NP (5 and 10muM) induced apoptotic and neurotoxic effects. The 2 and 7 day-old mouse hippocampal cultures were vulnerable to 5 and 10muM NP, whereas 12 day-old cultures responded only to the highest concentration of NP, thus suggesting an age-dependent action of the chemical on neuronal cells. The use of specific inhibitors did not support the involvement of calpains in NP-induced apoptosis, but indicated caspase-8- and caspase-9-dependent effects of NP. Specific ER antagonists MPP and PHTPP potentiated the NP-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release whereas, ER agonists PPT and DPN inhibited these effects. RXR antagonist HX531 diminished the NP-evoked loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the activity of caspase-3 and LDH release. In addition, exposure to NP inhibited ERalpha- and ERbeta-specific immunofluorescence but stimulated RXR-specific immunolabeling in mouse hippocampal cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the apoptotic and toxic actions of NP on neuronal cells in early development is accompanied by an impairment of ER- and stimulation of RXR-mediated signaling pathways. Taking into account NP-induced alterations in mRNA expression levels of particular types of RXRs, we suggest that NP affected mainly RXRalpha and RXRbeta, but not RXRgamma signaling.",
