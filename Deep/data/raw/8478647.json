We now report that in kainic acid treated rats, reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus are A2B5 immunopositive and express GAP-43 immunoreactivity. A2B5 is a cell surface ganglioside selectively expressed in the glial O-2A lineage (oligodendrocytes and type-2 astrocytes in vitro). Since A2B5-positive cells were also GFAP immunoreactive, our observation suggest that hippocampal-reactive astrocytes in the epileptic process are type-2 astrocytes. GAP-43 is a membrane-associated phosphoprotein involved in neurite outgrowth. In vitro analysis showed that the glial O-2A lineage may express this phosphoprotein. In this study, we found that GAP-43 was coexpressed in astrocytes with A2B5 suggesting that in vivo as in vitro type-2 astrocytes express GAP-43.",
