     "AB": "Ammon's horn sclerosis (AHS) is a common finding in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In addition to selective neuronal cell loss and axonal reorganization, AHS is also characterized by a striking astroglial reaction. However, the functional significance of reactive astrogliosis in the pathogenesis of TLE remains to be determined. Reactive astrocytes produce a variety of cell adhesion molecules and other extracellular matrix (ECM) components with potential effects on axonal growth, axonal branching, and neosynaptogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS). In the present study we describe the distribution of the ECM glycoprotein tenascin/cytotactin (TN-C) in 44 human hippocampal specimens from patients with TLE. The distribution of TN-C immunoreactivity was evaluated with the anti-human TN-C monoclonal antibody K8 by densitometrical analysis, and TN-C protein levels were detected by immunoblotting. In the normal human hippocampus, there were distinctive boundaries between areas of high and low TN-C expression. These border zones demarcated areas with major synaptic input, i.e., the dentate gyrus molecular layer (DG-ML) and the gray matter of the Ammon's horn. TN-C and the neurite growth-associated protein GAP-43 exhibited a complementary pattern of distribution. Densitometric and protein biochemical analysis showed a significant, 4.3-fold increase of TN-C in the hippocampus of TLE patients with AHS compared with normal hippocampus obtained at autopsy. This increase in TN-C immunoreactivity was accompanied by a loss of TN-C boundaries and closely correlated with the extent of reactive gliosis, as indicated by immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Furthermore, a striking colocalization between TN-C and GAP-43 was observed in the DG-ML of patients with AHS. These observations raise the intriguing possibility of pathogenetically relevant glio-neuronal interactions in human TLE.",
