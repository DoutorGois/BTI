     "AB": "Multi-electrode arrays (MEA) are increasingly used to investigate spontaneous neuronal network activity. The recorded signals comprise several distinct components: Apart from artifacts without biological significance, one can distinguish between spikes (action potentials) and subthreshold fluctuations (local fields potentials). Here we aim to develop a theoretical model that allows for a compact and robust characterization of subthreshold fluctuations in terms of a Gaussian statistical field theory in two spatial and one temporal dimension. What is usually referred to as the driving noise in the context of statistical physics is here interpreted as a representation of the neural activity. Spatial and temporal correlations of this activity give valuable information about the connectivity in the neural tissue. We apply our methods on a dataset obtained from MEA-measurements in an acute hippocampal brain slice from a rat. Our main finding is that the empirical correlation functions indeed obey the logarithmic behavior that is a general feature of theoretical models of this kind. We also find a clear correlation between the activity and the occurrence of spikes. Another important insight is the importance of correctly separating out certain artifacts from the data before proceeding with the analysis.",
