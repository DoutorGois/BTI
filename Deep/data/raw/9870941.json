     "AB": "The inhibition of hippocampal pyramidal cells occurs via inhibitory interneurons making GABAergic synapses on distinct segments of the postsynaptic membrane. In area CA1 of the hippocampus, the activation of mu- and delta-opioid receptors inhibits these interneurons, thereby increasing the excitability of the pyramidal cells. Through the use of selective opioid agonists and biocytin-filled whole-cell electrodes, interneurons possessing somata located within stratum oriens of hippocampal slices were classified according to the location of their primary axon termination and the expression of mu- or delta-opioid receptors. Activation of these opioid receptor subtypes resulted in outward currents in the majority of interneurons, which is consistent with their inhibition. Post hoc morphological analysis revealed that those interneurons heavily innervating the pyramidal cell body layer were much more likely to express mu-opioid receptors, whereas cells with axons ramifying in the pyramidal neuron dendritic layers were more likely to express delta-opioid receptors, as defined by the generation of outward currents. This morphological segregation of interneuron projections suggests that mu receptor activation would diminish GABA release onto pyramidal neuron somata, thereby increasing their excitability and output. Conversely, inhibition of interneurons via delta receptor activation would amplify afferent signaling to pyramidal neuron dendrites by reducing GABAergic inhibition of these structures.",
