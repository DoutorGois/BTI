     "AB": "Despite advances in our understanding of the basic biology of amyloid precursor protein (APP), the normal physiological function(s) of APP in learning and memory remains unclear. Here we show increased APP degradation in the hippocampus to be associated with the consolidation of a passive avoidance response. Neurone-specific APP695 expression became transiently reduced 2-4 h post-training through association with endosomal adaptin proteins and enhanced internalization. By contrast, internalization of glial-associated APP containing a Kunitz protease inhibitor-like domain (APP-KPI) was dependent on the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). In addition, LRP expression and association with apolipoprotein E increased in the 2-4 h post-training period. The LRP antagonist receptor-associated protein prevented the APP-KPI internalization and LRP-apolipoprotein E association and this resulted in amnesia. Degradation of APP695 and APP-KPI did not appear to be related to alpha-secretase activity, as no learning-associated increase of secreted APP was observed in the CSF. Moreover, as internalization of APP isoforms was observed only in dentate gyrus, it probably relates to the learning-associated restructuring of the perforant path terminals. Memory-associated APP processing in both neuronal and glial compartments points to a role for glial unsheathing of synaptic connections, an event required for the synaptic restructuring that accompanies memory consolidation. These observations may have a direct relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease as beta/gamma-secretase-derived beta-amyloid is formed following internalization of cell surface APP into the endosomal compartment.",
