     "AB": "The adenylate cyclase system has been studied from the standpoint of its significance in cholinergic modulation of the synaptic transmission in the CA1 field of the rat hippocampal slices. Microionphoretic application of ACh as well as addition of either carbachol or tolbutamide (an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase) blocked the transmission in synapses formed by the Schaffer collaterals and commissural fibres with dendrites of carbacholine both the number of releasing quanta of the neurotransmitter and the probability of their release decreased. Atropine eliminated the inhibitory effect of carbacholine on synaptic transmission. Dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin increased the amplitude of synaptic potentials and completely or partially prevented the inhibitory effect of cholinomimetics on synaptic potentials. The results obtained revealed opposite effects of cholinomimetics and activators of the adenylate cyclase system on neurotransmission in synapses formed by the Schaffer collaterals/commissural fibres and dendrites of pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal CA1 field.",
