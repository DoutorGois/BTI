     "AB": "N-terminal-truncated forms of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide have been recently suggested to play a pivotal role early in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among them, A beta 3(pE)-42 peptide, starting with pyroglutamyl at residue Glu-3, is considered as the predominant A beta species in AD plaques and pre-amyloid lesions. Its abundance is reported to be directly proportional to the severity of the clinical phenotype. The present study investigates the effects of soluble oligomeric A beta 3(pE)-42 after intracerebroventricular injection on mice learning ability and the molecular mechanisms of its in vitro neurotoxicity. Mice injected with soluble A beta 3(pE)-42 or A beta(l-42) displayed impaired spatial working memory and delayed memory acquisition in Y-maze and Morris water maze tests, while those injected with soluble A beta(42-1) showed no effect. These cognitive alterations were associated with free radical overproduction in the hippocampus and olfactory bulbs, but not in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum. In vitro, A beta 3(pE)-42 oligomers induced a redox-sensitive neuronal apoptosis involving caspase activation and an arachidonic acid-dependent pro-inflammatory pathway. These data suggest that A beta 3(pE)-42 could mediate the neurodegenerative process and subsequent cognitive alteration occurring in preclinical AD stages.",
