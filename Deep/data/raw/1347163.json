     "AB": "In the present study, the effect of the adenosine uptake blocker, propentofylline (HWA 285) on the extracellular concentration of several amino acids including glutamate, glycine and taurine following 10 min of forebrain ischemia in gerbil hippocampus was investigated using in vivo microdialysis. Pretreatment with HWA 285 (20 mg/kg i.p.) significantly reduced the extracellular concentration of glutamate following ischemia but did not significantly alter levels of other amino acids such as glycine and taurine. These findings suggest that the neuroprotective effect of HWA 285 may be associated with inhibition of glutamate release in the gerbil hippocampus.",
