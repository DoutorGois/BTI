     "AB": "There is a wide body of literature to suggest that sexual experience may influence androgen secretion in various species, in turn, androgens may also influence anxiety. We hypothesized that sexual experience may alter anxiety behavior and secretion of endogenous androgens. Experiment 1: anxiety behavior of rats with a history of sexual experience was compared to that of sexually-inexperienced, naive male rats. Sexually-experienced rats showed less anxiety-like behavior in the open field and elevated plus maze, and exhibited increased plasma and hippocampal testosterone (T) levels. Experiment 2: the effects of recent sexual experience on anxiety behavior of sexually-experienced male rats, sexually-responsive but inexperienced male rats, and sexually-unresponsive, inexperienced male rats exposed to a receptive female immediately prior to testing was examined. Recent sexual experience significantly decreased anxiety-like behavior in the open field, elevated plus maze, and the elevated zero maze tasks, and tended to decrease anxiety-like behavior in the light-dark task. Rats with recent sexual experience exhibited increased plasma and hippocampal T levels. Experiment 3: to examine the effect of recent sexual experience, anxiety behavior of rats with a history of sexual experience that received sexual experience with a stimulus female immediately prior to testing was compared to that of rats with a history of sexual experience that did not receive sexual experience immediately prior to behavioral testing. Experienced rats that were exposed to a female prior to testing showed decreased anxiety-like behavior in the open field, elevated plus maze, and light-dark transition tasks, and showed increased plasma and hypothalamic, T and 3alpha-diol, and increased hippocampal T. Thus, sexual experience is associated with lower levels of anxiety-like behavior and higher levels of androgen secretion.",
