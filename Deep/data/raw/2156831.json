     "AB": "G protein-coupled receptors comprise a family of genes that share significant sequence similarity. We have screened a rat genomic library under low stringency hybridization conditions with the coding portion of the hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor gene to isolate new members of this gene family. We show that one of these clones, clone D, codes for a 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) binding site since: 1) it possesses an intronless open reading frame encoding a protein with seven putative transmembrane domains and 89% amino acid identity with the human 5-HT1A receptor (G21); 2) when transfected into Ltk- cells, it expresses a ligand-binding site with the pharmacology of the 5-HT1A receptor subtype, including 5-HT- and spiroxatrine-displaceable binding of 8-hydroxy-(2-(N,N-di[2,3-3H]propylamino)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (KH = 0.8 nM). We further show that clone D encodes a functional receptor because its binding site interacts with G proteins and because it mediates agonist-induced inhibition of basal and stimulated cAMP accumulation in transfected GH4C1 pituitary cells. Finally, we have analyzed the tissue distribution of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA in rat brain and have found that 5-HT1A mRNA is present with the expected distribution of the 5-HT1A receptor (highest in septum and hippocampus) but is present as three RNA species (3.9, 3.6, and 3.3 kilobases). These studies represent the first characterization of receptor function and brain distribution of the cloned rat 5-HT1A receptor.",
