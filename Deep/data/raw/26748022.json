     "AB": "Here we consider the value of neural population analysis as an approach to understanding how information is represented in the hippocampus and cortical areas and how these areas might interact as a brain system to support memory. We argue that models based on sparse coding of different individual features by single neurons in these areas (e.g., place cells, grid cells) are inadequate to capture the complexity of experience represented within this system. By contrast, population analyses of neurons with denser coding and mixed selectivity reveal new and important insights into the organization of memories. Furthermore, comparisons of the organization of information in interconnected areas suggest a model of hippocampal-cortical interactions that mediates the fundamental features of memory.",
