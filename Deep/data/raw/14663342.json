     "AB": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a surrogate marker of acute brain pathology, yet few studies have resolved the evolution of water diffusion changes during the first 8 hours after acute injury, a critical period for therapeutic intervention. To characterize this early period, this study used a 17.6-T wide-bore magnet to measure multicomponent water diffusion at high b-values (7 to 8,080 s/mm(2)) for rat hippocampal slices at baseline and serially for 8 hours after treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187. The mean fast diffusing water fraction (Ffast) progressively decreased for slices treated with 10-microM/L A23187 (-20.9 +/- 6.3% at 8 hours). Slices treated with 50-micromol/L A23187 had significantly reduced Ffast 80 minutes earlier than slices treated with 10-microM/L A23187 (P < 0.05), but otherwise, the two doses had equivalent effects on the diffusion properties of tissue water. Correlative histologic analysis showed dose-related selective vulnerability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons (CA1 > CA3) to pathologic swelling induced by A23187, confirming that particular intravoxel cell populations may contribute disproportionately to water diffusion changes observed by MRI after acute brain injury. These data suggest diffusion-weighted images at high b-values and the diffusion parameter Ffast may be highly sensitive correlates of cell swelling in nervous issue after acute injury.",
