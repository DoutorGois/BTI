     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the potential protective effect of melatonin on the oxidative damage induced by deltamethrin in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of rats. METHODS: 35 male wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups(seven rats per group): olive oil control, deltamethrin-treated (12.5 mg/kg), melatonin(25.0 mg/kg) and deltamethrin plus melatonin (25.0 mg/kg , 2.5 mg/kg respectively) group. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione (GSH) in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum were determined after 5 days of DM treatments. RESULTS: MDA content in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum tissue of the DM-treated rats were significantly higher than those in control group, and compared with DM-treated group, MDA content in those tissue of MT + DM-treated group have significantly decreased after 5 days of DM exposure (P < 0.05). Activities of GSH-Px in DM-treated group were significantly lower than those in control group, and those in the MT + DM group were significantly higher than DM group(P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: DM can induce the oxidative damage in rat brain and melatonin has protective effects on deltamethrin-induced oxidative damage in hippocampus, cerebral cortex and cerebellum of rats.",
