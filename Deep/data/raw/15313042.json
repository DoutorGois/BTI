     "AB": "C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice with cannulae inserted bilaterally in the dorsal hippocampus or the dorsolateral striatum were released from the south arm of a cross maze and trained to find food in the east arm. Probe trials on which mice were released from the north arm were given following short or prolonged training. Prior to the probe trials, mice received intra-hippocampal or intra-striatal injections of lidocaine or saline. Results show that saline-injected C57BL/6 were fundamentally place learners whereas saline-injected DBA/2 mice did not engage any predominant system. Inactivating the hippocampus or the dorsolateral striatum in C56BL/6 mice disrupted place learning without promoting response learning. Inactivating the same brain sites in DBA/2 mice did not affect their behaviour. Thus, contrary to that observed in rats, disrupting the neural substrate of one memory system can abolish learning in that system but does not promote the use of another system in these genotypes.",
