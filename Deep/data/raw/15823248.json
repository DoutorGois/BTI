     "AB": "The protein malnutrition is a worldwide problem, affecting mainly newborns and children of developing countries. This deficiency reaches the brain in the most critical period of the development. Various consequences are related to this insult, such as memory disturbance, learning, and behavioral impairment. Protein content of the diet plays an important role on antioxidant mechanisms. This study observed the effects of protein malnutrition on rat hippocampus redox state. Wistar rats were separate in four groups, receiving different diets: first group with 25% casein, protein deficient group with 8% casein, and the same two groups supplemented with methionine (0.15%). Diets were isocaloric and were administered since the prenatal period up to the sacrifice. Rats were decapitated at 21 or 75 days old and hippocampus were isolated for measuring the lipoperoxidation by TBARS method, protein oxidative damage by carbonyl (DNPH) levels, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). There was significant alterations in the activities of the enzyme SOD, lipoperoxidation, and protein oxidation in hippocampus of 21 and 75 day-old rats fed with 25% of protein with methionine and the groups fed with low levels of protein (8%) both supplemented or not with methionine. Our data suggest that both the content of protein in the diet and the essential amino acid methionine may alter the antioxidant system and the redox state of the brain.",
