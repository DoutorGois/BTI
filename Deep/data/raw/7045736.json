Characterization of the antisera and preliminary mapping of histaminergic neurons were conducted on brain tissue from normal and experimentally manipulated rats. Using immunofluorescence, histamine-like immunoreactive cell bodies were revealed in the lateral hypothalamus, and fibers were stained in the hypothalamus, cortex, amygdala and hippocampus.",
