     "AB": "Catecholamine, histamine, and adenosine-mediated accumulations of radioactive cyclic AMP were assessed in adenine-labeled slices from eight rat brain regions. 2-Fluoronorepinephrine, a selective beta-adrenergic agonist, elicited an an accumulation of cyclic AMP in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, superior colliculi, thalamus, hypothalamus, and medulla-pons. In cerebral cortex and most other brain regions, the beta-adrenergic-mediated response appeared to involve primarily beta 1-adrenergic receptors, while in cerebellum, there was a significant involvement of beta 2-adrenergic receptors. 6-Fluoronorepinephrine, a selective alpha-adrenergic agonist, elicited accumulations of cyclic AMP in all regions except cerebellum. Combinations of the two fluoro derivatives afforded in all brain regions an accumulation of cyclic AMP identical with that elicited by norepinephrine. In hypothalamus, the alpha- and beta-adrenergic responses were significantly greater than additive. In cerebral cortex, the alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated response appeared to involve alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and to be nearly completely dependent on adenosine, while in other brain regions, the dependence of the alpha-adrenergic response on adenosine was less or absent. Combinations of 6-fluoronorepinephrine and histamine had greater than additive effects in cortex and hippocampus. The results indicate that the interactive control of cyclic AMP-generating systems by alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, adenosine, and histamine receptors differs significantly among rat brain regions.",
