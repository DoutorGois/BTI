OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of age on a centrally injected endotoxin-induced cytokine production and cellular activation in mice. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J (B6) mice, C3H/HeN mice, and C3H/HeJ mice received an intracerebroventricular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and were sacrificed at various times (2, 4, 8 h) thereafter. ELISA for IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-alpha were conducted on forebrain tissue homogenates as well as plasma samples, and lectin staining to detect activated microglia was prepared for selected brain slices. RESULTS: Intracerebroventricular injection of LPS in B6 mice produced an age-associated increase in mortality which was paralleled with a significant increase in brain and plasma levels of TNF-alpha. AntiTNF-alpha- and IL-6-immunoreactive cells possessed macrophagelike morphologies and were observed along the LPS injection tract and scattered throughout the hilus of the dorsal hippocampus and cerebral cortices. This LPS-mediated response was found to be specific in that the LPS-hyporesponsive mouse strain (C3H/HeJ) failed to demonstrate significant brain or plasma levels of TNF-alpha after LPS administration compared to C3H/HeN mice. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the age-related increases in TNF-alpha production and mortality following the intracerebroventricular administration of LPS may be due to an increased endotoxin hypersensitivity of brain microglia/macrophages within aged animals.",
