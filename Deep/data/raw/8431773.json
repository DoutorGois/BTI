     "AB": "Cytochrome P-450 mediated metabolism is potentially involved in the expression of the pharmacological and/or toxicological effects of a wide variety of drugs and environmental chemicals upon tissues which contain this metabolic system. In the present investigation, the presence of cytochrome P-450IIE1 and associated mono-oxygenase activities in brain and the effect of chronic ethanol treatment on brain cytochrome P-450 (P-450) were studied. Aniline hydroxylase, N-nitroso-dimethylamine N-demethylase and p-nitrophenol hydroxylase activities (known to be mediated by P-450IIE1) were detectable in brain microsomes from untreated rats and were about 5%, 125% and 8.3%, respectively, of the corresponding hepatic levels. Chronic ethanol treatment resulted in induction of the above enzyme activities in brain microsomes by 243%, 496% and 155%, respectively. Intake of ethanol for a prolonged period also resulted in the induction of total P-450 in the brain (150% of the control). Addition of the antisera raised against rat liver cytochrome P-450IIE1 markedly inhibited brain microsomal p-nitrophenol hydroxylase activity. Immunoblot analysis of rat brain microsomes using the above antisera also revealed the induction of brain cytochrome P-450IIE1 following chronic ethanol administration. Immunocytochemical localization of cytochrome P-450IIE1 using the above antisera, revealed the preferential localization of the enzyme in the neuronal cell bodies in the cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, hypothalamic nuclei and reticular nuclei in the brainstem of rats treated chronically with ethanol. Based upon these studies, it is conceivable that chronic alcohol ingestion could enhance the sensitivity of certain regions of the brain to environmental chemicals that are metabolized to more toxic derivatives by the P-450 system.",
