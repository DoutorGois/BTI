     "AB": "Plasticity of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission was studied in the CA1 region of the hippocampus utilising whole cell patch-clamp recording techniques. LTP was associated with a decrease in CV whereas LTD was accompanied by an increase in CV and a decrease in Pr. These data are consistent with LTP and LTD being an opposite expression of the same fundamental process.",
