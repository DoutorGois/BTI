     "AB": "This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of (2R,3S)-pinobanksin-3-cinnamate (PNC) in rats with occlusion-damaged bilateral common carotid arteries. Administration with PNC (5 and 10 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks significantly improved the behavioral performance of rats with vascular dementia, as showed in the Morris water maze test by shortening the escape latency and latency of crossing, completing more platform crossings, as well as spending more time in the target zone. Further evaluations found that PNC could markedly decrease malondialdehyde levels, enhance superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione levels, and decrease the release of cytochrome c as well as the activities of caspases. Moreover, PNC increased Nrf2 and anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein expression, while Nox1 and pro-apopotic bax protein expression was decreased. PNC may exert its neuroprotective effects through counteracting oxidative stress and has the potential to treat vascular dementia.",
