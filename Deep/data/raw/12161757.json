     "AB": "To investigate the role of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3 kinase) in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, we used whole-cell patch clamp recordings from rat CA1 neurons to determine the effects of PI3 kinase inhibitors on long-term depression (LTD). PI3 kinase blockade caused a loss of synapse specificity of LTD that was dependent on the co-activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and involved release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. These findings suggest that the synapse specificity of hippocampal LTD may not be an intrinsic property of this form of homosynaptic plasticity, but rather that it can be regulated by PI3 kinase.",
