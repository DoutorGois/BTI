     "AB": "The probability of hippocampal long-term potentiation induction in the mossy fiber CA3 and commissural/associational CA3 responses and the cortical levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity were compared in right nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM)-lesioned rats. A 50% reduction in the right cortical ChAT activity was demonstrated 4 weeks after an ibotenic acid lesion of the NBM. No significative differences were found in the probability of LTP induction of right hippocampal slices in sham-operated rats from 10 to 40 days after the injection into the right NBM. On the contrary, a progressive and significative increase in the probability of LTP induction was shown in right hippocampal slices of NBM-lesioned rats from 10 to 40 days after the injection of ibotenic acid into the right NBM. The results demonstrated the appearance of a paradoxical increase of hippocampal synaptic plasticity when the cortical cholinergic biochemical alterations are still present. This finding might be responsible for a behavioural recovery, in NBM-lesioned rats.",
