     "AB": "Secreted and transmembrane proteins provide critical functions in the signaling networks essential for neurogenesis. We used a genetic signal sequence gene trap approach to isolate 189 genes expressed during development in e16.5 whole head, e16.5 hippocampus and e14.5 cerebellum. Gene ontology programs were used to classify the genes into respective biological processes. Four major classes of biological processes known to be important during development were identified: cell communication, cell physiology processes, metabolism and morphogenesis. We used in situ hybridization to determine the temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression in the developing brain using this set of probes. The results demonstrate that gene expression patterns can highlight potential gene functions in specific brain regions. We propose that combining bioinformatics with the gene expression pattern is an effective strategy to identify genes that may play critical roles during brain development.",
