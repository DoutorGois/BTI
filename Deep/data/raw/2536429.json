     "AB": "We studied the influence of opioid agonists on the release of serotonin (5-HT) elicited by K+ (20 mM) in superfused slices of rat hippocampus. K+-evoked outflow of serotonin was inhibited significantly up to 50% in the presence of the mu-selective agonist [D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAGO) and of the delta-selective agonist [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE). U50,488H a selective kappa agonist, at concentrations between 0.1 to 1 microM, produced an inhibition of 5-HT-release lower than that observed in the presence of mu and delta agonists. The delta antagonist ICI 174,864 (N,N-diallyl-Tyr1,Aib2,Aib3)Leu-enkephalin potently inhibited the effect of DPDPE but did not affect the inhibition produced by DAGO. In contrast, the mu-selective antagonist D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Nle-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 at 1 microM significantly reversed the inhibitory effect produced by a maximal dose of DAGO (0.1 microM) but not the corresponding effect produced by a maximal dose of DPDPE (1 microM). Naloxone was a competitive antagonist of DAGO but noncompetitive antagonist of DPDPE. Treatment of hippocampal slices with pertussis toxin did not alter the K+-evoked release of 5-HT but abolished the inhibitory effect of both DAGO and DPDPE.",
