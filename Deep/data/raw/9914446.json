     "AB": "Pretreatment of rats with the extract of Ginkgo biloba termed EGb761 reduced the behavioral sensitization induced by successive D-amphetamine administrations (0.5 mg/kg) as estimated by increasing values of locomotor activity. EGb761 pretreatment also prevented the reduced density of [3H]dexamethasone binding sites in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 hippocampal regions of D-amphetamine treated animals. These observations suggest that EGb761, by reducing glucocorticoid levels, could modulate the activity of the neuronal systems involved in the expression of the behavioral sensitization.",
