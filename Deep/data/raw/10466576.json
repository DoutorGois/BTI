     "AB": "The present study was undertaken to explore the distribution of lipofuscin in the brain of cheirogaleids by autofluorescence and compare it to other studies of iron distribution. Aged dwarf (Cheirogaleus medius) and mouse (Microcebus murinus) lemurs provide a reliable model for the study of normal and pathological cerebral aging. Accumulation of lipofuscin, an age pigment derived by lipid peroxidation, constitutes the most reliable cytological change correlated with neuronal aging. Brain sections of four aged (8-15 year old) and 3 young (2-3 year old) animals were examined. Lipofuscin accumulation was observed in the aged animals but not in the young ones. Affected regions include the hippocampus (granular and pyramidal cells), where no iron accumulation was observed, the olfactory nucleus and the olfactory bulb (mitral cells), the basal forebrain, the hypothalamus, the cerebellum (Purkinje cells), the neocortex (essentially in the pyramidal cells), and the brainstem. Even though iron is known to catalyse lipid oxidation, our data indicate that iron deposits and lipofuscin accumulation are not coincident. Different biochemical and morphological cellular compartments might be involved in iron and lipofuscin deposition. The nonuniform distribution of lipofuscin indicates that brain structures are not equally sensitive to the factors causing lipofuscin accumulation. The small size, the rapid maturity, and the relatively short life expectancy of the cheirogaleids make them a good model system in which to investigate the mechanisms of lipofuscinogenesis in primates.",
