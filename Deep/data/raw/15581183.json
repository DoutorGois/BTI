     "AB": "Neurodegenerative diseases classified as synucleinopathies are characterized by alpha-synuclein inclusions. In these disorders, alpha-synuclein accumulates within glial or neuronal cells in the brain including regions of adult neurogenesis. We hypothesized a pathophysiological role for alpha-synuclein in newly generated cells of the adult brain and in this study examined regions of neurogenesis in adult mice overexpressing human wild-type alpha-synuclein under the control of the platelet-derived growth factor promoter. The number of proliferating cells and the fate of newly generated cells were analyzed in the olfactory bulb system and in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. There were no effects on proliferation detectable; however, significantly less neurogenesis and fewer neurons were observed in the olfactory bulb as well as in the hippocampus of adult human alpha-synuclein mice compared to control littermates. This effect was almost exclusively due to diminished survival of neuronal precursors in the target regions of neurogenesis. Our data imply that the finely tuned equilibrium of neuronal cell birth and death in neurogenic regions may be altered in human alpha-synuclein-overexpressing mice. We hypothesize that reduced adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb may contribute to olfactory deficits in neurodegenerative disorders associated with alpha-synuclein inclusions.",
