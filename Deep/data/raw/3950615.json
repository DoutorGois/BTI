     "AB": "The tottering mouse (tg/tg) is a single-locus mutant, phenotypically characterized by the development of epilepsy associated with distinct electroencephalographic abnormalities. Because of reported alterations in muscarinic receptor (mAChR) number in various seizure states, mAChR density was examined in discrete brain regions of tottering (tg/tg) and coisogenic wild-type (+/+) mice. Saturation binding experiments revealed a widespread decrease in membrane mAChR density in the CNS of adult tottering (tg/tg) mice as compared with age-matched control wild-type (+/+) mice. The decrease was most pronounced in the hippocampus, where tg/tg mice exhibited a 40-60% reduction in mAChR density with no change in the affinity of the receptor for antagonists or agonists. At postnatal day 10, before the reported onset of electroencephalographic abnormalities, 114 and 65% increases in mAChR density were observed in the tg/tg hippocampus and cortex, respectively. Following the development of seizure activity at postnatal day 22, mAChR density in the tg/tg hippocampus was reduced by 29%. No change in brain mAChR density was seen in adult heterozygotes (+/tg), which do not develop electroencephalographic or seizure abnormalities. These results indicate that the development of reduced mAChR number in the CNS of the tg/tg mouse is secondary to abnormal neuronal activity, providing further support for the hypothesis that membrane depolarization can cause a decrease in neuronal mAChR density.",
