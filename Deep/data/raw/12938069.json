     "AB": "INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Prematurity has often been associated with a general intellectual deficit and with different structural brain disorders which can be revealed by volumetric measurements performed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In turn, perinatal asphyxia, even when it is not accompanied by neurological disorders, is related to a deficit in specific neuropsychological functions. CASE REPORT: This study describes the case of three 13 year old female triplets, with a history of extreme prematurity and perinatal asphyxia, the long term effects of which are evaluated in terms of cognitive performance. We studied their performance in the neuropsychological functions of intelligence, memory, and visual perceptual, visual constructive, visual spatial and frontal functions. In two of the subjects, structural MRI and volumetric analysis of the hippocampuses were performed. In all the subjects, intelligence was found to be above average, the most notable result being the superior score in case 1. Verbal learning and the long term retention of verbal material were altered in case 3, where there was also a smaller hippocampal volume. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of a multiple birth, we have seen that extreme prematurity, accompanied by non severe perinatal asphyxia without hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, can exert very diverse effects on neurocognitive development. It can be normal, and even superior, or show a deficit in some skill. In our case, the functions that were most liable to suffer these antecedents are long term memory and verbal learning. This disorder is accompanied by bilateral involvement of the hippocampus, which can be observed using MRI.",
