     "AB": "Whether fluid cognitive functions are malleable has been a topic of ongoing debate for at least the past 100 years. Ever-evolving technology has led to new and diverse fields of investigation entering this debate. There are significant advantages to be gained by integrating different scientific paradigms, but there are also significant challenges. Cross-paradigm differences in levels of analysis, nomenclature, and expectations of training outcomes complicate interpretation of training results. It is argued that further investigations of (a) cross-paradigm intricacies and (b) strategy versus process training, particularly with spatial abilities, are needed.",
