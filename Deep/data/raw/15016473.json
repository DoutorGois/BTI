     "AB": "The influence of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment on the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Na(+),K(+)-ATPase was determined during different time periods of reperfusion in rats exposed to global cerebral ischemia. Ischemic animals were either sacrificed or exposed to the first HBO treatment 2, 24, 48 or 168 h after ischemic insult (for SOD activities measurement) or immediately, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 24, 48, 72 or 168 h after ischemic procedure (for Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activities measurement). Hyperbaric oxygenation procedure was repeated for seven consecutive days. The results of presented experiments demonstrated the statistically significant increase in the hippocampal SOD activity 24 and 48 h after global cerebral ischemia followed by a decrease in the enzymatic activity 168 h after ischemic insult. In the ischemic rats treated with HBO the level of hippocampal SOD activity was significantly higher after 168 h of reperfusion in comparison to the ischemic, non HBO-treated animals. In addition, it was found that global cerebral ischemia induced a statistically significant decrease of the hippocampal Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity starting from 1 to 168 h of reperfusion. Maximal enzymatic inhibition was obtained 24 h after the ischemic damage. Decline in Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity was prevented in the animals exposed to HBO treatment within the first 24 h of reperfusion. Our results suggest that global cerebral ischemia induces significant alterations in the hippocampal SOD and Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activities during different periods of reperfusion. Enhanced SOD activity and preserved Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity within particular periods of reperfusion, could be indicators of a possible beneficial role of HBO treatment in severe brain ischemia.",
