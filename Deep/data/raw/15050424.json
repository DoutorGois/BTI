     "AB": "The effects of (R)- and (S)-optical isomers of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and of the racemate (R,S)-8-OH-DPAT on serotonin (5-HT) release in the ventral hippocampus of awake rats and on induction of the whole-body hypothermia were studied. Extracellular 5-HT levels were determined by a newly developed high-sensitive HPLC method based on derivatization with benzylamine and fluorescence detection. The basal levels of 5-HT in 20 min microdialysates from rats perfused with Ringer solution or with Ringer solution containing 1 microM citalopram were 6.3 +/- 1.3 fmol/20 microl and 36.1 +/- 4.2 fmol/20 microl (n=20), respectively. The reduction of hippocampal 5-HT levels induced by subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of (R,S)-8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg) was significantly attenuated by the presence of 5-HT reuptake inhibitor citalopram in Ringer solution only at its peak value at 40 min (maximal reduction to 60% compared to 46% of control values in Ringer-perfused rats), whereas the overall effects were comparable at both experimental conditions. Injection of (R)-8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg s.c.) caused further reduction of 5-HT levels, to 49% and 41%, respectively, whereas (S)-8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg s.c.) caused maximal reduction of 5-HT levels only to 74% of controls in both perfusion groups. Similar pattern and time-courses were observed in rats with hypothermia induced by injection of 8-OH-DPAT enantiomers, where (R,S), (R)-forms were about two-times more potent than the (S)-isomer. It is concluded that the acute systemic dose of (R)-, (S)- and (R,S)-8-OH-DPAT enantiomers exerted enantiomer-specific effects on 5-HT(1A) receptor-mediated function both at the presynaptic and postsynaptic sites as revealed by monitoring hippocampal 5-HT levels and body temperature.",
