     "AB": "Previous studies showed that the spatial cognitive deficits of rats were induced by chronic melamine exposure, which was associated with the hippocampal oxidative damage. Currently, we examined the antioxidative effect of vitamins C and E combination on cognitive function in melamine-treated rats. Melamine was oral administrated to male adolescent Wistar at a dosage of 300mg/kg/day for 28days. After that, animals received vitamins C and E at a dose of 150 and 200mg/kg, respectively, intraperitoneally for the next 7days. Cognitive behaviors were investigated using the Morris water maze test. The biochemical indexes were detected in the hippocampal homogenate. The treatment with vitamin complex significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits induced by melamine. ROS, MDA, and NO contents were almost back to normal, while SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, and NOS activities were improved as well. The neural apoptosis in the hippocampus were ameliorated by regulating the expression of anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) and caspase-3. Additionally, histological observation showed that vitamin complex effectively alleviated the injuries of hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that the potential therapeutic for oxidative damage induced neuronal apoptosis after treatment of vitamins C and E combination, which is most likely related to the antioxidative effects.",
