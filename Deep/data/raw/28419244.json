     "AB": "Background: Resolvin D1 and D2 are bioactive lipid mediators that are generated from docosahexaenoic acid. Although recent preclinical studies suggest that these compounds have antidepressant effects, their mechanisms of action remain unclear. Methods: We investigated mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of resolvin D1 and resolvin D2 in lipopolysaccharide (0.8 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced depression model mice using a tail suspension test. Results: I.c.v. infusion of resolvin D1 (10 ng) and resolvin D2 (10 ng) produced antidepressant effects; these effects were significantly blocked by a resolvin D1 receptor antagonist WRW4 (10 microg, i.c.v.) and a resolvin D2 receptor antagonist O-1918 (10 microg, i.c.v.), respectively. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitor rapamycin (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor U0126 (5 microg, i.c.v.) significantly blocked the antidepressant effects of resolvin D1 and resolvin D2. An AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (3 microg, i.c.v.) blocked the antidepressant effects of resolvin D1 significantly, but not of resolvin D2. Bilateral infusions of resolvin D1 (0.3 ng/side) or resolvin D2 (0.3 ng/side) into the medial prefrontal cortex or dentate gyrus of the hippocampus produced antidepressant effects. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that resolvin D1 and resolvin D2 produce antidepressant effects via the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling pathway, and that the medial prefrontal cortex and dentate gyrus are important brain regions for these antidepressant effects. These compounds and their receptors may be promising targets for the development of novel rapid-acting antidepressants, like ketamine and scopolamine.",
