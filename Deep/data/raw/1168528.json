     "AB": "The distribution of apomorphine following subcutaneous injection of 20 mg/kg (as the hydrochloride) was measured spectrofluorometrically in specific regions of rat brain. Measurable concentrations were found in the brain within a few minutes of injection, the drug was still detectable for at least 60 min in all regions, and maximum concentration was observed 20 min after injection. Stereotyped behavior, characteristic of apomorphine action, followed a time course parallel to accumulation of the drug in the brain.",
