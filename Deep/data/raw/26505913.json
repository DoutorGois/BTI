     "AB": "Acetylcholine can modulate hippocampal network function through activation of both nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). All five mAChR subtypes have been identified in the hippocampus. Besides by their involvement in excitability of hippocampal cells, synaptic plasticity and memory, a large body of research has demonstrated the involvement of presynaptic mAChRs in the inhibition of glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus. Over the years, however, pharmacological and molecular genetic studies have yielded quite contradictory results regarding the mAChR subtype(s) involved. In this study, multi-electrode array technology was used for the pharmacological elucidation of the subtype of mAChR mediating the depression of excitatory synaptic transmission at the SC-CA1 synapse. Using selective antagonists (VU0255035, MT7, tripinamide, MT3) and allosteric potentiators (VU 10010, VU 0238429) the involvement of M1, M2, M4, and M5 subtypes was ruled out thereby implying a major modulatory role for M3 receptors in the inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission in area CA1 of rat hippocampus.",
