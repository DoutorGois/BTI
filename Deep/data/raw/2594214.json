     "AB": "The calcium permeability of receptor channels activated by quinolinic acid (QUIN) in cultured rat hippocampal neurons was investigated using the whole-cell voltage-clamp method. In Na+-free, 10 mM Ca2+ solution with the internal solution containing 165 mM Cs+, QUIN elicited prominent inward currents at -60 mV, and the reversal potential of the QUIN-induced current was -5.8 +/- 1.2 mV, indicating that QUIN-activated channels are highly permeable to Ca2+ (permeability ratio PCa2+/PCs+ = 5.9). This result was substantiated by microfluorometry using fura-2, which revealed that QUIN caused a marked increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration even after the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels had been suppressed by La3+.",
