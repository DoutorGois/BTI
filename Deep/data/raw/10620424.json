     "AB": "This study tested the hypothesis that neurons in olfactory regions of the kokanee salmon brain contain glucocorticoid receptors. Distribution and neuronal number of glucocorticoid receptor-like immunoreactive (GRir) neurons were identified in the kokanee salmon brain using immunohistochemistry with an antibody to GR (polyclonal rabbit anti-human, dilution 1:1500; and monoclonal mouse, dilution 5 micrograms/ml). Distribution of GRir neurons similar to the mammalian pattern was observed in the brains of sexually immature (n = 8; 4 female and 4 male) as well as spawning (n = 8; 4 female and 4 male) salmon. Olfactory-related areas containing GRir positive neuronal bodies included the internal cell layer of the olfactory bulb, ventral-lateral and lateral parts of the dorsal telencephalon (homologue of the mammalian hippocampus), ventral area of the telencephalon (homologue of the mammalian amygdala), glomerulosus complex of the thalamus, the preoptic area, and inferior lobe of the hypothalamus. The pattern of GRir neuronal distribution in sexually immature and spawning fish was similar. However, spawning fish brains, compared to sexually immature brains, exhibited a significantly greater GRir neuronal number in several olfactory regions in paired immunohistochemical runs. There also were differences in intraneuronal location of GRir in olfactory regions, with staining being predominantly cytoplasmic in sexually immature fish but nuclear in spawning fish. These results are consistent with a role for cortisol in olfactory-mediated homing in kokanee salmon. Although GRir were identified in many nonolfactory regions, the focus of this study is on GRir present in brain regions involved in olfaction.",
