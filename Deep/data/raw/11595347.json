     "AB": "Rat pups age of 14 postnatal day (P14) were subjected to lithium-pilocarpine (Li-PC) model of status epilepticus (SE). Control rats (n=6) were given an equivalent volume of saline intraperitoneally. Behavioral testing began on P60 including the Morris water maze, the radial arm maze, and the rotarod test. Brain were then analyzed with cresyl violet stain for histological lesions and evaluated for mossy fiber sprouting with the Timm stain. We observed spatial memory deficits both in the Morris water maze and radial arm maze in Li-PC-treated rat. There was no motor impairment in Li-PC-treated rat by the rotarod test. Two of six Li-PC-treated rats showed cell loss in hippocampal CA1 subfield. The Timm staining pattern was similar in both control and Li-PC-treated rats. Result of this study suggests that Li-PC-induced SE in immature rats cause long-term cognitive deficit and permanent cell loss in hippocampal CA1, but spare motor impairment.",
