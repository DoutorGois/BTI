     "AB": "A method using [3H]2-deoxyglucose was used to identify brain areas activated during partial and generalized amygdaloid kindled seizures and generalized seizures following electro-convulsive shock in rats. The amygdala, hippocampus. septal nuclei and hypothalamus were bilaterally activated in kindled convulsions. Electroshock caused a more widespread involvement including the thalamus, striatum, reticular formation and cerebellum. Changes in the amygdala and hippocampus but not hypothalamus, were found after partial kindling.",
