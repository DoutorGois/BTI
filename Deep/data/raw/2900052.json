NMDA receptor densities were unchanged in all areas tested. In contrast, significant reductions in the number of glutamate terminals were seen in the hippocampus of the Alzheimer's samples. A smaller reduction was seen in the caudate nucleus but this failed to reach significance. No such reductions were seen in either the frontal or parietal cortices.",
