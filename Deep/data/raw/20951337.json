     "AB": "We report a 55-year-old woman, who presented with transient amnesia for 7h following underwater swimming. There was no evidence of neurological disturbance except global amnesia. Sharp waves in both temporal regions were registered during the initial EEG recording, which was accentuated by hyperventilation. Right hippocampal high signal intensity was observed in DWI performed 56 h after symptom onset. The sharp waves were all disappeared on follow-up EEG recordings.",
