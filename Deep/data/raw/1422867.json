     "AB": "Rats were divided into the following four groups namely (a) sham-operated control, (b) 6-OHDA-treated, (c) sham-operated vitamin E-fed and (d) Vitamin E-fed treated with 6-OHDA. Total glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured in brainstem (BS), striatum (ST), hippocampus, frontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens (N. Acc.). GSH and SOD levels were significantly decreased in all regions of 6-OHDA-treated rats compared to controls. Feeding of vitamin E resulted in a significant reduction of GSH in ST and N. Acc. but caused increases in SOD in BS, ST, and N. Acc. Pretreatment of rats with vitamin E caused significant attenuation of the effects of 6-OHDA on GSH and SOD in most of the brain regions. These results show that vitamin E can spare the scavenging systems from the injurious effects of 6-OHDA.",
