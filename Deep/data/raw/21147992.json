     "AB": "Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is characterized by focal seizures, associated with hippocampal sclerosis, and often resistance to antiepileptic drugs. The parafascicular nucleus (PF) of the thalamus is involved in the generation of physiological oscillatory rhythms. It receives excitatory inputs from the cortex and inhibitory inputs from the basal ganglia, a system implicated in the control of epileptic seizures. The aim of this study was to examine the involvement of the PF in the occurrence of hippocampal paroxysmal discharges (HPDs) in a chronic animal model of MTLE in male mice. We recorded the local field potential (LFP) and the extracellular and intracellular activity of hippocampal and PF neurons during spontaneous HPDs in vivo. The end of the HPDs was concomitant with a slow repolarization in hippocampal neurons leading to an electrical silence. In contrast, it was associated in the PF with a transient increase in the power of the 10-20 Hz band in LFPs and a depolarization of PF neurons resulting in a sustained firing. We tested the role of the PF in the control of HPDs by single 130 Hz electrical stimulation of this nucleus and bilateral intra-PF injection of NMDA and GABA(A) antagonist and agonist. High-frequency PF stimulation interrupted ongoing HPDs at an intensity devoid of behavioral effects. NMDA antagonist and GABA(A) agonist suppressed hippocampal discharges in a dose-dependent way, whereas NMDA agonist and GABA(A) antagonist increased HPDs. Altogether, these data suggest that the PF nucleus plays a role in the modulation of MTLE seizures.",
