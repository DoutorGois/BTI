     "AB": "A practical example is given of how a newly developed stereological estimator of particle number, the disector, can be used to make estimates of neuron number in the dentate gyrus of rats. The estimates are free of biases related to lost caps, overprojection and assumptions about size, shape and orientation of the objects that are counted. The disector principle and the practical considerations relating to histological preparations and sampling are presented.",
