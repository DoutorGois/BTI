     "AB": "AIM AND METHODS: The DNA binding protein from hippocampus of epileptic rats was investigated by southwestern blot, which regulated the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene. Its expression pattern was also studied. RESULTS: Southwestern blot showed that there were two specific DNA binding proteins that regulated the expression of GFAP gene, and their molecular weight were 39 kDa and 35.5 kDa, respectively. The expression of the DNA binding proteins was markedly increased in hippocampus of kainic acid (KA) + NS group at 5 d, reached the peak at 3 w, lasted for 3 m observed. CONCLUSION: The results above suggest that KA may increase the expression of GFAP in hippocampus by upregulating the transcription factor that regulated the expression of GFAP gene, which may participate in the formation of epileptic seizures.",
