     "AB": "AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are not thought to be involved in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), but may be involved in its expression via second messenger pathways. However, one subunit of the AMPARs, GluR2, is also known to control Ca2+ influx. To test whether GluR2 plays any role in the induction of LTP, we generated mice that lacked this subunit. In GluR2 mutants, LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices was markedly enhanced (2-fold) and nonsaturating, whereas neuronal excitability and paired-pulse facilitation were normal. The 9-fold increase in Ca2+ permeability, in response to kainate application, suggests one possible mechanism for enhanced LTP. Mutant mice exhibited increased mortality, and those surviving showed reduced exploration and impaired motor coordination. These results suggest an important role for GluR2 in regulating synaptic plasticity and behavior.",
