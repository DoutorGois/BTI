     "AB": "Neurons in areas CA 1 and 3 of cat's dorsal hippocampus were studied. Fifteen percent of the investigated cells were influenced by visual stimuli. Eighty five such neurons were investigated. The organization of their receptive fields was tested with stationary and moving visual stimuli. Twenty eight percent of neurons had small receptive fields (10-20 deg square). Forty one neurons responded to stationary flashing spots. They were ON-OFF, ON and OFF types with phasic (66%) and tonic (34%) characteristics. Seventy five responded to dark and bright stimuli moving across their receptive fields. Twenty five neurons were direction-sensitive and 21 responded better to the dark moving stimuli than to the bright ones. No significant differences in the response properties of neurons in the CA 1 and CA 3 fields were observed.",
