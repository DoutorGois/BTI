     "AB": "By using differential display PCR, we have identified 98 cDNA fragments from the rat dorsal hippocampus that are expressed differentially between the fast learners and slow learners in the water maze learning task. One of these cDNA fragments encodes the rat serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (sgk) gene. Northern blot analysis revealed that the sgk mRNA level was approximately 4-fold higher in the hippocampus of fast learners than slow learners. In situ hybridization results indicated that sgk mRNA level was increased markedly in CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus of hippocampus in fast learners. Transient transfection of the sgk mutant DNA to the CA1 area impaired, whereas transfection of the sgk wild-type DNA facilitated water maze performance in rats. These results provide direct evidence that enhanced sgk expression facilitates memory consolidation of spatial learning in rats. These results also elucidate the molecular mechanism of glucocorticoid-induced memory facilitation in mammals.",
