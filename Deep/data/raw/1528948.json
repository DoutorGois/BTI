     "AB": "Repeated episodes of penile erection and yawning can be induced in male rats either by low doses of the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine or by oxytocin given systematically or into a lateral ventricle (ICV), respectively, or after microinjection of the two substances directly in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. These behavioral responses are prevented in a dose-dependent manner by the ICV administration of the potent oxytocin antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8-vasotocin. In contrast, the PVN injection of d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-Orn8-vasotocin (1-30 ng), while effective in preventing oxytocin effect, was unable to prevent apomorphine response. On the other hand, apomorphine-, but not oxytocin-induced penile erection and yawning was prevented by electrolytic lesion of the medial septum (MS). Such a lesion decreased oxytocin content by about 45% in the hippocampus. The above results suggest that the hypothalamic-hippocampal oxytocinergic pathway mediates apomorphine-induced penile erection and yawning and that oxytocin is involved at different levels in the CNS for the control of these behavioral responses.",
