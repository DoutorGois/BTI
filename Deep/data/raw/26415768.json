     "AB": "Epileptogenesis is a dynamic process initiated by insults to the brain that is characterized by progressive functional and structural alterations in certain cerebral regions, leading to the appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Within the duration of the trauma to the brain and the appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures, there is typically a latent period, which may offer a therapeutic window for preventing the emergence of epilepsy. Previous animal studies have shown that curcumin can attenuate acute seizure severity and brain oxidative stress, but the effect of curcumin on epileptogenesis has not been studied. We examined the effect of continued administration of curcumin during the latent period on epileptogenesis and the deleterious consequences of status epilepticus in adult rats in a post-status epilepticus model of temporal lobe epilepsy induced by kainic acid. We demonstrate that, while administration of curcumin treatment during the latent period does not prevent occurrence of spontaneous recurrent seizures after status epilepticus, it can attenuate the severity of spontaneous recurrent seizures and protect against cognitive impairment. Thus, treatment with curcumin during the latent period following status epilepticus is beneficial in modifying epileptogenesis.",
