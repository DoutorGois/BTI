     "AB": "Monosynaptic evoked field potentials (MEFP) were recorded in the dentate gyrus of male Wistar rats upon stimulation of either the perforant path or the commissural system. While the perforant path potential exhibited in acute experiments a clear reversal point of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and population spike when protruding the registration electrode from the hippocampal fissura to the hilus of the dentate gyrus, the simultaneously registered commissural potential elicited by stimulation of the contralateral hilus showed no reversal of the negative monophasic wave but merely an amplitude maximum 40 microns above the reversal point of the perforant path potential. Frequency-related changes of the MEFPs during short tetanic stimulation with 15 Hz both in acute and chronic experiments, revealed differences in the properties of the input systems in that the commissural potential exhibited a clear frequency potentiation whereas the perforant path potential showed frequency depression. Pronounced long-term potentiation of the perforant path potential induced by 4 trains of tetanizing stimuli and lasting up to 72 h was accompanied by a long-term heterosynaptic depression of the commissural potential for up to 7 days after tetanization. Both the different frequency-related changes of the inputs and the extremely long duration of the heterosynaptic depression are discussed with respect to their proposed functions in the mechanisms of functional plasticity.",
