     "AB": "Male Wistar rats were trained to discriminate the interoceptive effects of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-OMe-DMT; 1.25 mg/kg, IP) from saline in a two-lever operant chamber. Following discrimination learning, the following drugs (with ED50 dose in mg/kg IP) dose-dependently generalized: lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD, 0.04), 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.11), 6-methoxy-4-(dipropyl-amino)-1,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenz(c,d)indole hydrochloride (BAY R 1531, 0.15), 5-OMe-DMT itself (0.63), ipsapirone (TVX Q 7821, 2.7), and buspirone (3.8). The potencies of these drugs in generalization tests were best correlated with their binding affinities for the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor subtype (as measured by displacement of 3H-ipsapirone in the hippocampus). Drugs not, or only partially generalizing included quipazine, bufotenin, m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP), 5-methoxy-3(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl)-1H-indole succinate (RU 24969), citalopram, clomipramine, 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)-pyridine-5- carboxylate (BAY K 8644), the buspirone metabolite 1-pyrimidinyl-piperazine (1-PP), methysergide, metergoline, and metitepine. Of the last three compounds with antagonistic activity at 5-HT receptors, as well as ketanserin, pizotifen, and ritanserin, only metitepine and pindolol could fully block the 5-OMe-DMT stimulus. Pizotifen blocked the generalization of quipazine fully, that of 5-OMe-DMT only partially, and that of ipsapirone not at all. These data indicate that the 5-HT1A receptor subtype is strongly involved in the transduction of the interoceptive discriminative stimuli induced by 5-OMe-DMT, with 5-HT2 agonism also playing a possible role.",
