     "AB": "PURPOSE: The hippocampus is central to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Histology shows abnormalities in the dentate granule cell layer (DGCL), but its small size (~100 mum thickness) has precluded in vivo human studies. We used ultra high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare DGCL morphology of schizophrenic patients to matched controls. METHOD: Bilateral hippocampi of 16 schizophrenia patients (10 male) 40.7 +/- 10.6 years old (mean +/- standard deviation) were imaged at 7 Tesla MRI with heavily T(2)*-weighted gradient-echo sequence at 232 mum in-plane resolution (0.08 muL image voxels). Fifteen matched controls (8 male, 35.6 +/- 9.4 years old) and one ex vivo post mortem hippocampus (that also underwent histopathology) were scanned with same protocol. Three blinded neuroradiologists rated each DGCL on a qualitative scale of 1 to 6 (from \"not discernible\" to \"easily visible, appearing dark gray or black\") and mean left and right DGCL scores were compared using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: MRI identification of the DGCL was validated with histopathology. Mean right and left DGCL ratings in patients (3.2 +/- 1.0 and 3.5 +/- 1.2) were not statistically different from those of controls (3.9 +/- 1.1 and 3.8 +/- 0.8), but patients had a trend for lower right DGCL score (p = 0.07), which was significantly associated with patient diagnosis (p = 0.05). The optimal 48% sensitivity and 80% specificity for schizophrenia were achieved with a DGCL rating of </=2. CONCLUSION: Decreased contrast in the right DGCL in schizophrenia was predictive of schizophrenia diagnosis. Better utility of this metric as a schizophrenia biomarker may be achieved in future studies of patients with homogeneous disease subtypes and progression rates.",
