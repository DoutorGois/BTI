     "AB": "One week after receiving bilateral neurotoxic lesions of their dorsal hippocampi, adult Wistar rats were bilaterally grafted with fetal hippocampal tissue suspensions. The behavior of the animals was tested during a period of 5 months after grafting to determine changes in lesion-induced deficits. The transplants caused various behavioral effects with different time courses. Grafted animals showed an early, however, transient amelioration of behavioral deficits in a T-maze alternation task and they performed with a long-lasting improvement in the alcove-test. Transplant histology demonstrated high levels of AChE-activity in patches correlating with clusters or rudimentary layers of pyramidal neurons.",
