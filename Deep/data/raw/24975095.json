     "AB": "Neuroinflammation has been consistently reported as a pathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Microglial cells are activated by diverse pathological stimuli and play key roles in development of neuroinflammation. Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), the major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimers brain, is known to activate cultured microglial cells to produce increased amounts of proinflammatory and neurotoxic factors. Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is the main bioactive alkaloid isolated from Ligusticum chuanxiong. TMP has multiple pharmacological activities, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects. Neuroprotective potential of TMP has been demonstrated in animal models of neuropathologies. However, the efficacy of this compound for controlling Abeta-related neuropathology has not been explored yet. We examined the efficacy of TMP in the repression of inflammatory response in cultured microglial cells stimulated with Abeta25-35 in the presence of interferon (IFN)-gamma. TMP significantly inhibited the Abeta25-35 and IFN-gamma-stimulated productions of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and intracellular reactive oxygen species from primary microglial cells. TMP also effectively reduced Abeta25-35 and IFN-gamma-elicited NF-kappaB activation. In organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs), TMP significantly blocked Abeta25-35-induced reactive oxygen species generation and phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, TMP also inhibited Abeta1-42-induced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta production in primary microglial cells and neuronal death in OHSCs. These results suggest that TMP provide a possible therapeutic approach for alleviating the inflammatory progression of Alzheimers disease.",
