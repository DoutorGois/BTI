     "AB": "The neuroprotective effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) against ischemic injury has been demonstrated in animal models. In this study, we compared the protective effect of bilobalide, a purified terpene lactone from EGb 761, and EGb 761 against ischemic injury. We measured neuronal loss and the levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded cytochrome oxidase (COX) subunit III mRNA in vulnerable hippocampal regions of gerbils. At 7 days of reperfusion after 5 min of transient global forebrain ischemia, a significant increase in neuronal death and a significant decrease in COX III mRNA were observed in the hippocampal CA1 neurons. Oral administration of EGb 761 at 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day and bilobalide at 3 and 6 mg/kg/day for 7 days before ischemia progressively protected CA1 neurons from death and from ischemia-induced reductions in COX III mRNA. In addition, both bilobalide and EGb 761 protected against ischemia-induced reductions in COX III mRNA in CA1 neurons prior to their death, at 1 day of reperfusion. These results suggest that oral administration of bilobalide and EGb 761 protect against ischemia-induced neuron death and reductions in mitochondrial gene expression.",
