     "AB": "The localization and timing of cellular calcium loading and glial cell reaction in relation to selective death of hippocampal neurons was studied in Mongolian gerbils following transient forebrain ischemia. Two days after a 5-min period of ischemia, heavy calcium staining was histochemically demonstrated in circumscribed groups of nerve cells, located in the transition zone between the CA1 and CA3 areas. This preceded complete neuronal cell death that was quantitatively assessed by measuring the intensity of Nissl staining. After a 12-min period of ischemia, extensive calcium loading was observed in conjunction with severe neuronal damage throughout the CA1 region as well in the dorsal nuclei of the thalamus. The extent of calcium staining decreased with time and was not seen at stages later than 7 days. Already at 2 days after a 5-min period of ischemia, a strong increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity was seen. This indicates a marked and early hypertrophy of astrocytes that was not accompanied by an obvious proliferation. Neither the astrocytic response nor the neuronal calcium accumulation were observed in gerbils pretreated with propentofylline, HWA 285 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 15 min before bilateral carotid artery occlusion. Also, the decrease of Nissl staining in the CA1 area after 5 and 12 min of ischemia was considerably less pronounced and did not significantly differ from sham-operated controls.",
