     "AB": "The ventral hippocampal formation (vHF) seems to constrain diverse responses to psychological stimuli, and disruption of this function may underlie severe neuropsychiatric diseases. In particular, the ventral subiculum inhibits hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) activity following psychological, but not systemic, stressors. Despite the difficulty in interpreting such HPA responses, they have been relied upon to further characterize vHF function, because increased HPA axis activity is implicated in neuropsychiatric disturbances, and reliance on behavioral and cognitive data is even more problematic. Plasma arginine vasopressin (pAVP), which is inhibited by psychological stimuli and is also implicated in diverse neuropsychiatric diseases, provides a less ambiguous measure of CNS function. To test if its inhibition by psychological stress is also mediated by the vHF, we conducted two studies. In the first, pAVP and behavioral responses to novel acoustic stress were assessed in rats with bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the ventral subiculum and the ventral hippocampus. The subiculum lesions blocked the fall in pAVP and enhanced escape behaviors, whereas the hippocampal lesions produced responses intermediate to those in the subiculum-lesioned and control rats. In the second study, the pAVP response was similarly blocked by small lesions restricted to those vHF subfields which project to the neuroendocrine hypothalamus, compared to the response in animals with lesions in other vHF subfields. These results indicate that discrete projections from the vHF inhibit the pAVP response to psychological stimuli, and suggest that pAVP may provide a reliable probe of vHF activity.",
