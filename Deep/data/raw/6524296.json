     "AB": "An acute amnesic syndrome accompanied the development of a hematoma of the upper part of the third ventricle affecting the fornix. The initial deficit was substantial with corresponding forgetfulness, but there was no false recognition nor fabulation. Recollection of past events was fairly well conserved, subject to difficulties with the temporal structuring of memories. Secondarily. psychometric tests showed preferential impairment of spontaneous recollection and logical learning. The role of lesions of the upper fornix projecting onto the dorsomedian nuclei of the thalamus is discussed.",
