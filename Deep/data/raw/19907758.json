In the dentate gyrus it was 70% of its maximum value in the cortex, while in CA2 it corresponded to the minimum level in the brain stem. Taking into account the role of caspase-3 in apoptosis, these differences can indicate different intensity of programmed cell death in different fields of the forming hippocampus.",
