     "AB": "Oxidative stress may contribute to the cellular alterations, which occur as the result of aging, and the nervous system is particularly vulnerable to aging associated oxidative injury. The multicatalytic proteasome (MCP) is responsible for the majority of protein degradation and is sensitive to oxidative stress. To determine if MCP activity is altered during aging, studies were conducted in multiple tissues from aged Fisher 344 rats. Analysis of heart, lung, kidney, and liver revealed decreased MCP activity in 12, 24, and 28 month old rats, compared with 3 week or 3 month old animals. The spinal cord, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex demonstrated age dependent decreases in MCP activity, but at no timepoint was MCP activity decreased in either the brain stem or cerebellum. Oxidative injury and the lipid oxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal caused decreased MCP activity in neural PC6 cells, while application of MCP inhibitors was sufficient to induce cell death in neural PC6 cells. Together, these data indicate a role for MCP inhibition in cellular dysfunction associated with aging and oxidative injury.",
