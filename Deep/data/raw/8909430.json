     "AB": "This study investigates the histories and the clinical course of 111 patients who had nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy. We compared 61 patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (UHS group) and 50 patients with minimal change (MRI negative group) assessed on the basis of MRI. In agreement with previous reports, we confirmed statistically that patients in the UHS group strongly tended to have had febrile convulsive status during early childhood or infancy and that habitual seizures tended to begin at a younger age than the other subset of nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy. Strikingly, episodes of psychoses, especially postictal psychoses, occurred significantly more often in the UHS group than in the MRI negative group. Additional involvement of temporal neocortex further augmented this association. We stress the role of mesial temporal pathology, and its linkage to the temporal neocortex, in the genesis of postictal psychoses.",
