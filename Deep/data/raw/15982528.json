     "AB": "Oxygen radicals play a crucial role in brain injury. Grape seed extract is a potent anti-oxidant. Does grape seed extract reduce brain injury in the rat pup? Seven-day-old rat pups had the right carotid arteries permanently ligated followed by 2.5 h of hypoxia (8% oxygen). Grape seed extract, 50 mg/kg, or vehicle was administered by i.p. 5 min prior to hypoxia and 4 h after reoxygenation and twice daily for 1 day. Brain damage was evaluated by weight deficit of the right hemisphere at 22 days following hypoxia and by histopathology. Grape seed extract reduced brain weight loss from 20.0+/-4.4% S.E.M. in vehicle pups (n=21) to 3.1+/-1.6% in treated pups (n=20, P<0.01). Grape seed extract improved the histopathologic brain score in cortex, hippocampus and thalamus (P<0.05 versus vehicle). Concentrations of brain 8-isoprostaglandin F2alpha and thiobarbituric acid reacting substances significantly increased due to hypoxic ischemia. Grape seed extract reduced this increase. Treatment with grape seed extract suppresses lipid peroxidation and reduces hypoxic ischemic brain injury in neonatal rat.",
