     "AB": "The glutamate receptor subtypes AMPA and kainate are involved in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in the CNS. Recently there has been considerable interest in understanding the molecular regulation of these receptors by proteins that directly bind to AMPA and kainate receptor subunits. Amongst the first interaction partners to be discovered were NSF, ABP, GRIP and PICK1, which bind the AMPA receptor subunit GLUA2. We have studied the functional roles of the interactions of these proteins in regulating AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. We have also started to investigate the functions of PICK1 and GRIP on kainate receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in this region. In this article we reflect upon this work, which has led to some new ideas about how AMPA and kainate receptors are regulated at synapses.",
