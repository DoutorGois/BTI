     "AB": "Protein synthesis is believed to be involved in stabilizing synaptic plasticity. Effects lasting longer than about 2-3h are considered to require synthesis of new proteins, implying a functional separation between early (E) and late (L) components. However, the issue of constitutive vs. new protein synthesis is still unclear, especially in young animals. Here, we examined the effects of two protein synthesis inhibitors, anisomycin and emetine, on long-term-potentiation (LTP) in CA1 area of hippocampal slices from 12- to 20-day-old rats. Either drug was applied from -30 min to +30 min with respect to LTP induction, a time window previously reported to be critical. However, the LTP remained stable under the entire recording period of 4h (anisomycin), or 8h (emetine). Proper preparation of emetine solution was evidenced by the fact that, in separate experiments, prolonged treatment with emetine gradually blocked baseline responses. Although no corresponding effect was observed with anisomycin, the drug was judged to be potent by its ability to inhibit yeast growth. The ability of anisomycin to inhibit protein synthesis was further confirmed by radiolabeling experiments assessing the degree of leucine incorporation. Our data suggest that LTP up to at least 8h is not dependent on triggered protein synthesis but can be attained by utilizing proteins already available at induction time.",
