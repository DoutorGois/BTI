     "AB": "During surgery or infection, peripheral inflammation can lead to neuroinflammation, which is associated with cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, and several neurodegenerative diseases. Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist, is known to exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties and reduces the incidence of postoperative cognitive impairments. However, on the whole the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aims to explore whether dexmedetomidine influences microRNAs (miRNAs) in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. Adult Wistar rats were injected with 1 mg/kg LPS intraperitoneal (i.p.) in the presence or absence of 5 microg/kg dexmedetomidine. After 6 h, 24 h, and 7 days, gene expressions of interleukin 1-beta (IL1-beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and microRNA expressions of miR 124, 132, 134, and 155 were measured in the hippocampus, cortex, and plasma. Dexmedetomidine decreased the LPS-induced neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and cortex via significant reduction of the IL1-beta and TNF-alpha gene expressions after 24 h. Moreover, the LPS-mediated increased expressions of miR 124, 132, 134, and 155 were significantly decreased after dexmedetomidine treatment in both brain regions. In plasma, dexmedetomidine significantly reduced LPS-induced miR 155 after 6 h. Furthermore, there is evidence that miR 132 and 134 may be suitable as potential biomarkers for the detection of neuroinflammation.",
