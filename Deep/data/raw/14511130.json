     "AB": "Mitochondria are important in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative diseases, and mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), membrane depolarization, permeability changes and release of apoptogenic proteins are involved in these processes. Following brain insults, cell death often occurs in discrete regions of the brain, such as the subregions of the hippocampus. To analyse mitochondrial structure and function in such subregions, only small amounts of mitochondria are available. We developed a protocol for flow cytometric analysis of very small samples of isolated brain mitochondria, and analysed mitochondrial swelling and formation of ROS in mitochondria from the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Calcium-induced mitochondrial swelling was measured, and fluorescent probes were used to selectively stain mitochondria (nonyl acridine orange), to measure membrane potential (tetramethylrhodamine-methyl-ester, 1,1',3,3,3',3'-hexamethylindodicarbocyanine-iodide) and to measure production of ROS (2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein-diacetate). We found that formation of ROS and mitochondrial permeability transition pore activation were higher in mitochondria from the CA1 than from the CA3 region, and propose that differences in mitochondrial properties partly underlie the selective vulnerability of the CA1 region to brain insults. We also conclude that flow cytometry is a useful tool to analyse the role of mitochondria in cell death processes.",
