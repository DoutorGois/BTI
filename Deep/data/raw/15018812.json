     "AB": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) specifically inhibits plasminogen activators, extracellular fibrinolytic serine proteases that are also implicated in brain plasticity and toxicity. Primarily localized intracellularly, PAI-2 is thought to also counteract apoptosis mediated by a currently undefined intracellular protease. Here we localized PAI-2 mRNA through in situ hybridization in brain cryosections derived from normal adult mice or after kainate excitation. We found that in the normal brain PAI-2 mRNA was confined to an area within the accumbens nucleus shell. After kainate was injected (i.p.), PAI-2 mRNA was substantially and rapidly (within 2 h) induced in neuron-like cells primarily in layers II-III of the neocortex; the cingulate, piriform, entorhinal and perirhinal cortices; the olfactory bulb, nucleus and tubercle; in the accumbens nucleus, shell and core; throughout the caudate putamen and the amygdaloid complex; in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus, and in the parasubiculum. These findings suggest that PAI-2 could play a role in the accumbens nucleus as well as in activity-related events associated with olfactory, striatal, and limbic structures.",
