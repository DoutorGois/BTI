     "AB": "Vertigo, instability, oscillopsia and concomitant autonomic disorders are classical and well-known symptoms of vestibular disorders. At the same time, recent studies suggest that there are more complicated vestibular dysfunctions caused by the cortical projections of the vestibular system. The central vestibular system includes parietal temporal cortex and insular, anterior intraparietal sulcus, posterior parietal and medial parts of the superior temporal gyrus, singular gyrus retrosplenial cortex, hippocampus and parahippocampal area. The central part of the vestibular system closely interacts with other afferent systems forming a multisensory structure of higher brain functions. Dysfunctions of higher vestibular function play an important role in the development of clinical syndromes including pusher syndrome, room tilt illusion, unilateral spatial neglect syndrome, impairment of spatial memory and navigation. These syndromes can develop due to the direct damage of the cortical vestibular system or as a result of disconnection between the vestibular cortex and other parts of the sensory cortex.",
