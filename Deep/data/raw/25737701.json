     "AB": "As the major division of the basal ganglia, neostriatum forms mutual connections with multiple brain areas and is critically involved in motor control and learning/memory. Long-term synaptic plasticity has been widely studied in different species recently. However, there are rare reports about the short-term synaptic plasticity in neostratium. In the present study, using field excitatory postsynaptic potentials recording, we reported one form of short-term synaptic plasticity that is paired pulse depression in juvenile rat dorsal striatum slices induced by stimuli of the white matter. The field excitatory postsynaptic potentials could be abolished by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylizoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, but not by gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor antagonist bicuculline or dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SKF-81297. The paired pulse depression in the corticostratial pathway was different from paired pulse facilitation in the hippocampal CA1 synapse. In addition, the paired pulse depression was not affected by bath application of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor antagonist or dopamine D1 receptor antagonist. However, low calcium and high magnesium could attenuate the paired pulse depression. These findings suggest a more complicated plasticity form in the dorsal striatum of juvenile rats that is different from that in the hippocampus, which is related with extracellular calcium.",
