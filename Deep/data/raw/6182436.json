     "AB": "Rat hippocampal slices were preloaded with 3H-histamine and superfused with physiological medium and electrically stimulated in the absence (S1) and in the presence (S2) of drugs. The electrically evoked 3H-overflow consisted mainly of histamine, was Ca++ dependent and completely blocked by tetrodotoxin, all pointing towards an impulse triggered neuronal release. Mepyramine, promethazine and diphenhydramine the H1-antagonists, inhibited the stimulation evoked histamine release in a dose dependent manner. Burimamide and cimetidine, the H2-antagonists, enhanced the stimulation induced release of histamine whereas dimaprit, the H2-antagonist, had the opposite effect. Histamine by itself did not influence its own release. The observations indicate an opposing role for H1- and H2-receptors in modulating spike induced histamine release and represents a functional consequence of the stimulation of the receptors.",
