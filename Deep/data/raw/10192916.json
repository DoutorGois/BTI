     "AB": "The roles of dietary tryptophan (Trp) were evaluated in regulation of production of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin (NT)-3 in the various brain regions in ddY mice. Feeding the mice a Trp-deficient diet for 2 weeks significantly decreased in the hippocampal level of NGF but not those of BDNF and NT-3, as compared with feeding an adequate Trp diet. The mice fed excess Trp did not have different levels of any of these neurotrophins than in the mice fed an adequate Trp diet. The levels of BDNF in the cerebral cortex were also significantly lower in the mice fed on a Trp-deficient diet, while the levels of NGF and NT-3 in the region were not modulated upon feeding of the diet. The dietary Trp level had no significant effect on the levels of NGF, BDNF, or NT-3 in the entorhinal cortex nor septum of the mice. These results demonstrate that the brain levels of NGF and BDNF are dependent on the dietary content of tryptophan.",
