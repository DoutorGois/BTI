     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: There is an urge to identify new molecules which can modulate process of epileptogenesis, since currently available drugs act symptomatically and one-third of the patients remain refractory to the disease. Hence, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of Resveratrol (RESV) on epileptogenesis in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling in mice. METHOD: Swiss albino mice were administered RESV (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg,p.o) in acute study. On the seventh day animals were subjected to various neurological and neurobehavioral tests viz, Increasing Current Electroshock Test (ICES), PTZ-induced seizures, passive avoidance response, and elevated plus maze test. For the development of kindling PTZ was administered in a dose of 25 mg/kg, i.p. on every alternate day and RESV in all the three doses was administered daily. Seizure score was continuously monitored till the development of kindling and cognition tests were performed in the end of the study. The animals were sacrificed and levels of inflammatory biomarkers viz., IL-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1-Ra), IL-6, and TNF-alpha were assessed in the hippocampus and cortex of the kindled animals. RESULTS: RESV in all three doses increased the seizure threshold to hind limb extension in the ICES test. RESV in all the tested doses suppressed the development of kindling and reduced the levels of IL-1beta, IL1-Ra, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in kindled mice. CONCLUSION: RESV suppressed the development of kindling in mice and decreased the levels of inflammatory biomarkers in their hippocampus. RESV modified brain inflammation during epileptogenesis and found to possess nootropic activity in the kindled mice.",
