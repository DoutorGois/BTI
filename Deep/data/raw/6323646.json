     "AB": "The transverse guinea pig hippocampal slice preparation was used to model the metabolic changes which occur in vivo during ischemia and recovery. Perfusing brain slices with medium devoid of glucose and oxygen elicits rapid decreases in phosphocreatine, ATP, intracellular pH, and in the evoked field potential recorded in the dentate gyrus. AMP and creatine rise during this period, while ADP and lactate levels remain unchanged. Cyclic AMP exhibits a transient increase in concentration. With the exception of ADP and lactate, these responses are very similar to those observed during in vivo ischemia. The return of glucose and oxygen to the incubation medium reverses these metabolic and electrophysiological effects and also leads to pronounced elevations in cyclic nucleotide concentrations. Metabolite concentrations approach, but do not reach, in vitro steady state levels during the first 30 min of recovery. Total adenylate and creatine steady state levels are approximately 50% of in vivo concentrations. The results suggest that, although hippocampal slices differ metabolically from in vivo tissue, they exhibit a similar pattern of metabolic responses to ischemic and reflow conditions.",
