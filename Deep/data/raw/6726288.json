     "AB": "After lesions were placed in the hippocampal commissures, degenerating terminals could be localized above, inside and beneath the granule cell layer of the contralateral dentate gyrus. The terminals formed asymmetric synapses with spines, dendritic shafts and somata of granule cells. Degenerating terminals also formed synapses with dendrites and somata of basket cells identified by the Golgi-electron microscope technique. These basket cells were located either at the hilar border of the granule cell layer or in the molecular layer and each formed an axonal plexus around the somata and proximal dendrites of granule cells. These observations provide an anatomical basis for the recently described feed-forward inhibition in this brain region.",
