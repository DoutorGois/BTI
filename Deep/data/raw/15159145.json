     "AB": "The use of the single-trial fear conditioning paradigm allows for control over the exact moment when an animal is exposed to a learning event, making it possible to study both the initial neurobiological changes that are associated with learning and changes that take place over long periods of time. In the present study, we performed detailed analyses of the alterations in phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-beta1a (PLC-beta1a) levels and enzyme activities in subcellular fractions prepared from the hippocampal formation (HPF) and medial frontal cortex (MFC) 1, 3, 5, 7, 24, and 72 h following single-trial fear conditioning. We observed tissue- and time-dependent changes in both PLC-beta1a enzyme activity and anti-PLC-beta1a immunoreactivity in each subcellular fraction. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that changes in PLC-beta1a catalytic activity and subcellular distribution play important roles in neuronal signaling processes that are required for fear-conditioned learning and memory.",
