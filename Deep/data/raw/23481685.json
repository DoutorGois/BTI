     "AB": "Default mode network (DMN) disruption has been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the specific pattern of altered connectivity over the course of prodromal AD remains to be characterized. The aim of this study was to assess DMN connectivity in older adults with informant-verified cognitive complaints (CC) but normal neuropsychological performance compared to individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls (HC). DMN maps were derived from resting-state fMRI using independent component analysis. Group comparisons of DMN connectivity were performed between older adults with MCI (n = 18), CC (n = 23), and HC (n = 16). Both CC and MCI showed decreased DMN connectivity in the right hippocampus compared to HC, with the CC group showing greater connectivity than MCI. These differences survived atrophy correction and correlated with cognitive performance. DMN connectivity appears sensitive to early prodromal neurodegenerative changes associated with AD, notably including pre-MCI individuals with cognitive complaints.",
