     "AB": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered as an intermediate zone between normal aging and dementia. The most prominent feature of MCI is an isolated mild decline in memory, whereas other cognitive functions remain intact. The symptoms of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) range from MCI to dementia, and an animal model of VCI has been established in a gerbil by transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). In the current study, we set out to investigate whether electroacupuncture (EA) could improve memory in gerbils with BCCAO-induced MCI. Animals were randomly divided into two groups: sham-operated group (n = 17) and a model group that was subdivided into BCCAO, n = 17, and EA-treated BCCAO, n = 28. Gerbils were treated with EA at KI3 or GV20 four times every other day using a set of electrical stimulus pulses (1 mA, 2 Hz) that were applied for 20 min. For investigation of cognitive function, we performed a Y-maze test and Western blotting to identify the expression of neuroinflammatory proteins. EA treatment at KI3 (\"Taegye\" acupoint) improved cognitive function and reduced the expression of neuroinflammatory proteins including ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1, toll-like receptor 4, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase in the hippocampus of gerbils that had undergone BCCAO. Furthermore, using micro-positron emission tomography/computed tomography, we demonstrated that EA treatment increased glucose metabolism in the hippocampus of these animals. The present study highlights the neuroprotective effect of EA treatment against BCCAO-induced memory dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and glucose metabolism. Our findings suggest that EA, which has previously been used in complementary and alternative medicine, might also be considered as a therapy that can improve memory and reduce neuroinflammation associated with dementia.",
