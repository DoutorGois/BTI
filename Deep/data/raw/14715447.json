     "AB": "The neurotoxic effect of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1beta was studied in monolayer cultures, obtained using roller-drum incubation of hippocampal slices from neonatal Sprague Dawley rats. Following exposure to recombinant rat IL-1beta for four days, a concentration dependent loss was observed in the number of NMDAR1 receptor subunit immunoreactive pyramidal neurons in the cultures, reaching significance at 10 ng/ml rIL-1beta. Also incubation with recombinant mouse IL-1beta caused a loss of pyramidal neurons, with a significant effect at a concentration of 30 pg/ml. The vitamin E analog trolox (30 microM) was found to exert a protective effect against the rIL-1beta induced neuronal degeneration. A neuroprotective action against rIL-1beta was also found after co-incubation with the NMDA antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801; 30 microM), while no protection was found with the GABAA mimetic clomethiazole. Hence, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta is neurotoxic to hippocampal pyramidal neurons when studied in an in vitro system with advanced phenotypic characteristics. The neuroprotective effects exerted by trolox and MK-801 suggest that free radicals and NMDA receptor-mediated processes are involved in IL-1beta -induced neurodegeneration.",
