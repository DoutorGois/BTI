     "AB": "The effect of venlafaxine on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rat hippocampal neurons was studied, as well as its inhibitory effect on apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Differences in behavioral ability between the depression model group and the venlafaxine treatment group were observed in behavioral, sucrose-water and open field tests. The rat hippocampal tissue was sliced, stained and observed for BDNF distribution by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis of hippocampal neurons was detected by TUNEL. BDNF expression in the hippocampal tissue was detected by Western blot. Injury and apoptosis of the hippocampal tissue were observed by electron microscopy. Behavioral test showed that venlafaxine effectively improved the behavioral abilities of depressed rats. Immunohistochemistry showed that venlafaxine markedly increased BDNF expression in the rat hippocampus. TUNEL showed that venlafaxine markedly inhibited apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, which was also confirmed by electron microscopic observation of the pathologic sections. Venlafaxine improved the expression of BDNF by influencing the PI3k/PKB/eNOS pathway and repressed the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons.",
