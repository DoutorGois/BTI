     "AB": "In the present study, we examined the effects of OPC-14117, a superoxide radical scavenger, on the secondary cellular damage and cognitive dysfunction occurring in a rat model of cerebral contusion induced by a controlled cortical impact (CCI). Histological examinations revealed that the contusion necrosis volume reached 13.6+/-5.3 mm(3) in non-treated animals and declined to 1.9+/-0.6 mm(3) in OPC-14117-treated animals (P<0.01). The cell number of the CA3 region was 120.0+/-12.4 cells/mm in the normal controls, 73.6+/-9.9 cells/mm in the non-treated animals, and 111.2+/-10.2 cells/mm in the OPC-14117-treated animals, indicating that CCI-induced selective neuronal cell death in the CA3 region was attenuated by the OPC-14117 administration (P<0.01). The tissue osmolality, as determined with a vapor pressure osmometer, was 314.5+/-15.4 mmol/kg in the normal brain and increased to 426.0+/-20.1 mmol/kg at 12 h following CCI. The increase in tissue osmolality was significantly attenuated by OPC-14117 administration (P<0.01). The OPC-14117 administration also attenuated the CCI-induced cognitive deficits. The OPC-14117-treated animals showed a tendency to improve on the Morris water maze performance test. The impairment of the habituation of exploratory activity elicited by CCI was significantly attenuated by OPC-14117 administration (P<0.05). In conclusion, OPC-14117 may have a potential for decreasing secondary cellular damage due to traumatic brain injury since it is as efficacious as any other compound tested in this model.",
