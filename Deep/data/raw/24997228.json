     "AB": "Hearing loss induces plasticity in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems in auditory brain regions. Excitatory-inhibitory balance is also influenced by a range of neuromodulatory regulatory systems, but less is known about the effects of auditory damage on these networks. In this work, we studied the effects of acoustic trauma on neuromodulatory plasticity in the auditory midbrain of CBA/J mice. Quantitative PCR was used to measure the expression of serotonergic and GABAergic receptor genes in the inferior colliculus (IC) of mice that were unmanipulated, sham controls with no hearing loss, and experimental individuals with hearing loss induced by exposure to a 116 dB, 10 kHz pure tone for 3 h. Acoustic trauma induced substantial hearing loss that was accompanied by selective upregulation of two serotonin receptor genes in the IC. The Htr1B receptor gene was upregulated tenfold following trauma relative to shams, while the Htr1A gene was upregulated threefold. In contrast, no plasticity in serotonin receptor gene expression was found in the hippocampus, a region also innervated by serotonergic projections. Analyses in the IC demonstrated that acoustic trauma also changed the coexpression of genes in relation to each other, leading to an overexpression of Htr1B compared to other genes. These data suggest that acoustic trauma induces serotonergic plasticity in the auditory system, and that this plasticity may involve comodulation of functionally-linked receptor genes.",
