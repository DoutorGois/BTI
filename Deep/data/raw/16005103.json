     "AB": "The CA1 region of the rat hippocampus exhibits both alpha and beta adrenergic receptor (AR) responses, however, the specific AR subtypes involved and the neuronal expression patterns for these receptors are not well understood. We have employed single cell real time RT-PCR in conjunction with cell-specific immunohistochemical markers to determine the AR expression patterns for hippocampal neurons located in CA1, a region often implicated in learning and memory processes. Cytoplasmic samples were taken from 55 individual cells located in stratum oriens, pyramidale, or radiatum and reverse transcribed. All successfully amplified pyramidal neuron samples (n = 17) expressed mRNA for the beta2AR, with four cells additionally expressing mRNA for the beta1AR subtype. Positive interneurons from stratum oriens (n = 10) and stratum radiatum (n = 8) expressed mRNA for the alpha1A and/or alpha(1B)AR (n = 9/18) only when coexpressing transcripts for somatostatin. Interneurons containing neuropeptide Y or cholecystokinin (n = 9/18) were not positive for any of the nine AR subtypes, suggesting that CA1 interneuron AR expression is limited to a subset of somatostatin-positive cells. These findings suggest that only a select number of AR subtypes are transcriptionally expressed in CA1 and that these receptors are selective to specific neuronal cell types.",
