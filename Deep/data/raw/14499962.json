     "AB": "Transient global ischemia induces intensive neuronal degeneration in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer, accompanied by reactive transformation of glial cells. Previously, we have shown using the double immunostaining method that the NGF receptors (NGFR) p75 and TrkA are expressed mainly on subpopulations of GFAP+ astrocytes, and this expression increases progressively after ischemia. In the presented study, we analyzed quantitatively the morphological transformations of cells immunopositive for GFAP or NGF receptors in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 hippocampal area in different survival periods after ischemia, evoked by 10-min cardiac arrest in adult rats. In control brains, NGF receptors were expressed only on small cells with poorly ramified processes. After ischemia, the NGFR+ cells increased in size and morphological complexity (measured using fractal analysis). However, even 2 weeks after ischemia these cells did not reach the size and value of the fractal dimension typical of the largest GFAP+ astrocytes. Moreover, the reaction of NGFR+ cells was significantly delayed in comparison with the total astrocyte population. The obtained results suggest that NGF receptors are expressed mainly by immature astrocytes and ischemia induces the maturation of these cells.",
