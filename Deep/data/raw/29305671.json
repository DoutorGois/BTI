     "AB": "PURPOSE: To test the short- and long-term effects of Tenilsetam on chronic neuroinflammation in the GFAP-IL6 mouse. METHODS: From 3 months of age, GFAP-IL6 mice were divided into 2 groups and fed with Tenilsetam enriched food pellets or control food pellets, respectively, for either 5 or 15 months. Total numbers of Iba-1(+) microglia, TSPO(+) cells were determined using an unbiased stereological method. Levels of methylglyoxal and TNF-alpha in the cerebellar homogenate were tested using HPLC and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: Tenilsetam decreased the total number of Iba-1(+) microglia in both the cerebellum and the hippocampus of GFAP-IL6 mice at 8 months and in the cerebellum at 18 months. In the cerebellum, it decreased the density of microglia in GFAP-IL6 mice to a similar level after 5 and 15 months' feeding. Tenilsetam prevented the volume loss of the cerebellum at 8 months. It also significantly decreased TNF-alpha in the cerebellum of GFAP-IL6 mice to a similar level of WT mice after 15 months of feeding. CONCLUSION: Tenilsetam has anti-inflammatory effects evidenced by the decreased number of microglia in both the cerebellum and hippocampus, and decreased TNF-alpha levels in the GFAP-IL6 Tenilsetam fed animals.",
