     "AB": "Many experimental observations have demonstrated the modulatory role exerted by several neural structures and neurotransmitters on spontaneous and paroxysmal bioelectric activity of the hippocampus. Recently, the control exerted by locus coeruleus (LC) and its noradrenergic (NA) efferent pathway on different experimental models of epilepsy (e.g. cortical cobalt chronic epilepsy, amygdaloid and hippocampal kindling) was emphasised. On this basis, a series of experiments was performed to elucidate the functional role of LC-NA system on the hippocampal penicillin (PCN) focus and the type of adrenergic receptor involved. The experiments were carried out on 25 rats in which an epileptiform hippocampal focus was obtained through intrahippocampal PCN administration (100-200 I.U.). In these conditions, LC, ipsilateral to PCN hippocampal focus, was stimulated before and after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (2 mg/kg). Results showed a significant reduction of hippocampal spiking frequency during LC stimulation; after i.p. propranolol injection, LC stimulation, at the same parameters, failed to induce any sort of modification of PCN hippocampal spiking frequency. Furthermore, intrahippocampal application of a beta-selective agonist 2-fluoro-noradrenaline (2-FNA) mimics the inhibitory effects of LC stimulation. All data suggest that the LC-NA system is able to induce a net reduction of hippocampal epileptiform focus and the inhibitory NA control involves the activation of adrenergic beta receptors.",
