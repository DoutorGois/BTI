     "AB": "Newborn male pups of the inbred mouse strain DBA/2J were injected with a buffered solution of L-thyroxine, known to induce a hyperplasia of the intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fiber terminal fields (iip-MF). Because previous studies have shown that the size of the iip-MF correlates positively with both reference memory and working memory in a spatial radial maze task, we expected improved performance on such a task in the treated animals. Such an improvement was in fact found for both reference and working memory. We conclude that the iip-MF are functionally involved in the regulation of spatial learning and memory in mice.",
