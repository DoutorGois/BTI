     "AB": "Benzodiazepine receptors were investigated in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the brainstem, and the cerebellum of audiogenic seizure (AGS)-susceptible and seizure-resistant (ER) control rats. In AGS-susceptible rats of Sprague-Dawley descent, muscimol (10-6 M and 3 x 10-5 M) activated the binding of 3H-diazepam (0.4 nM) significantly less than in ER-rats. This finding may be strain selective, since it was not observed in AGS-susceptible rats of Wistar descent. Specific binding of the convulsant benzodiazepine receptor ligand methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl carboline-3-carboxylate (3H-DMCM), the benzodiazepine receptor ligand 3H-diazepam and the chloride channel directed cage convulsant t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate 35S-TBPS were not significantly changed in AGS-susceptible as compared to control rats. Our findings indicate that a disturbance at the level of the benzodiazepine receptor/GABA receptor/chloride channel complex is not a likely general aetiological factor for audigenic seizures in rats.",
