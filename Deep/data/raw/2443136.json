     "AB": "Phosphorylation of synaptosomal plasma membranes from rat hippocampus in the presence of the convulsant drug 4-aminopyridine resulted in the inhibition of the phosphorylation of the nervous tissue specific protein kinase C substrate protein B-50 (48 kDa) and the alpha-subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (50 kDa). Preincubation of SPM with 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate prevents the inhibition of B-50 phosphorylation by 4-aminopyridine, but had no effect on the inhibition of 50 kDa phosphorylation. 2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate is known to be a specific N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist and has anti-epileptic activity in vitro and in vivo. Several other anti-epileptic drugs tested did not influence the 4-aminopyridine-induced inhibition of protein phosphorylation.",
