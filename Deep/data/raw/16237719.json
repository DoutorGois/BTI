     "AB": "Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a predominant water channel of the brain, mediates transmembrane water movement at the blood-brain barrier and brain-cerebrospinal fluid interface. A broad pattern of evidence indicates that AQP4 and regulators of its expression are potential targets for treatment of brain swelling, but whether it participates in the regulation of neurotransmission has not been reported. We examined neurochemical differences between AQP4-knockout and wild-type mice with particular focus on neurotransmission. Basal tissue neurotransmitter and metabolite levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Significant sex- and region-specific differences of amino acids and monoamines were found in the brain of wild-type and AQP4-knockout mice. In cortex, striatum, and hippocampus of male AQP4-knockout mice, an increase of glutamine and decrease of aspartate were observed. Glutamate was increased only in female AQP4-knockout mice. The lack of AQP4 failed to affect the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid and taurine. In the medial prefrontal cortex of AQP4-knockout mice, the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine were increased, but no significant change in dopamine level was found. In the striatum of male AQP4-knockout mice, the levels of dopamine and serotonin were remarkably increased, which was not found in female mice. In the hypothalamus of AQP4-knockout mice, only the serotonin level was altered. These results provide the first evidence that the lack of AQP4 expression is accompanied by sex- and region-specific alterations in brain amino acid and monoamine metabolism.",
