     "AB": "Changes in proline-specific peptidase activity in the frontal cortex and hippocampus were studied using the experimental model of retrograde amnesia in rats. In one group, the amnesia was produced by a single injection of M-cholinergic antagonist scopolamine and the other group received the maximal electroconvulsive stimulation (MES). The amnesic effect was evaluated in passive avoidance test. In the amnesia models under consideration, the activity of prolylendopeptidase was significantly increased in both frontal cortex and hippocampus. The activity of dipeptidyl peptidase IV was significantly decreased in the cortex, whereas in the hippocampus it remained unchanged. Pyracetam inhibited prolylendopeptidase in the cortex and hippocampus, whereas dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity remained unchanged.",
