     "AB": "The mechanisms underlying diabetic encephalopathy, are only partially understood. In this study, we try to address the mechanisms of diabetes induced damage and whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) could attenuate the degenerative changes in diabetic hippocampus in a rodent model of diabetes. Diabetes was induced in rats by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Animals were divided into the following experimental groups: control rats; control animals treated with DHA; untreated diabetic rats; diabetic rats treated with insulin; diabetic rats treated with DHA; diabetic rats treated with insulin and DHA. At the end of week 12, rats were killed and one of the hemispheres was cryosectioned and the other was dissected and hippocampi homogenized. The number of bromodeoxyuridine positive cells in the hippocampus of diabetic rats was decreased, and the latency time to find the platform in the Morris Water maze was significantly increased in the diabetic rats when compared to controls. No changes where observed in the expression of p21 in the hippocampus of control and diabetic rats. Biochemical markers of oxidative stress were altered in hippocampus of diabetic rats, and NFkappaB-positive cells were increased in the hippocampus of diabetic rats when compared to controls. Treatment with DHA, or the combination of DHA with insulin, significantly restored to control levels all the values mentioned above. Our findings confirm a pivotal role for oxidative stress as well as NF-kappaB, but not p21, in diabetes-induced hippocampal impairments. Administration of DHA as well as insulin prevented the changes induced by diabetes in hippocampus.",
