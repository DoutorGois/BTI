     "AB": "The central representation of geomagnetic information in the avian brain continues to challenge researchers. Although the homing pigeon hippocampal formation primarily participates in the map-like representation of landmarks, some suggestive data indicate that it may also participate in spatial behavior guided by geomagnetic information. Forty-four isolated neurons were recorded from the hippocampal formation of homing pigeons trained to shuttle between two goal locations under changing (direction and intensity, and direction only) magnetic field conditions. Of the 37 slow-firing cells sampled (<14 spikes/s), none displayed a change in firing rate at the time of magnetic field transitions or during different ambient magnetic field conditions. By contrast, three of seven fast firing cells (>17 spikes/s) clearly displayed a phasic increase in firing during at least one of the magnetic field transitions used. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that a subset of hippocampal formation neurons receives information regarding changes in the earth's magnetic field that may be used to guide behavior.",
