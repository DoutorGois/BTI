     "AB": "We investigated activity-dependent calcium increases in proximal dendrites of dentate granule cells in the rat hippocampus, and its relationship with induction of LTP at perforant path synapses (PP-synapses). LTP was induced at PP-synapses by high-frequency stimulation (HFS; 100 Hz for 0.4 s), and the same HFS evoked a dendritic calcium increase in the proximal dendrite. However, bath-application of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) blocker nimodipine noticeably reduced this calcium increase without abolishing induction of LTP. This calcium increase mediated by high-threshold VDCCs is likely to be evoked by action potentials. LTP induction at PP-synapses is hence suggested to be independent of action potential-induced calcium increases in the proximal dendrite.",
