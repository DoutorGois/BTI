     "AB": "Affective disorders are often accompanied by changes in motivation and anxiety. We investigated the genome-wide gene expression patterns in an animal model of depression that separates Wistar rats belonging into clusters of persistently high anxiety/low motivation to explore and low anxiety/high motivation to explore (low explorers and high explorers, LE and HE, respectively), in three brain regions previously implicated in mood disorders (raphe, hippocampus and the frontal cortex). Several serotonin-, GABA-, and glutamatergic genes were differentially expressed in LE- and HE-rats. The analysis of Gene Ontology biological process terms associated with the differentially regulated genes identified a significant overrepresentation of genes involved in the neuron development, morphogenesis, and differentiation; the most enriched pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes were the Wnt signalling, MAPK signalling, long-term potentiation, and long-term depression pathways. These findings corroborate some expression data from other models of depression, and suggest additional targets.",
