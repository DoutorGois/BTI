Somatostatin levels in the frontal cortex were significantly reduced in Parkinsonian subjects who were slightly or severely demented compared to controls and to non-demented Parkinsonians. Significant reductions were also observed in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of severely demented subjects.",
