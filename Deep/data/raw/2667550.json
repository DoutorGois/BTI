     "AB": "The cholinergic systems of the forebrain may be divided in two major sub-units: the septohippocampal system and the innominate-cortical system. This analysis is limited to the behavioral effects of lesions of pathway origins i.e. Medial Septal Area (MSA) and Nucleus Basalis of Meynert (NBM). Working memory is regularly involved by MSA lesion; NBM lesions also seem to affect working memory but is more often the cause of altered reference memory. However, multiple techniques of lesions are used, impairing interpretation of all the results by their bias and discrepancies.",
