     "AB": "A human hippocampus cDNA library in lambda ZAP II was screened by hybridization with a rat brain inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) 3-kinase cDNA. Two clones (hh6 and hh3) were isolated and sequenced. The insert of clone hh6 was shown to correspond to the 3' end of the coding sequence of 50,000-Mr InsP3 3-kinase (referred to as 3-kinase-A). Sequencing of the clone hh3 insert yielded an open reading frame encoding a 472-amino acid protein with a calculated Mr of 53,451 (referred to as 3-kinase-B). The C-terminal part of 3-kinase-B (residues 187-462) was 68% identical with 3-kinase-A in amino acid sequence. The cDNA of clone hh3 was rescued as a Bluescript plasmid and expressed in Escherichia coli as a beta-galactosidase fusion product. It showed InsP3 3-kinase activity that was stimulated in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin (more than 7-fold in a crude bacterial lysate from expressed plasmid). Regeneration of InsP3 3-kinase activity after SDS/PAGE identified a major polypeptide (Mr 60,000-65,000). The Km for InsP3 of expressed 3-kinase-B was 1.6 microM. These data provide molecular evidence for the existence of InsP3 3-kinase isoenzymes.",
