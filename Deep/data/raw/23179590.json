     "AB": "The selective vulnerability of specific neuronal subpopulations to trimethyltin (TMT), an organotin compound with neurotoxicant effects selectively involving the limbic system and especially marked in the hippocampus, makes it useful to obtain in vivo models of neurodegeneration associated with behavioural alterations, such as hyperactivity and aggression, cognitive impairment as well as temporal lobe epilepsy. TMT has been widely used to study neuronal and glial factors involved in selective neuronal death, as well as the molecular mechanisms leading to hippocampal neurodegeneration (including neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, intracellular calcium overload, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress). It also offers a valuable instrument to study the cell-cell interactions and signalling pathways that modulate injury-induced neurogenesis, including the involvement of newly generated neurons in the possible repair processes. Since TMT appears to be a useful tool to damage the brain and study the various responses to damage, this review summarises current data from in vivo and in vitro studies on neuroprotective strategies to counteract TMT-induced neuronal death, that may be useful to elucidate the role of putative candidates for translational medical research on neurodegenerative diseases.",
