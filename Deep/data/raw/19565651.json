     "AB": "Kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE) is a well-characterized model of excitotoxic neuronal injury. Excitotoxicity results from activation of specific glutamate receptors, with resultant elevation of intracellular Ca(2+). The CA1 and CA3 subregions of the hippocampus are especially vulnerable to KA, and this pattern of neuronal injury resembles that occurring in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Calcium plays an essential role in excitotoxicity, and accordingly calcium channel inhibitors have been shown to have protective effects in various experimental models of epilepsy and brain injury. Moreover, they also potentiate the antiseizure efficacy of conventional antiepileptic drugs. This study was undertaken to determine whether NP04634, a novel compound, reported as a non-L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channel (VSCC) inhibitor, could prevent the entrance in SE and the neuronal loss evoked by intraperitoneal injection of KA. Our results show that intragastrical administration of NP04634 reduced the percentage of rats that entered SE after KA injection, increased the latency of SE entry, and significantly reduced the mortality of rats that entered SE. Also, NP04634 prevented the loss of hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons and reduced the gliosis induced by KA. These results point to a potential anticonvulsant and neuroprotective role for NP04634.",
