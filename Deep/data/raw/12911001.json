     "AB": "A 42-year-old man had complex partial epilepsy and secondary generalized seizure, without remarkable abnormalities in interictal EEG and head MRI. Three-dimensional SRT (3D SRT) analysis of peri-ictal SPECT data detected hyperperfusion in the right temporal lobe, the basal nucleus and the hippocampus, which showed hypoperfusion during interictal period. These findings suggested that the epileptogenic focus existed in the right temporal lobe. We concluded that 3D SRT analysis of peri-ictal SPECT would be helpful to identify the epileptogenic focus.",
