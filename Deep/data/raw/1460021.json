     "AB": "Osteogenic protein-2, OP-2, a new member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, closely related to the osteogenic/bone morphogenetic proteins, was discovered in mouse embryo and human hippocampus cDNA libraries. The TGF-beta domain of OP-2 shows 74% identity to OP-1, 75% to Vgr-1, and 76% to BMP-5, hence OP-2 may also have bone inductive activity. The genomic locus of OP-2 has seven exons, like OP-1, and spans more than 27 kilobases (kb). In the C-terminal TGF-beta domain, OP-2 has a unique additional cysteine. Mouse embryos express relatively high levels of OP-2 mRNA at 8 days, two species of 3 and 5 kb. A careful study of mRNA expression of the osteogenic proteins in specific organs revealed discrete mRNA species for BMP-3, BMP-4, BMP-5, and BMP-6/Vgr-1 in lung or liver of young and adult mice. OP-1 is expressed in kidney; however, OP-2 and BMP-2 mRNAs were not detected in any organs studied, suggesting an early developmental role.",
