     "AB": "Recent studies reported changes in neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression induced by seizures in the experimental epileptic models. However, there have been few reports of the alteration of NPY expression in hippocampal complexes of genetic epilepsy models. In the present study, we performed spatial and temporal analyses of NPY expression in the hippocampal complexes of the seizure-resistant (SR) and seizure-sensitive (SS) gerbils, one of the genetic models. In SR gerbils, most NPY(+) cells were located at the dentate hilus (DH) and the subiculum (SC). In the pre-seizure group of SS gerbils, neurons in the DH and SC were nearly devoid of NPY immunoreactivity. Interestingly, the acute NPY expressions were observed in these areas of the post-seizure group at 30 min, and its immunoreactivity was declined at 12 h after the onset of seizure. These findings suggest that in seizure, the deficiency of NPY in DH and SC may be one of the factors, and that the acute expression of NPY after seizure in these areas may be the compensatory response for reduction of seizure activity in this animal.",
