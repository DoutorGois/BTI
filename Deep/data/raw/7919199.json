     "AB": "Stereotactic lesioning of the rat entorhinal cortex leads to an induction of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) immunoreactivity in non-neuronal cells of the deafferented dentate gyrus. Double immunofluorescence against APP and the microglia-binding isolectin B4 from Griffonia simplicifolia revealed that APP immunoreactivity was confined to activated microglia. The microglial APP expression became detectable 3 days after lesioning, reached its peak after 7 days and disappeared after 10 days. The early accumulation of APP in microglia supports the view that microglia play an important role in the initial stages of amyloid plaque formation. Such a glial APP accumulation occurs rapidly in distant but anatomically connected areas. This is in line with the preferential localization of amyloid plaques in the dentate gyrus, which is the projection field of the degenerating neurones of the entorhinal cortex in patients with developing dementia.",
