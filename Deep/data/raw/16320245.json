     "AB": "Synapses of neurons use clathrin-mediated endocytic pathways for recycling of synaptic vesicles and trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors. Epsin 1 and huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1) are endocytic accessory proteins. Both proteins interact with clathrin and the AP2 adaptor complex and also bind to the phosphoinositide-containing plasma membrane via an epsin/AP180 N-terminal homology (ENTH/ANTH) domain. Epsin1 and HIP1 are found in neurons; however, their precise roles in synapses remain largely unknown. Using immunogold electron microscopy, we examine and compare the synaptic distribution of epsin1 and HIP1 in rat CA1 hippocampal synapse. We find that epsin1 is located across both sides of the synapse, whereas HIP1 displays a preference for the postsynaptic compartment. Within the synaptic compartments, espin1 is distributed similarly throughout, whereas postsynaptic HIP1 is concentrated near the plasma membrane. Our results suggest a dual role for epsin1 and HIP1 in the synapse: as broadly required factors for promoting clathrin assembly and as adaptors for specific endocytic pathways.",
