     "AB": "Mathew et al. propose that many candidate genes identified in our study may reflect the events in the choroid plexus (ChP) potentially included in hippocampal samples. We reanalyze our data and find that the ChP inclusion is unlikely to affect our major conclusions regarding the basal suppression of translational machinery or the early translational repression (at 5 to 10 minutes). As Mathew et al. examined for a subset of genes at 4 hours, we agree that the late suppression may partly reflect the events in the ChP. Although the precise contribution of anatomical sources remains to be clarified, our behavioral analyses indicate that the late-phase suppression of these genes may contribute to memory formation.",
