     "AB": "Recent studies indicate that a protracted daily administration of the antidepressant fluoxetine to adult rats increases cell proliferation/neurogenesis in the hippocampus. It has been hypothesized that this action of fluoxetine might be mediated by neurotrophic factors. We hypothesized that glial S100beta could be such a factor, and using quantitative Western immunoblotting, we investigated the effect of a 21-day treatment of rats with fluoxetine (5 mg/kg), and found that fluoxetine increases the content of hippocampal S100beta.",
