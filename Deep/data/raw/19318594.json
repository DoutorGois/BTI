     "AB": "Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) exerts beneficial effects on cognitive function. The selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil increases serum IGF-I levels in elderly subjects. Because stimulation of sensory neurons induces IGF-I production by releasing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the mouse brain, we hypothesized that donepezil increases IGF-I production by sensory neuron stimulation to improve the cognitive function in mice. Donepezil, but not tacrine, increased the CGRP release from dorsal root ganglion neurons isolated from wild-type (WT) mice. Pretreatment with the protein kinase A inhibitor KT5720 [(9S,10S,12R)-2,3,9,10,12-hexahydro-10-hydroxy-9-methyl-1-oxo-9,12-epoxy-1H-diind olo[1,2,3-fg: 3',2',1'-kl]pyrrolo[3,4-i][1,6]-benzo-diazocine-10-carboxylic acid hexyl ester] reversed the effects induced by donepezil. Increase in tissue levels of CGRP, IGF-I, and IGF-I mRNA in the hippocampus was observed at 4 weeks after oral administration of donepezil in WT mice. In these animals, c-fos expression in spinal dorsal horns, parabrachial nuclei, the solitary tract nucleus, and the hippocampus was increased. Enhancement in angiogenesis and neurogenesis was observed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of WT mice after donepezil administration. Improvement of spatial learning was observed in WT mice after donepezil administration. Oral administration of tacrine for 4 weeks produced none of the aforementioned effects induced by donepezil in WT mice. However, none of the effects observed in WT mice was seen after donepezil administration in CGRP-knockout mice and WT mice subjected to functional denervation. These observations suggest that donepezil may improve cognitive function in mice by increasing the hippocampal production of IGF-I through sensory neuron stimulation. These effects of donepezil may not be dependent on its acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity.",
