     "AB": "The mechanisms by which chronic ethanol exposure produces neuronal damage have not been established. Potentially ethanol may reduce normal neurotrophic influences necessary for neuronal survival, growth, and function. We hypothesized that chronic ethanol exposure might produce a decrease in the synthesis, availability, upregulation, delivery, and/or the biological activity of normally occurring neurotrophic factors, or may alter the capacity of target neurons to respond to these factors. The available evidence leading to this hypothesis and supporting data from our laboratory are discussed.",
