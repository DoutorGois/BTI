     "AB": "Neuroinflammation has been recognized to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is pathologically characterized by the accumulation of senile plaques containing activated microglia and amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta). In the present study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on neuroinflammation in rats with Abeta1-40 hippocampal injection. We found that Abeta-induced rats exhibited a disorder of pyramidal cell layer arrangement, and a decrease of mean pyramidal cell number in the CA1 hippocampal region compared with those in sham operated rats. NaHS (a donor of H2S, 5.6 mg/kg/d, i.p.) treatment for 3 weeks rescued neuronal cell death significantly. Moreover, we found that H2S dramatically suppressed the release of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 in the hippocampus. Consistently, both immunohistochemistry and Western blotting assays showed that H2S inhibited the upregulation of COX-2 and the activation of NF-kappaB in the hippocampus. In conclusion, our data indicate that H2S suppresses neuroinflammation via inhibition of the NF-kappaB activation pathway in the Abeta-induced rat model and has potential value for AD therapy.",
