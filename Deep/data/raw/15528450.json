     "TI": "Dual, hyperalgesic, and analgesic effects of the high-efficacy 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) agonist F 13640 [(3-chloro-4-fluoro-phenyl)-[4-fluoro-4-{[(5-methyl-pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-amino]-me thyl}piperidin-1-yl]methanone, fumaric acid salt]: relationship with 5-HT1A receptor occupancy and kinetic parameters.",

     "AB": "The aim of the present study was to establish the relationship between the plasma and brain concentration-time profiles of F 13640 [(3-chloro-4-fluoro-phenyl)-[4-fluoro-4-{[(5-methyl-pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-amino]-me thyl}piperidin-1-yl]methanone, fumaric acid salt] after acute administration and both its hyper- and hypoanalgesic effects in rats. The maximal plasma concentration (C(max)) of F 13640 after i.p. administration of 0.63 mg/kg was obtained at 15 min and decreased to half its maximal value after about 1 h. The amount of F 13640 collected by means of in vivo microdialysis in hippocampal dialysates could be measured reliably after 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg, reached its maximum at about 1 h, and fell to half of its maximal value at about 3 h. 5-Hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor occupancy was estimated by ex vivo binding in rat brain sections. F 13640 inhibited [(3)H]8-hydroxy-2-[di-n-propylamino] tetralin binding ex vivo in rat hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and frontal cortex (ED(50), 0.34 mg/kg i.p.). Maximal inhibition was reached at approximately 30 min after 0.63 mg/kg F 13640 and fell to half of its value after about 4 to 8 h. After injection (15 min) in the paw pressure test, F 13640 (0.63 mg/kg i.p.) induced an initial hyperalgesia that was followed 4 h later by a paradoxical analgesia that lasted until 8 h. In contrast, in the formalin test, F 13640 inhibited pain behaviors until 4 h after drug administration. F 13640 also produced elements of the 5-HT syndrome that lasted up to 4 h after administration. These results demonstrate that F 13640 induces hyperalgesia and/or analgesia with a time course that parallels the occupancy of 5-HT(1A) receptors and the presence of the compound in blood and brain.",
