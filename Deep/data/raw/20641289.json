     "AB": "Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) has diverse physiological roles as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1). 5-HT is involved in regulation and modulation of sleep, affective and personality behaviors, and pain. It is also a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation. The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which include several subtypes (4). 5-HT4 receptors are G-protein-coupled and present in several organs and tissues (5-11). 5-HT4 receptors are abundantly present in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and striatum, and the lowest density is observed in the cerebellum (12). Some thalamic nuclei have intermediate densities. 5-HT4 receptors are involved in the mediation of cognition and memory. Thus, there is a need for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacological role of 5-HT4 receptors. (1-Butyl-4-piperidinylmethyl)-8-amino-7-iodo-1,4-benzodioxan-5-carboxylate (SB207710) is a selective, high-affinity 5-HT4 receptor antagonist (7, 13). (123)I-Labeled SB207710 ([(123)I]SB207710) has been evaluated as a single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) radioligand for imaging brain 5-HT4 receptors in vivo (14).",
