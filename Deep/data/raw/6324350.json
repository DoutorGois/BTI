     "AB": "Electrical stimulation techniques were used to produce a long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of naive rabbits. Animals were then classically conditioned. Long-term potentiation of the hippocampus before training increased the rate at which animals subsequently learned the conditioning task. This result has significance for potential cellular mechanisms of associative learning.",
