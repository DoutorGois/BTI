     "AB": "The localization of a GTP-binding protein (G(o)) in the cerebellar and cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the normal and reeler mutant mouse was immunohistochemically examined using affinity-purified antibody raised against the alpha subunit of G(o). Although the general distribution pattern of G(o)-immunoreactive products in the brain of the normal mouse, i.e., abundant in the neuropil but absent from neuronal cell bodies, is also seen in the reeler brain, some differences are present, as described below. Strong G(o)-immunoreactive products are found in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex of the normal mouse. In the reeler cerebellum, in addition to the strong G(o)-immunoreactivity of the thin molecular layer, moderate G(o)-immunoreactivities are also found in the granular cell layer and the central cerebellar mass. G(o)-immunoreactive products are distributed throughout all layers of the cerebral cortex of the normal and reeler mouse. However, layer I of the normal cerebral cortex is more strongly stained with this antibody than the underlying layers, whereas the upper third of the reeler cerebral cortex is more strongly stained than the lower two-thirds. In the hippocampus of the normal mouse, G(o)-immunoreactive products are localized in the neuropil of the stratum oriens, stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum-moleculare, but absent from the cell bodies of the pyramidal cells and their apical dendritic shafts. Such a distribution pattern of G(o)-immunoreactive products is also seen in the hippocampus of the reeler mouse, except that G(o)-immunonegative pyramidal cells split into 2 or 3 laminae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
