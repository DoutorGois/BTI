     "AB": "As part of a program aimed at discovering orally active 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists, we screened our compound library and identified 2-[allyl(4-methylphenyl)amino]-4H-pyrido[3,2-e][1,3]thiazin-4-one (7) as a lead compound that inhibited kainate-induced neurotoxicity mediated by AMPA receptors in rat hippocampal cultures. Structure-activity relationship studies of a series of 2-amino-4H-pyrido[3,2-e][1,3]thiazin-4-one derivatives revealed that substituents on the phenyl ring attached to the 2-amino group and the 4H-pyrido[3,2-e][1,3]thiazin-4-one ring system play an important role in inhibitory activity against kainate-induced neurotoxicity. Several analogs bearing a phenyl group with a 4-substituent or five- or six-membered ring fused at the 3,4-positions exhibited potent inhibitory activity against kainate-induced neurotoxicity. Further, some of these compounds exhibited significant suppression of maximal electroshock seizure in mice following oral administration. Of these compounds, 2-[(4-chlorophenyl)(methyl)amino]-4H-pyrido[3,2-e][1,3]thiazin-4-one (16i) (YM928) demonstrated the most potent inhibitory effect with an ED50 value of 7.4mg/kg.",
