     "AB": "Changes in the spontaneous brain electrical activity and sleep organization were investigated in 5 mice strains during the evolution of experimental fixed rabies infection. Cortical electrodes were chronically implanted for continuous EEG recording and spectral analysis until death. Three evolutionary phases were individualized. The initial phase exhibited alterations of sleep stages, REM sleep disappearance, pseudoperiodic facial myoclonus and first clinical signs. The mature phase was characterized by a generalized EEG slowing (2-4 cycles/s). The terminal phase occurring with extinction of hippocampal rhythmic slow activity showed a flattening of cortical activity. The brain electrical activity ceased about 30 min before the cardiac arrest. Paroxysmal activities appeared during the course of the disease as bursts of rhythmic slow waves, pseudoperiodic spikes or occasionally ictal epileptic discharges. Spectral analysis revealed a progressive and characteristic clustering of the EEG frequency band power values. The spread of infection in the CNS was monitored by specific immunofluorescence studies which revealed the presence of rabies virus antigen in the pons, the cerebellum, the thalamus and the cortex during the initial phase. The pyramidal field of the hippocampus was infected during the mature phase but the gyrus dentatus was never infected even at the terminal phase. These studies show that particular neuronal functions are impaired during rabies virus infection suggesting that neuronal alterations may be involved in the pathogenic mechanisms leading to lethality.",
