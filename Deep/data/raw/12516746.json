     "AB": "A substantial number of VLBW graduates of intensive care develop cognitive and behavioral problems, even in the absence of neuroimaging abnormalities. Although this article has highlighted the potential, important, contributing role of medical and stressful, neonatal, environmental conditions to the development of these deficits, it is not all-encompassing, and there are additional prenatal (ie, in utero stress, drug exposure) and neonatal (ie, infectious) contributing factors. The long-term, outcome data presented in this article are pertinent to the more mature, VLBW infant, and it remains unclear and critically important to delineate the long-term, neurobehavioral outcome of those extremely low birth-weight survivors born at the cutting limit of viability.",
