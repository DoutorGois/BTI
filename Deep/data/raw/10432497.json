     "AB": "Living slices of rat hippocampus were used to study the possibility of suppressing forward and recurrent \"rapid\" inhibition in area CA1 by local application of picrotoxin, an antagonist of ionotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors. Application of picrotoxin to the apical dendrites increased the duration of focal potentials recorded in the radial layer (143.0 +/- 7.5%, n = 5; here and subsequently, results are presented as mean +/- error of the mean and n is the number of experiments) but had no effect on the population peak in the pyramidal layer (103.0 +/- 19.6%, n = 5). This is evidence for the existence of suppression of direct, but not of recurrent inhibition. Application of picrotoxin to the cell body layer, on the other hand, significantly increased the population peak (654.5 +/- 245.1%, n = 4) and provoked convulsive activity in neurons, demonstrating suppression of recurrent inhibition. Local application of picrotoxin was further used to study the question of how completely antagonists of glutamate ionotropic receptors sensitive to alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-S-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) suppress inhibition in solutions with low magnesium contents. This question is important for interpreting experimental data obtained from measurements of the components of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP), which depend on activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors sensitive to N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA). A number of studies have suggested that even at low concentrations, AMPA receptor antagonists suppress forward inhibition to such an extent that it has no significant effect on measurements of the NMDA component of EPSP. Our data do not contradict this suggestion.",
