     "AB": "Trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) is important for many forms of synaptic plasticity. However, the link between activity and resulting synaptic alterations is not fully understood. We identified a direct interaction between N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF), an ATPase involved in membrane fusion events and stabilization of surface AMPARs, and Polo-like kinase- 2 (Plk2), an activity-inducible kinase that homeostatically decreases excitatory synapse number and strength. Plk2 disrupted the interaction of NSF with the GluA2 subunit of AMPARs, promoting extensive loss of surface GluA2 in rat hippocampal neurons, greater association of GluA2 with adaptor proteins PICK1 and GRIP1, and decreased synaptic AMPAR current. Plk2 engagement of NSF, but not Plk2 kinase activity, was required for this mechanism and occurred through a motif in the Plk2 protein that was independent of the canonical polo box interaction sites. These data reveal that heightened synaptic activity, acting through Plk2, leads to homeostatic decreases in surface AMPAR expression via the direct dissociation of NSF from GluA2.",
