     "AB": "In order to explore whether the member of Bcl-2 gene family, for example, Bcl-2 and Bax, are induced after cerebral ischemia, and whether expression of genes can be modulated by calcium-antagonist, the rat cerebral ischemic models were made by occluding left middle cerebral artery. The expression of Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA was measured by RT-PCR method. After middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), the expression of both Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA were induced. Level of Bcl-2 mRNA increased steadily and level of Bax mRNA increased gradually at first, reached a peak after 24 h, then decreased slowly. After administration of nimodipine, Bcl-2 mRNA was up-regulated in the hippocampus 6 and 24 h after ischemia, while Bax mRNA was down-regulated 6 and 24 h after ischemia. Focal cerebral ischemia can induce proto-oncogenes to express, which was associated with apoptosis. Calcium-antagonist can up-regulate Bcl-2 mRNA and down-regulate Bax mRNA. The increased ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA may contribute to the anti-apoptic effect of nimodipine. The study indicates that pharmacological modulation of Bcl-2 family member expression could become a new strategy to manage neuronal damage.",
