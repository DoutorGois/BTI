     "AB": "Stimulation of phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis by excitatory amino acids (glutamate and ibotenate) or norepinephrine was potentiated in hippocampal slices from rats trained in an eight-arm radial maze, used as a test of spatial learning. No difference in basal or carbamylcholine-stimulated PI hydrolysis was found between control and trained animals. An increased PI response to excitatory amino acids and norepinephrine was not found in hippocampal slices prepared from animals trained in a shock conditioning avoidance test. These results suggest a possible involvement of specific glutamate receptors coupled with PI hydrolysis in the synaptic mechanisms underlying formation and/or storage of spatial memory.",
