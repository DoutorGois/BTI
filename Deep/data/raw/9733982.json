     "AB": "In a series of multiple regression models predicting either duration or severity of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients, significant linear correlations were found consistently for the volume of CA1, the subiculum, and the entorhinal cortex. Similarly, the total number of neurons in CA1, CA4, and the subiculum was correlated significantly with both the duration and the severity of AD. A hierarchical multiple regression model was used to examine whether any of these intercorrelated measures had any unique relationship to disease duration or severity. The results showed that only CA1 demonstrated a unique contribution to the explained variance in predicting duration or severity of AD for volume and for neuronal numbers. These results indicate that in the hippocampal formation, volume and neuronal numbers of CA1 appear to show a unique relationship with clinical measures of AD.",
