     "AB": "Quantitative interferometry showed that chronic amphetamine administration to August rats (2.5 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks) increased the area of neuronal cytoplasm and nuclei and content and concentrations of proteins in hippocampal CA3 neurons. These changes persisted after single injection of delta sleep-inducing peptide (60 microg/kg). The reaction of the entire neuronal population of hippocampal CA3 neurons to amphetamine is similar.",
