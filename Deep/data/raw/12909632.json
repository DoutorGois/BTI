     "AB": "Little is known about the dynamics of the dendritic transport of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) to synapses. Here, using virally expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-GluR1 and GFP-GluR2 and confocal photobleach techniques we show near real-time movement of these subunits in living cultured hippocampal neurons. GFP-GluR1 fluorescence was widely distributed throughout the extranuclear compartment with no evidence for discrete intracellular stores. GFP-GluR1 transport was predominantly proximal to distal at rates of 0.2-0.4 mum.s-1. GFP-GluR2 fluorescence was more punctate and localized at or close to the plasma membrane. Overall, GFP-GluR2 movement was less dynamic with distinct mobile and immobile pools. Neither activation nor inhibition of surface-expressed N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors or AMPARs had any significant effect on the rates of GFP-GluR1 or GFP-GluR2 dendritic transport. These results demonstrate that GluR1 is constitutively and rapidly transported throughout the neuron. GluR2, on the other hand, is less mobile, with a majority retained in relatively immobile membrane-associated clusters, with approximately 40% showing synaptic co-localization. Furthermore, the transport of both subunits is activity-independent, suggesting that the regulated delivery of AMPARs to the vicinity of synapses is not a mechanism that is involved in processes such as synaptic plasticity.",
