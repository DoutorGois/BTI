     "AB": "The present quantitative study was performed in order to discriminate pathological substrates for dementia from Alzheimer changes in normal controls (NC) and non-Alzheimer neuropsychiatric diseases (NAND). Regional densities of senile plaques (SP), neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and astrocytes in the cornu ammonis (CA), subiculum and entorhinal cortex were measured and differences in these densities among Alzheimer's disease (AD), NAND and NC were statistically compared. Densities of NFT in the CA and subiculum were significantly higher in AD than in NAND, and densities of SP in all regions were significantly higher in AD than in NAND. Similarly, NFT density in the subiculum and SP density in all regions were higher in AD than in NC. Regional densities of astrocytes in most regions were closely correlated with those of Alzheimer changes. In conclusion, the attribution of the Alzheimer changes, particularly of NFT, to dementia is neglected when they are confined to the entorhinal cortex. However, the attribution of the Alzheimer changes to dementia should be appreciated when they spread from the entorhinal cortex to the subiculum and/or CA.",
