     "AB": "Kainic acid (KA) is a neurotoxin that induces epileptic seizures and excitotoxicity in the hippocampus. Acupuncture is frequently used as an alternative therapy for epilepsy, and it has been known to protect hippocampal neurons against KA toxicity. Using proteomic analysis, we investigated protein expression changes in the hippocampus following acupuncture stimulation at HT8. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (20-25 g) received acupuncture treatment at HT8 acupoint bilaterally once a day for 3 days and were then administered KA (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Twenty-four hours after KA injection, neuronal survival and astrocyte activation in the hippocampus were measured, and protein expression in the hippocampus was identified by 2-dimensional electrophoresis. Acupuncture stimulation at HT8 suppressed KA-induced neuronal death and astrocyte activation in the hippocampus. We identified the changes in the expression of 11 proteins by KA or acupuncture stimulation at HT8 and found that acupuncture stimulation at HT8 normalized the expression of dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 and upregulated the expression of transcriptional activator protein pur-alpha, serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 5, and T-complex protein 1 subunit alpha, which are related to the survival of neurons. These results suggest that acupuncture stimulation at HT8 changes protein expression profiles in the hippocampus in favor of neuronal survival in KA-treated mice.",
