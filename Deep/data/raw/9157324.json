     "AB": "Previous studies have shown that adrenalectomy results in a small increase in hippocampal alpha-bungarotoxin binding, whereas seven days of chronic treatment with high doses of corticosterone results in decreases in alpha-bungarotoxin binding in several brain regions. The studies reported here examined the effects of different doses of corticosterone on brain alpha-bungarotoxin binding. C3H mice were adrenalectomized and treated with corticosterone-containing pellets (0.5-60%) for four days. Alpha-Bungarotoxin binding was measured in eight brain regions. Chronic treatment with corticosterone resulted in plasma corticosterone levels ranging from the low levels observed in an unstressed mouse during the daytime to levels significantly above those observed in mice during the night or as a result of stress. Adrenalectomy resulted in small increases in binding in hippocampus which was reversed by low dose corticosterone treatment. Chronic high-dose corticosterone treatment resulted in significant decreases in binding in four of the eight brain regions examined. Similar, but not identical, results were obtained in two other mouse strains (C57BL and DBA/2). These results argue that corticosterone levels play an important role in modulating the level of the brain nicotinic receptors that bind alpha-bungarotoxin with high affinity.",
