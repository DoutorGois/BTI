     "AB": "Recent studies have demonstrated alterations in cortical gray to white matter tissue contrast with nondemented aging and in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little information exists about the clinical relevance of such changes. It is possible that changes in MRI tissue contrast occur via independent mechanisms from those traditionally used in the assessment of AD associated degeneration such as hippocampal degeneration measured by more traditional volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We created cortical surface models of 95 cognitively healthy individuals and 98 individuals with AD to characterize changes in regional gray and white matter T1-weighted signal intensities in dementia and to evaluate how such measures related to classically described hippocampal and cortical atrophy. We found a reduction in gray matter to white matter tissue contrast throughout portions of medial and lateral temporal cortical regions as well as in anatomically associated regions including the posterior cingulate, precuneus, and medial frontal cortex. Decreases in tissue contrast were associated with hippocampal volume, however, the regional patterns of these associations differed for demented and nondemented individuals. In nondemented controls, lower hippocampal volume was associated with decreased gray/white matter tissue contrast globally across the cortical mantle. In contrast, in individuals with AD, selective associations were found between hippocampal volume and tissue contrast in temporal and limbic tissue. These results demonstrate that there are strong regional changes in neural tissue properties in AD which follow a spatial pattern including regions known to be affected from pathology studies. Such changes are associated with traditional imaging metrics of degeneration and may provide a unique biomarker of the tissue loss that occurs as a result of AD.",
