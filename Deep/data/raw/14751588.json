     "AB": "Dopamine and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein, 32 kDa (DARPP-32) is a key element of dopamine/D1/DARPP-32/protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) signaling cascades of mammalian brain. We are interested in the expression patterns of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors in DARPP-32-containing neurons, which may constitute morphological basis for interaction between dopamine and ionotropic glutamate receptors in dopaminoceptive cells. Double immunofluorescence was performed to visualize neurons showing coexpression of DARPP-32 with NMDA or AMPA receptor subunits (i.e., NR1, NR2a/b, glutamate receptor subunit 1 [GluR1], GluR2/3, and GluR4) in the forebrains of rats. Distribution of DARPP-32-positive neurons completely or partially overlapped with that of NMDA receptor- or AMPA receptor-immunoreactive ones in the frontal and parietal cortex, hippocampus and neostriatum, and neurons double-labeled with DARPP-32/NR1, DARPP-32/NR2a/b, DARPP-32/GluR1, DARPP-32/GluR2/3, or DARPP-32/GluR4 immunoreactivity were numerously observed. Semiquantification analysis indicated that most of DARPP-32-containing neurons (86-98%) expressed NR1, NR2a/b and GluR2/3, while less of them (14-90%) expressed GluR1 and GluR4. Although high rates (90-98%) of DARPP-32-positive cells expressed NMDA receptors in all regions above, variant percentages of them expressing AMPA receptor subunits were observed among the cortex (54-90%), hippocampus (59-97%) and neostriatum (14-97%). The study presents differential expression patterns of NMDA and AMPA receptors in DARPP-32-postive neurons in these forebrain regions. Taken together with previous reports, the present data suggest that interaction between dopamine and glutamate receptors may occur in the dopaminoceptive neurons with distinct receptor compositions and may be involved in modulating neuronal properties and excitotoxicity in mammalian forebrain.",
