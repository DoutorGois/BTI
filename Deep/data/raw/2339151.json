     "AB": "Age-related changes in central cholinergic muscarinic receptors were measured in young (3-6 month), middle-aged (15-17 month), and aged (22-26 month) male Fisher 344 rats by receptor binding techniques. Using [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate as the ligand, a significant decrease (14-19%) in the number of muscarinic cortical receptors was measured in aged rats compared to both young and middle-aged rats. With the selective M1 antagonist, [3H]-pirenzepine, a 17% decrease in receptor density was observed in the cortex of aged animals compared to young rats. For both ligands no differences were observed in the striatum or hippocampus between any age group and there was no change in affinity (Kd) in any of the three brain regions for the three age groups. Additionally, there was no difference in choline acetyltransferase activity measured in cortex, hippocampus, or striatum of young and aged rats. Thus, there is a loss of M1 muscarinic receptors in the cerebral cortex of aged male Fisher 344 rats.",
