     "AB": "Excitotoxic stimulation of NMDA receptors results in the activation of a variety of cellular responses. The inducible transcription factor NF-kappaB is known to be involved in excitotoxic responses by neurons. Here, we show that NF-kappaB activation occurs in a biphasic manner in hippocampal slices following a 20-min N-methyl- d-aspartate (NMDA) exposure. The biphasic activation profile consists of an early, rapid phase at 0.5-1 h post-insult, and a delayed phase evident 10-24 h post-insult. Endogenous inhibitors of NF-kappaB, IkappaBs, were examined for their involvement in the biphasic activation. IkappaBbeta exhibited marked degradation in response to the excitotoxity, while changes in the levels of IkappaBalpha and p105 isoforms were not detected. The initial decline in IkappaBbeta occurred in as little as 30 min post-NMDA exposure, coinciding with early NF-kappaB activity. A second, more gradual phase of IkappaBbeta degradation was also evident, possibly giving rise to the delayed activation of the transcription factor. While both phases of NF-kappaB activation were disrupted by the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5, they were distinct with regard to the composition of activated complexes and their responsiveness to altered culture conditions. The two phases of NF-kappaB activity also were associated with distinct gene regulation events. Up-regulation of bcl-2 message occurred early after the excitotoxic insult and remained up-regulated for an extended period. In contrast, bax message initially remained unchanged after the insult, but then exhibited an increase 24 h later, corresponding with the second phase of the NF-kappaB response. These results indicate that distinct phases of NF-kappaB activation are generated in the excitotoxic hippocampus, and that the phases may be involved in opposing cellular responses.",
