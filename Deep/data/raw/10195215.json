     "AB": "The metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, has a critical role in induction of NMDA-receptor-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity and excitotoxicity. This is likely mediated by a reciprocal positive-feedback interaction between these two glutamate receptor subtypes in which activation of mGluR5 potentiates NMDA receptor currents and NMDA receptor activation potentiates mGluR5-mediated responses. We have investigated the mechanism by which NMDA receptor activation modulates mGluR5 function and find evidence that this response is mediated by activation of a protein phosphatase and a resultant dephosphorylation of protein kinase C phosphorylation sites on mGluR5. This form of neuromodulation may be important in a number of normal and pathological processes that involve activation of the NMDA receptor.",
