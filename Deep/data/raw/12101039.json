     "AB": "The distribution of nestin immunoreactivity was studied in the whole normal adult human forebrains using new anti-human nestin mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antiserum. The nestin immunoreactive cells could be divided into three types according to their morphological characteristics. The first type contained neuron-like nestin immunoreactive cells, distributed in CA1-3 of hippocampus, septum, the nucleus of diagonal band, amygdala and basal nucleus of Meynert. The second type contained astrocyte-like cells, distributed in the subependymal zone and subgranular layer of dentate gyrus. The third type of cells had smaller cell bodies and fewer processes, also distributed in the subependymal zone and subgranular layer of dentate gyrus. Double immunohistochemical staining showed that the nestin positive, neuron-like cells in the nucleus of diagonal band and hippocampus also expressed NSE. However, the astrocyte-like nestin immunoreactive cells of the subependymal zone and subgranular layer of dentate gyrus were not double labeled with GFAP. Although some nestin immunoreactive fibers were distributed in the infundibulum, no nestin-immunoreactive cells were detected in the cortex. These data indicate that nestin exist in the adult human brain outside of the subependymal zone and dentate gyrus and also implies that nestin-immunoreactive cells may play a role in the modulation of basal forebrain function.",
