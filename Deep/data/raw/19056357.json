     "AB": "The permanent occlusion of common carotid arteries (2VO) causes a significant reduction of cerebral blood flow (hypoperfusion) in rats and constitutes a well established experimental model to investigate neuronal damage and cognitive impairment that occurs in human ageing and Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we evaluated two astroglial proteins--S100B and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)--in cerebral cortex and hippocampus tissue, glutamate uptake and glutamine synthetase activity in hippocampus tissue, as well as S100B in cerebrospinal fluid. Cognition, as assessed by reference and working spatial memory protocols, was also investigated. Adult male Wistar rats were submitted to 10 weeks of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion by the 2VO method. A significant increase of S100B and GFAP in hippocampus tissue was observed, as well a significant decrease in glutamate uptake. Interestingly, we observed a decrease in S100B in cerebrospinal fluid. As for the cognitive outcome, there was an impairment of both reference and working spatial memory in the water maze; positive correlation between cognitive impairment and glutamate uptake decrease was evidenced in hypoperfused rats. These data support the hypothesis that astrocytes play a crucial role in the mechanisms of experimental neurodegeneration and that hippocampal pathology arising after chronic hypoperfusion gives rise to memory deficits.",
