     "AB": "LP54 is an RNA-binding protein involved in localization of maternal messengers in sea urchin egg and embryos. Using a polyclonal antibody directed against Paracentrotus lividus LP54 we detected a 66-kDa cross-reacting antigen in undifferentiated and differentiated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. After treatment of undifferentiated cells with detergent, the 66-kDa antigen was found to be enriched in the cytoskeletal fraction. By Western blot the expression of this antigen was also analyzed in regions of the CNS and in tissues of the adult rat and its exclusive presence in the hippocampus and thalamus was revealed. The immunoreactivity with P. lividus antibody against LP54 in hippocampal lysate was also confirmed throughout anti-LP54 immunoaffinity column and competition experiments. The results indicates that a related protein to the sea urchin LP54 is evolutionary conserved in mammalian CNS.",
