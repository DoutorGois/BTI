This study tested the hypothesis that this effect results from damage to fibers of passage by observing the effects of transections of septohippocampal and septohypothalamic connections on growth. We attempted to identify these fibers further by (a) measuring spectrofluorometrically changes in the monoamine concentrations in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, corpus striatum, and diencephalon, (b) staining the degenerating axons after septal lesions and the two cuts, and (c) examining the correspondence between such damage and the acceleration of growth. Both knife cuts accelerated somatic growth and were associated (as well as septal lesions) with significant depletions of serotonin (-27 to -57%) and norepinephrine (-27 to -60%) in the hippocampus, with less consistent depletions of these monoamines in the cerebral cortex, and with no changes in regional dopamine content. All three procedures were associated with degeneration in the hippocampal formation and its fiber systems. Thus, fibers interconnecting hippocampus and brainstem, and passing through septum, exert tonic suppression over somatic growth in adult hamsters.",
