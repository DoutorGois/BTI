     "AB": "The authors demonstrate the results of experimental psychological examination of memory in 57 patients with epilepsy in psychomotor temporal seizures. It was possible to show that in such cases there was a total decline of short-time memory. In bilateral foci and a long-term development of the disease there was a formation of an amnestic syndrome. The most distinct changes were seen in a delayed reproduction. In an electrostimulation of the structures of the temporal lobe by means of implanted electrodes the experiments displayed an intactness of direct reproduction during a stimulation of the neocortex, a moderate decrease in a stimulation of the hypocampus and a grave -- when stimulating the amygdalar complex.",
