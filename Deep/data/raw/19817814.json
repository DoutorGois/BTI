     "AB": "The effect of continuous electrical stimulation of the hippocampus bilaterally on seizures and memory was assessed in two subjects with seizures from both mesial temporal lobes who were not candidates for resective epilepsy surgery. A double blind, randomized, controlled, cross-over trial design was utilized. Two electrodes with four contacts each were implanted along the axis of the hippocampus bilaterally. Simultaneous stimulation of all electrodes contacts was either on or off during each 3-month interval. Seizure frequency decreased by 33% in the two patients during stimulation and remained lower by 25% for the 3 months after stimulation was turned off before returning to baseline (p < 0.01). No consistent change in objective or subjective measures of memory occurred. No other adverse effects occurred. Seizure frequency is reduced both during and for a period after bilateral hippocampal stimulation, but the overall impact in this study is not as robust as has been previously reported.",
