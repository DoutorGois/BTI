     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Senile plaques, consisting of beta-amyloid, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of tau protein, are representative pathological hallmarks of AD. It is believed that the accumulation of NFTs precedes the onset of clinical symptoms of AD and correlates with the progression of memory dysfunction. Thus, the use of noninvasive detection techniques including radiolabeled probes and positron emission tomography (PET) will facilitate early diagnosis or staging of AD. In this study, we synthesized and evaluated novel hydroxylated 2-arylquinoline derivatives as tau imaging PET probes. The binding affinities of compounds for tau were evaluated by fluorescent staining of the AD hippocampal section and a competitive binding assay using [(18) F]THK-523. THK-951 showed high binding affinity for tau pathology in an AD brain section and K18Delta280K fibrils (Ki = 20.7 nM); thus, we radiosynthesized a (11) C-labeled THK-951 and further studied its potential as a tau PET probe. The [(11) C]THK-951 demonstrated excellent kinetics in a normal mouse brain (3.23% ID/g at 2 min postinjection and 0.15% ID/g at 30 min postinjection) and showed the labeling of NFTs in an AD brain section by autoradiography assay. These findings indicate the availability of [(11) C]THK-951 for in vivo PET imaging of tau pathology in AD.",
