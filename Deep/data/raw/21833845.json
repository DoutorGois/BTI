     "AB": "This study aims to determine the expression of Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) following hypoxia in neonatal rats and explore how it may increase susceptibility to epilepsy later in life. A modified model of neonatal hypoxia-induced epileptic susceptibility was simulated by 17 min of hypoxia (5% O(2) and 95% N(2)) in postnatal day (P) 10 rats. Hippocampal glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and parvalbumin (PV) during the development with or without hypoxia were examined using immunohistochemistry. No detectable neuronal loss was observed in the hippocampus either immediately or 14 days after hypoxia. During the development GAD- and PV-immunoreactivity increased substantially during P 11-13 and reached mature expression in the control rats, and decreased significantly at different time points except for a transient increase during P 11-13 in the hypoxic groups. Our study indicates that downregulation of hippocampal GABA after hypoxia-induced seizures in neonatal rats may contribute to higher epileptic susceptibility in later life.",
