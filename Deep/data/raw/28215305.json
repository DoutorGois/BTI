     "AB": "Among the adaptations observed following drugs of abuse consumption, BDNF levels are widely altered in both brain and periphery. In this chapter, we first reviewed these adaptations in preclinical studies, in both juveniles and adult animals. A particular focus was made on protracted withdrawal as incubation is often associated with an increase in central BDNF levels. Then, we reported mixed results regarding the role of BDNF in drug-seeking behavior in animals as BDNF can either enhance reinstatement or have protective properties. Finally, we reviewed recent clinical studies that provide insight into the potential of BDNF to be a good biomarker of vulnerability to relapse.",
