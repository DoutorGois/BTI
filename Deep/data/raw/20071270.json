     "AB": "To create a wireless neural recording system that can benefit from the continuous advancements being made in embedded microcontroller and communications technologies, an embedded-system-based architecture for wireless neural recording has been designed, fabricated, and tested. The system consists of commercial-off-the-shelf wireless-enabled processor modules (motes) for communicating the neural signals, and a back-end database server and client application for archiving and browsing the neural signals. A neural-signal-acquisition application has been developed to enable the mote to either acquire neural signals at a rate of 4000 12-bit samples per second, or detect and transmit spike heights and widths sampled at a rate of 16670 12-bit samples per second on a single channel. The motes acquire neural signals via a custom low-noise neural-signal amplifier with adjustable gain and high-pass corner frequency that has been designed, and fabricated in a 1.5-microm CMOS process. In addition to browsing acquired neural data, the client application enables the user to remotely toggle modes of operation (real-time or spike-only), as well as amplifier gain and high-pass corner frequency.",
