     "AB": "Safflower yellow (SY), one of traditional Chinese medicine extracted from safflower, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects on animal models of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's diseases (AD), by inhibiting oxidative injury, neuronal apoptosis and tau hyperphosphorylation. In this study, we investigated whether safflower yellow (SY) can improve cognitive function, decrease Amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation and overactivation of astrocytes in AD mouse model. We found that SY treatment significantly ameliorated the learning and memory deficits of APP/PS1 mice. By hematoxylin-eosin staining, we found that the neuronal loss and death in APP/PS1 mice was decreased by SY treatment. Immunohistochemical staining showed that SY treatment dramatically down-regulated Abeta1-42 deposition and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) level in APP/PS1 mice. Biochemical analysis also showed that SY treatment reduced soluble and insoluble Abeta1-42 level in the cortex and soluble Abeta1-42 level in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, we found that SY treatment decreased the expression of proteins related to generation of Abeta, and markedly increased expression of enzymes associated with clearance of Abeta in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. These results indicate that the SY can serve as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD.",
