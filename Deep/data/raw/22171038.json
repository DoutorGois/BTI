     "AB": "The amplitude and time course of stimulus-evoked second messenger signals carried by intracellular changes in free calcium ([Ca](free)) depend on the total influx of Ca(2+), the fraction bound to endogenous buffer and the rate of extrusion. Estimates of the values of these three parameters in proximal dendrites of 15 mouse alpha retinal ganglion cells were made using the \"added buffer\" method and found to vary greatly from one experiment to the next. The variations in the measured parameters were strongly correlated across the sample of cells. This reduced the variability in the amplitude and time course of the dendritic Ca(2+) signal and suggests that the expression of Ca(2+) channels, binding proteins and extrusion mechanisms is homeostatically coordinated to maintain the amplitude and kinetics of the Ca(2+) signal within a physiologically appropriate range.",
