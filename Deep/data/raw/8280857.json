     "AB": "Using quantitative receptor autoradiography, spirodecanone binding was evaluated in the gerbil hippocampus 1 h-1 month after cerebral ischaemia of 10 min. The spirodecanone binding was unaffected in the hippocampus up to 48 h after ischaemia. Thereafter, increased binding was found in the stratum radiatum of hippocampal CA1 sector 7 days and 1 month after ischaemia. Other hippocampal regions showed no significant alterations in the spirodecanone binding. A histological study revealed that the hippocampal CA1 sector was severely damaged 7 days and 1 months after ischaemia. These results demonstrate that spirodecanone binding sites are located on interneurones or glial cells in the hippocampal CA1 sector.",
