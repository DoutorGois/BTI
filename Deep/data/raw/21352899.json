     "AB": "Although tinnitus is an auditory disorder, it is often associated with attentional and emotional problems. Functional neuroimaging studies in humans have revealed that the hippocampus, amygdala and anterior cingulate, areas of the brain involved in emotion, attention and spatial processing, are also involved in auditory memory and tinnitus perception. However, few studies of tinnitus-evoked emotional and cognitive changes have been reported using animal models of tinnitus. In the present study, we investigated whether acoustic trauma that could cause tinnitus would affect attention and impulsivity in rats. Eight male Wistar rats were exposed to unilateral acoustic trauma (110 dB, 16 kHz for 1 h under anaesthesia) and eight rats underwent the same anaesthesia without acoustic trauma. Tinnitus was tested in noise-exposed rats using a frequency-specific shift in a discrimination function with a conditioned lick suppression paradigm. At 4 months after the noise exposure, the rats were tested in a 5-choice serial reaction time task. The behavioural procedure involved training the rats to discriminate a brief visual stimulus presented randomly in one of the five spatial locations and responding by poking its nose through the illuminated hole and collecting a food pellet from the magazine. While all of the animals performed equally well in making correct responses, the animals exposed to acoustic trauma made significantly more premature responses. The results suggest that rats exposed to acoustic trauma and some of which have chronic tinnitus are impaired in impulsive control, but not performance accuracy.",
