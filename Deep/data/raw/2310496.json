     "AB": "The function of nucleus basalis (NB) and medial septal-vertical diagonal band of Broca (MS-VDBB) in a place navigation task requiring reference memory was investigated. Two subclasses of nucleus basalis ibotenic acid-lesioned rats could be identified: a group having both extensive non-specific subcortical damage and severely impaired learning behavior, and a less impaired group with correspondingly less subcortical damage. The depletion of cortical cholinergic enzymes was slightly higher in the group of NB-lesioned rats with extensive subcortical lesions than in the group with smaller lesioned areas. In the hippocampus of both of these NB-lesioned groups, cholinergic innervation remained unchanged. Ibotenic acid lesioning restricted to the MS-VDBB depleted hippocampal cholinergic innervation, but not the innervation of the frontal cortex, and also led to impaired learning behavior. Of all the lesioned rats, the most impaired were the NB-lesioned rats with large non-specific subcortical lesion.",
