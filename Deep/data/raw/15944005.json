     "AB": "The neuropeptide galanin is expressed in the mammalian central nervous system and has been implicated in neurotrophic actions. Central galanin administration induces cognitive deficits in rodents and inhibits the release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus. In addition, a galanin hyperinnervation of the basal forebrain cholinergic cells in Alzheimer's disease patients has been reported. To evaluate the effect of galanin treatment on galanin and muscarinic cholinergic receptor G protein coupling, galanin was administered into the lateral ventricle of rats via an implanted cannula. Galanin or muscarinic receptor functional coupling to G proteins was quantified by galanin or carbachol stimulation of guanosine 5'-(gamma-[35S]thio)triphosphate binding in rat brain slices. Guanosine 5'-(gamma-[35S]thio)triphosphate basal binding in nucleus basalis of Meynert and thalamic nuclei was increased in the vehicle treated group. This effect was reverted by galanin treatment and indicates that the surgery increased receptor functional coupling to G proteins, which is restored by a possible neurotrophic action mediated by galanin. In addition, in galanin administered animals, galanin-stimulated binding was increased in the amygdala but decreased in the diagonal band, whilst binding stimulation mediated by carbachol was found to be increased in the amygdala, thalamic nuclei and diagonal band. These findings indicate that galanin treatment modulates the coupling of galanin and muscarinic cholinergic receptors to G proteins in specific regions of the rat central nervous system.",
