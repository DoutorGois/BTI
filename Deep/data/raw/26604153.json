     "AB": "Beta-cyfluthrin (CYF) is a commonly used synthetic pyrethroid having both agricultural and domestic applications. The present study aimed to evaluate the neurobehavioural effects of beta-cyfluthrin in adult rats administered at doses 25 mg/kg body weight/day and 12.5 mg/kg body weight/day for a period of 30 days. Motor coordination and spatial memory were found to be impaired by beta-cyfluthrin. Levels of dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), epinephrine (EPN), and serotonin (5-HT) decreased in frontal cortex, corpus striatum and hippocampus of treated rats. At the same time, significantly elevated levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) and nor-epinephrine (NE) were measured. Beta-cyfluthrin inhibited the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in all the regions of the brain. Hippocampal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) expression was reduced 3.1 and 4.7 fold by the two doses respectively. Impairment of the antioxidant defense system, evident by decrease in the levels of antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was seen in the treated rats. The neurochemical alterations manifested were more pronounced in the high dose group as the effects persisted even after withdrawal of exposure.",
