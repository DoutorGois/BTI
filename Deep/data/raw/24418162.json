     "AB": "Rosmarinic acid (RA) is an important component of Chinese herbal medicine treatments and has been demonstrated to exert therapeutic effects in mood disorders. The present study was designed to assess the effects of RA on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like symptoms, hippocampal cell proliferation and phosphorylation extracellular regulated protein kinases (pERK1/2) expression. We found that administration of RA (10mg/kg) alleviated PTSD-like symptoms in rats exposed to an enhanced single prolonged stress (ESPS) paradigm and restored hippocampal proliferation and pERK1/2 expression. Interestingly, the effects of RA were inhibited by the blockage of the ERK signaling. These data support the use of RA for treating PTSD and indicate that the ERK1/2 signaling cascade may play a critical role in the therapeutic efficacy of RA in treating such conditions.",
