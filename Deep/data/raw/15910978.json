     "AB": "Neurogenesis has been demonstrated in the adult mammalian hippocampus by the immunohistochemical identification of cells co-labeled with the neuronal marker NeuN and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker for DNA synthesis. Whether these newly born neurons exhibit a genetic signature similar to that of existing hippocampal cells remains unknown. Recent advances in single cell RNA amplification techniques provide a unique method for profiling the mRNA complement of cells developed during adult neurogenesis. Standard protocols for identifying BrdU-positive cells requires an acid denaturation step that may preclude the amplification of cellular RNA for expression analysis. We first tested whether the BrdU reaction product was visible in monkey hippocampal tissue following treatment with dilutions of HCl (2-0.2 M) or citric acid (1.0-0.1 M). BrdU-labeled cells were visible only in tissue sections treated with 2 M HCl. RNA amplification was not compromised in cells dual-labeled for BrdU and NeuN using the 2 M HCl acid denaturation step. These cells express mRNAs encoding a wide variety of functional protein subclasses including glutamate receptors. The present study demonstrates for the first time that BrdU immunohistochemisty is compatable with gene array technology in the primate hippocampus to evaluate subclasses of genes in newborn neurons.",
