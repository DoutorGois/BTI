     "AB": "We examined the amounts of several adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoforms and of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) in alcoholic and control brains. Immunoreactivity of type I AC was significantly increased in alcoholic nucleus accumbens and corpus amygdaloideum. Immunoreactivity of type VIII AC was also increased in alcoholic corpus amygdaloideum and hippocampus. CREB immunoreactivities were unchanged. These findings indicate that the brain-region specific increase of Ca(2+)-sensitive AC may contribute to the pathophysiology of alcoholism.",
