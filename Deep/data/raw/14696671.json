     "AB": "The present study investigated whether Shenqi-wan possesses a protective effect against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis of the hippocampal cell line HiB5. Through morphological and biochemical analyses, it was demonstrated that HiB5 cells treated with H2O2 exhibited several apoptotic features, while cells pre-treated with Shenqi-wan prior to H2O2 exposure showed a decrease in the occurrence of apoptosis. In addition, a patch clamp study revealed that Shenqi-wan inhibited profoundly N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor-activated ion current in acutely dissociated hippocampal CA1 neurons. These results suggest that Shenqi-wan may exert its protective effect against H2O2-induced apoptosis via inhibition of NMDA receptors in hippocampal neuronal cells.",
