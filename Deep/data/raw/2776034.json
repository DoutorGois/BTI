     "AB": "The entorhinal cortex gives rise to a dense projection to the outer two-thirds of the dentate molecular layer. The main target neurons are the granule cells. This study demonstrates that entorhinal fibers labeled by anterograde degeneration also terminate on parvalbumin-containing non-granule cells in the rat fascia dentata. Since the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin was recently found coexistent with gamma-aminobutyric acid in inhibitory hippocampal neurons, the described connection provides evidence for a role of entorhinal fibers in feed-forward inhibition of the granule cells.",
