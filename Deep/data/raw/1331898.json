     "AB": "The effects of dibutyryl cyclic AMP were studied with the combined EEG-intracerebral microdialysis technique in the hippocampus of freely behaving rats. It was found that intrahippocampal microdialysis with this drug produced epileptiform EEG events associated with limbic type behavioral seizures. The dibutyryl cyclic AMP-induced seizures developed with a long latency, and persisted for a prolonged period even after the removal of the drug from the microdialysis fluid. Similar EEG or behavioral manifestations did not occur during intrahippocampal microdialysis with artificial cerebrospinal fluid or ATP solutions. These data suggest that in the hippocampus, in vivo, the cyclic AMP second messenger system may be involved in potentially epileptogenic excitatory processes.",
