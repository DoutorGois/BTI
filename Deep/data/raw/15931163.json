     "AB": "Hypoperfusion after traumatic brain injury may exacerbate damage. Adenosine, a vasodilator, regulates cerebral blood flow (CBF). Treatment with adenosine receptor agonists has shown benefit in experimental CNS trauma; however, their effects on CBF after injury remain undefined. We used magnetic resonance imaging to assess CBF in uninjured rats both early and at 24 h after intrahippocampal administration of either the nonselective adenosine receptor agonist 2-chloroadenosine (2-CA, 12 nmol) or the A(2A)-receptor agonist 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)-phenethylamino-5'-N-ethylcarbox-amidoadenosine (CGS 21680, 6 nmol). We also assessed the effects of these agents on cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglu). We then assessed the effect of 2-CA on CBF at 3.5 to 5 h after controlled cortical impact (CCI). Injection of 2-CA into uninjured rat brain produced marked increases in CBF in ipsilateral hippocampus and cortex versus vehicle (P<0.05); CBF increases persisted even at 24 h. Measurement of hippocampal levels of 2-CA showed persistent increases to 24 h. CGS 21680 produced even more marked global increases in CBF than seen with 2-CA (2-6-fold versus vehicle, P<0.05 in 10/12 regions of interest (ROIs)). Neither agonist altered CMRglu versus vehicle. After CCI, 2-CA increased CBF in ipsilateral hippocampal and hemispheric ROIs (P<0.05 versus vehicle), but the response was attenuated at severe injury levels. We report marked increases in CBF after injection of adenosine receptor agonists into uninjured rat brain despite unaltered CMRglu. 2-Chloroadenosine produced enduring increases in CBF in uninjured brain and attenuated posttraumatic hypoperfusion. Future studies of adenosine-related therapies in CNS injury should address the role of CBF.",
