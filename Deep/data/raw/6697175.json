     "AB": "Rapid and complete inhibition of monoamine oxidase by pargyline produced linear increases in the content of the histamine metabolite, tele-methylhistamine (t-MH), in 9 regions of rat brain 2 and 4 h after drug administration. The treatment had little or no effect on the histamine content of these regions. As histamine methylation is the major metabolic pathway of histamine in brain, the rate of increase in brain t-MH content after complete inhibition of its metabolism provides an estimate of histamine turnover. Histamine turnover rates varied over 46-fold among regions, from cerebellum (0.029 nmol/g . h) to hypothalamus (1.33 nmol/g . h), similar to those reported for norepinephrine and serotonin. Turnover rates were highly correlated with control t-MH levels (r = 0.97) and control histamine levels (r = 0.84). Rate constants were highest in the caudate nucleus and frontal cortex, equivalent to a half-life of about 11 min in these regions. While hypothalamic histamine had the highest turnover rate, the rate constant for histamine in this region was among the lowest in brain, perhaps consistent with the presence of histaminergic cell bodies. Histamine turnover rates may be indicative of the activity of histamine-synthesizing neurons, and their determination will facilitate understanding of histamine in brain.",
