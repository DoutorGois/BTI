     "AB": "In the present study, glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists were administered by retrograde microdialysis into either the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band (MS/vDB), or hippocampus, and the output of acetylcholine (ACh) was measured in the hippocampus by using intracerebral microdialysis. Perfusion with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) in the MS/vDB caused an incrase in ACh output in the hippocampus. This increase was completely blocked by coadministration of their respective antagonists D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). Perfusion in the MS/vDB with kainic acid also caused an increase in ACh output, but coadministration of CNQX attenuated the increase only partially. Perfusion with D-AP5 and CNQX alone in the septal probe did not affect ACh output from the hippocampus. In contrast to the results of septal administration of NMDA and AMPA, local perfusion with the same drugs in the hippocampus caused a decrease in ACh output. Whereas the results of septal administration of drugs indicate that septal cholinergic neurons probably receive excitatory glutamatergic innervation, the decrease in ACh output caused by administration of NMDA and AMPA in the hippocampus is poorly understood.",
