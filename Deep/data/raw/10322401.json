Hippocampal neurons show both structural and functional plasticity, and individual differences in hippocampal function are shaped by early life experiences. For human brain aging, there are new non-invasive imaging tools to relate to the animal models, and these can help to assess the vulnerability of the aging hippocampus in relation to stress and Alzheimer's disease.",
