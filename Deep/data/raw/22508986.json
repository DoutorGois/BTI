     "AB": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase 5 (MK5) deficiency is associated with reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) (mitogen-activated protein kinase 6) levels, hence we utilized the MK5 knockout mouse model to analyze the physiological functions of the ERK3/MK5 signaling module. MK5-deficient mice displayed impaired dendritic spine formation in mouse hippocampal neurons in vivo. We performed large-scale interaction screens to understand the neuronal functions of the ERK3/MK5 pathway and identified septin7 (Sept7) as a novel interacting partner of ERK3. ERK3/MK5/Sept7 form a ternary complex, which can phosphorylate the Sept7 regulators Binders of Rho GTPases (Borgs). In addition, the brain-specific nucleotide exchange factor kalirin-7 (Kal7) was identified as an MK5 interaction partner and substrate protein. In transfected primary neurons, Sept7-dependent dendrite development and spine formation are stimulated by the ERK3/MK5 module. Thus, the regulation of neuronal morphogenesis is proposed as the first physiological function of the ERK3/MK5 signaling module.",
