     "AB": "A microbore liquid chromatographic assay with dual electrochemical detection is described for the determination of serotonin and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in rat brain dialysates. The concentration of serotonin in these samples is usually in the low nanomolar range (fmol per 20 microliters range). To optimize separation and detection, several adaptations were made to the system with respect to the injection valve, flow-rate of the pump, connections between injector, column and detector, and cell volume of the detector. These aspects are discussed, as well as the procedure developed for optimal peak identification of serotonin and correct estimation of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. The assay allows the measurement of basal serotonin release without the use of a re-uptake inhibitor added to the perfusion fluid.",
