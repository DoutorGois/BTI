     "AB": "myo-Inositol has been found to be clinically effective in depression, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and panic disorder when given chronically per os. The present study examined the effects of chronic dietary inositol in rats on locomotor behaviour. Regional brain levels of inositol were analyzed by gas chromatography. Chronic dietary inositol significantly enhanced locomotion and rearing in rats and elevated inositol levels by 36% in the cortex and 27% in hippocampus. No differences in inositol levels were found in the striatum or cerebellum. The stimulatory effects of inositol may be related to its effects as an atypical antidepressant in depressed patients.",
