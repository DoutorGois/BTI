     "AB": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) was shown to produce a long-lasting potentiation of synaptic efficacy in dentate gyrus neurons of the rat hippocampus in vivo. This potentiation was shown to share some similarities with tetanization-induced long-term potentiation (LTP). In the present study, we further examined the mechanism underlying CRF-induced long-lasting potentiation in rat hippocampus in vivo. Results indicated that the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin-D, at a concentration that did not change basal synaptic transmission alone (5 microgram), significantly decreased CRF-induced potentiation. Similarly, the protein synthesis inhibitor emetine, at a concentration that did not affect hippocampal synaptic transmission alone (5 microgram), also markedly inhibited CRF-induced potentiation. These results suggest that like the late phase of LTP, CRF-induced long-lasting potentiation also critically depend on protein synthesis. Further, prior maximum excitation of dentate gyrus neurons with tetanization occluded further potentiation of these neurons produced by CRF and vise versa. Moreover, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that CRF mRNA level in the dentate gyrus was significantly increased 1 h after LTP recording. Together with our previous findings that CRF antagonist dose-dependently diminishes tetanization-induced LTP, these results suggest that both CRF-induced long-lasting potentiation and tetanization-induced LTP require protein synthesis and that CRF neurons are possibly involved in the neural circuits underlying LTP.",
