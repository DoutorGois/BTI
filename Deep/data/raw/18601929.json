     "AB": "In the present study we have examined the influence of intracerebroventricullary administered CRF, and a non-selective CRF receptor antagonist, alpha-helical CRF((9-41)), on rat conditioned fear response, serum corticosterone, c-Fos and CRF expression, and concentration of amino acids (in vitro), in several brain structures. Pretreatment of rats with CRF in a dose of 1 microg/rat, enhanced rat-freezing response, and further increased conditioned fear-elevated concentration of serum corticosterone. Moreover, exogenous CRF increased aversive context-induced expression of c-Fos in the parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (pPVN), CA1 area of the hippocampus, and M1 area of the frontal cortex. A different pattern of behavioral and biochemical changes was present after pre-test administration of alpha-helical CRF((9-41)) (10 microg/rat): a decrease in rat fear response and serum corticosterone concentration; an attenuation of fear-induced c-Fos expression in the dentate gyrus, CA1, Cg1, Cg2, and M1 areas of the frontal cortex; a complete reversal of the rise in the number of CRF immunoreactive complexes in the M2 cortical area, induced by conditioned fear. Moreover, alpha-helical CRF((9-41)) increased the concentration of GABA in the amygdala of fear-conditioned rats. Altogether, the present data confirm and extend previous data on the integrative role of CRF in the central, anxiety-related, behavioral and biochemical processes. The obtained results underline also the role of frontal cortex and amygdala in mediating the effects of CRF on the conditioned fear response.",
