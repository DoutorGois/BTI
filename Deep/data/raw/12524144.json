     "AB": "We investigated antioxidative activity and the effect of indomethacin, an agent that inhibits cyclooxygenase, on extracellular glutamate and cerebral blood flow in cerebral ischemia in gerbils. Pre-ischemic administration of indomethacin (5 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly rescued hippocampal CA1 neurons (9+/-6 cells/mm in the ischemia, 87+/-43 cells/mm in the indomethacin group, P<0.001). DNA fragmentation induced by ischemia was also examined using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method and indomethacin reduced TUNEL positive cells (140+/-21 in the ischemia, 99+/-31 in the indomethacin group, P<0.01). In addition, indomethacin attenuated the increase in hippocampal blood flow during reperfusion, but not increased extracellular glutamate by ischemia. Eight-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), a highly sensitive marker of DNA oxidation, was measured 90 min following ischemia using high-pressure liquid chromatography. Indomethacin significantly decreased the level of ischemia-induced 8-OH-dG in the hippocampus (P<0.05). These results suggest that indomethacin may protect neurons by attenuating oxidative stress and reperfusion injury in ischemic insult.",
