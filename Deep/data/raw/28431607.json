     "AB": "Sigma-1 receptor (sigma1r) activation could attenuate the learning and memory deficits in the AD model, ischemia model and others. In our previous study, the activation of sigma1r increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), possibly through the NR2A-induced pathway, and sigma1r agonists might function as neuroprotectant agents in vascular dementia. Here, we used sigma1r knockout mice to confirm the role of sigma1r. Furthermore, an antagonist of NR2A was first used to investigate whether the NR2A-induced pathway is the necessary link between sigma1r and BDNF. The operation of brain ischemia/reperfusion was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 20min in C57BL/6 and sigma1r knockout mice as the ischemic group. A sigma1r agonist, PRE084 (1mg/kg, i.p.), and NR2A antagonist, PEAQX (10mg/kg, i.p.), were administered once daily throughout the experiment. Behavioral tests were performed starting on day 8. On day 22 after brain ischemia/reperfusion, mice were sacrificed and brains were immediately collected and the injured and the hippocampus was isolated and stored at -80 degrees C for western blot analysis. After ischemic operation, contrast with the sigma1r knockout mice, PRE084 significantly ameliorated learning and memory impairments in the behavioral evaluation, and prevented the protein decline of BDNF, NR2A, CaMKIV and TORC1 expression in wild-type mice. However, the effects of PRE084 on CaMKIV-TORC1-CREB and BDNF, even for learning and memory impairment, were antagonized by the co-administration of PEAQX, an antagonist of NR2A. The activation of sigma1r improves the impairment of learning and memory in the ischemia/reperfusion model, and the expression of BDNF, which may have been achieved through the NR2A-CaMKIV-TORC1 pathway.",
