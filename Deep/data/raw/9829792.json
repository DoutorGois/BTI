     "AB": "In 2 experiments, rats with electrolytic lesions of the dorsal hippocampus and sham-operated control subjects were given injections of lithium chloride after exposure to a distinctive context. This procedure establishes a context-illness association in intact subjects. In Experiment 1, the strength of the context aversion was assessed by measuring the subjects' willingness to consume a novel flavor in the context. It was found that lesioned subjects showed less suppression of consumption than controls. Experiment 2 tested the ability of the context to block subsequent flavor-aversion learning and revealed less effective blocking in lesioned rats. These results are consistent with the view that hippocampal lesions retard context conditioning; unlike previous work that has made use of conditioned freezing as the measure of context conditioning, the present results are not explicable in terms of lesion-induced changes in general activity.",
