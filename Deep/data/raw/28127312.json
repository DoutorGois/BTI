     "AB": "Alterations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) function and abnormalities in its interactions with other brain areas (i.e., the hippocampus) have been related to Alzheimer Disease (AD). Considering that these malfunctions correlate with the increase in the brain's amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide production, here we looked for a causal relationship between these pathognomonic signs of AD. Thus, we tested whether or not Abeta affects the activity of the PFC network and the activation of this cortex by hippocampal input stimulation in vitro. We found that Abeta application to brain slices inhibits PFC spontaneous network activity as well as PFC activation, both at the population and at the single-cell level, when the hippocampal input is stimulated. Our data suggest that Abeta can contribute to AD by disrupting PFC activity and its long-range interactions throughout the brain.",
