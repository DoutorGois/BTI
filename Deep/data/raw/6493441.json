     "AB": "The effect of intermittent normobaric hypoxia and of biological pyrimidines (uridine and cytidine) on the specific activities of some enzymes related to cerebral energy metabolism were studied. Measurement were carried out on the following: homogenate in toto; purified mitochondrial fraction; crude synaptosomal fraction, in different areas of rat brain: cerebral cortex, hippocampus, corpus striatum, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata. Intermittent normobaric hypoxia (12 hours daily for 5 days) caused modifications of the enzyme activities in the homogenate in toto (decrease of hexokinase in cerebellum; increase of pyruvate kinase in medulla oblongata), in the purified mitochondrial fraction (increase of succinate dehydrogenase in the corpus striatum) and in the crude synaptosomal fraction (decrease of cytochrome oxidase activity in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum; decrease of malate dehydrogenase in hippocampus and cerebellum; decrease of lactate dehydrogenase in cerebellum). Daily treatment with cytidine or uridine altered some enzyme activities either affected or unaffected by intermittent hypoxia.",
