     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: We investigate possible differences in neural correlates of empathy processing between abstinent methamphetamine (MA) abusers and healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: Nineteen abstinent MA abusers (mean age of 36.06 years, range 31-52 years) and 19 healthy subjects (mean age of 37.05 years, range 33-42 years) participated in this study. A visual fMRI activation paradigm was used, comprising a series of cartoons, each depicting a short story. There were two categories of stories: empathy (Empathy) and Physical causality (Physical). fMRI images were acquired using a 3.0 T whole-body scanner. All fMRI data were analyzed using MATLAB v. 7.2 and SPM5. RESULTS: Both MA subjects and controls exhibited activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Despite this similarity in activation patterns, we found that the two groups differed in the activation of several cortical regions associated with the processing of empathy information. Hypoactivations of the orbitofrontal cortex, temporal poles, and hippocampus in MA abusers relative to healthy subjects suggests that the ability of empathic response could be compromised in abstinent MA abusers (p < 0.05, corrected for a small volume). CONCLUSIONS: Functional impairments in the empathic neural network caused by MA may contribute to the misunderstanding of others and to the erosion of social interactions in MA abusers.",
