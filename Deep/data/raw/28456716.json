     "AB": "Exercise has been proven to promote learning and memory, and is closely related to increased adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In our study, the beta subunit of Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3beta) can be significantly regulated by exercise, and the modulation of GSK3beta activity can enhance adult neurogenesis and memory. To explore the mechanism by which exercise can improve cognitive function and adult neurogenesis, and the role GSK3beta plays in this process, we established a mouse model of voluntary exercise to examine the expression and activity of GSK3beta, and its associated signaling pathways, in the hippocampus dentate gyrus. The results showed an obvious increase in adult neurogenesis and cognitive functions, and the up-regulation of GSK3beta, after exercise. The activity of the insulin pathway, which negatively regulates GSK3beta, was also increased. Moreover, our results showed that the dopamine D1 receptor (DARP D1) pathway and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were also activated, which indicates a relationship between GSK3beta and neurogenesis. Overall, our findings demonstrated that voluntary exercise promotes cognition and neurogenesis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus by the regulation of GSK3beta expression and activity, which may be implemented through the DARP D1 receptor-signaling pathway.",
