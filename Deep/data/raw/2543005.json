     "AB": "To test the hypothesis that the increase in locomotor activity and the diversification of stimulus sampling observed during intrahippocampal microinfusions of norepinephrine are mediated by beta adrenergic receptors, rats were infused with either the beta agonist isoproterenol or the alpha-1 agonist methoxamine while being tested in a Behavioral Pattern Monitor. The behavioral profile induced by isoproterenol was qualitatively similar to that observed previously with norepinephrine. Methoxamine had no significant effects. The ability of isoproterenol to mimic the norepinephrine-induced blockade of the hyperactivity associated with intrahippocampal microinfusions of the cholinergic agonist carbachol was also tested. Carbachol produced hyperactivity which was attenuated by the coinfusion of isoproterenol. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that increases in diversive exploration and stimulus sampling induced by intrahippocampal norepinephrine are due to the activation of beta adrenergic receptors within the dentate gyrus.",
