     "AB": "AIM: A novel coumarin derivative 7-hydroxy-5-methoxy-4-methyl-3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-coumarin (IMM-H004) has shown anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. In this study we investigated the effects of IMM-H004 on spatial memory in rats treated with okadaic acid (OKA), which was used to imitate Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like symptoms. METHODS: SD rats were administered IMM-H004 (8 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), ig) or donepezil (positive control, 1 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), ig) for 25 d. On d 8 and 9, OKA (200 ng) was microinjected into the right ventricle. Morris water maze test was used to evaluate the spatial memory impairments. Tau and beta-amyloid (Abeta) pathology in the hippocampus was detected using Western blot and immunohistochemistry. TUNEL staining was used to detect cell apoptosis. RESULTS: OKA-treated rats showed significant impairments of spatial memory in Morris water maze test, which were largely reversed by administration of IMM-H004 or donepezil. Furthermore, OKA-treated rats exhibited significantly increased phosphorylation of tau, deposits of Abeta protein and cell apoptosis in the hippocampus, which were also reversed by administration of IMM-H004 or donepezil. CONCLUSION: Administration of IMM-H004 or donepezil protects rats against OKA-induced spatial memory impairments via attenuating tau or Abeta pathology. Thus, IMM-H004 may be developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.",
