     "AB": "Neurons in the central nervous system establish, via their axons and dendrites, an extended network that allows synaptic transmission. During developmental maturation and process outgrowth, membrane turnover is necessary for the enlargement and subsequent growth of axons and dendrites from the perikarya to the target cell (constitutive exocytosis/endocytosis). After targeting and synapse formation, small synaptic vesicles are needed for the quantal release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic terminal with subsequent recycling by regulated exocytosis/endocytosis. An investigation of the onset of the appearance of mRNA and protein in dissociated cultures of neurons from mouse hippocampus or from chick retina has shown an early abundance of proteins involved in exocytosis, such as syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin 1, whereas dynamin 1, a protein necessary for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, can be detected only after neurons have established contacts with neighboring cells. The results reveal that constitutive membrane incorporation and regulated synaptic transmitter release is mediated by the same neuronal proteins. Moreover, the data exclude that dynamin 1 takes part in constitutive recycling before synapse formation, but dynamin 2 is present at this stage. Thus, dynamin 2 may be the constitutive counterpart of dynamin 1 in growing neurons. Synapse establishment is linked to an upregulation of dynamin 1 and thereby represents the beginning of the regulated recycling of membranes back into the presynaptic terminal.",
