     "AB": "Rodent female reproductive behavior is facilitated by the genomic targets of estrogen (E) and progesterone (P) in neuroendocrine regions of the brain. Using the differential display-PCR technique to identify these targets we discovered a novel hormone-sensitive mRNA in the female rat brain that is substantially reduced in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) after 3 h of P treatment, following 24 h of E priming. Northern blots show that it is a single transcript of approximately 1.7 kb. The sequence of the corresponding full-length cDNA indicates that this gene is the rat homolog of mouse SCAMP-4, the fourth member identified in a family of proteins known as secretory carrier membrane proteins (SCAMPs). In situ hybridization studies show that SCAMP-4 mRNA is relatively low throughout the rat forebrain, with the highest levels observed in the VMH, habenula and hippocampus. The SCAMP-4 message is also less abundant in the habenula and VMH during proestrus, when circulating levels of E and P are at their peak, than during diestrus-1 when circulating hormone levels are low. Amino acid sequence analysis indicates that SCAMP-4 lacks the putative calcium binding and leucine zipper structures, as well as protein-protein interacting NPF domains common among most SCAMP family members, but is the only member identified to date to contain a putative protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site. Fluorescent microscopy of cells transfected with a SCAMP-4/GFP fusion construct reveals distinct fluorescence in subcellular aggregates that may contain secretory vesicles. In addition to our results in the VMH, the finding of high levels of SCAMP-4 message in the habenula, a brain area rich in mast cells, together with previous reports linking mast cell secretion with courtship behavior also suggest a possible role for SCAMP-4 in reproductive behaviors associated with mast cell activity in the central nervous system (CNS).",
