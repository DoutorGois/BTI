     "AB": "The glycolytic metabolism through the key enzymes, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, have been studied in the brain areas: anterior cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, septum and hippocampus in adult rats with pharmacologically induced hyperthyroidism. The oxidative metabolism of glucose is accelerated in most brain areas by treatment with high doses of T3, as is shown by the increase in HK activity, approaching normality on reducing the dose. This decrease can also by observed in the PFK activity through the effect of assayed doses of thyroxine. The anterior cortex is the only brain area that does not show significant variations of PK activity through the effects of treatment with thyroid hormones. On the other hand, a general inhibition of the glycolytic anaerobic pathway by treatment with T3 was observed.",
