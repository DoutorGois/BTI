     "AB": "In this study we have decided to examine acute interaction of ethanol with some drugs that belong to selective serotonin inhibitor (SSRI) group. Therefore, the influence of sertraline, fluoxetine and citalopram on the effect of ethanol on EEG of rabbits (frontal cortex, hippocampus, MRF) was tested. Sertraline (10mg/kg i.p.), fluoxetine (10mg/kg i.p.) and citalopram (5mg/kg i.p.) were given 30min before ethanol injection in a dose 0.8g/kg i.v. Ethanol caused the increase of the slow frequencies (0.5-4cps) in the recording, as well as a marked decrease of the fastest frequencies (13-30 and 30-45cps). Sertraline, fluoxetine and citalopram (given before ethanol) prevented the increase in the slow frequencies (0.5-4cps) in the recordings from the frontal cortex and hippocampus, which indicates on antagonism inhibitory action of ethanol. These drugs administered together with ethanol may increase its influence on fast frequencies. This effect depends on brain structure and drug.",
