     "AB": "Data accumulated through the past 15 years showed that memory consolidation of one-trial avoidance learning relies on a sequence of molecular events in the CA1 region of the hippocampus that is practically identical to that of long-term potentiation (LTP) in that area. Recent findings have indeed described CA1 LTP concomitant to the consolidation of this and other tasks. However, abundant evidence suggests that, in addition, other molecular events, involving some of the same steps but with different timing and in different sequence in the basolateral amygdala, entorhinal, parietal and cingulate cortex are as important as those of the hippocampus for memory consolidation. Here we review the hippocampal mechanisms involved and the possible interconnections between all these processes. Overall, the findings indicate that memory consolidation of even a task as deceivingly simple as one-trial avoidance relies on hippocampal LTP but also requires the concomitant participation of other brain systems and molecular events. Further, they point to the mechanisms that account for the enhanced consolidation usually seen for emotion-laden memories.",
