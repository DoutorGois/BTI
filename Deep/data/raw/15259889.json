     "AB": "In two recent studies, the hypothesis that recall is more severely impaired than recognition in patients with damage thought to be limited to the hippocampus was tested. Yonelinas et al. (2002) reported findings that appeared to support this hypothesis, whereas Manns, Hopkins, Reed, Kitchener, and Squire (2003) found that recall and recognition were equally impaired. An analysis of the individual subject data from the two studies revealed that the apparent disagreement stemmed from the inclusion of a single outlying recognition score for 1 of the 55 control subjects in Yonelinas et al. (2002). When that outlier was excluded, the studies were in agreement that recognition and recall are substantially and similarly impaired in these patients. Yonelinas et al. (2002) also analyzed remember/know judgments and ROC data in an effort to show that recollection is selectively impaired in patients, but these analyses also raise problems.",
