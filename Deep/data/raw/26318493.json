     "AB": "Understanding the molecular and cellular process specifically regulated during fear memory consolidation and extinction is a critical step toward development of new strategies in the treatment of human fear disorders. Here we used inhibitory component of AP-1 transcription factor, JunB, in order to map brain regions where JunB-dependent transcription is regulated during consolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory. We found that contextual fear memory consolidation induced JunB expression in the medial nucleus and intercalated cells of the amygdala while extinction training induced JunB in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the dorsal hippocampus. JunB upregulation induced by contextual fear memory extinction was absent in alphaCaMKII autophosphorylation-deficient mice which have impaired contextual fear memory extinction. Thus, our data suggest that JunB expression in the medial nucleus and intercalated cells of the amygdala is involved in fear memory consolidation while alphaCaMKII-autophosphorylation-dependent JunB expression in the areas CA1 and CA3 of the dorsal hippocampus regulates fear memory extinction.",
