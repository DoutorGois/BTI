     "AB": "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is decreased in rodent models for stress-related disorders partly through an elevated level of glucocorticoids (GCs). On the other hand, lithium (Li), a mood stabilizer and an inhibitor of GSK-3beta, increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, it remains unclear whether GCs-induced decrease can be recovered by Li or not. Recently we established the culture system of adult rat dentate gyrus-derived neural precursor cell (ADP) and examined GCs and Li actions on ADP proliferation. GCs decreased ADP proliferation and Li recovered it. Both cyclin Dl expression and nuclear beta-catenin are also reciprocally regulated by GCs and Li. In addition, GCs activated GSK-3beta. Therefore, GSK-3beta/beta-catenin pathway may be important in the reciprocal actions of GCs and Li on ADP proliferation. In this manuscript, we review the past literature and our study and summarize what is currently known about the effects of GCs and Li on adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",
