     "AB": "We investigated alterations in the ageing-related parameters: multiple-unit action potentials, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity, glutathione-s-transferase (GST) activity, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, lipid peroxidation and lipofuscin contents in the brain regions cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and thalamus, resulting from the chronic administration of aluminium chloride (AlCl3) in drinking water to rats of 6 and 12 months of age. Aluminium treatment significantly depressed Na(+), K(+)-ATPase, GST and GPx activities, elevated lipid peroxidation and lipofuscin contents, and produced intense epileptiform activity in the electroencephalograms of the studied brain regions together with a concomitant increase in the multiple-unit action potentials (MUA) indicating a vigorous neuronal epileptic hyperactivity. Taken together the aluminium-induced alterations in these parameters are indicative of an accelerated ageing process.",
