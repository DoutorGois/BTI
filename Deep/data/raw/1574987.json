     "AB": "Dapsone, an antileprosy drug, was administered to rats with amygdala (AM)-kindled seizures or hippocampal (HIPP)-kindled seizures to elucidate its anticonvulsive efficacy. Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to kindling stimulations 2 weeks after electrode-implantation. The subjects were tested once a day for 7 successive days after inducing three generalized (stage 5) seizures to study the effects of dapsone. Dapsone had an inhibitory effect on stage 5 seizures at 12.50 mg/kg in the AM-kindled rats and at 6.25 mg/kg and 9.375 mg/kg in the HIPP-kindled rats. Thus, there was a distinct difference in the effective dose for generalized seizures between the AM-kindled rats and the HIPP-kindled rats. The inhibitory action of dapsone on stage 5 seizures may be due mainly to the elevation of the afterdischarge-triggering threshold at the stimulation site of the AM or HIPP. Such inhibitory action appears prominently at serum concentrations of about 13 micrograms/ml in AM-kindled rats and about 6 micrograms/ml in HIPP-kindled rats. The level of 6 micrograms/ml almost equals the therapeutic serum concentration of dapsone used in the treatment of leprosy.",
