     "AB": "Numerous studies in animals and humans have shown that damage to the vestibular system in the inner ear results in spatial memory deficits, presumably because areas of the brain such as the hippocampus require vestibular input to accurately represent the spatial environment. Consistent with this hypothesis, studies in animals have demonstrated that complete bilateral vestibular deafferentation (BVD) causes a disruption of place cell firing as well as theta activity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether BVD in rats affects baseline field potentials (field excitatory postsynaptic potentials and population spikes) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG) of awake freely moving rats up to 43 days post-BVD and of anesthetized rats at 7 months post-BVD. Compared to sham controls, BVD had no significant effect on either baseline field potentials or LTP in either condition. These results suggest that although BVD interferes with the encoding, consolidation, and/or retrieval of spatial memories and the function of place cells, these changes are not related to detectable in vivo decrements in basal synaptic transmission or LTP, at least in the investigated pathways.",
