     "AB": "Electrical stimulation of the nervous system is an attractive possible therapy for intractable epilepsy, but only stimulation of the vagus nerve has been subjected to large, controlled, and completed clinical trials. Controlled trials are in progress for intermittent cycling stimulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus, and for cortical stimulation at a seizure focus, responsive to detection of seizure onset. Anecdotal experience has been gathered with stimulation of cerebellum, centromedian thalamus, subthalamus, caudate, hippocampus, and brainstem. All stimulation of the central nervous system for epilepsy must be considered experimental.",
