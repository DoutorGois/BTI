     "AB": "Low-dose radiosurgery is presently in use as a treatment modality for focal epilepsy, but the mechanisms underlying the associated changes in seizure expression are poorly understood. We investigated whether total and parvalbumin expressing (PV+) neuronal densities within the hippocampus and amygdala are affected by analogous focal irradiation in amygdala-kindled rats. Adult rats were kindled by electrical stimulation through 10 stage 5 seizures. The kindled amygdala was then focally irradiated at 18 or 25 Gy, and generalized seizure thresholds were subsequently monitored for approximately 6 months. Histological and immunohistochemical assays of total and PV+ neuronal densities were performed bilaterally throughout the hippocampus and within the basolateral amygdala. PV+ neuronal densities were unaffected by kindling or irradiation in these regions. Kindling selectively reduced neuronal densities in the dentate granule cell layer, and medial CA3 pyramidal cell layer. Irradiation at 25 Gy, but not at 18 Gy, prevented or reversed this kindling-associated reduction in density.",
