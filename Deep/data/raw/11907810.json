     "AB": "A 65-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for forgetfulness, depression and eccentric behavior that had been first noticed 2 years prior to admission. She showed memory impairment, perseveration and repeated violent actions, but no limb-kinetic apraxia. She died 12 years after the onset of symptoms. At autopsy, the unfixed brain weighed 820 g. Atrophy was circumscribed in the frontal lobe on both sides. The globus pallidus and the caudate nucleus were markedly atrophic and gold yellow in color, and the substantia nigra was strikingly pale. The cortical area showed neuronal loss and status spongiosus of the second and third cortical layers with ballooned neurons. Marked neuronal loss was observed in the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus, Meynert basal nucleus and substantia nigra. With Holzer stain, fibrillary gliosis was found to be severe in the frontal lobe, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, hippocampus, dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus, substantia nigra, pontine tegmentum and inferior olivary nucleus. With Bielschowsky-Hirano stain, neurofibrillary tangles were observed in the cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, pontine nucleus, the inferior olivary nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and, to a lesser extent, the neostriatum. Strikingly numerous argyrophilic and tau-positive threads were present in the cerebral white matter. These neuropathological findings corresponded to corticobasal degeneration, but lesions characteristic of progressive supranuclear palsy were also found. Moreover, widespread iron deposition throughout the central nervous system was the most striking finding of the present case. To our knowledge, such a case has not been reported in the literature to date.",
