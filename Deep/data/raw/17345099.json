     "AB": "The transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily comprises of a group of non-selective cation channels that have been implicated in both receptor and store-operated channel functions. The family of classical TRPs (TRPCs) consists of seven members (TRPC1-7), with TRPC4 possibly playing a role in neuronal signaling. We have examined the distribution pattern of TRPC4 mRNA and protein in the developing and postnatal murine brain by using in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry. Expression of TRPC4 mRNA starts at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) in the developing septal area and cerebellar anlagen. At E16.5, prominent expression is additionally seen in the hippocampal formation and cortical plate. High densities of cells expressing TRPC4 mRNA occur in the adult olfactory bulb and hippocampus, whereas the cortex and septum display lower densities of cells positive for TRPC4 mRNA. Analysis of the adult hippocampal formation has revealed TRPC4 immunoreactivity in hippocampal areas CA1 to CA3 and in the dentate gyrus. Functions consistent with this spatially restricted pattern of expression remain to be revealed.",
