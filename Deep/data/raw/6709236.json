     "AB": "The axons of the septohippocampal pathway reach the hippocampal formation via the fimbria, dorsal fornix and supracallosal striae. Complete lesions of these pathways denervate most of the hippocampal formation but a small, residual innervation occurs via a different ventral route. The cells of origin for this additional route for cholinergic innervation of the hippocampal formation have been identified in the present study with a combined technique using a fluorescent retrograde tracer and acetylcholinesterase histochemistry. These cells were localized to the diagonal band of Broca. In a subsequent experiment it was demonstrated, by destroying these cells unilaterally, that they were responsible to a large extent for the cholinergic compensatory collateral sprouting in the hippocampus that has previously been shown to develop following complete fimbria-fornix transection.",
