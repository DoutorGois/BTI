     "AB": "Recent data indicate that the neurons of the cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) respond to nerve growth factor (NGF) with increased survival under experimental conditions and have NGF receptors which mediate the binding and retrograde transport of NGF from axon terminals to somata. Focal intraparenchymal injections of retrograde tracing agents into neuropil demonstrate that the distribution of axons from cholinergic nuclei to cortex and hippocampus is topographically restricted and largely ipsilateral. Monoclonal antibody 192, a well-characterized antibody which recognizes only the rat NGF receptor, was labelled with 125I and injected into a lateral ventricle of adult rats. Highly specific bilateral transport to numerous neurons of the CBF system was demonstrated by autoradiography. This result directly demonstrates that suitably targeted antibodies can be taken up by specific neuronal populations following intraventricular injection and implies that CBF neurons may be influenced by relatively high molecular weight substances injected into cerebrospinal fluid.",
