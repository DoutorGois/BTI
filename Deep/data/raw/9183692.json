     "AB": "We have recently shown that spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by motor neuron loss, is associated with deletion of a gene that encodes the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP). In the present study, we have examined the distribution of NAIP-like immunoreactivity (NAIP-LI) in the rat central nervous system (CNS) by using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against NAIP. In the forebrain, immunoreactive neurons were detected in the cortex, the hippocampus (pyramidal cells, dentate granule cells, and interneurons), the striatum (cholinergic interneurons), the basal forebrain (ventral pallidum, medial septal nucleus, and diagonal band), the thalamus (lateral and ventral nuclei), the habenula, the globus pallidus, and the entopenduncular nucleus. In the midbrain, NAIP-LI was located primarily within neurons of the red nucleus, the substantia nigra pars compacta, the oculomotor nucleus, and the trochlear nucleus. In the brainstem, neurons containing NAIP-LI were observed in cranial nerve nuclei (trigeminal, facial, vestibular, cochlear, vagus, and hypoglossal nerves) and in relay nuclei (pontine, olivary, lateral reticular, cuneate, gracile nucleus, and locus coeruleus). In the cerebellum, NAIP-LI was found within both Purkinje and nuclear cells (interposed and lateral nuclei). Finally, within the spinal cord, NAIP-LI was detected in Clarke's column and in motor neurons. Taken together, these results indicate that NAIP-LI is distributed broadly in the CNS. However, high levels of NAIP-LI were restricted to those neuronal populations that have been reported to degenerate in SMA. This anatomical correspondence provides additional evidence for NAIP involvement in the neurodegeneration observed in acute SMA.",
