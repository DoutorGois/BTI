     "AB": "Using microfluorometry, effects of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) on the in vitro ischemia-induced intracellular calcium elevation were investigated in gerbil hippocampal slices at 35 degrees C. When slices were superfused with hypoxic and glucose-free medium, the mean latency of the in vitro ischemia-induced calcium elevation was 209 +/- 51 s. The addition of aFGF in medium (25 micrograms/l) delayed the calcium elevation throughout the experiments: the mean latency was 541 +/- 94 s. This retardation in calcium elevation may be indicative of neuroprotective nature of aFGF.",
