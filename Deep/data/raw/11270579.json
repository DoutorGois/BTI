     "AB": "The occupancy of L-type Ca2+ channels by treatment with an oral dose of the dihydropyridine-type Ca2+ antagonist nicardipine (sustained-release formulation) was evaluated in membrane preparations of rat frontal cortex and hippocampus using a radioligand binding assay technique, with [3H]-nicardipine as a ligand. Three hours after nicardipine administration, specific binding was decreased by about 15-20%, both in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. This indicates that oral nicardipine occupied approximately 15-20% of L-type Ca2+ channels. A progressive occupancy of Ca2+ channels was observed between six and 12 h after nicardipine administration. Twelve hours after drug administration, approximately 65-70% of Ca2+ channels were occupied. These findings indicate that oral treatment with 3 mg/kg of nicardipine (sustained-release formulation) occupies L-type Ca2+ channels in rat brain by more than 40% from the 6th to the 24th h after drug administration. This suggests that an oral dose of nicardipine (sustained-release formulation) in duces a significant occupancy of L-type Ca2+ channels in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus for about one day. The possible clinico-therapeutic relevance of this observation is discussed.",
