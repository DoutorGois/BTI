     "AB": "The G alpha subunits of the G(12) family of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), defined by G alpha(12) and G alpha(13), have many cellular functions in common, including stimulation of stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly via the small GTPase RhoA activation. We and others previously showed that G alpha(12) and G alpha(13) mediate neurite retraction in neuronal cell lines, but their roles in primary cultured neurons have not been adequately understood. Here, we found that expression of constitutively active mutants of G alpha(12) or G alpha(13) caused growth cone collapse dependent on Rho-kinase activity in hippocampal neurons. The stimulation of thrombin and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors, which have been thought to selectively couple to G alpha(12) and G alpha(13), respectively, caused growth cone collapse and suppressed axon branching dependent on Rho-kinase activity in hippocampal neurons. Thrombin- and LPA-induced growth cone collapse was suppressed by both single knockdown of G alpha(12) and G alpha(13) with short hairpin RNAs and this suppression was augmented by double knockdown of both G alpha(12) and G alpha(13). These results suggest that thrombin and LPA receptors couple to both G alpha(12) and G alpha(13) for growth cone collapse.",
