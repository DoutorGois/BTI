     "AB": "The present study was performed to determine the effects of the anticholinergic agent scopolamine and the cholinergic agent physostigmine on tonic immobility in rabbits. Recordings of the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from cortex and hippocampus were also made before, during, and after each test session. Scopolamine significantly prolonged the response and produced large amplitude slow wave activity in the EEG of both cortex and hippocampus. Physostigmine significantly shortened the duration of immobility and increased rhythmic slow activity in the frequency range of 5.5-9.1 Hz in the hippocampus while producing a desynchronized cortical rhythm. It is suggested that the cortex and hippocampus play a role in modulating tonic immobility duration by inhibiting the brain-stem structures thought to control this response.",
