     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: In this study, a serial day rapid kindling protocol was used to fully kindle rats in a matter of days. Subsequently, the anticonvulsant profile of a relatively new anti-epileptic drug, topiramate, was evaluated in a cross-over design to further validate this rapid kindling model. METHODS: Rats were kindled during three consecutive days, according to the serial day rapid kindling protocol. Topiramate was tested at a dose of 100mg/kg, i.p., over the next 2 days using a cross-over design. The stability of the kindled state was evaluated in all rats during two retest paradigms. During the drug-testing procedure, rats received a single i.p. injection of either topiramate or verhicle. Starting 1 h later the rats received additional kindling stimulations during which their response was measured. RESULTS: Serial day rapid kindling induced a long lasting and stable fully kindled state that allowed for the anti-epileptic drug screening procedure. Topiramate reduced both the afterdischarge duration and ameliorated seizure semiology in the kindled rats. DISCUSSION: Serial day rapid kindling provided a tool to rapidly kindle rats in 3 days. Using a cross-over design, clear indications on anti-epileptic activity of a given drug can be determined using few laboratory animals.",
