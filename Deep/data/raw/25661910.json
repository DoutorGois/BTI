     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of low- and high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) on the nucleus accumbens (ACC) and the adjacent internal capsule in 3 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under intraoperative conditions. METHODS: After placement of the electrode in the right ACC, the patients underwent an MR scan inside the operating room. BOLD imaging was performed and interpreted using a boxcar paradigm with alternating high-frequency stimulation of the ACC and the internal capsule versus rest. Correlation maps were calculated employing SPM99. RESULTS: During high-frequency stimulation of the right ACC, focal activation could be found in the right striatum, the right frontal lobe and the right hippocampus, whereas low-frequency stimulation was correlated to right insular activation. INTERPRETATION: Intraoperative BOLD-fMRI is feasible during DBS surgery of OCD patients. Our results support the existence of an ipsilateral hemispheric circuit involving the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus and striatum. Intraoperative fMRI may be used to acquire additional information regarding the pathophysiology of OCD that can be used to improve the results of DBS in OCD.",
