     "AB": "An incubation medium was established for the microphotometric demonstration of glutamate dehydrogenase (Gldh) in cryostat sections of the rat hippocampus which served as an exemplary brain region. The final incubation medium consisted of 100 mM L-glutamic acid monosodium salt, 5 mM NAD, 10 mM sodium azide (NaN3), 5 mM ADP, 20 mM sodium chloride, 0.15 mM phenazine methosulfate (PMS), 5 mM nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 22% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in 0.05 M Hepes buffer; the final pH was 7.5. The study showed that in the histochemical demonstration of Gldh the use of relatively high PVA concentrations were necessary to avoid diffusion artefacts because Gldh seems to be only loosely bound to the mitochondrial matrix. The use of NaN3 as a blocker of the respiratory chain was indispensible, because without NaN3 most reduction equivalents were lost through the respiratory chain. With PMS as an exogenous electron carrier, the demonstrable Gldh activities increased significantly indicating that, in the case of Gldh, the endogenous NADH tetrazolium reductase was not sufficiently effective. Furthermore, it was shown that Gldh was affected by many small molecules (e.g. activation by sodium ions, inhibition by magnesium and calcium ions) so that minor variations of the incubation conditions may cause major differences in demonstrable activities.",
