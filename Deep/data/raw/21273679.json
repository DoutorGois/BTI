     "AB": "In this study, the neuropathological changes induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and chronic mild stress (CMS) in calbindin D-28K (CB) and parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactive neurons in the rat hippocampus were demonstrated. We used immunohistochemical techniques to quantify the numerical density and morphological changes of PV immunoreactive and CB immunoreactive neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) and the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. We also assessed cell proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptotic processes (active caspase-3) in the DG. We found a significant decrease (16.6% for CUS and 13.3% for CMS) in the numerical density of granule cells (GC), alterations in the CB immunoreactive cells of the GC in the DG and an impairment of mossy fiber CB immunolabelling in the CA3. These changes were not accompanied by a decrease in Ki-67 labeling or the level of caspase-3 in the DG. These data indicate a stress-induced reduction of calcium binding neuron parameters, which may be related to the behavioral paradigms exhibited in these models.",
