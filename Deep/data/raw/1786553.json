     "AB": "The effects of phospholipase blockers on tetanus-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) and of diacylglycerol (DG) and arachidonic acid (AA) on synaptic transmission were studied in CA1 neurons of guinea pig hippocampal slices to evaluate the role of protein kinase C (PKC) and AA on the maintenance of LTP. Tetanus-induced LTP was suppressed by perfusion with neomycin (1 mM) or 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl-N,N-diphenylcarbamate (NCDC, 0.1 mM), blockers of phospholipase. 1-Oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol (OAG, 100 micrograms/ml) and AA (100 microM) produced a temporal increase in both the amplitude of the population spike (PS) and the slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) but failed to produce LTP. Application of OAG or AA in low-Mg2+ (0.1 mM) solution induced LTP. OAG- and AA-induced LTP was blocked by DL-2-amino-phosphopentanoic acid (AP5; 50 microM). The administration of a potent activator of PKC, phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), in low-Mg2+ (0.1 mM) solution enhanced the PS and EPSPs for 2 or 3 h but this enhancement did not persist. These results suggest that PKC activation is not as important as AA for the maintenance of LTP and that OAG and AA play important roles in the maintenance of LTP in synergy with the influx of Ca2+ through NMDA receptor-coupled channels.",
