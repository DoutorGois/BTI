     "AB": "Septal kindling has been shown to produce a long-lasting decrease in endogenous calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of hippocampal synaptic plasma membrane proteins, including two major bands of approximately 50,000 and 60,000 Daltons. These two proteins differ from the B-50 protein and tubulin, as evidenced by differences in migration in SDS-PAGE gels and by lack of cross-immunoreactivity with specific antibodies. Identity of these two proteins with the rho and sigma subunits of purified calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaM Kinase II) is suggested by similar migration in SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional gels, by similar calmodulin binding in two-dimensional gels, and similar 125I-peptide mapping of the 50,000 Dalton protein. These results demonstrate that septal kindling is associated with changes in the activity of a major Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase system in hippocampal synaptic plasma membrane. This long-lasting modulation of kinase activity may provide a molecular insight into some aspects of neuronal plasticity.",
