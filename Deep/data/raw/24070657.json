     "AB": "Buyanghuanwu Decoction (BYHWD), as a traditional Chinese medicine, has been developed to treat vascular dementia for hundreds of years, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this research, the protective effects of BYHWD on hippocampal neuron were examined in the rats of ischemia-reperfusion. Ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced by the four-vessel occlusion method and continued for 30 days. BYHWD (per 6.25g/kg/d) was orally given to rats twice each day for 30 days after ischemia-reperfusion, Nimodipine (per 10mg/kg/d) was orally given to rats twice each day for 30 days. In VD+BYHWD group rats, the neuronal injury in the hippocampal CA1 region was significantly less than that of VD group's. BYHWD of intragastric administration also markedly increased the expression of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinaseII (CaMKIIIy)in the CA1 region. Our results suggested that increased ERK2 and CaMKIIIy due to BYHWD may partially account for its effect of neuroprotection standing against ischemic injury in the hippocampal CA1 region, and participated in the rebuilding of synapse, strengthened the expression of LTP, promoted the ability recover of learning and memory in VD rats.",
