     "AB": "The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection on human hippocampus neural stem cells NSCs differentiation in vitro, Fetal hippocampus tissue was dissociated mechanically and then cultured in proliferation medium with EGF and bFGF. Immunofluorescence method was used to detect the expression of NSCs marker-Nestin within these cells. Cultured in 10% FBS, NSCs began to differentiate. On the onset of the differentiation, HCMV AD169 (MOI=5) was added into the differentiation medium. After 7 days differentiation, the effect of HCMV infection on NSCs differentiation was observed by detecting the rate of nestin, GFAP and HCMV immediate-early (IE) positive cells with confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence method. The resucts showed most of the cells (passage 4-6 ) were Nestin positive and could differentiate into NSE-positive neurons and GFAP-positive astrocytes. On day 7 postinfection, 86% +/- 12% of infected cells were IE positive. The percentage of Nestin-positive cells was 50% +/- 19% and 93% +/- 10% (t= 6.03, P<0.01)and those of GFAP-positive cells was 81% +/- 11% and 55 +/- 17% (t=3.77, P<0.01) in uninfected and infected cells respectively. These findings indicated that NSCs were HCMV permissive cell and HCMV AD 169 infection suppressed the differentiation of Hippocampus-genetic human neural stem cells into astrocytes.",
