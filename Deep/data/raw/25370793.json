     "AB": "In this study, the therapeutic effect of olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) transplantation on brain damage was evaluated on acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning rat model. Two weeks after primary culture, OECs were microinjected into hippocampus of CO poisoning rats. Survival of OECs in the host was observed and quantified. OECs survived at 2 weeks, but surviving cell number was found sharply decreased at 6 weeks and reduced to less than 10(3) at 8 weeks after transplantation. At 2 weeks after transplantation, motor function test and cerebral edema assay were performed and followed by pathological examination including hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemistry staining to observe the neuron injury and synapsin I and growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) expression. Furthermore, biomarkers of oxidative stress and apoptosis related proteins in the hippocampus were detected. The results showed that CO exposure led to neurological dysfunction and cerebral edema in rats. After OEC transplantation, neurological function was significantly improved and the cerebral edema was alleviated. In addition, the numbers of neurons and Nissl bodies were increased and synapsin I and GAP-43 protein expressions were upregulated in the hippocampus. Compared with CO poisoned rats, superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione content were both increased and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde level was decreased in the hippocampus of OEC transplanted rats. Moreover, OEC transplantation reduced apoptosis induced by CO exposure. The Bcl-2 expression was significantly upregulated and Bax expression was significantly downregulated. The activity of caspase-3 and the cleaved-poly ADP-ribose polymerase expression were decreased. Taken together, our data suggest that OEC attenuates brain damages induced by acute CO poisoning within 2 weeks after transplantation.",
