     "AB": "Accumulation of inositol-1-phosphate after labeling with [3H]inositol and stimulation with noradrenaline, carbachol, and serotonin was measured in rat cortical, caudate nucleus, and hippocampal slices. The response to noradrenaline was significantly increased in cortical slices from animals that had received either a single electroconvulsive shock (ECS) or a series of 10 daily ECS but was unchanged in caudate nucleus or hippocampal slices. The response to carbachol, a muscarinic cholinergic agonist, was unchanged in cortical or caudate nucleus slices but was significantly reduced in hippocampal slices from animals that had received chronic ECS. The response to serotonin in cortical slices was not affected by the treatment. The results are correlated with changes in receptor number, which have been demonstrated to occur after administration of ECS.",
