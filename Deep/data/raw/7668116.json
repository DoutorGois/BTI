     "AB": "UNLABELLED: AIM. To study the effect of somatostatin (SS) and GABA on the long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal CA1 area in rats. METHODS: Active avoidance response (AAR) of shuttle-box was recorded and population spikes (PS) were taken as indices of LTP. RESULTS: Increased percentages of PSA (PS amplitude, in AAR-acquired rats are more than 100%; After intrahippocampal injection (i.h.) of SS (1 g L-1), increased percentages of PSA exhibited above 120%. Increased percentages of PSA were significantly decreased (< 10%, n = 3) and even caused no PS (n = 8) by ih cysteamine (Cys, 20 g L-1, the depletor of SS); i.h. GABA (200 g L-1) indicated that the increased percentages of PSA are less than 30%, GABA weakened the effect of SS on LTP. CONCLUSION: SS enhance hippocampal LTP but GABA decrease it; they may influence each other to regulate the hippocampal synaptic transmission in the process of learning and memory.",
