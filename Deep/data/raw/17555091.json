     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the changes of ATPase activety and neurotrophic factor expression of brain in aging mice and the Oncolyn's neutralization effect. METHODS: Kunming mice were randomly divided into control group, aging group and Oncolyn group. The aging models were made by subcutaneously injecting D-galactose at neck skin. Oncolyn were administrated through oral for 70 days. The activity of ATPase in brain tissue and protein expression of NGF and BDNG in hippocampus were measured. RESULTS: The activities of Ca2+ -Mg2+-ATPase and Na+ -K+-ATPase in aging mice were significantly decreased from 0.27 and 0.046 U/mg prot (control group) to 0.022 and 0.021U/mg prot (P < 0.05). The protein expressions of NGF, BDNG also were lower than those in control group (decreased 48.28% and 43.24% respectively). After mice were administrated Oncolyn two kinds of ATPase activities were significantly increased (0.056 and 0.117 U/mg prot respectively). In addition, expressions of NGF, BDNG also were higher than those in aging mice (increased 46.67%, 163.64%). CONCLUSION: It was seemed that Oncolyn could neutralize aging through increasing of ATPase activity and neurotrophic factor expression in the process of aging.",
