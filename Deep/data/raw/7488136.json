     "AB": "The potential antioxidant activity of 17-beta estradiol and other steroid hormones in neuronal cells was investigated by studying oxidative stress-induced cell death caused by the neurotoxins amyloid beta protein, hydrogen peroxide and glutamate in the clonal mouse hippocampal cell line HT22. Preincubation of the cells with 10(-5) M 17-beta estradiol prior to addition of the neurotoxins prevented oxidative stress-induced cell damage and ultimately cell death, as detected with cell viability (MTT) and cell lysis (trypan blue exclusion/cell counting; propidium iodide staining) assays. At the DNA level, 17-beta estradiol blocked the DNA degradation caused by glutamate. Other steroid hormones, such as progesterone, aldosterone, corticosterone and the steroid precursor cholesterol, did not protect the cells. The neuronal protection afforded by 17-beta estradiol was estrogen receptor-independent. These data demonstrate a potent neuroprotective activity of the antioxidant 17-beta estradiol, which may have implications for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",
