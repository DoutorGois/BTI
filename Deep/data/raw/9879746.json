     "AB": "The AT1 receptor is one of the two receptor subtypes able to bind angiotensin II. In the present study, immunohistochemical examination of the distribution of the AT1 receptor in several limbic structures of female rats has been done, revealing new aspects of the distribution of AT1-positive cells. The presence of AT1 receptor expressing cells in the hippocampus and the amygdala is described, but their distribution in these regions has not been examined in a detailed way. We found some notable differences in the distribution of these cells: in female rats, we detected high amounts of labeled cells in the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex and piriform cortex. In somewhat lower amounts, stained cells could be found in several nuclei of the amygdala (in the basomedial, basolateral, lateral, central and medial nucleus of the amygdala, in the amygdalopiriform transition area and in the amygdalohippocampal transition area as well as in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis).",
