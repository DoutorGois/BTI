     "AB": "We report on a 13-year-old boy with temporal lobe epilepsy associated with left hippocampal sclerosis and a contralateral arachnoid cyst in the middle cranial fossa (ACMCF). Chronic intracranial recording from subdural grid electrodes showed the left medial temporal lobe to be the ictal onset zone. After left anterior temporal lobectomy with hippocampectomy, seizure control was improved. ACMCF was not considered the direct cause of epilepsy; instead the seizures were attributed to hippocampal sclerosis.",
