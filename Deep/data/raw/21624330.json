     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study influence of lanthanum chloride (LaCl(3)) on the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) including c-jun, early growth response gene 1 (Egr1) and activity-regulated cytoskeletal gene (Arc) in the hippocampus of rats, and discuss the mechanism of LaCl(3) undermining learning and memory capability. METHODS: Forty female Wistar adult rats were divided into control group, low LaCl(3)-contaminated group (0.25%), medium LaCl(3)-contaminated group (0.50%), and high LaCl(3)-contaminated group (1.00%) by randomized design. Each group had ten female rats along with five male rats and mated by the ratio of 2:1. The amounts of pups in the above four groups were 80, 83, 78 and 75 separately. The pups in respective group were La-dyed by lactation, and then the pups in LaCl(3)-contaminated groups drank 0.25%, 0.50% and 1.00% LaCl(3) separately for one month. Learning and memory capability of pups were measured in jumping stairs experiment. Hippocampal lanthanum content was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Hippocampal c-jun, Egr1 and Arc mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR, and corresponding protein expression was measured by Western blotting method. RESULTS: In the jumping stairs experiment, pups in 0.25%, 0.50% and 1.00% LaCl(3)-contaminated groups respectively made (1.75 +/- 0.71), (2.38 +/- 0.92) and (3.00 +/- 0.76) mistakes; significantly higher than control group (1.25 +/- 0.46) (q values were 4.386, 6.793, P < 0.05). However, the incubation period of 0.25%, 0.50% and 1.00% LaCl(3)-contaminated groups were (174.13 +/- 33.72), (139.25 +/- 45.83) and (75.50 +/- 18.56) respectively, which were all significantly lower than that of control group (206.75 +/- 20.47) (q values were 2.958, 6.121, 11.902, P < 0.05). Hippocampal c-jun mRNA expression were (0.89 +/- 0.08), (0.77 +/- 0.12), (0.58 +/- 0.14) and (0.29 +/- 0.10); while the c-jun protein expression were (0.72 +/- 0.13), (0.64 +/- 0.11), (0.43 +/- 0.11) and (0.31 +/- 0.14), and the Egr1 mRNA expression were (0.78 +/- 0.09), (0.61 +/- 0.13), (0.53 +/- 0.10) and (0.22 +/- 0.08), Egr1 protein expression were (0.65 +/- 0.18), (0.40 +/- 0.15), (0.32 +/- 0.13) and (0.14 +/- 0.09) in 0.25%, 0.50% and 1.00% LaCl(3)-contaminated groups; and all of which presented a dose-effect relationship that the correlation coefficients of these parameters with dose were -0.900 (t = 11.309, P = 0.000), -0.969 (t = 7.058, P = 0.000), -0.898 (t = 11.179, P = 0.000) and -0.962 (t = 6.739, P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: LaCl(3) undermines the learning and memory capability of rats, which is possibly related to lower expression of c-jun and Egr1 gene and protein induced by lanthanum in hippocampus.",
