Azmitia, Stimulation of astroglial 5-HT(1A) receptors releases the serotonergic growth factor, protein S-100, and alters astroglial morphology, Brain Res. 497 (1989) 80-86. ; P.M.

In this study, we tried to find out whether S-100beta can protect cultured neurons from glutamate- and staurosporine-induced damage and whether the neuroprotective activity of the highly selective 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, Bay x 3702, is mediated by an induction of S-100beta. Extracellularly added S-100beta (1-10 ng/ml) reduced staurosporine-induced damage in pure neuronal cultures from chick embryo telencephalon as well as in mixed neuronal/glial cultures from neonatal rat hippocampus. In addition, S-100beta (1 ng/ml) reduced neuronal death induced by exposure to glutamate (0.25 mM, 30 min) in mixed neuronal/glial cultures from neonatal rat hippocampus. In cultured rat cortical astrocytes, a 24 h-treatment with Bay x 3702 (1 nM) increased the S-100beta content in the culture medium from 2.2+/-0.3 (controls) to 6.2+/-0.7 ng/ml. In the adult rat, a 4 h-infusion of 4 microg/kg Bay x 3702 (i.v.) was found to increase the S-100beta content in the striatum 6 h after the beginning of the infusion to 153+/-37 microg/g compared with 60+/-20 microg/g in vehicle-treated rats. Bay x 3702 had no effect on the S-100beta content in the rat hippocampus. Finally, we tried to block the protective effect of Bay x 3702 against staurosporine-induced damage in mixed neuronal/glial cultures from rat neonatal hippocampus by anti-S-100beta antibodies. We found only a partial blockade, although the antibodies fully blocked the antiapoptotic effect of S-100beta itself demonstrating that the antibody was effective in blocking neuroprotection by S-100beta. Thus, we conclude that S-100beta was able to protect cultured neurons against glutamate- and staurosporine-induced damage. Furthermore, S-100beta mediated partially the protective effect of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, Bay x 3702, against staurosporine-induced apoptosis in mixed neuronal/glial cultures from neonatal rat hippocampus.",
