     "AB": "Normovolemic hemodilution is a possible way to improve the brain recovery after ischemia and reperfusion. Therefore we have decided to examine how this process may affect the post-ischemic protein synthesis machinery. We analysed rat brains after 4-vessel-occlusion and different time intervals of reperfusion using normovolemic hemodilution. We achieved an important increase of [4,5-3H]leucine incorporation into polypeptides in vitro in the rat brain neocortex 30 minutes after ischemia, but concurrently there was no significant change in the hippocampus and striatum. By extending the time course of reperfusion we did not observe any important deviation of in vitro [4,5-3H]leucine incorporation in the studied brain areas. Thus, although hemodilution increased protein synthesis in selective vulnerable regions after ischemia, this improvement is not of significant importance.",
