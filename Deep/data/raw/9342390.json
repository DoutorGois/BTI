     "AB": "We have studied the effect of the cholinergic agonist carbachol on the spontaneous release of glutamate in cultured rat hippocampal cells. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) through glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type channels were recorded by means of the patch-clamp technique. Carbachol increased the frequency of sEPSCs in a concentration-dependent manner. The kinetic properties of the sEPSCs and the amplitude distribution histograms were not affected by carbachol, arguing for a presynaptic site of action. This was confirmed by measuring the turnover of the synaptic vesicular pool by means of the fluorescent dye FM 1-43. The carbachol-induced increase in sEPSC frequency was not mimicked by nicotine, but could be blocked by atropine or by pirenzepine, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtype M1 antagonist. Intracellular Ca2+ signals recorded with the fluorescent probe Fluo-3 indicated that carbachol transiently increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Since, however, carbachol still enhanced the sEPSC frequency in bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetate-loaded cells, this effect could not be attributed to the rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. On the other hand, the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine as well as a down-regulation of protein kinase C by prolonged treatment of the cells with 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate inhibited the carbachol effect. This argues for an involvement of protein kinase C in presynaptic regulation of spontaneous glutamate release. Adenosine, which inhibits synaptic transmission, suppressed the carbachol-induced stimulation of sEPSCs by a G protein-dependent mechanism activated by presynaptic A1-receptors.",
