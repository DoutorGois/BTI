     "AB": "Binding studies with [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([3H]8-OH-DPAT), a specific serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonist, were done on the autopsied brains from control subjects and from patients with chronic schizophrenia. All the patients and controls were of the Japanese race. In the controls, representative Scatchard plots for the specific [3H]8-OH-DPAT bindings in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus revealed a single component of high affinity binding site (Kd value = 5.7 and 5.9 nM, Bmax value = 80.1 and 101.0 fmol/mg protein, respectively). The [3H]8-OH-DPAT bindings to the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were potently inhibited by serotonin (IC50 = 6.3 x 10(-9) M) and 5-HT1A agonists (IC50 = 5.0 x 10(-9) - 2.3 x 10(-7) M), while other neurotransmitters, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 related compounds did not inhibit the binding (IC50 greater than 10(-5) M). The bindings were decreased in the presence of 0.1mM GTP and 0.1mM GppNHp but not in the presence of 0.1mM GMP. In the prefrontal and temporal cortices of schizophrenics, there was a significant increase in the specific [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding, by 40% and 60%, respectively, with no change in the hippocampus, amygdala, cingulum, motor cortex, parietal or occipital cortex, as compared to findings in the controls. Scatchard analysis showed that this increased binding reflects changes in the number of sites but not in the affinity. The effect of 0.1mM GppNHp on the binding to prefrontal cortex was observed in both controls and schizophrenic patients. The bindings were significantly greater in the schizophrenic patients than in controls, in the presence of 0.1mM GppNHp. Our findings suggest that there are GTP-sensitive 5-HT1A sites in the human brain and that selective increases in GTP-sensitive 5-HT1A sites in the prefrontal and temporal cortices of schizophrenics relate to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",
