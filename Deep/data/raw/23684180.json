     "AB": "Early-life stress is a main contributory factor to the onset of depression. Treatments remain inadequate and as such, a large unmet medical need for novel therapeutics remains. Impeding advancement is the poor understanding of the molecular pathology. microRNAs (miRNAs) are novel regulators of gene expression. A paucity of information regarding their role in depressive pathology and antidepressant action remains. This study investigated changes to hippocampal miRNA levels induced via early-life stress in Sprague-Dawley rats and whether antidepressant treatments could reverse these changes. Investigated were the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, the rapid acting N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine and electroconvulsive shock therapy (ECT). Microarray analysis revealed early-life stress affected the expression of multiple hippocampal miRNAs. Antidepressant treatments reversed some of these effects including a stress-induced change to miR-451. Ketamine and ECT possessed the highest number of common targets suggesting convergence on common pathways. Interestingly all three treatments possessed miR-598-5p as a common target. This demonstrates that changes to hippocampal miRNA expression may represent an important component of stress-induced pathology and antidepressant action may reverse these.",
