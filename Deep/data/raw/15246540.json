     "AB": "We have recently observed that the free radical-generating mixture of xanthine and xanthine oxidase (X/XO) can suppress the inhibitory effects of adenosine on synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, but that this action can be mimicked by xanthine alone. We have now clarified the mechanism of these interactions by using the new, potent and highly selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, 1-(3-cyano-4-neopentyloxyphenyl)pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid (Y-700). Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. X/XO induced a long-lasting increase of fEPSP slope and significantly reduced the presynaptic inhibitory effect of adenosine. Both these actions were prevented by Y-700 at a concentration of only 200nM. Similarly the superfusion of xanthine alone increased fEPSP slope and reduced sensitivity to adenosine but these effects were also prevented by Y-700. The results indicate that the antagonism of adenosine responses by X/XO or by xanthine alone are entirely attributable to the activity of the added or endogenous XO activity, probably generating free radicals, and are not likely to be caused by a direct antagonistic action at the xanthine-sensitive site on the adenosine receptor.",
