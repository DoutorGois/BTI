     "AB": "Activation of purinergic receptors by ATP (P2R) modulates glutamate release and the activation of post-synaptic P2R is speculated to induce nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. Increased glutamatergic and nitrergic signaling have been involved in the neurobiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the effects of two P2R antagonists (PPADS and iso-PPADS) in animals submitted to models predictive of antidepressant-, anxiolytic- and anticompulsive-like effects. Swiss mice receiving PPADS at 12.5mg/kg showed reduced immobility time in the forced swimming test (FST) similarly to the prototype antidepressant imipramine (30mg/kg). This dose was also able to decrease the number of buried marbles in the marble-burying test (MBT), an anticompulsive-like effect. However, no effect was observed in animals submitted to the elevated plus maze (EPM) and to the open field test. The systemic administration of iso-PPADS, a preferential P2XR antagonist, also reduced the immobility time in FST, which was associated to a decrease in NOx levels in the prefrontal cortex. In addition, P2X7 receptor was found co-immunoprecipitated with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) in the prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that P2X7, possibly coupled to NOS1, could modulate behavioral responses associated to stress-related disorders and it could be a new target for the development of more effective treatments for affective disorders.",
