     "AB": "Thrombin, a key player in thrombogenesis, affects cells in the brain through activation of its receptors. Low levels of thrombin activity are protective while high levels are toxic. We sought to quantify thrombin activity levels and their spatial distribution in brains of mice following reperfusion after ischemic stroke focusing on infarct, peri-infarct and contralateral areas. In order to find out the contribution of brain-derived thrombin, mRNA levels of both prothrombin and factor X were determined. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of thrombin levels that were measured in the ischemic brain on synaptic transmission. We found that in the brains of mice following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, thrombin activity is elevated throughout the ischemic hemisphere, including in peri-infarct areas (90 +/- 33 and 60 +/- 18 mU/mL, in the infarct and peri-infarct areas, respectively, compared to 11 +/- 3 and 12 +/- 5 mU/mL, in the corresponding contralateral areas; mean +/- SE; p < 0.05). Brain mRNA levels of prothrombin and, in particular, factor X are up-regulated in the ischemic core. Hippocampal slices treated with thrombin concentrations as found in the ischemic hemisphere show altered synaptic responses. We conclude that high thrombin activity following reperfusion after ischemic stroke may cause synaptic dysfunction. Following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice, thrombin activity is elevated throughout the ischemic hemisphere, including in peri-infarct areas. Brain mRNA levels of prothrombin and factor X are up-regulated in the ischemic core. Thrombin is known to affect synaptic function in a concentration dependent manner and hippocampal slices treated with the concentrations found in the ischemic hemisphere show altered synaptic responses. We conclude that in ischemic stroke, the high brain thrombin activity found after reperfusion may cause synaptic dysfunction.",
