     "AB": "Embryonic septal-basal forebrain tissue was grown in explant culture for 1, 4 or 5 days prior to transplantation to the hippocampus of adult rats denervated of its septal input by a fornix/fimbria transection. The explant transplants were compared with transplants of septal cell suspensions. Analysis of fiber ingrowth by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry at various timepoints post-transplantation shows little difference in the developmental time course or extent of cholinergic axon ingrowth into the host hippocampus between the suspension transplants and the explant transplants. Septal explants in culture for 5 days were as effective as those in culture for one day prior to transplantation in providing cholinergic reinnervation to the host hippocampus. Studies using antibodies to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and the fluorescent retrograde tracer, fast blue, confirmed that the AChE-positive cells in the transplants were cholinergic and that the innervation to the host hippocampus came from the transplanted cholinergic neurons. Thus the results demonstrate that embryonic cholinergic septal neurons can be maintained in short-term culture prior to transplantation without adversely affecting their ability to innervate an appropriate CNS target in vivo.",
