     "AB": "Potassium channels can be affected by epileptic seizures and serve a crucial role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Dimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) and its enzyme euchromatic histonelysine Nmethyltransferase 2 (G9a) are the major epigenetic modulators and are associated with gene silencing. Insight into whether H3K9me2 and G9a can respond to epileptic seizures and regulate expression of genes encoding potassium channels is the main purpose of the present study. A total of 16 subtypes of potassium channel genes in pilocarpinemodelled epileptic rats were screened by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction, and it was determined that the expression ATPsensitive inward rectifier potassium channel 10 (Kcnj10) increased in hippocampus and insular cortex, while the expression of most of the other subtypes decreased. The total level of H3K9me2 decreased in the model group compared with the control. The Kcnj10 gene encoding the Kir4.1 channel was selected to analyse changes in H3K9me2 in the promoter region by the chromatin immunoprecipitation method. AntiH3K9me2 and antiG9a antibodies were used to identify the modified DNAs. Five primers were designed across the promoter region of the Kcnj10 gene. In epileptic hippocampi, the relative abundance of H3K9me2 and G9a in the promoter region of Kcnj10 decreased markedly. Removal of the H3K9me2 repressive mark resulted in decreased transcriptional inhibition of the Kcnj10 gene and therefore increased its expression. In the cultured C6 cells, specific inhibition of the enzymatic activity of G9a by 2(Hexahydro4methyl1H1,4diazepin1yl)6,7di methoxyN(1(phenylmethyl)4piperidinyl)4quinazolinamine trihydrochloride hydrate (bix01294) resulted in upregulation of the expression of Kir4.1 proteins. The present study demonstrated that H3K9me2 and G9a are sensitive to epileptic seizure activity during the acute phase of epilepsy and can affect the transcriptional regulation of the Kcnj10 channel.",
