     "AB": "Dendritic spines are small postsynaptic compartments of excitatory synapses in the vertebrate brain that are modified during learning, aging, and neurological disorders. The formation and modification of dendritic spines depend on rapid assembly and dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in this highly compartmentalized space, but the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we report that spatiotemporal enrichment of actin monomers (G-actin) in dendritic spines regulates spine development and plasticity. We first show that dendritic spines contain a locally enriched pool of G-actin that can be regulated by synaptic activity. We further find that this G-actin pool functions in spine development and its modification during synaptic plasticity. Mechanistically, the relatively immobile G-actin pool in spines depends on the phosphoinositide PI(3,4,5)P3 and involves the actin monomer-binding protein profilin. Together, our results have revealed a novel mechanism by which dynamic enrichment of G-actin in spines regulates the actin remodeling underlying synapse development and plasticity.",
