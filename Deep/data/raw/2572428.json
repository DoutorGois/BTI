     "AB": "The role of endogenous glycine in supporting N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-evoked neurotransmitter release was investigated. HA-966 (1-hydroxy-3-aminopyrrolidone-2) inhibited NMDA-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine from rat hippocampal brain slices, but was much less effective in inhibiting [3H]norepinephrine release evoked by kainic acid (KA). Glycine (1 mM) reversed the HA-966 (1 mM) antagonism of NMDA-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine. Strychnine (10 microM) had no effect on the ability of glycine to reverse HA-966 antagonism of NMDA-evoked neurotransmitter release. Other amino acids were also capable of reversing the HA-966 antagonism of NMDA-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release with a rank order of potency: D-serine greater than or equal to glycine much greater than L-serine approximately beta-alanine. These same compounds inhibited strychnine-insensitive [3H]glycine binding to rat cortical membrane fragments with a rank order of potency: glycine greater than D-serine much greater than L-serine greater than or equal to beta-alanine. In addition, HA-966 inhibited [3H]glycine binding (IC50 = 8.5 microM). The results suggest that HA-966 antagonism of NMDA-evoked neurotransmitter release is due to the inhibition of endogenous glycine acting at a strychnine-insensitive modulatory glycine site associated with the NMDA receptor/ionophore complex.",
