     "AB": "We report the case of a 25-year-old female patient with intractable complex partial seizures characterized by repetition of certain religious statements and a rather compulsive kissing behavior. Presurgical evaluation revealed a right-sided, mesial temporal focus and hippocampal sclerosis on MRI. After selective amygdalohippocampectomy, she has only occasional auras. Her rare and peculiar ictal manifestations are discussed in the context of semiology and pathogenesis. [Published with videosequences].",
