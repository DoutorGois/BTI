     "AB": "Glutamate receptors are numerous on the ischemia vulnerable CA-1 pyramidal cells. Postischemic use of the AMPA antagonist NBQX has shown up to 80% protection against cell death. Three aspects of this were studied: In the first study, male Wistar rats were given NBQX (30 mg/kg x 3) either 20 hours or immediately (0 h) before 12 min of 4-vessel occlusion with hypotension. After six days of reperfusion comparison with an untreated group showed almost full protection in the 0 h group (4% cell loss, p < 0.001) but only slight protection in the 20 h group (62% cell loss, p < 0.05). After 12 min of ischemia in the present model, eosinophilic CA-1 cells are seen from day 2 on. Since there could be a late, deleterious calcium influx via NMDA receptors, one group of ischemic rats was given MK-801 (5 mg/kg i.p.) 24 hours after ischemia. However, quantitation 6 days later of remaining CA-1 cells showed no protection. In the third study referred here, two groups of ischemic rats were given NBQX (30 mg/kg x 3) immediately after ischemia. The groups survive for six and 21 days, respectively. Counting of CA-1 pyramidal cells showed an equal, significant protection in both groups (approx 20% cell loss).",
