     "AB": "It is well known that regular low or mild exercise helps to improve and maintain cognition. On the other hand, ever thought many people prefer high-intensity exercise (e.g., running, swimming, biking, soccer, basketball, etc.) to get rid of stress or improve their health, the previous studies reported that intense exercise either impairs cognition or has no effect on cognitive function. However, we previously showed that intermittent intense exercise prevents stress-induced depressive behavior in mice in a similar manner to moderate exercise. On the basis of this finding, we investigated the effect of intermittent intense exercise on cognitive deficit in chronically stressed mice. A total of forty mice were evenly divided into control, stressed, stressed with moderate exercise, and stressed with intense exercise groups. The stressed mice were chronically exposed a restraint stress (10 h/day, 6 days/week for 7 weeks). The exercised mice were subjected to intermittent intense or endurance moderate running on the treadmill three times a week. Cognition was evaluated using the Morris water maze test and the object recognition test. Chronic stress decreased cognition, and newborn cell survival and blood vessel density in the hippocampus. However, both regular intense and moderate exercise prevented decrease of cognition, improved newborn cell survival and blood vessel density. These findings suggest that intermittent intense exercise may protect against decrease of cognition in a similar manner to moderate exercise and that both exercise-induced protection of decrease of cognition is closely related to newborn cell survival and angiogenesis in the hippocampus.",
