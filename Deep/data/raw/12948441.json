     "AB": "Neurotrophins are synthesized first as precursors, followed by maturation through proteolytic removal of the \"pro\" region. Since pro- and mature neurotrophins elicit opposite functional effects by differential interactions with Trks and p75 receptors, extracellular cleavage represents a new way to control the synaptic functions of neurotrophins. A single nucleotide mutation in the pro-region appears to affect synaptic targeting and activity-dependent secretion of BDNF in hippocampal neurons. These results demonstrate new mechanisms by which neurotrophins regulate synaptic plasticity and memory function.",
