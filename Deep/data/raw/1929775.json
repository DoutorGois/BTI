     "AB": "Positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 was used to assess cortical metabolic rate during an olfactory memory task in six patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type. Metabolic activity was compared with that of both age-matched controls performing the olfactory task and controls resting with their eyes closed. Patients had lower metabolic rates in the anterior portion of the medial-temporal cortex than did controls, and the difference was greatest between patients and the controls performing the memory task. This region is known to receive a large olfactory input and has been implicated in the encoding of human memory. Normal controls resting with their eyes closed had significantly lower metabolic rates in this area when compared with normal controls performing the task. Our results are consistent with those of earlier reports of temporal lobe decreases in metabolic rate and extend them through the examination of areas salient to the behavioral loss.",
