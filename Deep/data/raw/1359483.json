     "AB": "Aluminum (Al) has been shown to produce deficits in learning and memory. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that Al-induced inhibition of learning may be due to its effect on glutamate release secondary to changes in calcium channel function and/or intracellular events triggering glutamate release. Calcium-dependent potassium (K)-evoked [14C]-glutamate release from 400 microns transverse rat hippocampal slices was inhibited by Al in a concentration dependent manner (IC50 = 40 microM). Aluminum (30, 100 microM) noncompetitively inhibited Bay K 8644-evoked glutamate release. 4-Aminopyridine (30, 1000 microM) noncompetitively attenuated the Al inhibition of glutamate release, suggesting an Al-induced alteration of Ca channel function. Activation of the Gi protein by R(-)phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA; 1 microM) reduced K-evoked glutamate release 69%, whereas 300 microM Al produced an 84% reduction. These effects were prevented by the Gi protein inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; 100 microM), suggesting an effect of Al on the Gi protein to inhibit glutamate release. Phorbol myristate acetate (0.16 microM)-induced glutamate release was inhibited by 300 microM Al and 80 microM polymyxin B, suggesting an Al modulation of protein kinase C (PKC)-evoked glutamate release. These results demonstrate an Al inhibition of glutamate release that may be mediated by multiple, but interconnected mechanisms (e.g., via interactions with Ca systems), providing multiple targets for an Al-induced alteration of neuronal function.",
