     "AB": "Explants of hippocampus from fetal rats were cultivated in Maximow chambers in semisynthetic medium up to 12 days in vitro. The cultures were fixed Bouin, slided 15 micron, coloured with Kluver-Barrera and some morphological parameters were tested. 1. The nerve fiber index increased by influence of 1% Solcoseryl in relation to control cultures, which growed in minimal medium. An essential stimulation was observed by application of placentar serum and embryonal extract into the culture medium. 2. Die decrease of the number of neurons and glial cells per unit of area and a small decrease of the area of neuron nuclei was discussed in relation to the effect of the pharmacon Solcoseryl on O2- consumption. 3. Solcoseryl (firm Solco AG, Base) is an extract of calf blood. It can not substitute other tissue extracts.",
