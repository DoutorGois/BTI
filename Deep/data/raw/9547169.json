     "AB": "The expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2B/epsilon2 (GRIN2B) in the human adult brain was assayed by in situ hybridisation, by using a specific cRNA probe. The full length GRIN2B cDNA was cloned and sequenced. It showed a 90% nucleotide conservation when compared to the rodent homologue. GRIN2B gene is expressed at high levels in the fronto-parieto-temporal cortex and hippocampus pyramidal cells and, at a lower extent, in the basal ganglia (amygdala and striatum). The cerebellar granule cells does not show any mRNA expression. The non-ubiquitous anatomical distribution of the GRIN2B mRNA in the central nervous system suggests that the gene could be involved in specific functions pertaining to the expressing cell groups.",
