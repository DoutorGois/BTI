     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: Increasing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with diabetes. Rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist and anti-diabetic agent, may improve symptoms of AD. However, the underlying therapeutic potential of it has not been fully elucidated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were divided into four groups: control group, sham operated group, Streptozotocin (STZ) group, rosiglitazone (RGZ) group. Particularly, the STZ-induced rat model was established by intracerebroventricular injection (3 mg/kg) on the first and third day. The water maze behavioral test was performed to evaluate spatial reference learning and memory of the rats. Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels were measured by ELISA method. To determine APP-derived fragment, BACE1 and Abeta degrading enzymes levels, such as NEP and IDE, as well as Abeta transportation protein level, such as LRP1, RAGE, Abca1 and APOE, which were analyzed by Western blot. Immunohistochemistry was used to observe the change of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 in hippocampus. RESULTS: Chronic treatment with RGZ could reduce the Abeta level and improved spatial memory performance in STZ-induced rat model. However, RGZ modified the expression of specific transport proteins monitoring Abeta clearance, such as ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), and the advanced glycation end product-specific receptor (RAGE) rather than change levels of Abeta degrading enzymes, such as IDE and NEP, nor affect APP processing. CONCLUSION: As a potential therapeutic strategy, rosiglitazone might exert anti-AD effect not by alteration of APP processing pathway and Abeta degradation directly, but through promotion of Abeta clearance indeed.",
