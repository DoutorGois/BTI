     "AB": "The propagation of epileptiform burst activity was investigated in the CA1 area of the in-vitro hippocampal slice preparation of the guinea pig. This activity was provoked by 0.1 mM 4-aminopyridine in the bathing medium and was recorded in the pyramidal layer with an array of eight electrodes. The delay between the first population spike of a burst recorded with different electrodes was calculated using the cross-correlation function. The propagation velocity was estimated from the delays and the electrode intervals. It was found that the velocity of spontaneous and evoked epileptiform bursts varies between 0.15 and 5 m/s and is not confined to the range of conduction velocities of the fibre systems in CA1 (0.3-0.55 and 1.0-1.8 m/s). Different velocities can be present in different parts of the CA1 area and the initiation of spontaneous bursts is not confined to the CA2-3 areas, but can also occur in CA1. Burst activity also propagated in a low calcium-high magnesium medium. Different mechanisms of propagation are discussed and it is argued that the propagation velocity due to ephaptic interaction may vary largely. It is concluded that epileptiform activity can be propagated not only by synaptic connections at or near the pyramidal layer, but also by way of electrical field effects of population spikes.",
