     "AB": "The four members of the family of synapse-associated protein 90/postsynaptic density-95-associated proteins (SAPAP1-4) are adapter proteins of postsynaptic density (PSD). They interact with different synaptic scaffolding proteins, cytoskeletal components, and signalling components, and are therefore considered to assemble functional multiprotein units at synapses. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal expression of SAPAP1-SAPAP4 genes in postnatal rat brain by in situ hybridization. All four genes are expressed in many brain areas, leading to overlapping yet distinct mRNA distribution patterns. Moreover, two mRNAs encoding distinct SAPAP3 isoforms exhibit basically identical postnatal expression patterns. In the hippocampus, SAPAP1, SAPAP2, and SAPAP4 transcripts are restricted to cell body zones, whereas SAPAP3 mRNAs are also detected in molecular layers. Thus, SAPAP3 is one of the few PSD components whose local synthesis in dendrites may contribute to an input-specific adaptation of dendritic spine function.",
