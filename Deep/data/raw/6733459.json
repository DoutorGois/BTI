     "AB": "The distribution of immunoreactive (ir)-dynorphin B in 101 microdissected rat brain and spinal cord regions was determined using a specific radioimmunoassay. The highest concentration of dynorphin B in brain was found in the substantia nigra (1106.2 fmol/mg protein). Very high concentrations of ir-dynorphin B (greater than 400 fmol/mg protein) were also found in the lateral preoptic area, parabrachial nuclei and globus pallidus. Relatively high concentrations of ir-dynorphin B (250-400 fmol/mg protein) were found in 19 nuclei, including the periaqueductal gray matter, anterior hypothalamic nucleus, median eminence, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus. Moderate levels of the peptide (between 100 and 250 fmol/mg protein) were found in 42 brain nuclei such as the perifornical nucleus, nucleus of the diagonal band, medial forebrain bundle, and dorsal premamillary nucleus. Low concentrations of ir-dynorphin B (less than 100 fmol/mg protein) were found in 28 brain areas, e.g. cerebral cortical structures (parietal, cingulate, frontal), claustrum, olfactory bulb, lateral and periventricular thalamic nuclei. The cerebellar cortex has the lowest dynorphin B concentration (53.7 fmol/mg protein). Spinal cord segments exhibit low or moderate (cervical segment) levels of the peptide. The neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland is extremely rich in ir-dynorphin B (11,047.1 fmol/mg protein).",
