     "AB": "Middle-age Down's syndrome patients develop dementia with antomicopathological changes that are characteristic for Alzheimer's disease. Cerebral amyolid angiopathy (CAA) most commonly manifests itself as a lobar intracerebral haemorrhage that tends to recur. Multiple haemorrhages may occur simultaneously. CAA is frequently associated with Alzheimer's disease, however the relationship between CCA and Down's syndrome is poorly know. Although there are established clinical criteria for the diagnosis of CAA related to lobar intracerebral haemorrhage, definitive CAA needs anatomicopathologial confirmation. This paper presents the case of a male with Down's syndrome and recurrent lobar intracerebral haemorrhage. An autopsy showed lesions in leptomeningeal and cortical arteries which are characteristic of CAA in addition to anatomicopathological changes of Alzheimer s disease that were mostly seen in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. The paper also discusses the pathological association between beta-amyloid protein, apolipoprotein alleles, CAA, Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome.",
