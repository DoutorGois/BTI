     "AB": "Following cholinergic denervation of the hippocampus by medial septal lesions, an unusual neuronal reorganization occurs in which peripheral adrenergic fibers arising from superior cervical ganglia grow into the hippocampus (hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth). Recent studies suggest that a similar process, in which sympathetic noradrenergic axons invade the hippocampus, can occur in Alzheimer's disease patients. In the last few years, the occurrence of apoptotic cell death has been studied in Alzheimer's disease patients and in animal models of this disorder. Several studies suggest that the hippocampus is an important area to be considered for apoptotic cell death. In our studies in the rat hippocampus, we have measured the expression of inducers and blockers of apoptosis in membrane, cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, and the activity of caspases. The level of cytosolic Fas was increased in cholinergic denervation compared to control and hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth groups. The membrane Fas ligand expression was significantly increased in hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth and in cholinergic denervation compared to the control group. The level of caspase-3 (CPP32) was increased in the cholinergic denervation group compared to control and hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth groups. The cytosolic expression of bcl-x was increased in hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth compared to control and cholinergic denervation. The cytosolic activity of caspase-3 appeared to be significantly decreased in hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth and increased in cholinergic denervation groups compared to control and cholinergic denervation/hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth, respectively. From the present results, we suggest that cholinergic denervation may be responsible for pro-apoptotic responses, while hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth may protect neurons from apoptosis in rat dorsal hippocampus.",
