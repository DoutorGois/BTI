     "AB": "1. In this pilot study the authors examined the role of hippocampal metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in hypoxia in vivo by determining frank neuronal cell death histologically 4 days after the first of three daily insults. 2. Adult male, Wistar rats, chronically prepared with cannulae, were intraventricularly injected with either saline or the metabotropic receptor antagonists L-AP3 (0.102 mg) or MCPG (0.208 mg) 30 min prior to hypoxic insult. 3. Histological analysis of hippocampal regions revealed attenuated neuronal cell loss in CA1 and CA3 in both L-AP3 and MCPG-treated animals. 4. These data suggest a participation of mGluRs in hypoxia-induced neuronal cell death.",
