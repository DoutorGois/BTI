     "AB": "Somatostatin mediates its diverse physiological effects through a family of five G-protein-coupled receptors (sst(1)-sst(5)); however, knowledge about the distribution of individual somatostatin receptor proteins in mammalian brain is incomplete. In the present study, we have examined the regional and subcellular distribution of the somatostatin receptor sst(4) in the rat CNS by raising anti-peptide antisera to the C-terminal tail of sst(4). The specificity of affinity-purified antibodies was demonstrated using immunofluorescent staining of HEK 293 cells stably transfected with an epitope-tagged sst(4) receptor. In Western blotting, the antiserum reacted specifically with a broad band in rat brain, which migrated at approximately 70 kDa before and approximately 50 kDa after enzymatic deglycosylation. sst(4)-Like immunoreactivity was most prominent in many forebrain regions, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Analysis at the electron microscopic level revealed that sst(4)-expressing neurons target this receptor preferentially to their somatodendritic domain. Like the sst(2A) receptor, sst(4)-immunoreactive dendrites were often closely apposed by somatostatin-14-containing fibers and terminals. However, unlike the sst(2A) receptor, sst(4) was not internalized in response to intracerebroventricular administration of somatostatin-14. After percussion trauma of the cortex, neuronal sst(4) receptors progressively declined at the sites of damage. This decline coincided with an induction of sst(4) expression in cells with a glial-like morphology. Together, this study provides the first description of the distribution of immunoreactive sst(4) receptor proteins in rat brain. We show that sst(4) is strictly somatodendritic and most likely functions in a postsynaptic manner. In addition, the sst(4) receptor may have a previously unappreciated function during the neuronal degeneration-regeneration process.",
