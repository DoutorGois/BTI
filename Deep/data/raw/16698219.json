     "AB": "Our previous work demonstrated that the hormone response to stress and the negative feedback inhibition to these hormones are sex-dependently altered by prenatal morphine exposure in adult rats. An alteration in the glucocorticoid negative feedback inhibition is mediated by glucocorticoid receptors (GR) that are distributed throughout the brain, and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) localized mainly in the hippocampus and involved in a tonic influence of brain functions. Therefore, the present study examined the binding characteristics of MR and GR in young adult male and female rats exposed prenatally (E11-E18) to morphine (10 mg/kg/2 x /day), saline or no treatment at all (controls). At 60-90 days of age, animals were adrenalectomized (ADX) 24 h prior to decapitation. The hippocampus and hypothalamus were dissected for saturation binding assays. The data demonstrate that prenatal stress due to maternal saline injections up-regulates MR and GR binding in the hippocampus of adult male rats and this effect is prevented by prenatal morphine exposure. There is no effect of prenatal morphine exposure on GR binding in the hypothalamus of males. In female rats, prenatal morphine exposure does not affect the binding of MR and GR in the hippocampus or GR in the hypothalamus relative to controls; however, they are affected by ovarian hormone fluctuation. Moreover, prenatal stress decreases MR binding in the hippocampus of diestrous females and GR binding in the hypothalamus of estrous females. Both decreases are prevented by prenatal morphine exposure. Thus, the present study demonstrates that: (1) prenatal stress due to maternal saline injections alters MR and GR binding of adult male and female rats and is prevented by prenatal morphine exposure; (2) the MR and GR binding in adult female rats are affected by ovarian hormone fluctuations.",
