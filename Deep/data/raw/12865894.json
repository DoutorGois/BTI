     "PG": "2160-8",
     "AB": "We previously showed that a methanolic extract of St John's wort (SJW) (Hypericum) and hypericin, one of its active constituents, both have delayed regulation of genes that are involved in the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Hyperforin, another constituent of SJW, is active in vitro and has been proposed to be the active constituent for therapeutic efficacy in depression. We therefore examined if hyperforin has delayed effects on HPA axis control centers similar to those of Hypericum and hypericin. We used in situ hybridization histochemistry to examine in rats the effects of short-term (2 weeks) and long-term (8 weeks) oral administration of two hyperforin preparations, fluoxetine (positive control), and haloperidol (negative control) on the expression of genes involved in the regulation of the HPA axis. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) given daily for 8 weeks, but not 2 weeks, significantly decreased levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA by 22% in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA by 23% in the locus coeruleus. Fluoxetine increased levels of mineralocorticoid (MR) (17%), glucocorticoid (GR) (18%), and 5-HT(1A) receptor (21%) mRNAs in the hippocampus at 8, but not 2, weeks. Comparable to haloperidol (1 mg/kg), neither the hyperforin-rich CO(2) extract (27 mg/kg) nor hyperforin-trimethoxybenzoate (8 mg/kg) altered mRNA levels in brain structures relevant for HPA axis control at either time point. These data suggest that hyperforin and hyperforin derivatives are not involved in the regulation of genes that control HPA axis function.",
