     "AB": "Rats with bilateral neonatal ventral hippocampus lesions (NVHL) are commonly used for modeling developmental aspects of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Given that functional changes become significant only after puberty, NVHL as well as sham-operated rats were analyzed at the ages of 21, 42 and 63days (i.e. as pups, adolescents and adults), using MRI to examine the damage caused by surgery over time. Morphometric evaluations were considered and lesions were classified as small, medium and large. The volume of lesions increased regularly with age, to a greater extent than increases in overall brain size. This was relatively linear, corresponding to a gradually shrinking forebrain, and these observations held true for each class of lesions considered. Following the observation that the lesion procedure elicited calcifications in the brain, the same rats were subjected to 3D X-ray scanning the day after each MRI session, allowing precise measurements of skull size to be carried out. The NVHL rats had smaller skulls; however, the dimensions of the calcifications did not grow more than the skull size over time. The mechanisms underlying the progressive anatomical changes following surgery are discussed, and we propose this in vivo follow-up method to investigate therapeutic strategies aimed at countering or limiting the post-lesion consequences of a neonatal brain damage.",
