     "AB": "Cholinergic modulation of single cell responses and field potentials evoked in the hippocampus by electrical stimulation of the perforant path and mossy fibres was investigated in two groups of chronic unanesthetized rabbits--with intact hippocampus and with basally undercut septum (without ascending medial forebrain bundle afferents). In both groups of animals responses to stimulation were blocked or significantly depressed by i.v. physostigmine injection in many neurons (50% in the intact hippocampus and 69% in the hippocampus without medial forebrain bundle). In minor groups of neurons (10 and 8%, respectively), facilitation of responses was observed. Scopolamine restored initial responsiveness of hippocampal neurons and augmented effects of stimulation in some of them. The effect of physostigmine was reproduced by stimulation of the medial septum. Depressive influence of medial septal area stimulation was increased by physostigmine and blocked by scopolamine. Population spikes evoked by stimulation of the perforant path of the intact group were equally suppressed (by 43%) during sensory stimulation evoking natural theta, after physostigmine and after medial septal area stimulation. In the group of animals without medial forebrain bundle these influences resulted in a complete suppression of field potentials; scopolamine restored them. It is concluded that the main function of the septohippocampal cholinergic input consists of filtering out the signals appearing at the background of theta-rhythm triggered by a previous signal, thus preventing their interference with its processing and registration.",
