     "AB": "We have previously demonstrated that an acute pharmacological interruption of the afferent inputs from the hypothalamus to the hippocampus resulted in the blockade of the genesis and spread of intra-amygdala kainate-induced seizure activity in the hippocampus. This finding suggests that a sustained interruption of the hypothalamic stimulative influences may completely prevent amygdaloid seizure-induced hippocampal neuron damage. To test this assumption, we delivered antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) against synaptotagmin I, a regulatory protein of the transmitter release machinery, into the hypothalamus by using a Hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-liposome-mediated gene transfer technique. Four days prior to the induction of status epilepticus by intra-amygdala injection of kainate, the synaptotagmin I antisense was injected into the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) of the hypothalamus to chronically suppress the stimulative influences to the hippocampus via the reduction of transmitter release. The synaptotagmin I hypothalamic knockdown resulted in the almost complete prevention of seizure-induced damage of hippocampal neurons but not of entorhinal neurons following the kainate-induced amygdaloid seizures. This result suggests that the hypothalamic stimulative influences to the hippocampus have a major contribution to the amygdaloid seizure-induced hippocampal sclerosis, probably via disinhibition mechanism.",
