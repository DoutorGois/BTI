     "AB": "Although evidence suggests that 5-HT(2A) and muscarinic M1/M4 receptors are implicated in the pathology of schizophrenia, the results are not conclusive. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that binding of 5-HT(2A) and M1/M4 receptors is altered in the postmortem brain of schizophrenia subjects. Quantitative autoradiography was employed to measure [(3)H]ketanserin binding to 5-HT(2A) receptors and [(3)H]pirenzepine binding to both M1 and M4 receptors in Brodmann's area 9 (BA9), caudate/putamen, and the hippocampal formation from six schizophrenic and six control subjects. A significant reduction in the density of 5HT(2A) receptors in BA 9 of schizophrenic subjects was observed (p=0.036). No significant difference was observed in the density of 5HT(2A) receptors in the hippocampus or caudate/putamen between the two groups. No significant changes in the density of M1/M4 receptors was observed in these three regions between the two groups. These findings support a possible involvement of the serotonergic system in the pathology of schizophrenia.",
