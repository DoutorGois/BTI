     "AB": "Although more than 8000 papers of apoptosis are published annually, there are very few reports concerning necrosis in the past few years. A number of recent studies using lower species animals have suggested that the cornu Ammonis (CA) 1 neuronal death after brief global cerebral ischemia occurs by apoptosis, an active and genetically controlled cell suicide process. However, the studies of monkeys and humans rather support necrosis, the calpain-mediated release of lysosomal enzyme cathepsin after ischemia conceivably contributes to the cell degeneration of CA1 neurons. This paper provides an overview of recent developments in ischemic neuronal death, presents the cascade of the primate neuronal death with particular attentions to the cysteine proteases, and also indicates selective cathepsin inhibitors as a novel neuroprotectant. Furthermore, the possible interaction of calpain, cathepsin, and caspase in the cascade of ischemic neuronal death is discussed.",
