     "AB": "Intracerebral administration of kainic acid (KA) in rats was previously shown to abolish immunohistochemical labelling for the astrocytic gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) at sites depleted of neurons (Vukelic et al: Neurosci Lett 130:120-124, 1991). This response of Cx43 has now been further investigated with a number of different sequence-specific anti-Cx43 antibodies. At lesion sites in the thalamus, striatum, and hippocampus examined immunohistochemically with an antibody against amino acids (aa's) 346-363 in the Cx43 sequence, the antibody used in the earlier study, Cx43-immunoreactivity was increased 5 h after KA injections, absent by 24 h and for up to 2 weeks post-injection, and began to return to less than normal levels by 2 to 3 weeks post-injection. Analyses of KA lesion sites with antibodies against other sequences of Cx43 (amino acids 283-298, 253-270, 241-260, 113-123, and 49-61) revealed not only the presence but in some cases an increased density of Cx43 immunoreactivity after a survival time of 1 week. Immunolabelling patterns at these sites consisted of relatively large, coarse profiles rather the fine punctate labelling typically seen in sections of normal brain. In homogenates of KA-injected striatum analyzed by Western blots, Cx43 was detected at near normal or slightly increased levels at various survival times examined. The 43 kDa phosphorylated form of Cx43 and its faster migrating 41 kDa dephosphorylated form which is generated post-mortem by a brain phosphatase were both present after standard methods of tissue preparation for Western blot analysis, while only the 43 kDa form was present in normal and KA-injected striatum after inactivation of brain metabolism by focused cranial microwave irradiation. Ultrastructural investigations of lesions sites within the thalamus revealed a virtual absence of astrocytic gap junctions. These results demonstrate that Cx43 levels initially increase after intracerebral KA treatment, that its molecular organization in resident astrocytes is altered such that epitopes that are normally accessible to antibody are hidden while those that may be hidden or relatively inaccessible are exposed, and that this molecular alteration in Cx43 is associated with loss of astrocytic gap junctions.",
