     "AB": "Evidence from epidemiology suggests that developmental vitamin D (DVD) deficiency is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. DVD deficiency in rats is associated with altered brain morphology and enhanced hyperlocomotion in response to MK-801 and amphetamine. The aim of this study was to determine if similar phenotypes were associated with DVD deficiency in two strains of mice (C57BL/6J, 129/X1SvJ). Brains from neonatal (P0) and adult (P70) mice were imaged using MRI and the volumes of the cerebrum, hippocampus, striatum, septum, cortex and ventricles measured, as well as the widths of white matter tracts. Locomotor sensitivity to 5mg/kg d-amphetamine, 0.5mg/kg MK-801 or saline was examined in a separate group of mice in an open field. DVD deficiency altered brain morphology in C57BL6/J mice, such that C57BL/6J female DVD-deficient neonatal mice had a smaller hippocampus compared to female controls. In addition, adult C57BL/6J male DVD-deficient mice had smaller lateral ventricles compared to controls, which may have been compressed by the enlarged striatum seen in these DVD-deficient mice. However, in contrast to the behavioural phenotypes found in DVD-deficient rats, there was no significant effect of maternal diet on amphetamine or MK-801-induced locomotion in either strain. These data indicate that not only species, but also strain of mouse, moderates the impact of DVD deficiency on neuroanatomical and behavioural phenotypes in rodent animal models.",
