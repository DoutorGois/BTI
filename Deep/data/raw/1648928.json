     "AB": "The effect of prenatal ethanol exposure on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-sensitive [3H]-glutamate receptor binding site density was studied in rat brain. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a liquid diet containing 3.35% ethanol throughout gestation. This diet produced maternal peak blood ethanol levels of about 39 mg/dl eight hours after the administration of the liquid diet. Pair-fed dams received an isocalorically matched liquid diet and an ad lib lab chow group served as control for the paired feeding technique. At 45 days of age, offspring from each of the three diet groups were sacrificed and brain NMDA-sensitive [3H]-glutamate binding site density measured using in vitro radiohistochemical techniques. NMDA-sensitive [3H]-glutamate binding site density was reduced significantly by 19 to 29% in the apical dendritic field regions of dentate gyrus, hippocampal CA1 and subiculum of dorsal hippocampal formation of fetal alcohol rats compared to pair-fed and ad lib controls. NMDA-sensitive [3H]-glutamate binding site density was not significantly different among the three groups in the ventral hippocampal formation, posterior neocortex, lateral entorhinal cortex or cerebellum. These results are consistent with our previous observations of a reduction in total [3H]-glutamate receptor binding site density in the dorsal hippocampal formation of fetal alcohol rats, as well as more recent electrophysiological observations of a decrease in the sensitivity of fetal alcohol hippocampal slices to NMDA.",
