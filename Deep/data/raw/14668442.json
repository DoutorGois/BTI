     "AB": "A quantitative anatomical study in the rodent anterior cingulate and somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, and lateral amygdala revealed region-, cell-, and dendrite-specific changes of spine densities in 3-week-old Octodon degus after repeated parental separation. In parentally separated animals significantly higher spine densities were found on the apical and basal dendrites of the cingulate cortex (up to 143% on apical and 138% on basal dendrite). Branching order analysis revealed that this effect is seen on all segments of the apical dendrite, whereas on the basal dendrites significantly higher spine densities were seen only on the outer branches (third to fifth dendritic segments). Increased spine densities were also observed on the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (up to 109% on the distal apical segments and up to 106% on the basal segment) compared with the control group. In contrast, significantly reduced spine densities were observed on the granule cell dendrites in the dentate gyrus (down to 92%) and on the apical dendrites in the medial nucleus of the amygdala (down to 95%). No significant changes of spine densities were seen in the somatosensory cortex (except for an increase in the proximal apical segments) and in the lateral nucleus of the dorsal amygdala (except for an increase in the proximal basal dendritic segments). These results demonstrate that repeated stressful emotional experience alters the balance of presumably excitatory synaptic inputs of pyramidal neurons in the limbic system. Such experience-induced modulations of limbic circuits may determine psychosocial and cognitive capacities during later life.",
