     "AB": "Cognitive impairment is a quintessential feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD mouse models. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonist rosiglitazone improves hippocampus-dependent cognitive deficits in some AD patients and ameliorates deficits in the Tg2576 mouse model for AD amyloidosis. Tg2576 cognitive enhancement occurs through the induction of a gene and protein expression profile reflecting convergence of the PPARgamma signaling axis and the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) cascade, a critical mediator of memory consolidation. We therefore tested whether PPARgamma and ERK associated in protein complexes that subserve cognitive enhancement through PPARgamma agonism. Coimmunoprecipitation of hippocampal extracts revealed that PPARgamma and activated, phosphorylated ERK (pERK) associated in Tg2576 in vivo, and that PPARgamma agonism facilitated recruitment of PPARgamma to pERK during memory consolidation. Furthermore, the amount of PPARgamma recruited to pERK correlated with the cognitive reserve in humans with AD and in Tg2576. Our findings implicate a previously unidentified PPARgamma-pERK complex that provides a molecular mechanism for the convergence of these pathways during cognitive enhancement, thereby offering new targets for therapeutic development in AD.",
