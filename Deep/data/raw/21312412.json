     "AB": "The hippocampus is abnormal in schizophrenia. Smaller hippocampal volume is the most consistent finding and is present already in the early stages of the illness. The underlying cellular substrate is a subtle, yet functionally significant reduction of hippocampal interneurons. Neuroimaging studies have revealed a pattern of increased hippocampal activity at baseline and decreased recruitment during the performance of memory tasks. Hippocampal lesion models in rodents have replicated some of the pharmacological, anatomical and behavioral phenotype of schizophrenia. Taken together, this pattern of findings points to a disinhibition of hippocampal pyramidal cells and abnormal cortico-hippocampal interactions in schizophrenia.",
