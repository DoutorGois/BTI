     "AB": "Perirhinal cortex provides object-based information and novelty/familiarity information for the hippocampus. The necessity of these inputs was tested by comparing hippocampal c-fos expression in rats with or without perirhinal lesions. These rats either discriminated novel from familiar objects (Novel-Familiar) or explored pairs of novel objects (Novel-Novel). Despite impairing Novel-Familiar discriminations, the perirhinal lesions did not affect novelty detection, as measured by overall object exploration levels (Novel-Novel condition). The perirhinal lesions also largely spared a characteristic network of linked c-fos expression associated with novel stimuli (entorhinal cortex-->CA3-->distal CA1-->proximal subiculum). The findings show: I) that perirhinal lesions preserve behavioral sensitivity to novelty, whilst still impairing the spontaneous ability to discriminate novel from familiar objects, II) that the distinctive patterns of hippocampal c-fos activity promoted by novel stimuli do not require perirhinal inputs, III) that entorhinal Fos counts (layers II and III) increase for novelty discriminations, IV) that hippocampal c-fos networks reflect proximal-distal connectivity differences, and V) that discriminating novelty creates different pathway interactions from merely detecting novelty, pointing to top-down effects that help guide object selection.
