     "AB": "Astrocytes react to brain injury triggering neuroinflammatory processes that determine the degree of neuronal damage. However, the signaling events associated to astrocyte activation remain largely undefined. The nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) is a transcription factor family implicated in activation of immune cells. We previously characterized the expression of NFAT isoforms in cultured astrocytes, and NFAT activation in response to mechanical lesion. Here we analyze NFATc3 in two mouse models of inflammatory brain damage: hippocampal excitotoxicity induced by intracerebral kainic acid (KA) injection and cortical mechanical lesion. Immunofluorescence results demonstrated that NFATc3 is specifically induced in a subset of reactive astrocytes, and not in microglia or neurons. In KA-treated brains, NFATc3 expression is transient and NFATc3-positive astrocytes concentrate around damaged neurons in areas CA3 and CA1. Complementary Western blot and RT-PCR analysis revealed an NFAT-dependent induction of RCAN1-4 and COX-2 in hippocampus as soon as 6 h after KA exposure, indicating that NFAT activation precedes NFATc3 over-expression. Moreover, activation of NFAT by ATP increased NFATc3 mRNA levels in astrocyte cultures, suggesting that NFATc3 expression is controlled through an auto-regulatory loop. Meanwhile, stab wound enhanced NFATc3 expression specifically in a subclass of reactive astrocytes confined within the proximal layer of the glial scar, and GFAP immunoreactivity was attenuated in NFATc3-expressing astrocytes. In conclusion, our work establishes NFATc3 as a marker of activation for a specific population of astrocytes in response to brain damage, which may have consequences for neuronal survival.",
