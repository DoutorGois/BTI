     "AB": "Inflammatory responses play critical roles in carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning-induced cerebral injury. The present study investigated whether erythropoietin (EPO) modulates the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) inflammatory signaling pathways in brain injury after acute CO poisoning. EPO (2500 and 5000 U/kg) was injected subcutaneously twice a day after acute CO poisoning for 2 days. At 48 h after treatment, the expression levels of TLR4 and NF-kappaB as well as the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampal tissues were measured. Our results showed that CO poisoning induced a significant upregulation of TLR4, NF-kappaB, and inflammatory cytokines in the injured rat hippocampal tissues. Treatment with EPO remarkably suppressed the gene and protein expression levels of TLR4 and NF-kappaB, as well as the concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in the hippocampal tissues. EPO treatment ameliorated CO poisoning-induced histological edema and neuronal necrosis. These results suggested that EPO protected against CO poisoning-induced brain damage by inhibiting the TLR4-NF-kappaB inflammatory signaling pathway.",
