     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Short wave (SW), a pattern of electromagnetic therapy, achieves an oscillating electromagnetic field. It has been reported that it may have a potential effect on cerebral injury. The present study was designed to investigate the potential role and possible mechanism of SW in focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Secretory pathway Ca(2+)/Mn(2+) ATPase isoform 1 is a major component of Golgi apparatus stress. It has been reported as representative of Golgi apparatus stress. METHODS: Up to 120 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion injury was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Different sessions of SW daily were administered over head after reperfusion from day 1 to day 7. Functional recovery scores, survival rates, infarct volume analysis, electron microscope test, and western blotting studies were used to analyze the therapy. RESULTS: SW protected against neuronal death and apoptosis in cornu ammon 1 region of hippocampus by reducing neuronal deficit, infarct volume, and ultrastructure. SW partly inhibited upregulation of caspase3. In addition, the expression of secretory pathway Ca(2+)-ATPase isoform 1 (SPCA1) was upregulated by SW. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that SW can be protected against focal cerebral I/R injury, and the influence on Golgi apparatus stress might provide us a new perspective in further study. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report using SW to increase expression of SPCA1 indicating modulate Golgi apparatus stress in MCAO and reperfusion model.",
