     "AB": "The objective of this study was to assess whether ascorbic acid (AA), an intracellular anti-oxidant critical for neuronal protection, when added to artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), is able to protect hippocampal (HPC) formation slice preparations from ageing. In this research, the micro-electroencephalographic (EEG) technique was applied. Experiments were performed on 72 HPC formation slices obtained from 12 male Wistar rats. Two series of experiments were conducted: the control experiment, in which ACSF was used as an incubation medium, and the research one, in which ACSF was supplemented with 200 muM AA. The experimental model of carbachol-induced EEG theta rhythm was applied. The following parameters of theta rhythm after 15, 30 and 45 min of recording were analysed: frequency, power, time duration of theta epochs and time duration of intervals between theta epochs. The results show that AA causes a statistically significant decrease in the power of theta rhythm after 15, 30 and 45 min of recording. The time duration of intervals between theta epochs was almost twice as long in slices incubated in ACSF + AA than in ACSF after 45 min of recording. The data obtained indicate that AA does not improve the condition of HPC slices. On the contrary, it worsens the ability of slice preparations to generate theta oscillations. We hypothesize that our data may result from the Fenton reaction or changes in the conformation of connexins.",
