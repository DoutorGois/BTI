     "AB": "The influence of (1S, 3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid [(1S, 3R)-ACPD], an agonist of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), on recovery from in vitro hypoxia was investigated. Transverse hippocampal slices were exposed to a severe hypoxia, and the recovery of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) of CA1 neurons was monitored 1 hr after reoxygenation. If 20 microM (1S, 3R)-ACPD was present during hypoxia, the recovery of the fEPSPs was significantly higher compared to controls. This protective effect was not observed, when the mGluR-antagonist L-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionate (L-AP3, 300 microM) was coapplied with (1S, 3R)-ACPD.",
