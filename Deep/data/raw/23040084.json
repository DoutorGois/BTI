     "AB": "Dysfunctional noradrenergic transmission is related to several neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression. Nowadays, the role of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK)2 subunit containing GIRK channels controlling neuronal intrinsic excitability in vitro is well known. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of GIRK2 subunit mutation on the central noradrenergic transmission in vivo. For that purpose, single-unit extracellular activity of locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons and brain monoamine levels using the HPLC technique were measured in wild-type and GIRK2 mutant mice. Girk2 gene mutation induced significant differences among genotypes regarding burst activity of LC neurons. In fact, the proportion of neurons displaying burst firing was increased in GIRK2 heterozygous mice as compared to that recorded from wild-type mice. Furthermore, this augmentation was even greater in the homozygous genotype. However, neither the basal firing rate nor the coefficient of variation of LC neurons was different among genotypes. Noradrenaline and serotonin basal levels were altered in the dorsal raphe nucleus from GIRK2 heterozygous and homozygous mice, respectively. Furthermore, noradrenaline levels were increased in LC projecting areas such as the hippocampus and amygdale from homozygous mice, although not in the prefrontal cortex. Finally, potency of clonidine and morphine inhibiting LC activity was reduced in GIRK2 mutant mice, although the efficacy remained unchanged. Altogether, the present study supports the role of GIRK2 subunit-containing GIRK channels on the maintenance of tonic noradrenergic activity in vivo. Electric and neurochemical consequences derived from an altered GIRK2-dependent signalling could facilitate the understanding of the neurobiological basis of pathologies related to a dysfunctional monoaminergic transmission.",
