     "AB": "The pharmacological studies show that tianeptine (Stablon) is an original psychotropic drug. In classical and behavioural pharmacology, tianeptine has a novel antidepressant profile, different from other molecules and an anxiolytic effect but different from the benzodiazepines. Tianeptine does not cause sedation and sleeping troubles. In mice, tianeptine does not impair spatial memory but have facilitating effects on both working and reference memory. Tianeptine also increased the focalization of attention in cat and is active on comportmental adaptation models in stress. The electrophysiological data showed that tianeptine increases activity of the hippocampus pyramidal cells and decreases the recovery time after inhibitory substances application. Neurobiochemical studies showed that tianeptine increases serotonin uptake, in rat brain and in rat and human platelets, after acute and chronic treatment. Neuroendocrinology data showed that tianeptine decreases CRF and ACTH levels. Current research on the effect of tianeptine on acetylcholine could explain its anti-stress and memory facilitation activity.",
