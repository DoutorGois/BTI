In this study we describe the use of two different models to demonstrate the ability of Cerebrolysin to reduce microglial activation. The results of these in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that Cerebrolysin might exert a neuroimmunotrophic activity reducing the extent of inflammation and accelerated neuronal death under pathological conditions such as those observed in neurodegenerative diseases.",
