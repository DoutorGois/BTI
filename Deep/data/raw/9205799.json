     "AB": "The present study covers both the effects of MK-801, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, and pentobarbital on cholinergic terminal damage and delayed neuronal death (DND) in ischemic gerbil. To study the above effects, in vivo microdialysis, immunohistochemical, and morphological techniques were used. MK-801 (3 mg/kg) or pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally 1 h or 30 min before 5 min ischemia, respectively. Each estimation was then carried out 4, 7, or 14 days after ischemia. Ischemia induced a significant decrease in acetylcholine (ACh) release and a disappearance of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunoreactivity in the hippocampus in addition to inducing DND. On day 4, MK-801 protected ischemia-induced DND in the hippocampal CA1 subfield. However, MK-801 had no effect against the decrease in ACh release in spite of protection of the decrease in ChAT-immunoreactivity. On day 7 and 14, no protective effect of MK-801 was observed in all estimations. It became clear that the mechanism of cholinergic terminal dysfunction is different from that involved in pyramidal cell death, i.e., excitative neurotoxicity induced by overabundant extracellular glutamate. Pentobarbital also provided protection against DND. However, protective effects of pentobarbital on the decrease in ACh release and the low ChAT-immunoreactivity were incomplete. Our present study indicated a limitation on the efficacy of NMDA receptor antagonist and barbiturate against cerebral ischemia.",
