     "AB": "The effects of electrical stimulation of the medial amygdala (AMYG) and dorsal hippocampus (DHPC) on the rates of 14C transfer from 14C-1-acetate into adrenocortical steroids in adrenal slices of hypophysectomized rats were investigated. The 14C transfer rates into corticosterone were increased by stimulation of the AMYG and DHPC. The 14C transfer rates into cortisol were increased by the AMYG stimulation but were not altered by the DHPC stimulation. From these results, it might be suggested that these limbic structures were involved in the regulation of adrenocortical steroidogenesis without participation of the pituitary.",
