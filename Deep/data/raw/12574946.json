     "AB": "This report concerns a Japanese family with neuropathological findings consistent with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS/PDC) in the Island of Guam. The proband was a 68-year-old woman with an 8-year history of parkinsonism which was followed by psychiatric symptoms and neurogenic amyotrophy 5 years after the onset. She had a family history of parkinsonism associated with dementia in all of her three siblings. They grew up in the Hobara village, a focus of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the Kii Peninsula of Japan in their childhood. Their parents were not consanguineous nor natives of the Kii Peninsula. The brain weight was 1040 g and there were mild frontal lobe atrophy, moderate atrophy of pes hippocampi, decoloration of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus, and atrophy of the anterior root of the spinal cord. The microscopic examinations revealed degeneration of CA1 portion of the hippocampus to the parahippocampus gyrus, substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and spinal anterior horn with Bunina bodies. The spinal pyramidal tracts also mildly degenerated. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) were observed in the cerebral cortex, especially in the cortices from hippocampus to lateral occipitotemporal gyri, basal nucleus of Mynert, basal ganglia, thalamus, substantia nigra and widespread regions of the central nervous system through the brainstem to spinal cord including the nucleus of Onufrowitcz. In spite of a small amount of the senile plaques in the cerebral cortex and Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus, abundant NFT were distributed mainly in the third layer of the cerebral cortex, which is the characteristic feature of ALS/PDC. Thus, this was likely to be an ALS/PDC case outside the Guam Island. A tau mutation was not found on DNA analysis.",
