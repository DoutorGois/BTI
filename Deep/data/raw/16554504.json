     "AB": "A series of experiments was carried out testing the hypothesis that the septal region decreases the hippocampal susceptibility to hyperexcitability states through theta rhythm generation. Medial septal neurons were simultaneously recorded with hippocampal field potentials to investigate the septo-hippocampal function in the pilocarpine model of chronic epilepsy. The theta rhythm from chronically epileptic rats had lower amplitude (20% less) and higher frequency than controls (from 3.38 to 4.25 Hz), suggesting that both generator and pacemaker structures are affected during the epileptic process. At the cellular level, the group of rhythmically bursting firing medial septal neurons, in the epileptic animals, significantly and chronically increased their firing rates in relation to controls (from 13.86 to 29.14 spikes/s). Peristimulus histograms performed around hippocampal sharp waves showed that all high-frequency firing neurons, including rhythmically bursting neurons and most slow firing neurons, decreased firing rates immediately after hippocampal epileptic discharges. Thus inhibitory hippocampo-septal influences prevail during hippocampal epileptic discharges. The occurrence of epileptic discharges was reduced 86-97% of the number observed during spontaneous theta and theta induced by sensory (tail pinch) or chemical stimulation (carbachol), suggesting that the presence of the theta state regardless of how it was produced was responsible for the reduction in epileptic discharge frequency. The understanding of the theta rhythm \"anti-epileptic\" effect at the cellular and molecular levels may result in novel therapeutic approaches dedicated to protect the brain against abnormal excitability states.",
