     "AB": "A quantitative autoradiographic histological study was carried out to examine mechanisms underlying the reduction in the rates of growth and of cell acquisition, including that of granule cells, in the dentate gyrus of hypothyroid rats. Thyroid deficiency in early life had no effect on the replication of intrinsic cells present in the polymorph and granular layers. The pyknotic index was also normal in the \"proliferative zone\", polymorph layer and granule cell layer, indicating that thyroid hormone had no effect on the survival of replicating, migrating or maturing granule cells. By contrast, the arrival of migrating cells from the \"proliferative zone\" to the granular layer was severely retarded in thyroid deficiency. This deficit was rapidly restored after a physiological dose of thyroxine given to hypothyroid rats. The present findings are consistent with our previous proposal that the role of thyroid hormone in the formation and/or the maintenance of nerve cells is related to changes in either cell migration or maturation, rather than to alterations in the replication of germinal cells.",
