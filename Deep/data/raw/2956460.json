     "AB": "The binding sites for [3H]corticosterone (3HB) and [3H]aldosterone (3HA) within the hippocampal area of the mouse brain have been studied by autoradiography in competition experiments. Excess unlabelled aldosterone (A) or corticosterone (B) both abolished the nuclear accumulation of radioactivity within neurons observed after injection of either 3HA or 3HB. Experiments where a subcutaneous injection of a \"pure glucocorticoid' RU26988 was given before injection of 3HA alone showed a marked accumulation of radioactivity within neuronal nuclei of the hippocampus suggesting the presence of 3HA binding sites distinct from classical type II glucocorticoid receptors. In addition, when RU26988 was given before the injection of 3HA associated with a 30- or 100-fold excess of either A or B, the cell nuclear accumulation of radioactivity was no longer observed. These results showed that in our in vivo experimental conditions, B displayed the same ability as A to occupy 3HA binding sites, supporting the view that in mouse hippocampal neuronal nuclei, the aldosterone-binding and corticosterone-preferring sites represent the same molecular entity.",
