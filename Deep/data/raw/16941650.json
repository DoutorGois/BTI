     "AB": "Neuronal progenitors in the adult hippocampus continually proliferate and differentiate to the neuronal lineage, and ischemic insult promotes hippocampal neurogenesis. However, newborn neurons show a progressive reduction in numbers during the initial few weeks, therefore, enhanced survival of newborn neurons seems to be essential for therapeutic strategy. Bcl-2 is a crucial regulator of programmed cell death in CNS development and in apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Therefore, we tested whether Bcl-2 overexpression enhances survival of newborn neurons in the adult mouse hippocampus under normal and ischemic conditions. Many newborn neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus undergo apoptosis. Human Bcl-2 expression in NSE-bcl-2 transgenic mice began at the immature neuronal stage and remained constant in surviving mature neurons. Bcl-2 significantly increased survival of newborn neurons under both conditions, but particularly after ischemia, with decreased cell death of newborn neurons in NSE-bcl-2 transgenic mice. We also clarified the effect by Bcl-2 overexpression of enhanced survival of newborn neurons in primary hippocampal cultures with BrdU labeling. These findings suggest that Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis under normal and ischemic conditions.",
