     "AB": "Synaptophysin and growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) are synaptic proteins colocalized to the presynaptic terminal, and involved in regulating transmitter release and synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have proposed an alteration in the number of synapses in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia. As a corollary, we hypothesized that there may be an alteration in the level of mRNAs that code for synaptic proteins in brains of patients with schizophrenia. Using in situ hybridization, we investigated the levels of synaptophysin and GAP-43 mRNA in the medial temporal lobe of 10 normal subjects, 11 subjects with schizophrenia and 10 psychiatric control subjects. Synaptophysin mRNA levels were significantly reduced in several hippocampal subfields in both the schizophrenic and psychiatric control groups. GAP-43 mRNA levels were not significantly reduced in either group. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to neuroleptic treatment and the pathophysiology of mental illness.",
