     "AB": "Iodine is essential for the synthesis of triiodothyronine (T(3)) and thyroxine (T(4)). Iodine deficiency leads to inadequate thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones deficiency during brain development affects cognitive functions, such as attention, learning, and memory. However, the mechanism underlying these deficits is unclear. To investigate the role of iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism in synaptic plasticity, this study examined the induction of long-term synaptic plasticity (LTP) and expression of immediate early (IEA) gene proteins in rat hippocampus following congenital iodine deficiency or hypothyroidism. Through gestation and lactation, iodine-deficient or hypothyroid dam rats were administered with either iodine-deficient diet or methimazole-added drinking water. Exposure was terminated on postnatal day (PN) 30. In hippocampus of pup rats, the induction of LTP in area CA1 was determined on PN60 and the expression of c-fos and c-jun proteins was examined on PN20, PN30 and PN60. Compared to control pups, both treated groups have shown: (1) significantly lower concentrations of serum FT(3) and FT(4), (2) much smaller population spike (PS) amplitude (p<0.01) and field-excitatory postsynaptic potential (f-EPSP) slope induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) (P<0.01), and (3) significantly lower integrated optical density (IOD) total of c-fos and c-jun expression (P<0.05 or P<0.01). In summary, iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism during critical periods of brain development impair LTP induction and decrease the expression of c-fos and c-jun proteins in hippocampus.",
