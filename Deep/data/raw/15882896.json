     "AB": "In the present study, activity of salt soluble (SS) G1 and detergent soluble (DS) G4 molecular isoforms of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has been investigated in rat brain areas in trained (learned), scopolamine (amnesic) and Tacrine (anti-dementic) treated rats to find out their role in learning and memory functions. AChE was estimated spectrophotometrically at 412 nm in rat brain areas. Isolation and partial purification of molecular isoforms G1 and G4 of AChE was done by gel filtration chromatography. Passive avoidance was used to test learning and memory functions. AChE activity was altered in both the fractions SS and DS of different brain areas following passive avoidance in control, scopolamine treated, tacrine treated and tacrine treatment in scopolamine pretreated rats. The peak AChE activity obtained in the DS (fraction 9) and the SS (fraction 13) fraction following gel filtration chromatography. On the basis of molecular weight fraction 9 (DS) and 13 (SS) represent the G4 and G1, respectively. The pattern of changes in the AChE activity of G1 isoform (fraction 13 of SS) and G4 isoform (fraction 9 of DS) in brain areas were similar to those of SS and DS fraction, respectively. In hippocampus, AChE activity in the fraction G1 isoform (fraction 13 of SS) was decreased only in tacrine treated rats but AChE activity in the G4 isoform (fraction 9 of DS) was decreased in both trained and tacrine treated rats. Changes in activity of G4 isoform of AChE in hippocampus could be correlated with passive avoidance learning, scopolamine induced deficit in passive avoidance and reversal of scopolamine deficit by tacrine.",
