     "AB": "We have investigated the effects of early phases of chronic stress on generation and actions of nitric oxide (NO) in JCR:LA-cp rats both lean (+/+) and obese (cp/cp). Restraint stress was carried out for a 15-min single exposure or for 1 hr every day during 4, 9 or 14 days. The stress reaction was evidenced by significant increase in plasma cortisol. The exposure to stress for 14 days led to a neuronal damage in lean rats as evidenced by a decrease in glutamate uptake and an increase in the release of lactate in synaptosomes. This effect was not observed in obese rats. Concomitantly, the levels of glutamate increased in the hippocampus at 14 days in lean, but not obese rats, that showed higher basal levels of glutamate than lean rats. The activity of NO synthase (NOS) and guanosine cyclic monophosphate levels increased in the hippocampus preceding the neuronal damage. The neuronal lesions were prevented by inhibition of NOS without affecting cortisol levels. In the cardiovascular system, chronic stress exerted no significant effect on blood pressure, aortic contractility or platelet aggregation. However, there were significant changes in plasma nitrite/nitrate that reached maximum at 4 to 9 days. It is concluded that the generation of NO contributes to the systemic response to the organism to stress. In the brain, NO appears to be detrimental as this molecule mediates glutamate-dependent hippocampal damage, this effect being cortisol-independent. In contrast, in the vascular system, increased generation of NO may attenuate the vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregatory effects of catecholamines and other mediators of stress.",
