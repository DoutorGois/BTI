     "AB": "The neuropeptide galanin modulates several physiological functions such as cognition, learning, feeding behavior, and depression, probably via the galanin 1 receptor (GAL-R1). Using an HTS assay based on 125I-human galanin binding to the human galanin-1 receptor (hGAL-R1), we discovered a series of 1,4-dithiin and dithiipine-1,1,4,4-tetroxides that exhibited binding affinity IC50's to hGAL-R1 ranging from 190 to 2700 nM. Two of the dithiepin analogues, 7 and 23, behaved pharmacologically as hGAL-R1 antagonists in secondary assays involving adenylate cyclase activity and GTP binding to G-proteins. Analogues 7 and 23 were also active in functional assays involving galanin, reversing the inhibitory effect of galanin on acetylcholine (ACh) release in rat brain hippocampal slices and electrically-stimulated guinea pig ileum twitch.",
