     "AB": "In the model of trimethyltin (TMT)-induced neurodegeneration in developing rat hippocampus, calretinin (CR)-immunoreactive neurons are selectively spared and even more numerous than in controls. We investigated the possibility of an additional synthesis of CR using RT-PCR. The amount of CR mRNA increased significantly after TMT treatment. CR mRNA production after TMT treatment could hypothetically be regarded as a compensatory phenomenon in developing rats.",
