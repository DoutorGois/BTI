     "AB": "Recent studies have shown that tea polyphenols can cross the blood-brain barrier, inhibit apoptosis and play a neuroprotective role against cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, tea polyphenols can decrease DNA damage caused by free radicals. We hypothesized that tea polyphenols repair DNA damage and inhibit neuronal apoptosis during global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. To test this hypothesis, we employed a rat model of global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. We demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of tea polyphenols immediately after reperfusion significantly reduced apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region; this effect started 6 hours following reperfusion. Immunohistochemical staining showed that tea polyphenols could reverse the ischemia/reperfusion-induced reduction in the expression of DNA repair proteins, X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox factor-1 starting at 2 hours. Both effects lasted at least 72 hours. These experimental findings suggest that tea polyphenols promote DNA damage repair and protect against apoptosis in the brain.",
