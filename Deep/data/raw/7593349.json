     "AB": "By the systemic administration of diethyldithiocarbamate and iron into the rat, nitric oxide radicals produced in the brain during ischemia-hypoxia were trapped. The right hemisphere of the brain was then removed and frozen with liquid nitrogen. With use of recently developed electron paramagnetic resonance imaging instrumentation and techniques, three-dimensional imaging of the production of the nitric oxide radicals in several brains was performed. The results suggest that nitric oxide radicals were produced and trapped in the areas that are known to have high nitric oxide synthase activity, such as cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and substantia nigra. In this ischemia-hypoxia model, which did not interrupt the posterior circulation, the production and trapping of nitric oxide in the cerebellum were approximately 30% of those in the cerebrum.",
