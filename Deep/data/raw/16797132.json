     "AB": "The distribution of protein arginine N-methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) was investigated in the mouse brain using indirect immunofluorescence. PRMT3 was observed to be localized in the cell bodies and dendrites of neurons but not in the axons and glial cells, indicating that PRMT3 is involved in neuronal function. The distribution of the immunoreactive neurons in the brain was uneven, indicating that PRMT3 plays a role in specific neuronal systems such as the motor and limbic systems, as well as functions related to the cerebellum. The present ontogenetic analysis of PRMT1 and PRMT3 using Western blot methodology clearly revealed that PRMT3 develops during the perinatal stage and its expression is maintained even in adulthood. PRMT1, on the other hand, is expressed transiently during the early embryonic stage. These findings indicate that PRMT3 is related with neuronal function in both young and adult brains, while PRMT1 has roles in the immature brain, such as the formation of neural circuits.",
