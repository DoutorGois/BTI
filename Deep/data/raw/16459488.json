     "AB": "The brain and internal organs distribution of 125I-labeled [2-8]-leucopyrokinin ([2-8]-LPK), a truncated analog of leucopyrokinin (LPK), an insect myotropic peptide injected into the lateral brain ventricle was determined in rats. A high accumulation of this analog in adrenals and in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of the brain was found. A lesser but significant [2-8]-LPK accumulation in other internal organs and parts of the brain was also observed. The results of the present study confirm results of our previous study performed on the distribution of labeled native LPK in rats. A possible significance of obtained results for the brain function was discussed.",
