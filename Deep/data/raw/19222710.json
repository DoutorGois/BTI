     "AB": "Drebrin is a well-known side-binding protein of F-actin in the brain. Immunohistochemical data suggest that the peripheral parts of growing axons are enriched in the drebrin E isoform and mature axons are not. It has also been observed that drebrin E is concentrated in the growth cones of PC12 cells. These data strongly suggest that drebrin E plays a role in axonal growth during development. In this study, we used primary hippocampal neuronal cultures to analyze the role of drebrin E. Immunocytochemistry showed that within axonal growth cones drebrin E specifically localized to the transitional zone, an area in which dense networks of F-actins and microtubules overlapped. Over-expression of drebrin E caused drebrin E and F-actin to accumulate throughout the growth cone and facilitated axonal growth. In contrast, knockdown of drebrin E reduced drebrin E and F-actin in the growth cone and prevented axonal growth. Furthermore, inhibition of myosin II ATPase masked the promoting effects of drebrin E over-expression on axonal growth. These results suggest that drebrin E plays a role in axonal growth through actin-myosin interactions in the transitional zone of axonal growth cones.",
