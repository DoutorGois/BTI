     "AB": "Although the key contributors of altering neurological function in hepatic encephalopathy are relatively well known, the electrophysiological mechanism of CA1 damage, a key vulnerable area during hyperammonemia, have not yet been defined. Therefore, here we focus on the electrophysiological mechanisms of cognitive impairments following bile duct ligation (BDL). We performed patch-clamp recordings from the CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampus of male Wistar rats, which underwent sham or BDL surgery. A striking electrophysiological change of hippocampal neurons in experimental model of BDL was observed in the present study. Spontaneous firing frequency and rate of action potential (AP) rebound was decreased and afterhyperpolarization amplitude (AHP) was increased significantly in hippocampal cells of BDL animals compared to sham group. Together, the results suggest that altered intrinsic properties of the hippocampal neurons may contribute to the cognitive abnormalities during hepatic encephalopathy (HE), highlighting the electrophysiological mechanisms for providing new treatments against HE.",
