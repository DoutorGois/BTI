     "AB": "This article describes a study on neural noise and neural signal feature extraction, targeting real-time spike sorting with miniaturized microchip implementation. Neuronal signature, noise shaping, and adaptive bandpass filtering are reported as the techniques to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A subset of informative samples of the waveforms is extracted as features for classification. Quantitative and comparative experiments with both synthesized and animal data are included to evaluate different feature extraction approaches. In addition, a preliminary hardware implementation has been realized using an integrated circuit.",
