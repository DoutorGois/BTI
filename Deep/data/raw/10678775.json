     "AB": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats received a daily injection of 60 mg/kg of lidocaine (> 30 days). Twenty percent of rats developed convulsions (kindled rats) and remaining rats did not show convulsions (non-kindled rats). The level of immunoreactive somatostatin (IR-SRIF) in kindled rats was significantly increased in amygdala than that in non-kindled rats and control rats. Immunoreactive neuropeptide Y (IR-NPY) contents in kindled rats were significantly increased in amygdala, hippocampus, cortex and striatum compared to non-kindled and control rats. The expression of SRIF mRNA in kindled rats produced a significant increase in amygdala, while NPY mRNA in kindled rats showed an elevated expression in both amygdala and hippocampus. These results coincide with the previous findings with the elevated expression of SRIF and NPY mRNA in electrically and pharmacologically kindled models, suggesting the important role of these peptides in the kindling phenomenon.",
