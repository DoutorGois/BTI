     "AB": "[Cyt6]AVP-(3-9), an intermediate in the metabolism of AVP-(1-9) in vitro, was used to investigate the mechanism of formation of centrally active AVP metabolites. Exposure of [Cyt6]AVP-(3-9) to rat brain membranes resulted in formation of [Cyt6]AVP-(4-9), -(5-9), [pGlu4, Cyt6]AVP-(4-9) and AVP-(3-5), which were isolated and chemically identified. Products derived from cleavage of the C-terminus of the substrate were absent. Time-course experiments further indicated that the conversion process is predominantly mediby an aminopeptidase-like mechanism. The conversion of [Cyt6]AVP-(3-9) by membranes from hippocampus, amygdala and septum was quantitatively and qualitatively similar. The results point to a major role of aminopeptidase activity in the metabolic conversion of AVP and the formation of centrally active AVP metabolites.",
