     "AB": "Maitotoxin is a potent toxin that activates voltage and receptor-mediated Ca2+ channels, resulting in Ca2+ overload and rapid cell death. We report that maitotoxin-induced cell death is associated with activation of calpain but not caspase-3 proteases in septo-hippocampal cell cultures. Calpain and caspase-3 activation were examined by accumulation of protease-specific breakdown products to alpha-spectrin. Cell death manifested exclusively necrotic-like characteristics including round, shrunken nuclei, even distribution of chromatin, absence of DNA fragmentation and failure of protein synthesis inhibition to reduce cell death. Necrotic cell death was observed in neurons and astroglia. Calpain inhibitor II inhibited calpain-specific processing of alpha-spectrin and significantly reduced cell death. The pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-D-DCB, nominally attenuated cell death. Results suggest that: (1) calpain, but not caspase-3, is activated as a result of maitotoxin-induced Ca2+ influx; (2) necrotic cell death caused by maitotoxin exposure is partially mediated by calpain activation; (3) maitotoxin is a useful tool to investigate pathological mechanisms of necrosis.",
