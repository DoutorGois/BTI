     "AB": "Electrical stimulation (88 HZ) of the lateral hypothalamus elicited a sustained theta response at hippocampal recording sites of rats immobilized with succinylcholine. By pairing this unconditioned stimulus with a 10-sec presentation of a light, conditioned theta responses were demonstrated in as few as 40 trials. Spectral analysis of hippocampal bioelectric patterns during acquisition, extinction, and reconditioning indicated that the earliest change as a result of conditioning is a loss of power in EEG frequency below 8 HZ, followed by the development of a peak at 8 HZ with further conditioning. Extinction was associated with an increase in power in the frequencies below 8 HZ. When the conditioned rats were tested in the absence of the neuromuscular blocking agent, the conditioned stimulus elicited a theta response that was associated with slow motor activity on 70% of the trials.",
