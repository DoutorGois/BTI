     "AB": "Whole cell voltage clamp recordings were used to investigate the effects of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) agonists on the voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons. TXA2 agonists [1S-[1 alpha, 2 beta(5Z), 3 alpha(1E, 3S*)4 alpha ]]-7-[3-[3-hydroxy-4-(4'-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl]-7-oxabicyclo [2,2,1]heptan-2-yl]-5-heptenoic acid (I-BOP) and U-46619, reversibly suppressed the whole cell Ca2+ currents in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect was blocked by specific TXA2 receptor antagonist, SQ-29548. I-BOP as well as U-46619 inhibited both omega-conotoxin GVIA (CgTx)-sensitive and nimodipine sensitive Ca2+ currents but had no effect on CgTx/nimodipine insensitive Ca2+ currents. The I-BOP and U-46619 inhibition of Ca2+ currents was blocked by internal dialysis of hippocampal neurons with specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, NPC-15437 and PKC inhibitor-(19-36). Pretreatment of hippocampal neurons with either 5 micrograms/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) or 5 micrograms/ml cholera toxin (CTX) did not significantly affect the suppression of the Ca2+ currents by I-BOP and U-46619. Dialyzing with 1 mM guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) or 1 mM GDP significantly attenuated the I-BOP or U-46619 action. These results demonstrate that TXA2 agonists inhibit both CgTx- and nimodipine-sensitive Ca2+ currents but not CgTx/nimodipine-insensitive currents in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons via a PTX- and CTX-insensitive G protein-coupled activation of the PKC pathway.",
