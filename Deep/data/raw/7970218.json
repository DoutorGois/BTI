     "AB": "In the present in vivo experimental study the complexity alterations of the hippocampal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity were investigated prior and during the maintenance phase of long-term potentiation (LTP), using analytical methods based on the recent concepts of deterministic chaos. LTP was induced in the hippocampal dentate hilus after stimulation of the medial perforant path of the rat's brain. During the experimental procedure hippocampal EEG epochs were recorded prior and after the induction of LTP. Dimensionality computations performed on these epochs showed a maintained relative reduction in the correlation dimension during the maintenance phase of LTP. This result might suggest that different functional states of the brain are governed by different degrees of complexity and that the altered efficacy in the information process, as it is achieved by the induction of LTP, modifies the spontaneous EEG activity of the potentiated hippocampal area in a plastic manner.",
