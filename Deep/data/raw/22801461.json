     "AB": "Pilocarpine-induced seizures induce an ectopic projection of hippocampal mossy fibers (MFs). Here, the sprouting was directly examined using TV-42 mice that express synaptopHluorin (SpH) selectively in the MF boutons. The SpH was ectopically expressed in the inner molecular layer (IML) of the dentate gyrus in typical mice after seizures, but were not always accompanied by the zinc fluorescence. The expression of SpH also has a tendency to be enhanced in layers of the CA3a region. It is suggested that the abnormal connection of neurons is more widespread than expected based on the previous zinc-detecting methods.",
