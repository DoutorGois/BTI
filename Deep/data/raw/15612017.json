     "AB": "The zinc finger-homeodomain (ZFH) transcription factors contain a zinc finger motif and a homeodomain that might regulate neural and mesenchymal cell differentiation. We have cloned the ZFH4 gene that encodes a protein with structures closely related to ATBF1. In order to study the expression pattern of ZFH4 in the developing rat brain, we raised an antibody against a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of ZFH4. Western blotting with this antibody identified a gene product of 390 kDa in the normal rat brain. Levels of the protein were high in the brainstem at embryonic and neonatal periods and in the midbrain and diencephalon in neonatal rat brain. In addition, the corresponding mRNA of 12.5 kb was detected by Northern blotting. An immunolocalization study showed that postmitotic neurons in the brainstem were the major site of ZFH4 expression, and the levels of expression varied depending on age and anatomical sites. Expression was transient and weak in precursor cells at early neurogenesis. Although ZFH4 levels decreased after birth, ZFH4 continued to be expressed in the mature neurons including DOPA decarboxylase-positive neurons. High levels of expression were also detected in non-neuronal cells of the subcommissural organ, but the expression was almost undetectable throughout precursor cells to mature neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The spatial and temporal expression patterns closely resembled those of ATBF1, and we detected neurons that expressed ZFH4, ATBF1, or both. We postulate that ZFH4 participates in the regulation of neural cell maturation or of region-specific differentiation of the brain.",
