     "AB": "The subcellular effects of thyroidectomy in selected brain regions of Cynomolgus monkey were analyzed. 20 days after operation the respiratory rates, the activities of succinate cytochrome c reductase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase were decreased in mitochondria isolated from all brain structures. The highest reduction (30%) was found in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Cerebellar and striatal activities were reduced by about 20%. A smaller decrease (15%) was observed in thalamus. The effects of thyroidectomy on in vitro RNA synthesis were followed in cerebral cortex, cerebellum and thalamus. In the three analyzed regions, the activities of nucleolar and nucleoplasmic RNA polymerases dropped by 40%. Replacement therapy with T4 (2.5 micrograms/kg/day) or T3 (1 microgram/kg/day) administered immediately after thyroidectomy for 20 days, maintained mitochondrial and nuclear activities at normal level.",
