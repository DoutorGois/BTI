     "AB": "1. Voltage-dependent calcium currents in embryonic (E18) hippocampal neurons cultured for 1-14 days were investigated using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. 2. Calcium currents were isolated by removing K+ from both the internal and external solutions. In most recordings the external solution contained tetrodotoxin, tetraethylammonium ions, and low concentrations of Na+, whereas the internal solution contained the large cations and anions, N-methyl-D-glucamine and methanesulphonate, and an adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) regenerating system (Forscher and Oxford, 1985) to retard \"run-down\" of Ca currents. 3. Under these conditions, the sustained inward current triggered during depolarizing steps was enhanced when extracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]0) was raised from 2 to 10 mM and abolished when [Ca2+]0 was lowered to 0.1 mM or by addition of Co2+ ions. These results indicate that the inward current was carried primarily by Ca2+ ions and was designated ICa. This current may be comparable to the \"high-voltage-activated\" Ca current described in other preparations. 4. In cells cultured for 1-3 days, ICa was small or absent (less than 20 pA for cells 1 day in culture and less than 80 pA for cells 3 days in culture). Although ICa decayed considerably during depolarizing steps, there was little evidence of the transient calcium current (T current) that was recorded in approximately 40% of cells cultured longer than 6 days. Maximal (i.e., the largest) ICa increased from 20 to 80 pA in 1- to 3-day cells to 150-450 pA in cells cultured for longer than 6 days. 5. The decay of ICa elicited by depolarizations from holding potentials of -60 mV or more negative was usually greatest for the maximal ICa. Replacement of extracellular Ca2+ (4 mM) with Ba2+ (2 mM) resulted in a substantial decrease in the extent of decay of ICa and a shift of the I-V relation in the hyperpolarizing direction. 6. Qualitative data obtained from experiments in which different levels of internal Ca2+ buffering were employed demonstrated that, on average, the decay of ICa was reduced as the capacity and/or rate of buffering was increased. The mean decay of ICa in cells buffered with 5 mM 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) was 9 +/- 7 (SD) %, (n = 12) and 25 +/- 12%, (n = 12) for cells buffered with the same concentration of ethyleneglycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
