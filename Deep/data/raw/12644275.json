     "AB": "The behavioral effects of nitrous oxide (N(2)O) were antagonized by non-specific inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). To identify the isoform of NOS involved in this response, mice were pretreated with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (AS-ODN) against neuronal NOS, and then tested in a light/dark exploration paradigm. The AS-ODN but not the mismatch ODN significantly antagonized N(2)O induced behavior and also reduced NOS activity in the cerebellum and hippocampus. These results implicate neuronal NOS in the N(2)O response.",
