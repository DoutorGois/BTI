     "AB": "We have examined the effects of postnatal handling of rat pups from Days 1 to 21 on the development of the intracellular, glucocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus, and pituitary transcortin, and corticoid binding globulin in plasma. All animals were sacrificed 10-14h following adrenalectomy and the in vitro receptor assays were performed using 3H dexamethasone (intracellular receptors) or [3H] corticosterone (transcortin and corticoid binding globulin). Early handling resulted in a 30-40% increase in 3H dexamethasone binding (increase in Bmax with no change in Kd) in the hippocampus. In the pituitary handling was associated with a decrease in transcortin binding. There was no effect on plasma corticoid binding globulin. When tested as adults, nonhandled animals hypersecreted corticosterone following the termination of a stressor. This suggests a more efficient adrenocortical negative-feedback system in the handled animals and these data are consistent with previous work on the relationship between hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors and adrenocortical stress recovery.",
