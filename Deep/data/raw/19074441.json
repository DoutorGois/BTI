     "AB": "Progressive neurodegeneration and decline of cognitive functions are major hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). Neurodegeneration in AD correlates with dysfunction of diverse signal transduction mechanisms, such as the G-protein-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis mediated by Galphaq/11. We report here that impaired Galphaq/11-stimulated signaling in brains of AD patients and mice correlated with the appearance of cross-linked oligomeric angiotensin II AT2 receptors sequestering Galphaq/11. Amyloid beta (Abeta) was causal to AT2 oligomerization, because cerebral microinjection of Abeta triggered AT2 oligomerization in the hippocampus of mice in a dose-dependent manner. Abeta induced AT2 oligomerization by a two-step process of oxidative and transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking. The induction of AT2 oligomers in a transgenic mouse model with AD-like symptoms was associated with Galphaq/11 dysfunction and enhanced neurodegeneration. Vice versa, stereotactic inhibition of AT2 oligomers by RNA interference prevented the impairment of Galphaq/11 and delayed Tau phosphorylation. Thus, Abeta induces the formation of cross-linked AT2 oligomers that contribute to the dysfunction of Galphaq/11 in an animal model of Alzheimer disease.",
