     "AB": "Previous research suggests that 5-HT1A receptors are altered with exposure to chronic stress. No previous studies have examined the effect of acute stress on 5-HT1A. Using receptor autoradiography it was observed that there were no differences in [3H]-8-OH-DPAT binding between control rats and rats that received 20 minutes of restraint stress 2 hours prior to sacrifice. This study suggests that the changes in 5-HT1A receptor density associated with chronic stress develop over the course of repeated stress.",
