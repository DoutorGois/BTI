     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) at the basal-dendritic synapses of CA1 pyramidal cells was induced by a single 200 Hz stimulation train (0.5-1 sec duration) in freely behaving rats during one of four behavioral states: awake-immobility (IMM), walking, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement sleep (REM). Field EPSPs generated by basal-dendritic excitation of CA1 were recorded before and up to 1 d after the tetanus. After a tetanus during any behavioral state, basal-dendritic LTP was >170% of the baseline for the first hour after the tetanus and decayed to approximately 120% 1 d after. LTP induced during walking was significantly larger than that induced during IMM, SWS, or REM, which had similar LTP magnitudes. To test the hypothesis that septohippocampal cholinergic activity enhanced LTP during walking as compared with IMM, rats were either pretreated with muscarinic cholinergic antagonist scopolamine or injected with IgG192-saporin in the medial septum to selectively lesion cholinergic septohippocampal neurons. Pretreatment with scopolamine decreased the LTP induced during walking but did not affect that induced during IMM, such that the difference between the LTP induced during walking and IMM was abolished after scopolamine. Rats injected with IgG192-saporin showed no difference in the LTP induced during walking and IMM, and scopolamine did not reduce the LTP during walking. In contrast, sham-lesion rats showed larger LTP induced during walking than IMM, and the LTP induced during walking was attenuated by scopolamine. This is the first demonstration of an enhancement of hippocampal LTP by physiologically activated cholinergic inputs.",
