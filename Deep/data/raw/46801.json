     "AB": "The study was planned to see if the hippocampus has an influence on fast wave sleep (FWS) as well as on slow wave sleep (SWS). From 8 male cats EEG, EMG and EOG were recorded for 24 h, first under normal conditions, secondly after cortical damage to the dorsal marginal portion of posterior ectosylvian gyrus, and thirdly following hippocampectomy done through the cortical damage. From the records, SWS, FWS and the sleep state (defined as a sequence of SWS or SWS-FWS phases between two successive waking states) were measured in terms of their occurrence, the mean duration and the total time they occupied in the day, night and 24 h. In addition, sleep sequences were classified according to the number of constituent sleep phases. Cortical damage did not affect SWS, FWS, or sleep state with regard to their occurrence, the mean duration, and the total time they occupied in 24 h. Nor did it affect the proportion of short and long sequences. The circadian variation of sleep was clearly retained. Hippocampectomy significantly reduced the total time occupied by sleep state, SWS and FWS, increased the occurrence of sleep state and SWS phase against decreased incidence of FWS phase, and reduced the mean duration of sleep state and SWS phase. Hippocampectomy also significantly increased the occurrence of sleep sequences with only one SWS phase at the cost of sequences with alternating SWS and FWS phases. Following hippocampectomy, the circadian variation of sleep was not only retained, but actually exagerated. The hippocampus in inferred to facilitate the FWS as well as the SWS phase of sleep.",
