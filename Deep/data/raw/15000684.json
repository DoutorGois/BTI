     "AB": "Six weeks after bilateral olfactory bulbectomy, a peptide with molecular weight of 4 kD was revealed in extracts of the neocortex and hippocampus from mice. Using monoclonal antibodies 4G8, this peptide was identified as beta-amyloid. Its level was significantly higher in the bulbectomized animals than in sham-operated mice. The bulbectomized mice displayed sharp impairment in spatial memory when tested in the Morris water maze. The results suggest that bulbectomy initiates in the brain a pathological process similar to human Alzheimer's disease in location, biochemistry, and behavioral manifestations.",
