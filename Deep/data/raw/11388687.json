     "AB": "The present study investigated the effect of adenosine on glial glutamate efflux. Adenosine (from 1 nM to 100 microM) enhanced the release from cultured rat glial cells in a bell-shaped dose-responsive manner for the hippocampus and in a dose-dependent manner for the superior colliculus, and a similar increase was obtained with the A2a adenosine receptor agonist, 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl) phenethylamino-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine hydrochloride (CGS21680), but not with the A1 adenosine receptor agonist, N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA). Adenosine and CGS21680 also enhanced glutamate efflux from Xenopus oocytes injected with the poly (A)+ mRNAs derived from cultured glial cells for the hippocampus and the superior colliculus together with and without the A2a adenosine receptor mRNA, but instead such increase was not found in oocytes expressing A2a adenosine receptors alone. The results of the present study thus suggest that adenosine enhances glutamate efflux from glial cells via A2a adenosine receptors, and this may represent a mechanism underlying the facilitatory action of adenosine on hippocampal and superior colliculus neurotransmissions.",
