     "AB": "BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence in support of the presence of abnormal central changes (compared to healthy controls) in functional dyspepsia (FD) in addition to the peripheral changes in gastrointestinal tract. PURPOSE: This systematic review aims to provide an integrative understanding of the abnormal functional brain activity, visceral sensation, dyspeptic symptoms, and psychological changes of FD. Electronic and hand searches were conducted to identify functional neuroimaging studies involving FD patients. Sixteen studies were selected and divided into three categories: 10 resting state studies, three visceral distention studies, and three acupuncture studies. Changes were reported in several brain areas in FD patients including the frontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala. These brain activity changes were associated with visceral hypersensitivity, dyspeptic symptoms, poorer quality of life, anxiety, and depression. The results show that FD is associated with functional abnormalities in sensory and pain modulation, emotion, saliency, and homeostatic processing regions. The diversity of conditions, heterogeneous results, poorly standardized diagnoses of FD, and various comorbidities may be responsible for the variability in the results.",
