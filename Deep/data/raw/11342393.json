     "AB": "Although past research has indicated that stress and the accompanying increase in glucocorticoids compromises hippocampal neurons, little is known about the effect of stress on hippocampal glial cells. In the current study, male rats were exposed to activity-stress (A-S) for six days; this comprised housing with an activity wheel and restricted access (1h/day) to food. Physiological data (e.g., relative adrenal and thymus weights, gastric ulceration) suggested that the A-S rats experienced more stress than pair-fed (no wheel) and control (fed ad libitum, no wheel) rats. Whereas stress did not influence the quantitative morphology of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive cells, a semi-quantitative analysis revealed that the A-S rats had significantly more (30%) GFAP-immunoreactive cells in the hippocampal CA3 region than the control rats. Based on the present findings, it appears that the hippocampal astrocytic response to chronic stress may be similar to the response found in endangered, or challenged hippocampal environments, such as in ischemia.",
