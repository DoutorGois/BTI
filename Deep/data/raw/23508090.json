     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is an illicit, recreational drug that causes cellular death and neurotoxicity. This study evaluates the effects of different doses of MDMA on the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and genes in the hippocampus of adult rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this expremental study,a total of 20 male Sprague Dawley rats (200-250 g ) were treated with MDMA (0, 5, 10, 20 mg/kg i.p. twice daily) for 7 days. Seven days after the last administration of MDMA, the rats were killed. Bax and Bcl-2 genes in addition to protein expressions were detected by western blot and reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and p</=0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Our results showed that MDMA caused dose dependent up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 in the hippocampus. There was a significant alteration in bcl-2 and bax genes density. CONCLUSION: Changes in apoptosis-related proteins and respective genes relating to Bax and Bcl-2 might be involved in the molecular mechanism of MDMA-induced apoptosis.",
