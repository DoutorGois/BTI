     "AB": "The regional and cellular distribution of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 and -2 following cerebral ischemia has not been ascertained. Employing the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and hypoxia-ischemia (HI) models of unilateral brain injury, the aim was to elucidate immunolocalization of HO-1 and HO-2. Animals were sacrificed 3 days post-ischemia and immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were utilized to determine HO-1 and HO-2 expression. In the ipsilateral hemisphere following HI, HO-1 immunoreactivity was significantly upregulated in many neuronal and glial populations (including the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus). HO-1 was also detected in macrophages/microglia within the infarct. In addition to widespread neuronal HO-2 labelling, HO-2 was also expressed in vascular endothelial cells. Inflammatory cells within the infarct of MCAO and HI animals were surprisingly immunoreactive for HO-2, but only HI animals had significantly elevated HO-2 protein expression in the ipsilateral hemisphere. This may be due to the presence of global hypoxia in the HI model which can upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor and subsequent proliferation of endothelial cells. This report of HO-2 protein expression upregulation following HI coupled with an increase in HO-1 immunoreactivity suggests that this response may be implicated in reducing cell death or repairing damage induced by cerebral ischemia.",
