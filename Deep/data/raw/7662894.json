     "AB": "The editing status of mRNA at the Q/R site of the AMPA/kainate type glutamate receptor (GluR) subunits A, B, 5 and 6 modulates the ion selectivity of glutamate receptor operated ion channels. We hypothesized that a long-lasting dysfunction of this editing process after an ischeamic insult may be involved in the process of delayed neuronal cell death. In order to test this hypothesis, the editing status of the GluRs was determined in the hippocampus of rats up to 24 h after 10 min of global ischaemia. No statistical significant differences were found in the hippocampus of animals after ischaemia compared with controls. It is concluded that delayed neuronal cell death is not mediated by a less selective or less efficient mRNA editing process of the different glutamate receptor subunits in the hippocampus.",
