     "AB": "In previous studies we and others have found that activation of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) facilitate expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) of reactivity to afferent stimulation in hippocampal slices, with a more pronounced action in the ventral hippocampus. We have also been able to link the involvement of synaptopodin (SP), an actin-binding protein, with neuronal plasticity via its interaction with RyRs. To test this link more directly, we have now compared the ability of ryanodine to convert short-term to LTP in hippocampal slices taken from normal and SP-knockout (SPKO) mice. Indeed, SPKO hippocampus expresses lower concentrations of RyRs and in slices of these mice ryanodine is unable to facilitate conversion of short-term to LTP. These observations link functionally SP with calcium stores.",
