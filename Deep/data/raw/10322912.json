     "AB": "AIM: To study the effects of two constituents L-6a and L-10 from the leaves of Luffa cylinderica Roem on learning, memory, and hippocampal somatostatin in rats. METHODS: The learning and memory in rats were determined using the passive avoidance response of shuttle-box, by i.c.v. Somatostatin in hippocampus was determined with immunohistochemical and images analyses. RESULTS: L-6a 25 micrograms raised memory-keeping activity (P < 0.05) in rats. L-6a 25 micrograms increased the surface density and number density of somatostatin-like immureactant (Som-LI) (P < 0.05). L-10 25 and 50 micrograms increased the surface density and number density of Som-LI (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: L-6a 25 micrograms enhanced memory-keeping activity and increased the surface density and number density of Som-LI in rats. L-10 shows a tendency to enhance memory-keeping activity but no evident, but it increases the surface density and number density of Som-LI.",
