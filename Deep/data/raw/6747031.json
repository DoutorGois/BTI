     "AB": "The genesis of resting microglia in the gray matter of mouse hippocampus was studied by 3H-thymidine autoradiography in combination with electron microscopy. Newborn mice were injected with 3H-thymidine singly or repeatedly at different postnatal stages, and killed shortly after the injection or after various intervals. Tissue specimens of the hippocampus at CA1 and CA2 were processed for light and electron microscopic autoradiography. The results showed that at least 91% of glial cells in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampus are produced after birth. About three-fourths of astroglia in this area are produced before the sixth postnatal day, and a larger part of resting microglia are formed after the ninth postnatal day. Morphological transition can be traced from either proliferating cells in the stratum radiatum at late postnatal days to resting microglia, or from those in early postnatal days to astroglia. A continuous morphological transition was observed between the proliferating cells at the late postnatal days (microglial production period) and those at the early postnatal days (astroglial production period). The latter retain some fine structural characteristics similar to small glioblasts in the subependymal layer. These findings strongly suggest that resting microglia, as well as astroglia, are derived from glioblasts, and are of neurectodermal origin.",
