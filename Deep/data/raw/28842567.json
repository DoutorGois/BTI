     "AB": "Diffuse atrophy including the insula was previously demonstrated in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients but little is known about the prodromal stage of DLB (pro-DLB). In this prospective study, we used SPM8-DARTEL to measure gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy in pro-DLB patients (n = 54), prodromal Alzheimer's disease (pro-AD) patients (n = 16), DLB patients at the stage of dementia (mild-DLB) (n = 15), and Alzheimer's disease patients at the stage of dementia (mild-AD) (n = 28), and compared them with healthy elderly controls (HC, n = 22). Diminished GM volumes were found in bilateral insula in pro-DLB patients, a trend to significance in right hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus in pro-AD patients, in left insula in mild-DLB patients, and in medial temporal lobes and insula in mild-AD patients. The comparison between prodromal groups did not showed any differences. The comparison between groups with dementia revealed atrophy around the left middle temporal gyrus in mild-AD patients. Reduced WM volume was observed in mild-DLB in the pons. The insula seems to be a key region in DLB as early as the prodromal stage. MRI studies looking at perfusion, and functional and anatomical connectivity are now needed to better understand the role of this region in DLB.",
