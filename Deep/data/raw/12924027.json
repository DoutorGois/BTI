     "AB": "It is discovered that chronic consumption of ethanol induced decrease of carboxypeptidase H activity in striatum by 27%; increase of carboxypeptidase M activity in hippocampus by 67% and decrease in cerebral hemispheres by 34%; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-inhibited carboxypeptidase activity increase in hypothalamus by 141%, in striatum by 60% and in optic and lamina quadrigemina by 34%. The role of basic carboxypeptidases in mechanisms of ethanol influence on the peptidergic systems are discussed.",
