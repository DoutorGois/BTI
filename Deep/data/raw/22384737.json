     "AB": "Interrelations of the hippocampus and medial septal area (MSA) in the theta band (4-8 Hz) were studied during seizures produced by electrical kindling in waking guinea pigs. Field activity (EEG) was analyzed using the wavelet transform. A decrease in coherence of theta-oscillations in the hippocampus and MSA was observed during seizures. Phase analysis showed that in the beginning of kindling the MSA led in phase, but after formation of the pathological focus, MSA lagged the hippocampus. The data may contribute to understanding mechanisms of temporal lobe epilepsy.",
