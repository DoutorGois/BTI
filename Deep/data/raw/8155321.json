     "AB": "cDNA (CIC-3) encoding a protein kinase C-regulated chloride channel was cloned and characterized. The open reading frame encodes 760 amino acids, which possess significantly amino acid identity with previously cloned CIC chloride channels. The chloride currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes injected with CIC-3 cRNA were completely blocked by activation of protein kinase C by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. Abundant expression of CIC-3 mRNA was observed in rat brain, especially in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum. These findings suggest that CIC-3 may play an important role in neuronal cell function through regulation of membrane excitability by protein kinase C.",
