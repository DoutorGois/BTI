     "AB": "We have reported that acute d-amphetamine increases extracellular concentrations (efflux) of neurotensin-like immunoreactivity (NT-LI) and neuropeptide Y-LI (NPY-LI) in the ventral striatum (VSTR) of freely moving rats, effects that are abolished by chronic administration of haloperidol and risperidone admixed to food pellets. In this study we further investigated the d-amphetamine effects on NT-LI and NPY-LI efflux in VSTR and their content in selected brain regions. Rats received haloperidol, risperidone or vehicle for 30days and saline or d-amphetamine either on days 22-29 and/or day 30. Seven day d-amphetamine administration decreased basal NT-LI and NPY-LI efflux in vehicle-treated rats; pretreatment with haloperidol counteracted these effects, while pretreatment with risperidone had effect only on NT-LI. Acute d-amphetamine after the seven day d-amphetamine increased NT-LI only. Pretreatment with haloperidol or risperidone abolished the effects of acute d-amphetamine on NT-LI and NPY-LI. Acute and seven day d-amphetamine increased NT-LI and NPY-LI contents in striatum; seven day d-amphetamine also increased NT-LI in frontal and occipital cortex and both NT-LI and NPY-LI in hippocampus. Our results suggest that NT and NPY are involved in both the pathophysiology and the therapeutics of schizophrenia.",
