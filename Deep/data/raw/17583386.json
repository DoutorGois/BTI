     "AB": "Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) has been implicated as a mechanism of ischemia/hypoxia-induced cerebral injury. The current study was designed to explore the involvement of p38 MAPK in the development of cerebral hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) by observing the changes in dual phosphorylation (p-p38 MAPK) at threonine180 and tyrosine182 sites, protein expression, and cellular distribution of p-p38 MAPK in the brain of HPC mice. We found that the p-p38 MAPK levels, not protein expression, increased significantly (p<0.05) in the regions of frontal cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of mice in response to repetitive hypoxic exposure (H1-H6, n=6 for each group) when compared to values of the control normoxic group (H0, n=6) using Western blot analysis. Similar results were also confirmed by an immunostaining study of the p-p38 MAPK location in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of mice from HPC groups. To further define the cell type of p-p38 MAPK positive cells, we used a double-labeled immunofluorescent staining method to co-localize p-p38 MAPK with neurofilaments heavy chain (NF-H, neuron-specific marker), S100 (astrocyte-specific marker), and CD11b (microglia-specific maker), respectively. We found that the increased p-p38 MAPK occurred in microglia of cortex and hippocampus, as well as in neurons of hypothalamus of HPC mice. These results suggest that the cell type-specific activation of p38 MAPK in the specific brain regions might contribute to the development of cerebral HPC mechanism in mice.",
