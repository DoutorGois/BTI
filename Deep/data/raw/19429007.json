     "AB": "Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) is a transcriptional regulator that shows widespread distribution in the peripheral organs of the body. However, it remains uncertain where KLF6 is expressed in the adult forebrain under physiological conditions. Therefore, the present study investigated the spatial patterns of KLF6 expression and identified cell types expressing KLF6 in the forebrain. KLF6 immunoreactivity was widely seen throughout the forebrain including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, septum, amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus, and hypothalamus. Moreover, KLF6-positive cells were also detected in the radial migratory stream (RMS) and subventricular zone. Immunofluorescent double-labeling revealed that KLF6-immunoreactive cells were co-localized with neuronal nuclei or platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, a mature neuronal and endothelial marker, respectively, in most forebrain regions. In the RMS, KLF6 was co-expressed with polysialic neural cell adhesion molecule, a marker of neuronal progenitor cells. This is the first report showing that KLF6 protein is expressed in various regions of the adult forebrain and KLF6-positive cells manifest neuronal or endothelial phenotypes under physiological conditions.",
