     "AB": "With various constituents in ginkgo biloba extract, the detailed internal mechanism underlying a reduction in anxiety and improvements to learning and memory from GBE is not well understood. The present study investigated whether bilobalide, an important constituent in GBE, could affect anxiety, spatial learning and memory in male mice and whether hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor expression is associated with alteration in these behaviors. Mice were treated orally either with sesame seed oil or one of three dosages of bilobalide (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) daily until testing. A series of behavioral tests showed that repeated bilobalide treatment decreased levels of anxiety-like behavior and increased locomotor activity in open field and elevated plus maze tests. Treatment with bilobalide also shortened the time taken to find the platform in a Morris water-maze test. Mice exposed to bilobalide showed higher and dose-dependent levels of glucocorticoid receptor expression in the hippocampus. These results suggest that bilobalide reduces anxiety levels and enhances spatial learning and memory, possibly through an increase in hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor expression. This finding sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the effect of ginkgo biloba extract on behavior and also provides an important candidate drug in treatment of anxiety, depression, hypomnesia and amnesia.",
