     "AB": "The effects of aluminum chloride (AlCl3) on sodium current (INa), the transient outward potassium (IA) and delayed rectifier potassium currents (IK) in hippocampal CA1 neurons of rats were studied using the whole cell patch-clamp technique. AlCl3 decreased INa, IA, and IK in a partly reversible, dose and voltage-dependent manner. AlCl3 prolonged the time to peak of INa, and increased the inactivation time constants of INa and IA . In addition, 1000 microM AlCl3 shifted the voltage dependence of steady-state activation of INa, IA and IK toward positive potential, and the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of INa, IA toward negative potential. These results imply that AlCl3 could affect the activation and inactivation courses of sodium current and potassium current of rat hippocampal CA1 neurons, which may contribute to damage of the central nervous system by aluminum.",
