     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuronal cell apoptosis is an important pathological change in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated and extracted from Coptidis and rhizome and Cortex phellodendri, has a wide range of pharmacological effects. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of Berberine against neuronal insults induced by Abeta25-35 in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. METHODS: Primary neuron cells have been isolated from hippocampus of C57BL/6 newborn mice. We investigated effect of Berberine against neuronal insults induced by Abeta25-35 in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling, MTT, Propidium iodide, MMP, Caspase activity measurement, Western blot. RESULT: These neurons explosure to the beta25-35 protein resulted in a loss in cell viability and a surge in apoptosis. However, the presence of Berberine significantly reversed the effects induced by Abeta25-35. Through decreasing viability and caspase activity in neurons, the pretreatment with Berberine attenuated the cytotoxic effect of the Abeta25-35. Furthermore, it's found that expression of cytochrome C, as well as the restoration of Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl-xl/Bax ratio in the presence of Berberine, led to a decline in the apoptotic rate. CONCLUSION: The neuroprotective effects of Berberine against Abeta25-35-induced neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that this may be a promising therapeutics against AD.",
