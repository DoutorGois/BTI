     "AB": "The aim of this study was to determine GH-effects on Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression on hippocampus alterations caused by ozone exposure. Seventy male rats were divided into: (1) control; (2) exposed to ozone for 7, 15, and 30 days; (3) exposed to ozone and treated with GH, for 7, 15, and 30 days. Results showed that lipoperoxidation levels and number of COX-2-positive cells increased in all groups exposed to ozone compared to control. In the groups treated with GH, COX-2 immunoreactive cell number decreased with respect to the ozone group. Therefore, GH could provide protection against damage induced by oxidative stress.",
