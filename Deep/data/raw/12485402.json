     "AB": "Tyrosine phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor has been implicated in the regulation of the receptor channel. We investigated the effects of transient (15 min) global ischemia on tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B, and the interaction of NR2 subunits with the SH2 domain of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) in vulnerable CA1 and resistant CA3/dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Transient ischemia induced a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A in both regions. The tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B in CA3/dentate gyrus after transient ischemia was sustained and greater than that in CA1. PI3-kinase p85 was co-precipitated with NR2B after transient global ischemia. The SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase bound to NR2B, but not to NR2A. Binding to NR2B was increased following ischemia and the increase in binding in CA3/dentate gyrus (4.5-fold relative to sham) was greater than in CA1 (1.7-fold relative to sham) at 10 min of reperfusion. Prior incubation of proteins with an exogenous protein tyrosine phosphatase or with a phosphorylated peptide (pYAHM) prevented binding. The results suggest that sustained increases in tyrosine phosphorylation and increased interaction of NR2B with the SH2 domain of PI3-kinase may contribute to altered signal transduction in the CA3/dentate gyrus after transient ischemia.",
