     "AB": "Memory consolidation requires gene expression regulation by transcription factors, which eventually may induce chromatin modifications as histone acetylation. This mechanism is regulated by histone acetylases and deacetylases. It is not yet clear whether memory consolidation always recruits histone acetylation or it is only engaged in more persistent memories. To address this question, we used different strength of training for novel object recognition task in mice. Only strong training induced a long-lasting memory and an increase in hippocampal histone H3 acetylation. Histone acetylase inhibition in the hippocampus during consolidation impaired memory persistence, whereas histone deacetylase inhibition caused weak memory to persist. Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor inhibition impaired memory persistence and, concomitantly, reduced the general level of H3 acetylation. Accordingly, we found an important increase in H3 acetylation at a specific NF-kappaB-regulated promoter region of the Camk2d gene, which was reversed by NF-kB inhibition. These results show for the first time that histone acetylation is a specific molecular signature of enduring memories.",
