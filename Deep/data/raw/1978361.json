     "AB": "Evidence supports the view that 'memory traces' are formed in the hippocampus and in the cerebellum in classical conditioning of discrete behavioural responses. In the hippocampus learning results in long-lasting increases in excitability of pyramidal neurons that resemble the phenomenon of long-term potentiation. Although it plays a role in certain aspects of conditioning, the hippocampus is not necessary for learning and memory of the basic conditioned responses. The cerebellum and its associated brain-stem circuitry, on the other hand, does appear to be essential (necessary and sufficient) for learning and memory of the conditioned response. Evidence to date supports the view that mossy fibre convey conditioned stimulus information and that climbing fibres conveys the critical 'reinforcement' information to the cerebellum and that 'memory traces' appear to be formed in cerebellar cortex and interpositus nucleus.",
