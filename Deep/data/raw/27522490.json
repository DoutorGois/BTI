     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Acute unilateral peripheral-vestibular hypofunction (UVH) shifts the subjective visual vertical (SVV) ipsilesionally, triggering central compensation that usually eliminates shifts when upright. We hypothesized that compensation is worse when roll-tilted. METHODS: We quantified SVV errors and variability in different roll-tilted positions (0 degrees , +/-45 degrees , +/-90 degrees ) in patients with chronic UVH affecting the superior branch (SVN; n=4) or the entire (CVN; n=9) vestibular nerve. RESULTS: Errors in SVN and CVN were not different. When roll-tilted ipsilesionally 45 degrees (9.6+/-5.4 degrees vs. -0.2+/-6.4 degrees , patients vs. controls, p<0.001) and 90 degrees (23.5+/-5.7 degrees vs. 16.8+/-8.8 degrees , p=0.003), the patient's SVV was shifted significantly towards the lesioned ear. When upright, only a trend was noted (3.6+/-2.2 degrees vs. 0.0+/-1.2 degrees , p=0.099); for contralesional roll-tilts shifts were not different from controls. Variability was larger for CVN than SVN (p=0.046). With increasing disease-duration, adjustment errors decayed for ipsilesional roll-tilt and upright (p0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The reason verticality perception was distorted for ipsilesional roll-tilts, may be the insufficient integration of contralesional otolith-input. Similar errors in SVN and CVN suggest a dominant utricular role in verticality perception, albeit the sacculus may improve precision of SVV estimates. SIGNIFICANCE: With deficiencies in central compensation being roll-angle dependent, extending SVV-testing to roll-tilted positions may improve identifying patients with chronic UVH.",
