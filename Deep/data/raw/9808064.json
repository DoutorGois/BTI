     "AB": "LY274601 [R-(+)8-thiomethyl-2-(di-n-propyl-amino)tetralin], a full agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor with high affinity and selectivity, was labeled with 11C and 3H, and its in vivo behavior was studied to evaluate [11C]LY274601 as a PET radiotracer for imaging 5-HT1A receptor sites in living brain. Following intravenous tail injection into mice, [11C]LY274601 showed high blood-brain barrier permeability and accumulated in regions known to have high densities of 5-HT1A receptor sites such as the brain stem including the raphe nuclei. The binding of the radiotracer in target tissues is blocked by pre-injection of the 5-HT1A receptor selective ligand 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg, s.c.), suggesting that the binding is specific to 5-HT1A receptor sites. Using ex vivo autoradiography, the target tissues such as hippocampus CA1-4 fields, piriform cortex, dorsal raphe nucleus and lateral septum were visualized as hot spots. These tissues were observed to have binding 2-2.7 times greater than the cerebellum. The distribution of the radiotracer agrees well with the distribution of 5-HT1A receptors revealed by in vitro autoradiography with [3H]8-OH-DPAT. However, the radiotracer was metabolized quickly and cleared from target tissues with a half life of approximately 15 min. [11C]LY274601 showed high non-specific binding in regions with low number of 5-HT1A receptor sites such as cerebellum.",
