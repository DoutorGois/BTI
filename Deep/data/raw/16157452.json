     "AB": "During normal aging, microglia develop an activated phenotype characterized by morphologic changes and induction of CD11b, MHC II, and other inflammatory markers. We show that macrosialin (CD68), a macrophage-specific protein, is increased by aging in selected brain regions of male C57BL/6NNia mice. In corpus callosum and striatum, macrosialin mRNA and protein increased >or=50% (24 months versus 4 months); hippocampus and cerebellum were unchanged. Caloric restriction (CR) attenuated these age-related increases. Since CR attenuates age-related increases in oxidative damage and inflammation, we examined whether oxidized lipoproteins and inflammatory processes regulate macrosialin using murine BV-2 microglial cells as a model. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) induced macrosialin protein by 50%. Moreover, macrosialin was induced in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) which activates inflammatory pathways in BV-2 cells. Thus, the previously documented increase in oxidized lipoproteins, inflammation, and microglial activation during normal aging may contribute to the age-related increase in macrosialin expression.",
