     "AB": "Using the unbiased disector method we have shown that chronic alcohol consumption induces a significant decrease of dentate gyrus granule cell density in alcohol-fed rats for 18 months. A still more dramatic reduction was observed in a group of age-matched rats alcohol-fed for 12 months and switched to water for 6 months (recovery group). These results indicate that a progressive neuronal loss of the hippocampal granule cells in not impeded after cessation of alcohol intake. It is thus suggested that once the mechanisms underlying the alcohol-induced neuronal degeneration are triggered, they continue to act even after withdrawal.",
