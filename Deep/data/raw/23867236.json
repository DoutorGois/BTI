     "AB": "In Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) pathology advances in form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites throughout the brain. Clinically, PD is defined by motor symptoms that are predominantly attributed to the dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra. However, motor deficits are frequently preceded by smell deficiency or neuropsychological symptoms, including increased anxiety and cognitive dysfunction. Accumulating evidence indicates that aggregation of alpha-syn impairs synaptic function and neurogenic capacity that may be associated with deficits in memory, learning and mood. Whether and how alpha-syn accumulation contributes to neuropathological events defining these earliest signs of PD is presently poorly understood. We used a tetracycline-suppressive (tet-off) transgenic mouse model that restricts overexpression of human A30P alpha-syn to neurons owing to usage of the neuron-specific CaMKIIalpha promoter. Abnormal accumulation of A30P correlated with a decreased survival of newly generated neurons in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. Furthermore, when A30P alpha-syn expression was suppressed, we observed reduction of the human protein in neuronal soma. However, residual dox resistant A30P alpha-syn was detected in glial cells within the hippocampal neurogenic niche, concomitant with the failure to fully restore hippocampal neurogenesis. This finding is indicative to a potential spread of pathology from neuron to glia. In addition, mice expressing A30P alpha-syn show increased anxiety-related behavior that was reversed after dox treatment. This implies that glial A30P alpha-synucleinopathy within the dentate gyrus is part of a process leading to impaired hippocampal neuroplasticity, which is, however, not a sole critical event for circuits implicated in anxiety-related behavior.",
