     "AB": "Prenatal exposure to infection is known to affect brain development and has been linked to increased risk for schizophrenia. The goal of this study was to investigate whether maternal infection and associated fever near term disrupts synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of the offspring. We used LPS to mimic bacterial infection and trigger the maternal inflammatory response in near-term rats. LPS was administered to rats on embryonic days 15 and 16 and hippocampal synaptic transmission was evaluated in the offspring on postnatal days 20-25. Only offspring from rats that showed a fever in response to LPS were tested. Schaffer collateral-evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and fiber volleys in CA1 of hippocampal slices appeared smaller in offspring from the LPS group compared with controls, but, when the fEPSPs were normalized to the amplitude of fiber volleys, they were larger in the LPS group. In addition, intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons was heightened, as antidromic field responses in the LPS group were greater than those from control. Short-, but not long-term plasticity was impaired since paired-pulse facilitation of the fEPSP was attenuated in the LPS group, whereas no differences in long-term potentiation were noted. These results suggest that LPS-induced inflammation during pregnancy produces in the offspring a reduction in presynaptic input to CA1 with compensatory enhancements in postsynaptic glutamatergic response and pyramidal cell excitability. Neurodevelopmental disruption triggered by prenatal infection can have profound effects on hippocampal synaptic transmission, likely contributing to the memory and cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia.",
