     "AB": "Surgery is an established treatment for temporal lobe epilepsy refractory to medication. Several surgical approaches have been used to treat this condition including temporal lobectomy, transcortical selective amygdalohippocampectomy, subtemporal amygdalohippocampectomy, and transsylvian amygdalohippocampectomy. In this article the author reviews the transsylvian amygdalohyppocampectomy and pertinent anatomy. He also discusses the procedure's results with regard to seizure control, neuropsychological outcome, and visual field preservation.",
