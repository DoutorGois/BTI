     "AB": "Neuronal Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 4 (Npas4) is a key protein that intervenes in GABA synapse scaling and neurotrophicity enhancing. Since GABA and neurotrophicity are implicated in stress response and Npas4-deficient rodents exhibit behavioral alterations, an investigation was designed in rats to verify whether stress-induced spontaneous hippocampus Npas4 mRNA expression would be associated with specific patterns of stress response. The rats were exposed to one of three stressor levels: no stress (CTL, n=15), exposure to a footshock apparatus (Sham, S, n=40) and footshock (F, n=80). After stress exposure the S and F rats were tested in an activity cage, and subsequently in an elevated plus maze (EPM), just prior to the sacrifice. Using cluster analysis, the animals already assigned to a stress level were also distributed into 2 subgroups depending on their Npas4 mRNA levels. The low (L) and high (H) Npas4 expression subgroups were identified in the S and F groups, the CTL group being independent of the Npas4 levels. The Npas4 effect was studied through the interaction between stress (S and F) and Npas4 level (L and H). The biological stress response was similar in H and L rats, except blood corticosterone that was slightly lower in the H rats. The H rats were more active in the actimetry cage and presented higher levels of exploration in the EPM. They also exhibited higher hippocampus activation, as assessed by the c-fos, Egr1 and Arc mRNA levels. Therefore high Npas4 expression favors stress management.",
