     "AB": "The transition to motherhood results in a number of hormonal, neurological, and behavioral changes necessary to ensure offspring survival. Once motherhood is established, further neurological and behavioral changes may result with additional parity and mothering. Recent research has shown that motherhood enhances both hippocampal-dependent learning and memory and oxytocin-induced long-term potentiation, suggesting that the hippocampus is affected by mothering. In turn, degree of maternal behavior, either high or low, has been shown to affect spatial learning and memory performance in adult offspring. The present experiment aimed to investigate the effect of reproductive experience (nulli-, primi-, and multiparity and mothering) and degree of maternal behavior on hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in the mother. Results show that regardless of error type, primiparous rats make fewer errors compared to nulliparous rats, while multiparous rats show a trend towards making fewer errors compared to nulliparous rats. In addition, mothers who spend less time licking and nursing offspring had fewer reference memory errors. Perhaps the enhanced learning and memory in the inexperienced, new mother allows her to effectively acquire the suite of maternal behaviors necessary to ensure offspring survival and achieve reproductive success with subsequent reproductive experience.",
