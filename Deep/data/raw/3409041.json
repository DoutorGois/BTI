     "AB": "The ontogeny of the Type 2 glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the rat brain was examined using a monoclonal antibody raised against the rat liver GR. Marked changes both in the intensity and in the localization of GR immunoreactivity (GR-ir) were found to occur as a function of age and brain area examined. First, GR-ir was high perinatally and decreased to a low intensity of immunostaining around postnatal day 12 (pnd 12). Thereafter, GR-ir increased to a moderate intensity, which resembled adult levels by pnd 20 in most brain areas. Second, in some regions, such as the hippocampal CA3-4 pyramidal cell fields and the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, GR-ir was only clearly present during the first postnatal week. Third, in the hippocampus, GR-ir localization showed a distinctive developmental trend towards greater compactness within the CA1-2 pyramidal cell fields and a greater restriction of immunoreactive staining to these cell fields with exclusion of the adjoining areas. Fourth, adrenalectomy reduced overall GR-immunopositive staining, which could be reversed by administration of the selective glucocorticoid agonist, RU 28362. Our results suggest that during ontogeny the glucocorticoid receptor system displays considerable plasticity. Such plasticity may provide a basis for understanding the role of glucocorticoids during brain development.",
