     "AB": "Local injection of 6-hydroxydopamine in the locus coeruleus resulted in a 90% depletion of noradrenaline (NA) in the cerebral cortex as assessed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. This NA depletion had no effect on scopolamine-resistant hippocampal rhythmical slow activity and only an occasional effect on scopolamine-resistant neocortical low voltage fast activity. However, NE depletion resulted in a slight deficit in a behavioral swim-to-platform test and increased the deficit produced on the test by systemic treatment with scopolamine. Large surgical lesions of the medial thalamus or hippocampal formation plus posterior neocortex greatly increased the behavioral deficit produced by scopolamine. It is concluded that ascending noradrenergic projections play only a modest and possibly indirect role in the control of electrocortical activation and that a number of different brain lesions increase the behavioral impairment produced by central muscarinic blockade.",
