     "AB": "Since the exact mechanism of manganese (Mn)-induced learning disability is not known, we investigated the role of elevated cholesterol in rats exposed daily to 357 and 714 micrograms Mn/kg for 39 d. Significant Mn accumulation was accompanied by increased cholesterol content in the hippocampal region of Mn-treated rats. The learning, which is based on the time needed to reach food placed at the exit of a T-maze after a 1-d training period, was significantly slower in exposed rats than in unexposed rats. The rats receiving 357 and 714 micrograms Mn/kg reached the food in 104.5 +/- 13.8 and 113.3 +/- 25.7 s, respectively, on d 30, whereas their untreated counterparts reached the food in 28.7 +/- 11.4 s. This delay was completely corrected to 29.3 +/- 7.8 and 30.7 +/- 6.0 s in rats with coadministration of an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis with 357 and 714 micrograms/kg of Mn. The correction of impaired learning was associated with the normalization of hippocampal cholesterol, but the Mn level in this region of the brain was not influenced in rats treated with a drug that inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis. These results suggested that Mn-induced hypercholesterolemia is involved in Mn-dependent learning disability.",
