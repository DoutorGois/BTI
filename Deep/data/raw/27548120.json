     "AB": "The seeds of Psoralea corylifolia L. (P. corylifolia), also known as \"Bo-Gol-Zhee\" in Korea, are used in a traditional herbal medicine for treating various skin diseases. In the present study, we performed quantitative analyses of the seven standard components of P. corylifolia: psoralen, angelicin, neobavaisoflavone, psoralidin, isobavachalcone, bavachinin, and bakuchiol, using high-performance liquid chromatography. We also investigated the neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammation effects of P. corylifolia and its standard components in the hippocampal cell line HT22 and microglia cell line BV-2. A 70% ethanol extract of P. corylifolia was prepared and the seven standard components were separated using C-18 analytical columns by gradient solvents with acetonitrile and water, and ultraviolet detection at 215, 225 and 275 nm. The analytical method showed high linearity, with a correlation coefficient of >/=0.9999. The amounts of the standard components ranged from 0.74 to 11.71 mg/g. Among the components, bakuchiol (11.71 mg/g) was the most potent phytochemical component of P. corylifolia. Furthermore, we analyzed the inhibitory effects of the components from P. corylifolia to determine the bioactive compound needed to regulate neuronal cell changes. Angelicin, isobavachalcone, and bakuchiol suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated nitric oxide production in LPS-treated BV-2 microglia more significantly than did the other components. In HT22 hippocampal cells, neobavaisoflavone and bakuchiol had more potent inhibitory activity against hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death. Taken together of the quantification and efficacy analyses, bakuchiol appeared to be the most potent bioactive phytochemical component of P. corylifolia for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",
