     "AB": "The effects of a single and repeated electroconvulsive shock (ECS) (300 mA, 0.2 s) on tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels and GTP-cyclohydrolase activity in the brain and adrenal glands of rats were examined. Twenty-four hours after the last ECS treatment (one/day for 7 days), biopterin levels were significantly elevated in the locus coeruleus, hippocampus, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, and adrenal gland. There were no changes in biopterin levels after a single application of ECS. GTP-cyclohydrolase activity was significantly increased in the locus coeruleus, frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and adrenal gland 24 h after repeated ECS and remained elevated in certain tissues up to 8 days after the last treatment. Kinetic analysis of adrenal and locus coeruleus GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 day after 7 days of ECS showed significant changes in both Km and Vmax values. These data suggest that the long-term increases in BH4 levels and GTP-cyclohydrolase activity after repeated ECS may play a part in the mediation of the antidepressant effects of ECS.",
