     "AB": "Retrosplenial cortex (RS) is situated both anatomically and functionally between neocortical and limbic structures involved in spatial navigation. Initial anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioural evidence in both humans and rodents strongly suggested a role for RS in spatial navigation as well. Later studies using more selective cytotoxic lesions in rodents, however, cast doubt on earlier RS studies by failing to find spatial deficits following RS lesions. Contrasting reports from behavioural results on spatial tasks following RS damage have continued to be reported during the past decade. That RS does indeed contribute spatial behaviour even in rodents has been recently reaffirmed. The ambiguity surrounding RS is shown to result from differences in the choice of spatial tasks and rat strains between studies that find RS deficits and those that do not. The reconciliation of behavioural results following RS lesions strengthens the view that RS forms a part of the neural circuitry that underlies spatial navigation.",
