     "AB": "We have tested the hypothesis that cell lineage restriction boundaries define the borders between cytoarchitectonic areas in the cerebral cortex. Clonally related cells were identified using a retroviral marking technique, and the dispersion of neuronal clones was examined with respect to the transitions between cortical areas. We chose to study the hippocampal formation because we found that clones of hippocampal neurons, unlike those in neocortex, are compact and readily identifiable in the adult and that transitions between areas in the hippocampus are sharp relative to the spread of a typical clone. We conclude, contrary to the hypothesis, that clones of neurons transgress the boundaries between areas in the hippocampal formation, that border-crossing clones are observed as frequently as would be expected if clones spread freely over the hippocampus with no constraint imposed by area borders, and that different types of pyramidal neurons, characteristic of different areas, may appear to a single clone. different areas, may appear in a single clone.",
