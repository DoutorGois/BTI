     "AB": "This study describes immunocytochemical distribution of the protein kinase C (PKC) subspecies: alpha, beta and gamma in the CAI sector of gerbil hippocampus. Immunolabelling was performed with 10 nm gold-antibody complexes against each of the PKC subspecies. The subspecies of PKC were expressed specifically in different populations of hippocampal cells. An enhanced PKC immunoreactivity was noted in the animals after ischemia. We propose that this phenomenon reflects an activation of PKC in the early phase of brain ischemia.",
