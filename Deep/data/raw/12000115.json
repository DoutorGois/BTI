     "AB": "The hippocampal formation undergoes significant morphological and functional changes after prolonged feeding with low-protein diets. In this study we tested whether prolonged food restriction causes deleterious alterations in this brain region as well. It was found that the total number of dentate granule cells and hippocampal CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons did not differ between controls and rats submitted to food restriction (40%) for 36 weeks. Likewise, no effects of this dietary regimen have been detected on the morphology of the dendritic trees of hippocampal pyramids, and on the total number of the mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. By contrast, the dendritic arborizations of granule cells were found to have a reduced number of segments in food-restricted rats. However, the spine density on the distal segments of their dendritic trees and the total number of axospinous synapses in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus were increased in these animals. In addition, the total dendritic length of the granule cells and the overall surface area of the active zones of the synapses in the outer molecular layer were preserved, indicating that the capacity of dentate granule cells to process afferent stimuli is likely to be unaffected by this dietary treatment. Supporting this view are the results obtained in the water maze experiment which show that food-restricted rats exhibit unimpaired spatial abilities, which are known to be dependent on the entorhinal drive towards the hippocampal formation. These results show that, among hippocampal neurons, dentate granule cells are selectively vulnerable to food restriction. Nonetheless, the reorganization which takes place in their dendrites and synapses is capable of minimizing the functional impairments that were expected to occur following changes in the hippocampal neuronal circuitry induced by this type of dietary restriction.",
