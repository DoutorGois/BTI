     "AB": "This paper was designed in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of rats, to explore the role of transient receptor potential channel 4 (TRPC4) as Ca(2+) selective channel by detecting the changes of the expression of TRPC4 in different parts of cerebral tissues under the condition of focal cerebral ischemia. The rats were sacrificed after MCAO surviving time 6 h, 12 h, 1 d, 3 d. As determined by Western blot, the expressions of TRPC4 in striatum and hippocampus of 12 h, 1 d, 3 d groups were significant higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the TRPC4 immunoreactive substances were present in the membrane of neurons. Compared with the control group, immunostaining positive cells increased in hippocampus and striatum of cerebral ischemia groups. The TRPC4 immunostaining positive cells increased significantly in 1d-group and 3d-group (P<0.05). It suggests that as a Ca(2+) selective channel, the variance of the expression of TRPC4 may play a role in acute and delayed neuronal injury in focal cerebral ischemia.",
