     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Hippocampus avoidance in whole brain radiotherapy (HA-WBRT) offers the feasibility of less-impaired cognitive function than conventional WBRT. The study aims to assess the radiological distribution of brain metastases (BMs) with relation to the hippocampus and peri-hippocampus region as defined by the RTOG 0933 for better understanding of margin definition in HA-WBRT treatment planning. METHODS: Consecutive patients with diagnosis of BM from enhanced MRI between March 2011 and July 2016 were analysed. The pre-treatment T1 weighted, T2 weighted, T2 flair, three-dimensional spoiled gradient axial and contrast-enhanced axial cranial MR images of 226 patients are examined. The closest distances between the edge of hippocampus and the margin of tumours on different planes were measured. RESULTS: A total of 226 patients with 1080 visible metastatic sites were reviewed. The origin of the primary tumors was in 72.6% lung (n = 164), in 45 cases (19.9%) breast cancer and in 7.5% other malignancies (n = 17). There were 758 (70.2%) lesions situated beyond the tentorium. The median size of single lesion was 13.9 +/- 14.7 mm. Impossible, it seems that more of the patients are with only one lesion, to verify. The hippocampus involvement was found in 3.1% (n = 7, 95% CI 0.01-0.05) within 5 mm, 5.7% (n = 13, 95% CI 0.03-0.09) within 10mm and 8.4% (n = 19, 95% CI 0.05-0.12) within 20 mm. In multivariate analysis, the number 6 BM or higher was found to be an independent risk factor for hippocampal involvement (HI) (OR: 5.2, 5.38 and 3.84 in 5, 10 and 20 mm). CONCLUSION: This radiological study found that the incidence of hippocampus involvement is low in patients with BM. HA-WBRT can be delivered under the context of complete radiological diagnosis after careful delineation, proper margin definition and individual planning optimization. Advances in knowledge: The incidence of HI in patients with initial diagnosis of BM from solid tumours impacts the radiotherapeutic decision. Our radiological data analysed the incidence of HI not only to the conventional 5 mm margin definition, but also expanded to wider margins as 10 and 20 mm from hippocampus, which will help the treatment planning optimization with different technique.",
