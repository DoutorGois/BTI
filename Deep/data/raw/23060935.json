     "AB": "Cadmium (Cd), which is a poisonous trace element, has been reported extensively to lead to morphological and biochemical abnormalities of the central nervous system, memory loss and mental retardation. We studied the Alzheimer's disease-related toxicity of Cd in a mouse model [amyloid precursor protein (APP)/ presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mice, dual transfection of APP695swe and mutated PS1 genes]. Behavioral changes were detected using the Morris water maze test. The beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) levels were determined using immunohistochemistry and ELISA. The free zinc ion concentration in mouse brain was determined using autometallography. The protein expression of alpha-secretase, soluble APPalpha (sAPPalpha) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) in the mouse cerebral cortex and hippocampus was detected using western blotting. We found that Cd treatment increased the latency and distance of the platform search and reduced the number of platform crossings. The number and size of senile plaques in the brains of Cd-treated mice were significantly increased. The levels of Abeta(1-42) and free zinc ions were increased. The expression of ADAM10, sAPPalpha and NEP protein was reduced. We speculated that Cd reduced the expression of ADAM10, sAPPalpha and NEP protein, which caused an increase in the levels of Abeta(1-42) and free zinc ions and led to the accelerated Abeta deposition found in the experimental animals and their abnormal behavior.",
