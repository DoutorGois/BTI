     "AB": "Cell culture studies demonstrating that the serine protease thrombin can induce neuronal and glial process retraction, glial proliferation, and changes in gene expression suggest a role for thrombin in CNS development, plasticity, and response to injury. Most cellular responses to thrombin are mediated by proteolytic activation of the cloned thrombin receptor (TR), a member of the seven transmembrane domain, G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. As a step toward understanding the role of thrombin and its receptor in the CNS, Northern blot, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical techniques were used to analyze the cellular localization of TR mRNA in weanling-age rat brain. TR mRNA was broadly distributed across the neuraxis, although expression was very focal and often anatomically limited within specific neural structures. The greatest hybridization was associated with individual neurons in neocortex, cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, and subiculum, subsets of nuclei in hypothalamus, thalamus, pretectum, and ventral mesencephalon, and discrete cell layers in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb. Patterns of hybridization included neuronal, glial, and ependymal cells, although white matter was uniformly negative, as were most cerebrovascular endothelial cells. Expression of TR mRNA by astroglia and dopaminergic neurons was confirmed by colocalization with immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in hippocampus and tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra. Comparison between TR and prothrombin (thrombin's precursor) cRNA hybridization demonstrated distinct but overlapping brain distributions of these transcripts, most clearly evident in postnatally developing, laminated structures. These results suggest widespread utilization of, and multiple physiologic, and possibly pathophysiologic, functions for, the thrombin/TR cell signaling system in the CNS.",
