     "AB": "Stroke in the neonatal brain is an important cause of neurologic morbidity. To characterize the dynamics of neural progenitor cell proliferation and maturation after survival delays in the neonatal brain following ischemia, we utilized unilateral carotid ligation alone to produce infarcts in postnatal day 12 CD1 mice. We investigated the neurogenesis derived from the sub-ventricular zone and the sub-granular zone of the dentate gyrus subsequent to injury. Newly produced cells were labeled by bromodeoxyuridine at approximately 1 week (P18-20) after the insult by 5 i.p. injections (each 50 mg/kg). Subsequent migration and differentiation of the newborn cells was investigated at postnatal day 40 by immunohistochemistry for molecular neuronal and glial cell-lineage markers and BrdU incorporation. Cresyl violet stain demonstrated massive loss of neurons in the ipsilateral septal hippocampus in the CA3 and CA1 regions associated with atrophy. Total counts of new cells were significantly lowered not only in the ipsilateral injured but also the contralateral uninjured hippocampi and correlated with the lesion induced atrophy. Bilateral percent neuronal commitments in the dentate gyri however, were not significantly different from control. New cell densities in the neocortex and striatum increased bilaterally after neonatal stroke. The predominantly non-neuronal commitment of the SVZ-derived new cells was similar to the percentage of non-neuronal commitment in controls. In conclusion, neurogenesis occurring at 1 week after neonatal ischemia in the model maintained cell-lineage commitment patterns similar to sham controls. However, the total number of hippocampal SGZ-derived new neurons was reduced bilaterally; in contrast, the SVZ-derived neurogenesis was amplified.",
