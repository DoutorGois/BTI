     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: It has been argued recently that ischemic preconditioning (IPre) and postconditioning (IPost) have beneficial effects in many ischemic disorders however; their effects on global ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) are poorly understood. Thus, the present work aimed to study the possible mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of IPre and IPost. METHODS: Animals were randomly allocated into 4 groups (n = 30): (1) Sham operated (SO); (2) I/R group, animals were subjected to 15 min global ischemia followed by 60 min reperfusion; (3) IPre, animals were subjected to 3 episodes of 5 min ischemia followed by 10 min reperfusion before I/R; (4) IPost, animals were subjected to three episodes of 10s of ischemia and 10s of reperfusion after the period of ischemia followed by a 60 min reperfusion period. Lactate dehydrogenase activity, oxidative stress, inflammatory and apoptotic biomarkers, as well as neurotransmitters, infarct size and histopathological examination were assessed. RESULTS: I/R induced hippocampal damage through increasing oxidative stress, inflammatory, excitotoxic and apoptotic markers as well as lactate dehydrogenase activity and infarct size. Both, IPre and IPost attenuated most markers induced by I/R. CONCLUSIONS: IPre and IPost neuroprotective effects can be explained through their anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanisms.",
