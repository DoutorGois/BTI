     "AB": "Naturally occurring dead cells in the developing rat neocortex, subcortical white matter and hippocampus, which increase in number during the first postnatal week and decrease thereafter to disappear by the end of the first month, were examined by in situ labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation. These cells showed peripheral chromatin condensation or extremely dark, often fragmented, nuclei. Southern hybridization following agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA extracted from the developing cortex, but not from adult brain, showed a 'ladder' pattern which is typical of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Taken together these results show that naturally occurring cell death (programmed cell death) in the developing cerebral cortex has the morphology of apoptosis and is associated with endonuclease activation.",
