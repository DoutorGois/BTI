     "AB": "Sharp wave-ripple complexes (SPW-Rs) in the intact rodent hippocampus are characterized by slow field potential transients superimposed by close to 200-Hz ripple oscillations. Similar events have been recorded in hippocampal slices where SPW-Rs occur spontaneously or can be induced by repeated application of high-frequency stimulation, a standard protocol for induction of long-lasting long-term potentiation. Such stimulation is reminiscent of protocols used to induce kindling epilepsy and ripple oscillations may be predictive of the epileptogenic zone in temporal lobe epilepsy. In the present study, we investigated the relation between recurrent epileptiform discharges (REDs) and SPW-Rs by studying effects of partial removal of inhibition. In particular, we compared the effects of nicotine, low-dose bicuculline methiodide (BMI), and elevated extracellular potassium concentration ([K(+)](o)) on induced SPW-Rs. We show that nicotine dose-dependently transformed SPW-Rs into REDs. This transition was associated with reduced inhibitory conductance in CA3 pyramidal cells. Similar results were obtained from slices where the GABAergic conductance was reduced by application of low concentrations of BMI (1-2 muM). In contrast, sharp waves were diminished by phenobarbital. Elevating [K(+)](o) from 3 to 8.5 mM did not transform SPW-Rs into REDs but significantly increased their incidence and amplitude. Under these conditions, the equilibrium potential for inhibition was shifted in depolarizing direction, whereas inhibitory conductance was significantly increased. Interestingly, the propensity of elevated [K(+)](o) to induce seizure-like events was reduced in slices where SPW-Rs had been induced. In conclusion, recruitment of inhibitory cells during SPW-Rs may serve as a mechanism by which hyperexcitation and eventually seizure generation might be prevented.",
