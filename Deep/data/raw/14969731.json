     "AB": "Several cascades of changes in gene expression have been shown to be involved in the neuronal injury after transient cerebral ischemia; however, little is known about the profile of genes showing alteration of expression in a mouse model of transient forebrain ischemia. We analyzed the gene expression profile in the mouse hippocampus during 24 h of reperfusion, after 20 min of transient forebrain ischemia, using a high-density oligonucleotide DNA array. Using statistical filtration (Welch's ANOVA and Welch's t-test), we identified 25 genes with a more than 3.0-fold higher or lower level of expression on average, with statistical significance set at p<0.05, in at least one ischemia-reperfusion group than in the sham group. Using unsupervised clustering methods (hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering algorithms), we identified four types of gene expression pattern that may be associated with the response of cell populations in the hippocampus to an ischemic insult in this mouse model. Functional classification of the 25 genes demonstrated alterations of expression of several kinds of biological pathways, regulating transcription (Bhlhb2, Jun, c-fos, Egr1, Egr2, Fosb, Junb, Ifrd1, Neurod6), the cell cycle (c-fos, Fosb, Jun, Junb, Dusp1), stress response (Dusp1, Dnajb1, Dnaja4), chaperone activity (Dnajb1, Dnaja4) and cell death (Ptgs2, Gadd45g, Tdag51), in the mouse hippocampus by 24 h of reperfusion. Using hierarchical clustering analysis, we also found that the same 25 genes clearly discriminated between the sham group and the ischemia-reperfusion groups. The alteration of expression of 25 genes identified in this study suggests the involvement of these genes in the transcriptional response of cell populations in the mouse hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia.",
