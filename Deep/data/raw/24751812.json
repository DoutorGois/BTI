     "AB": "The expression and functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) in chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common type of refractory epilepsy in adults, are poorly understood currently. In this study, status epilepticus evoked by amygdala stimulation was used to establish rat chronic TLE model. Two months later, high-throughput sequencing was employed to investigate miRNA expression profile in rat hippocampus, and six miRNAs were confirmed to be differentially expressed. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis indicated that most of the target genes for these six miRNAs were associated with neuronal apoptosis. Meanwhile, the levels of miR-423-3p and miR-296-5p were correlated with the activity of caspase-3, an apoptosis indicator. Additionally, the loading of miR-423-3p was increased in RNA-induced silencing complex whilst caspase-6, a target of miR-423-3p, was reduced in chronic TLE rats. Collectively, our findings suggest that miRNAs may exert anti-apoptotic effects in chronic TLE.",
