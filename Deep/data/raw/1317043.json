     "AB": "1. Cholecystokinin and benzodiazepine receptor binding was evaluated in 2-, 9- and 18-month old rats in the brain regions where cholecystokinin octapeptide and gamma-aminobutyric acid are known to coexist in common nerve cells (frontal cortex, hippocampus). 2. There was a regionally selective alteration of hippocampal 3H-CCK-8 binding in the oldest age group, if compared to both young and adult animals. Non-linear regression analysis of binding data revealed significantly lower apparent number of binding sites (Bmax), and twofold (but not statistically significantly) higher binding affinity for the radiolabelled ligand. No differences between any age groups in 3H-flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors were found. 3. The results suggest that changes in cholecystokinin receptor characteristics might contribute to the behavioural impairments in aged rats.",
