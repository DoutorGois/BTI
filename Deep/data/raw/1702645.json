     "AB": "A hippocampal poly(A) RNA, pADHC-9, was cloned by differential screening of a human hippocampal cDNA library. By RNA blot analysis, pADHC-9 was elevated 2-fold in Alzheimer's disease hippocampus. In situ analyses identified pADHC-9 expression in pyramidal and non-pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified pADHC-9 as a potential human homolog of rat sulfated glycoprotein 2 (SGP-2). SGP-2 expression increased in rat hippocampus following experimental lesions that mimic intrinsic neuronal loss and/or deafferentation. The function of pADHC-9 in brain has not been defined, but in serum, a similar protein inhibits complement-dependent cytolysis. Increased expression of pADHC-9 in Alzheimer's disease hippocampus may be a compensatory response mounted to retard a complement-driven neurodegenerative cascade.",
