     "AB": "Activations produced by the recall of episodic and semantic memories differing in spatial content and age were examined. Recall of recent episodic memories with differing spatial content activated the medial temporal lobes and the retrosplenial-posterior cingulate cortex-precuneus complex more than recall of recent semantic memories with similarly differing spatial content. Some of these differences related to the amount of spatial information recalled because spatially richer recent memories, regardless of whether they were episodic or semantic, activated the right posterior parahippocampal cortex, precuneus, and posterior parietal cortex more. This spatial effect was found to be independent of memory age for semantic memories, although some episodic-semantic memory differences, including one in the left hippocampus, were not age independent. Episodic-semantic memory recall activation differences are therefore probably a function of the amount recalled, memory age, and what is recalled, particularly with respect to spatial information.",
