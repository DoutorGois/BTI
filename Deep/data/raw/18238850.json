     "AB": "AIMS: The individual extent of structural brain tissue changes in patients with alcohol dependence is influenced by genetic factors, gender, age and possibly a dose/duration-effect. Aim of the present study was to investigate different types of alcoholic beverages with regard to hippocampal volume loss in patients suffering from alcoholism. METHODS: We included 52 patients with alcohol dependence and divided them according to their preferred type of beverage consumption (beer, wine, and spirits). Hippocampal volumes were determined using volumetric high-resolution MR imaging. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in hippocampal volumes between patients consuming different beverages (ANOVA: F = 7.454; df = 2; P = 0.0015) with the smallest volumes in the wine group, followed by the spirits group. Furthermore, patients with a preferred spirits consumption showed significantly higher plasma homocysteine levels (ANOVA: F = 3.39; df = 2; P = 0.042). Linear regression analyses revealed an association of homocysteine and hippocampal volume only in the group of patients preferring spirits (R(2) = 0.364; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Homocysteine-mediated excitotoxicity may be an important pathophysiological mechanism in ethanol-related brain damage, particularly in patients consuming wine and spirits. The extent of brain atrophy in beer consuming patients seems to be more moderate.",
