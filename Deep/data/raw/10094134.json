     "AB": "Kynurenine aminotransferase I (KATI) converts kynurenine into kynurenic acid (KYNA), a broadspectrum antagonist at ionotropic excitatory amino acid receptors. The main interest in KYNA centers on its potential neuroprotective action in physiological and pathological conditions. We show here by in situ hybridization that KATI mRNA is widely expressed throughout the adult rat brain. A strong autoradiographic signal was detected in the hippocampus, piriform cortex, and choroid plexus. Microscopic evaluation suggested that KATI mRNA was expressed not only in astrocytes but also in hippocampal neurons and in choroid plexus epithelial cells. Neuronal expression of KATI mRNA was further confirmed by RT-PCR and in a model of transient cerebral ischemia. The expression pattern of the mitochondrial form (mKATI) of the enzyme was almost comparable to that of KATI. The major difference was observed in the choroid plexus where mKATI mRNA signal was very low.",
