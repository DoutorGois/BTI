     "AB": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes selective hippocampal cell death which is believed to be associated with the cognitive impairment observed in both clinical and experimental settings. The endogenous neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5), a TrkB ligand, has been shown to be neuroprotective for vulnerable CA3 pyramidal neurons after experimental brain injury. In this study, infusion of recombinant NT-4/5 increased survival of CA2/3 pyramidal neurons to 71% after lateral fluid percussion brain injury in rats, compared with 55% in vehicle-treated controls. The functional outcome of this NT-4/5-mediated neuroprotection was examined using three hippocampal-dependent behavioral tests. Injury-induced impairment was evident in all three tests, but interestingly, there was no treatment-related improvement in any of these measures. Similarly, injury-induced decreased excitability in the Schaffer collaterals was not affected by NT-4/5 treatment. We propose that a deeper understanding of the factors that link neuronal survival to recovery of function will be important for future studies of potentially therapeutic agents.",
