     "AB": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) prominently expresses polysialic acid (PSA), a carbohydrate polymer that is attached to neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and promotes changes in cell interactions. Previous studies have shown that expression of PSA is important for circadian rhythm stability under constant darkness, and for photic entrainment of the SCN circadian clock. In the present study, immunoblot analyses of the Syrian hamster SCN revealed marked diurnal fluctuations in PSA under a 24-h light/dark cycle. PSA levels were reduced by >90% during the mid-to-late dark phase, and were elevated to maximal daytime levels approximately 1 h after lights-on. A similar pattern of PSA fluctuation persisted under constant darkness. Exposure of animals under a 24-h light/dark cycle to a 30-min light pulse during the late dark phase dramatically increased SCN contents of PSA within 60 min, and these values returned to basal levels 1-2 h later. There was no effect of light-on expression of PSA in the hippocampus. Parallel studies revealed changes in the NCAM-180 isoform that carries PSA in the brain, suggesting that regulation of PSA may include protein as well as carbohydrate-associated mechanisms. Immunohistological analysis revealed light-induced enhancement of PSA in the SCN subregion containing calbindin D(28K) cells. PSA staining was also closely associated with the majority of SCN cells expressing light-inducible Fos protein. This rhythmic, light-inducible expression of PSA within the SCN suggests that dynamic cell interactions are important for the photic regulation of circadian clock phase.",
