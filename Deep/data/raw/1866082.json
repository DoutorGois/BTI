     "AB": "This study sharpens the temporal definition of an association in the context of long-term synaptic modification of the monosynaptic projections from entorhinal cortex to dentate gyrus in the anesthetized rat. The ipsilateral projection produces a powerful postsynaptic excitation and shows synaptic potentiation following 7.5 ms trains. On the other hand, brief, high-frequency contralateral stimulation just after this powerful postsynaptic excitation is followed by long-term depression (LTD) at the synapses of this pathway. Therefore, based on the differential induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) or LTD, a cell can distinguish associated pre- and postsynaptic activation at a temporal resolution at least as small as 7.5 ms.",
