     "AB": "We report a series of nine children with multiple daily seizures since infancy who underwent functional hemispherectomy that included en bloc resection of the hippocampus and the temporal neocortex. In all cases, the hippocampi were normal by conventional histology despite the fact that these patients had suffered from recurrent seizures over a long period of time. This observation suggests that extremely frequent seizures in childhood are not invariably associated with the development of hippocampal sclerosis.",
