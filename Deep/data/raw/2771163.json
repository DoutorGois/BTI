     "AB": "Release of endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) from the dorsal hippocampus in response to depolarizing stimulation with high-K+ infusion was examined in young and aged rats using the method of in vivo dialysis. ACh content in the dialysate was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection (HPCC-ECD). During the high-K+ stimulation, the concentration of ACh in the dialysate only slightly increased in aged rats in contrast with young rats where the ACh content during stimulation increased about 2-fold of the basal level. These results showed that ACh release evoked by depolarizing stimulation declined through aging in the hippocampus.",
