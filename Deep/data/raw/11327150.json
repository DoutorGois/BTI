     "AB": "In the field of the neurobiology of learning, significant emphasis has been placed on understanding neural plasticity within a single structure (or synapse type) as it relates to a particular type of learning mediated by a particular brain area. To appreciate fully the breadth of the plasticity responsible for complex learning phenomena, it is imperative that we also examine the neural mechanisms of the behavioral instantiation of learned information, how motivational systems interact, and how past memories affect the learning process. To address this issue, we describe a model of complex learning (rodent adaptive navigation) that could be used to study dynamically interactive neural systems. Adaptive navigation depends on the efficient integration of external and internal sensory information with motivational systems to arrive at the most effective cognitive and/or behavioral strategies. We present evidence consistent with the view that during navigation: 1) the limbic thalamus and limbic cortex is primarily responsible for the integration of current and expected sensory information, 2) the hippocampal-septal-hypothalamic system provides a mechanism whereby motivational perspectives bias sensory processing, and 3) the amygdala-prefrontal-striatal circuit allows animals to evaluate the expected reinforcement consequences of context-dependent behavioral responses. Although much remains to be determined regarding the nature of the interactions among neural systems, new insights have emerged regarding the mechanisms that underlie flexible and adaptive behavioral responses.",
