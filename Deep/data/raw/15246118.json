     "AB": "A comparative study of the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) was done in the hippocampus of rats and mice after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (APISE), and of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. At 1 day APISE, there was a marked increase in mGluR2/3 immunoreactivity in the stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) of CA1 area and in the middle one-third of the molecular layer (MM) of the dentate gyrus. Immuno-electron microscopic study showed degenerating mGluR2/3 positive axons in the SLM of CA1 area at 1 day APISE. From 7 days, mGluR2/3 immunopositive product decreased, and by 31 days APISE, it almost disappeared in two-thirds of the SLM near CA2. In the mouse model at 2 months APISE, mGluR2/3 immunopositive product in two-thirds of the SLM near the stratum radiatum disappeared, and so did in the whole SLM of CA1 area in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Neuropharmacological study by intravenous injection of mGluR2/3 agonist 2R,4R-4-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate [(2R,4R)-APDC] at different doses at 1h during pilocarpine induced status epilepticus showed that (2R,4R)-APDC could not stop seizures and neuronal death in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. The present study, therefore, suggests that the reduction of mGluR2/3 immunopositive product in the SLM of CA1 is a consequence of neuronal loss in either the entorhinal cortex or CA1 area of the hippocampus, and at the dosage range from 12.5 to 600 mg/kg, (2R,4R)-APDC may not be effective in the prevention of seizures or neuronal death in the hilus of the dentate gyrus.",
