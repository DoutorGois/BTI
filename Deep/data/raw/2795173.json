     "AB": "Behavioral recovery following brain injury in humans is well recognized; however, the anatomical basis for such recovery has not been demonstrated. Two cases are presented that show reorganization of synaptic connections (plasticity) in the dentate gyrus of human brain following uncal herniation. The neurohistological appearance of these cases is very similar to a well-described animal model of anatomical, physiological, and behavioral recovery following experimental surgical injury.",
