     "AB": "Veratridine-induced depolarization caused a large increase in Ca uptake in the rat hippocampal slice (30.2 vs. 9.0 nM/mg dry weight). This uptake was reduced to 18.4 nM/mg when veratridine was combined with anoxia. When compared with veratridine exposure alone, the combination of anoxia and veratridine increased intracellular Na (460 vs. 380 microM/g), decreased intracellular K (30 vs. 40 microM/g) and decreased ATP levels (0.1 vs. 0.8 nM/mg). The changes in Na, K, and ATP should enhance net Ca uptake, yet Ca uptake was reduced. This suggests an effect of anoxia to block Ca channels. In summary anoxia attenuates depolarization-induced Ca uptake. This may represent a mechanism by which neurons are partially protected against anoxic damage which could be more severe if depolarization-induced Ca uptake was not limited.",
