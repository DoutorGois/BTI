     "AB": "The effects of electroconvulsive shock on neurotransmitter receptor binding sites in rat brain have been studied. Electroconvulsive shock decreased beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus but not in the striatum, hypothalamus or cerebellum. The decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites was highly selective and was similar to the decrease in these receptors seen after chronic treatment of rats with tricyclic antidepressant drugs. Electroconvulsive shock selectively increased serotonin-2 receptor binding sites in the cerebral cortex. This effect was opposite to that of antidepressant drugs.",
