     "AB": "The dependence of long-term potentiation on an intact inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] metabolism was investigated with the whole-cell voltage-clamp method in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices. The intracellular application of 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (1 mM), an inhibitor of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase and of Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase eliminated the potentiation of postsynaptic currents in pyramidal cells 30 min after paired pre- and postsynaptic activation. These data suggest a possible role of postsynaptic inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and/or inositol 1,3,4,5-tetra-kisphosphate in synaptic plasticity.",
