     "AB": "The mechanism by which amyloid-beta (Abeta) produces brain dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease is largely unknown. According to previous studies, Abeta might share perforating properties with gramicidin, a well-accepted membrane-disrupting peptide. Therefore, we hypothesize that the key steps leading to synaptotoxicity by Abeta and gramicidin involve peptide aggregation, pore formation, and calcium dysregulation. Here, we show that Abeta and gramicidin form aggregates enriched in beta-sheet structures using electron microscopy, and Thioflavin and Congo Red staining techniques. Also, we found that Abeta and gramicidin display fairly similar actions in hippocampal cell membranes, i.e. inducing Ca(2+) entry and synaptoxicity characterized by the loss of synaptic proteins and a decrease in neuronal viability. These effects were not observed in a Ca(2+) free solution, indicating that both Abeta and gramicidin induce neurotoxicity by a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism. Using combined perforated patch clamp and imaging recordings, we found that only Abeta produced a perforation that progressed from a small (Cl(-)-selective pore) to a larger perforation that allowed the entry of fluorescent molecules. Therefore, based on these results, we propose that the perforation at the plasma membrane by Abeta is a dynamic process that is critical in producing neurotoxicity similar to that found in the brains of AD patients.",
