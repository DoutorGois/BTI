     "AB": "Previous studies have demonstrated that insulin receptors are widely distributed throughout areas of the forebrain in the adult rat that are involved in modulating neuroendocrine functions and feeding behaviour. In addition, a recent investigation showed that there is a good correlation between the presence of the insulin receptor and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in these regions, indicating a possible functional activity of insulin receptors in vivo. It is unknown whether neural connections between specific brainstem nuclei to forebrain regions may also be under direct regulation of insulin or related factors. In order to test this possibility, the distribution of insulin receptors and phosphotyrosine was mapped throughout the hindbrain of the adult rat by immunocytochemistry, using specific antibodies against the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor as well as against phosphotyrosine. Both markers showed a high degree of overlap throughout numerous distinct anatomical regions of the hindbrain. In the mesencephalon, insulin receptor and phosphotyrosine-positive neurons were found in the precommissural nucleus, the lateral and dorsal part of the central gray, the mammillary bodies and the interpeduncular nucleus. In addition, immunoreactivity was found in the subependymal layer around the aqueduct along fibres and nerve cells possibly contacting the cerebrospinal fluid. In the pons and medulla, dense immunoreactivity was seen in the lateral superior olive, nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus and nucleus ambiguous. Scattered cells were found in the pontine and vestibular nuclei, as well as in the reticular formation. The cerebellum contained moderately dense immunoreactivity in the granule cell and molecular cell layer of the cortex, as well as in the deep cerebellar nuclei.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
