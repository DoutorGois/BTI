     "AB": "In the present study, we investigated the temporal and spatial alterations of ceruloplasmin immunoreactivity in the gerbil hippocampus and dentate gyrus after 5 min transient forebrain ischemia. In sham-operated animals, ceruloplasmin immunoreactivity in the hippocampal CA2/3 areas was higher than that of other areas. Ceruloplasmin immunoreactivity and its protein content significantly increased and were highest in the CA1 area 1 day after ischemia-reperfusion. At this time point, the immunoreactivity was shown in pyramidal cells of the CA1 area. Four days after ischemia-reperfusion, ceruloplasmin immunoreactivity was shown in astrocytes in the hippocamapal CA1 area. These results suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) do not immediately damage neuronal cytosol, unlike DNA. An interval of time is required for the full expression of the cytoplasmic protein injury by ROS. This delayed neuronal injury 1 day after ischemic insult might provide a window of opportunity for therapeutic interventions using antioxidants.",
