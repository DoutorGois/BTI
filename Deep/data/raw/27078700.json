     "AB": "Alzheimer disease (AD), a central nervous system degenerative disease, is characterized by abnormal deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylated tau and synaptic loss. It is widely accepted that Abeta is the chief culprit of AD. Abeta peptide is the cleavage product of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). Recently, more attention has been paid to O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) modification of protein. O-GlcNAcylation plays a significant role in hippocampal synaptic function. Abated O-GlcNAcylation might be a modulator in progression of AD through regulating activity of pertinent enzymes and factors. Evidence suggests that enhanced O-GlcNAcylation interacts with tau phosphorylation and prevents brain from tau and Abeta-induced impairment. Here, we review the roles of O-GlcNAcylation in APP cleavage, tau phosphorylation and hippocampal synapses function.",
