     "AB": "Effects of exposure to lead on neurobehavioral function, content of monoamine neurotransmitter in hippocampus, and brain level of lipid peroxide were studied in 45 SD rats. Results showed learning and memory abilities of the rats were affected in exposure to lead of 1333.3 mg/kg (with their blood lead level of 6.23 mumol/L), their motor activities changed and emotional status became unsteady with 266.7 mg/kg of lead (with blood lead of 4.20 mumol/L) and 1333.3 mg/kg of lead, respectively, and levels of dopamine neurotransmitter and its metabolites declined and those of lipid peroxide increased with increasing exposure to lead. It is postulated changes in levels of neurotransmitter, such as monoamine and lipid peroxide, could explain the mechanism for damage in neurobehavioral function caused by lead exposure.",
