     "AB": "The influence of nifedipine, verapamil, and cinnarizine on the effect of ethanol on EEG of rabbits (frontal cortex, hippocampus, MRF) was tested. Nifedipine (1.75 mg/kg, IP) and cinnarizine (7.5 mg/kg, IP) were given 30 min before ethanol administration. Verapamil (0.2 mg/kg, IV) was given 15 min before ethanol injection in a dose of 0.8 g/kg IV. Ethanol caused the increase of the frequencies 0.5-4 cps in the recording, as well as a marked decrease of the fastest frequencies. Verapamil prevented ethanol's effect on EEG recording. Cinnarizine antagonized this action to a smaller extent and the influence of nifedipine is transitory and less pronounced.",
