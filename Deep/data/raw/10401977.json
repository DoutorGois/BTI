     "AB": "In order to evaluate the role of IL-1 production in post-traumatic brain, transcripts for IL-1 (alpha, beta, RA) have been quantified following RT-PCR, in hippocampus and cortex after injury of either hippocampus (Hip) or striatum (Stri). Moreover, 125I IL-1alpha binding sites have been directly quantified using binding experiments on brain sections and quantitative autoradiography. Under basal conditions, levels of PCR products were very low. On day 1, IL-1RA transcripts only were strongly increased in the hippocampus after Hip-lesions and in cortex after Stri lesion. Transcripts were back to control values on day 7 post-lesion. IL-1 receptor densities in the hippocampus (dentate gyrus) were decreased at day 1 around the site of the lesion (but not on the contralateral side) and were back to controls on day 7 indicating a transient and local IL-1 production in the surroundings of the lesion. No changes were found following Stri lesion. This study provides further evidence of the role of the IL-1 molecules family, notably IL-1RA, in the brain reaction to trauma.",
