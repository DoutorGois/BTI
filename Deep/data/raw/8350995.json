     "AB": "Applying quantitative microscopic histochemistry, the activity of acetylcholinesterase was determined in the various layers of the rat hippocampus at three different levels along the rostrocaudal extent. Two age groups of animals were examined: young adults (two to three months old) and aged subjects (26 months old). Young adults were divided into controls, and animals killed eight and 35 days following bilateral ibotenate lesioning of the medial septum-diagonal band complex. Aged rats were divided into controls and animals 35 days post-lesion. Analysis of variance revealed that the mean acetylcholinesterase activities of the entire hippocampus of individuals were not significantly different between young and aged rats when averaged across controls and 35 days post-lesion. There was a significant decrease of acetylcholinesterase activity (-52%) in young adults eight days post-lesion as compared to controls, but a significant increase (+63%) took place until 35 days post-lesion as compared to eight days post-lesion. Significantly lower activities existed, however, in young (-22%) and aged rats (-18%) 35 days post-lesion as compared to controls. This decrease in mean activity was not age dependent. As acetylcholinesterase is considered to be a good cholinergic indicator in the hippocampus, the results suggest a homotypic collateral sprouting from spared cholinergic afferents following ibotenate lesion of the medial septum-diagonal band complex in young and aged rats. Based on the data obtained, it is reasonable to assume that there was no difference in the post-lesional plasticity of neuronal acetylcholinesterase between young adult and aged rats.",
