     "AB": "The effect of experimental diabetes induced in rats was examined in brain areas like the septum, medial preoptic area, median eminence-arcuate region, amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus, pons and medulla. In all the areas studied, acute hyperglycemia caused an increase in the activity of acetylcholinesterase, the degradative enzyme of cholinergic system, whereas insulin administration reversed this effect. These findings suggest that the dysfunction of cholinergic system may also be involved in the diabetes associated CNS complications.",
