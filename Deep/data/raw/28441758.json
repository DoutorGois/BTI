     "AB": "Acteoside and isoacteoside, two phenylethanoid glycosides, coexist in some plants. This study investigates the memory-improving and cytoprotective effects of acteoside and isoacteoside in amyloid beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta 1-42)-infused rats and Abeta 1-42-treated SH-SY5Y cells. It further elucidates the role of amyloid cascade and central neuronal function in these effects. Acteoside and isoacteoside ameliorated cognitive deficits, decreased amyloid deposition, and reversed central cholinergic dysfunction that were caused by Abeta 1-42 in rats. Acteoside and isoacteoside further decreased extracellular Abeta 1-40 production and restored the cell viability that was decreased by Abeta 1-42 in SH-SY5Y cells. Acteoside and isoacteoside also promoted Abeta 1-40 degradation and inhibited Abeta 1-42 oligomerization in vitro. However, the memory-improving and cytoprotective effects of isoacteoside exceeded those of acteoside. Isoacteoside promoted exploratory behavior and restored cortical and hippocampal dopamine levels, but acteoside did not. We suggest that acteoside and isoacteoside ameliorated the cognitive dysfunction that was caused by Abeta 1-42 by blocking amyloid deposition via preventing amyloid oligomerization, and reversing central neuronal function via counteracting amyloid cytotoxicity.",
