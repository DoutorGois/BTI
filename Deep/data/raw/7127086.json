     "AB": "Dopamine release evoked by electrical field stimulation of slices from various regions of rat brain was assessed in the presence of 10-10-10-5 M melatonin. Inhibition of dopamine release by melatonin was observed in the ventral hippocampus, medulla pons, preoptic area and median and posterior hypothalamus. No inhibitory effect of melatonin on dopamine release was observed in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, dorsal hippocampus and striatum. Equal concentrations of melatonin were needed to produce half-maximal inhibition in all the regions affected. The results indicate that the brain sites for inhibitory effect of melatonin on dopamine neurosecretion overlap the sites reportedly involved in its modulation of neuroendocrine functions.",
