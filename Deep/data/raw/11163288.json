     "AB": "The present study examined whether anti-inflammatory drugs can ameliorate the postponed neuronal damage which has been observed following treatment of ischemic animals with 2,3-dihydro-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benz (F) quinoxaline (NBQX). Global cerebral ischemia was induced in male Wistar rats by four-vessel occlusion for 20 min. The animals were treated either with NBQX, rolipram, doxycycline or a combination of NBQX and rolipram or doxycycline. Four weeks after ischemia neuronal damage in the hippocampus was assessed. Treatment with NBQX or doxycycline did not affect ischemic neuronal damage whereas rolipram alone or combination of NBQX with either rolipram or doxycycline reduced neuronal damage. The present study shows that combining NBQX with an anti-inflammatory drug leads to long-lasting protection. These results suggest that inflammation contributes to the postponed neuronal damage following treatment with NBQX.",
