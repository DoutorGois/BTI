     "AB": "Perinatal glucocorticoid administration produces permanent spatial discrimination learning deficits in rats, presumably referable to changes in the development of neural systems subserving such functions. Because the hippocampal dentate gyrus and its afferent/efferent circuitry appear selectively vulnerable to neonatal steroid treatments, we have examined adult rats treated with neonatally administered glucocorticoids using electrophysiological methods. The techniques were chosen to reveal the topographic and neurophysiologic responsiveness of the major afferent supply to the dentate gyrus. Rats of both sexes received either a high dose (100 mg/kg) or low dose (1 mg/kg) of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone on postnatal day four, with control subjects receiving an injection of saline. These dosages have been shown to disrupt hippocampal dependent learning [6,38]. Laminar depth profile analyses of entorhinal cortex-dentate gyrus afferents revealed a significant shift in the spatial distribution of evoked extracellular population synaptic potentials (EPSPs) in glucocorticoid treated subjects. Stimulus-response functions also differed between glucocorticoid treated and control subjects. While response amplitudes at threshold stimulus intensities did not differ between groups, at higher stimulus intensities population spike potentials and associated EPSPs differed in glucocorticoid versus control subjects.",
