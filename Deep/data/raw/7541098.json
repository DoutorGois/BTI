     "AB": "The 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) system is involved in the defense of mammalian cells against virus infection. In a previous study [25], we demonstrated that the activities of the enzymes which synthesize and degrade 2-5A [2-5A synthetase (2-5OAS) and 2',3'-exoribonuclease] and of the enzyme that is activated by 2-5A (ribonuclease L) change during aging and development in different tissues of rat. The age-dependent decrease in 2-5OAS activity and increase in 2-5A nuclease activity results in a decrease in the cellular 2-5A content, suggesting that the efficiency of the antiviral 2-5A system is impaired in aged rats. Here we determined the age-dependent changes in the level of mRNA coding for the class I isoenzyme of 2-5OAS (M(r) 40-46 kDa) in rat liver and brain using a cDNA which was recently cloned from rat hippocampus. We found that the decrease in 2-5OAS activity is accompanied by a decrease in the level of 2-5OAS mRNA; in old animals (32-33 months old), the amount of 2-5OAS mRNA was reduced to 20-30% compared to young adult (2-3 months old) (100%) and middle-aged adult animals (12 months old) (110-120%). In addition, Western-blotting experiments revealed that the amount of class I 2-5OAS capable of binding to its activator, poly(I).poly(C), is also diminished in the livers and brains of old rats compared to those of young adult and middle-aged adult animals.",
