     "AB": "Richly detailed memories for particular events depend on processes that bind individual features of experience together. Previous cognitive behavioral research indicates that older adults have more difficulty than young adults in conditions requiring feature binding. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a working memory task to identify neural substrates of this age-related deficit in feature binding. For young, but not older, adults there was greater activation in left anterior hippocampus on combination trials (remember objects together with their locations) than on trials in which participants were told to remember only which objects or only which locations occurred. The results provide neuroimaging evidence for an age-related hippocampal dysfunction in feature binding in working memory.",
