     "AB": "Oscillations in hippocampal local field potentials (LFP) reflect the coordinated, rhythmic activity of constituent interneuronal and principal cell populations. Quantifying changes in oscillatory patterns and power therefore provides a powerful metric through which to infer mechanisms and functions of hippocampal network activity at the mesoscopic level, bridging single-neuron studies to behavioral assays of hippocampal function. Here, complementary protocols that enable mechanistic analyses of oscillation generation in vitro (in slices and a whole hippocampal preparation) and functional analyses of hippocampal circuits in behaving mice are described. Used together, these protocols provide a comprehensive view of hippocampal phenotypes in mouse models, highlighting oscillatory biomarkers of hippocampal function and dysfunction. Curr. Protoc.
