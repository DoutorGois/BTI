     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: This study explored the effects of levetiracetam (LEV) on the expression of nerve cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) mRNA in the hippocampus of rats with epilepsy induced by lithium-pilocarpine (Li-PILO) in order to provide a basis for investigating the antiepileptic mechanism of LEV and its doseresponse. METHODS: Forty-eight Wistar rats were randomly divided into a normal control, a Li-PILO model and two LEV treatment groups (LEV: 150 and 300 mg/kg) (n=12 each). The LEV treatment groups received LEV by intragastric administration 6 hrs after status epilepticus (once daily for 2 two weeks). The expressions of NCAM and GAP-43 mRNA in the hippocampus was determined by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The expression of NCAM and GAP-43 mRNA in the Li-PILO model group was significantly higher than in the normal control group (P<0.05). LEV treatment of 150 and 300 mg/kg significantly decreased the expression of NCAM and GAP-43 mRNA compared with the Li-PILO model group (P<0.05). The LEV treatment group at the dose of 300 mg/kg showed significantly lower expression of NCAM and GAP-43 mRNA than the 150 mg/kg LEV treatment group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Li-PILO can up-regulate the expressions of NCAM and GAP-43 mRNA in the hippocampus of rats with epilepsy. LEV can inhibit the expression of NCAM and GAP-43 mRNA and the effect is associated with the dose of LEV.",
