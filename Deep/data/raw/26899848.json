     "AB": "The expression of neurogenesis marker--NeuroD2 transcription factor--in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was studied in rats exposed to severe destructive hypoxia, a single or three episodes of moderate hypobaric hypoxia, preconditioned severe hypoxia, and severe hypoxia followed by 3 sessions of postconditioning by moderate hypobaric hypoxia. All the studied hypoxic exposure modes led to an increase of NeuroD2 level. Three-fold moderate hypoxia per se and in the preconditioning mode (followed by exposure to severe hypoxia) produced most pronounced up-regulatory effect on NeuroD2 expression. The results indicated that stimulation of neurogenesis processes seemed to be one of the aspects of the neuroprotective effect of three-fold preconditioning moderate hypoxia, but not of hypoxic postconditioning.",
