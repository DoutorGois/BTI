     "AB": "Neurotrophins are traditionally thought to be secretory proteins that regulate long-term survival and differentiation of neurons. Recent studies have revealed a previously unexpected role for neurotrophins in synaptic development and plasticity in diverse neuronal populations. In this review, we focus on the synaptic function of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. Although a variety of in vitro experiments have shown the ability of BDNF to acutely modulate synaptic transmission, whether BDNF truly potentiates basal synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons remains controversial. More consistent evidence has been obtained for the role of BDNF in long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model for learning and memory. BDNF also potentiates high frequency transmission by modulating the number of docked vesicles and the levels of the vesicle protein synaptobrevin and synaptophysin at the CA1 synapses. Both pre- and postsynaptic effects of BDNF have been demonstrated. Recent studies have begun to address the role of BDNF in late-phase LTP and in the development of hippocampal circuit. BDNF and other neurotrophins may represent a new class of neuromodulators that regulate neuronal connectivity and synaptic efficacy. J. Neurosci. Res. 58:76-87, 1999.
