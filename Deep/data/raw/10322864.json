     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the protective effect of Huanshaodan (HSD) in mouse brain in a steady ischemia-reperfusion model. METHODS: Step-through experiment, receptor binding test and choline acetyl-transferase (CAT) activity determination was performed. RESULTS: After HSD treatment, mice made much less mistakes in step-through experiment than sham groups. Meanwhile the 3H-MK801 binding of cerebral cortex and hippocampus tissues was significantly decreased. CAT activity of cerebral cortex and hippocampus tissue were increased respectively. CONCLUSION: HSD might antagonize ischemia injury of brain through modulating excessive activation of glutamate N-methyl-D-Aspartic acid receptors.",
