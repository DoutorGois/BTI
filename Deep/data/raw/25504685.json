     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To observe the expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT) in six cerebral regions of a methamphetamine (MA)-dependent rat, which were frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens septi, striatum, hippocampus, substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. METHODS: The rats were administrated intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg/day of MA for 10 days consecutively; the behaviour changes were measured via the conditioned place preference (CPP), and the scores of stereotyped behaviour (SB) were used to confirm animal addiction. Then, the animals were further injected with MA respectively for 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks to establish different periods of MA-dependent models. The expressions of DAT and DAT messenger RNA in six cerebral regions were detected. RESULTS: The results of CPP and SB scores were significant different when comparing all four experimental groups with the control group (p < 0.05). Comparing between different experimental groups, the expression of DAT mainly decreased and had dynamic changes in the same regions (p < 0.05). Comparing the different regions with each other in the same experimental group, the expression of DAT also had significant difference in several regions p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of DAT mainly decreased and had different in the six cerebral regions at the same MA-dependent time period as well as at different time periods in the same cerebral region. It was speculated that DAT might play a crucial role in the mechanism of MA dependence.",
