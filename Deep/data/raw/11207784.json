     "AB": "Febrile status epilepticus (SE) represents the extreme end of the complex febrile seizure spectrum. If there are significant sequelae to febrile seizures, they should be more common in this group. We have prospectively identified 180 children aged 1 month to 10 years who presented with febrile SE over a 10-year period in Bronx, New York, and Richmond, Virginia. They were compared with 244 children who presented with their first febrile seizure (not SE) in a prospective study done in the Bronx. The mean age of the children with febrile SE was 1.92 years, and of the comparison group, 1.85 years. Duration of SE was 30-59 min in 103 (58%), 60-119 min in 43 (24%), and > or =120 min in 34 (18%). Focal features were present in 64 (35%) of cases. There were no deaths and no cases of new cognitive or motor handicap. Children with febrile SE were more likely to be neurologically abnormal (20% vs. 5%; p < 0.001), to have a history of neonatal seizures (3% vs. 0; p = 0.006) and a family history of epilepsy (11% vs. 5%; p = 0.05) and less likely to have a family history of febrile seizures (15% vs. 27%; p = 0.01) than were children in the comparison group. The short-term morbidity and mortality of febrile SE are low. There are differences in the types of children who have febrile SE compared with those who experience briefer febrile seizures. Long-term follow-up of this cohort may provide insight into the relationship of prolonged febrile seizures and subsequent mesial temporal sclerosis.",
