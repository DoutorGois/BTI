     "AB": "Lead exposure has devastating effects on the developing nervous system, and has been implicated in variety of behavioral and cognitive deficits as well as neural morphological abnormalities. Since lead impacts many calcium-dependent processes, one likely mechanism of lead toxicity is its disruption of calcium dependent processes, among which is neuronal differentiation. We investigated the effects of inorganic lead on survival and several parameters of differentiation of cultured neurons. Three different cell types were used: Rat hippocampal neurons (a primary CNS cell type), B50 rat neuroblastoma cells (a transformed CNS-derived cell line), and N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells (a transformed peripherally-derived cell line). Lead concentrations ranged from low nM to 1 mM. Lead effects differed considerably among the three cell types, with B50 cells least affected. Lead effects were generally multimodal, with fewest effects observed at intermediate concentrations. Lead inhibited neurite initiation in hippocampal neurons, but stimulated initiation in N1E-115 cells. In those cells that differentiated, lead increased dendrite numbers in hippocampal neurons and neurite numbers in N1E-115 cells. Lead exposure increased both the length and the degree of branching of axons in hippocampal neurons and the length of neurites in N1E-115 cells. We hypothesize that lead impacts multiple regulatory processes that influence neuron survival and differentiation, and that its effects show differing dose-dependencies. The differing responses of the different cell types to lead suggests that differentiation may be regulated in different ways by the three types of cells. Alternatively, or additionally, the cell types may differ in their ability to compensate for, sequester, or expel lead.",
