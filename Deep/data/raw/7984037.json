     "AB": "The autosomal recessive lethal anorexia mutation in mice (anx/anx) causes starvation in preweanlings. In addition, this murine neurodevelopmental mutant shows other distinct phenotypic characteristics and dysfunctional behaviors. Previous studies strongly suggested that the mutation results in elevated serotonergic stimulation, because these traits are characteristic of such overstimulation and because brain serotonin is believed to have an inhibitory effect on feeding behavior. In this report, we show extensive serotonergic hyperinnervation in normal target fields (hippocampus, cortex, olfactory bulb and cerebellum) of mutant mice. Despite the extensive hyperinnervation, the normal laminar organization of the brain was retained. The specificity of the mutation to the serotonergic system was confirmed by demonstration of normal catecholaminergic innervation in the central nervous system (CNS), and this specificity was especially striking in a common target field, the cerebellum. Serotonergic hyperinnervation in these mutant preweanling mice may represent the underlying etiology of increased serotonergic stimulation which leads to anorexic starvation, abnormal behavior, and premature death.",
