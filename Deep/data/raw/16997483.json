     "AB": "Nestin is an intermediate filament protein serving as a marker for neuroprogenitor and stem cells. Here we report that a cluster of previously unrecognized nestin immunoreactive (nestin-ir) neurons was located in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca (MS-DBB) of the basal forebrain in adult rats. Nestin-ir neurons were exclusively located in the MS-DBB and intermingled with choline acetyltransferase-ir (ChAT-ir), parvalbumin-ir (PV-ir), or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase reactive (NADPHd-reactive) neurons. However, there was no colocalization between nestin-ir and PV-ir in single neurons in MS-DBB; only about 35% of nestin-ir neurons were ChAT-ir, and 8%-12% of nestin-ir neurons were NADPHd-reactive. Morphologically, nestin-ir neurons showed a larger size of somata than that of ChAT-ir or PV-ir neurons and the distribution of nestin-ir neurons spread across the rostro-caudal extent of the MS-DBB. Moreover, retrograde tracing revealed that a significant portion of these nestin-ir neurons projected to the thalamus and hippocampus. These results, for the first time, provide strong evidence that there exists a cluster of previously unrecognized nestin-ir neurons in MS-DBB of the basal forebrain in adult rats and that these nestin-ir neurons are distinguishable from ChAT-ir, PV-ir, and NADPHd-reactive neurons.",
