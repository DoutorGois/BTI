     "AB": "The electrophysiological actions of somatostatin (somatotropin release inhibiting factor; SRIF) were investigated in the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation. Intracellular recordings were obtained from pyramidal neurons in area CA1 in slices of hippocampus from guinea pigs and rabbits. Somatostatin, applied via micropressure ejection to CA1 pyramidal-cell somata, was primarily excitatory. The effects, however, were quite variable, with nearly all cells displaying pronounced tachyphylaxis. A majority of cells was depolarized by SRIF, but hyperpolarizations or biphasic depolarization/hyperpolarization responses were also recorded. Only minimal conductance changes were associated with the SRIF-induced voltage changes. Depletion of SRIF, by injection of the intact animal with cysteamine several hours before preparing slices, resulted in no obvious abnormalities in hippocampal slice electrophysiology. Our results obtained with application of exogenous SRIF are consistent with the concept that SRIF acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in hippocampus. However, our attempts to demonstrate endogenous SRIF action have thus far been unsuccessful.",
