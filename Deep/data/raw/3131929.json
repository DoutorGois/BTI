     "AB": "To study the retention of TCB in the brain of the immature mouse and its effects on the muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, [14C]TCB and TCB were administered to 10-day-old mice as a single peroral dose of 1.5 MBq/kg body wt and 0.41 mg or 41 mg/kg body wt, respectively. The mice were killed 24 h or 7 days after treatment. The amount of radioactivity in the whole brain decreased by 78% between 24 h and 7 days after administration. The density of muscarinic receptors was measured using the muscarinic antagonist [3H]QNB. A significant decrease (16%) in specific [3H]QNB binding was observed in the hippocampus 7 days after treatment. Despite the relatively rapid elimination of TCB from the immature mouse brain, a single low dose of TCB given during the period of rapid development of the cholinergic system appeared to affect the muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the immature mice.",
