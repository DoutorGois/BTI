     "AB": "Selective lesions of the dorsal (B7), median (B8), or lateral (B9) raphe nuclei were made stereotaxically in male rats 4 weeks before sacrifice. The extent of damage to each raphe nucleus was quantified histologically by means of a simplified formaldehyde histochemical method for visualization of serotonin in cryostat sections. A detailed mapping of the distribution of the yellow-fluorescent raphe perikarya provided the basis for quantification. Tryptophan hydroxylase activity was measured in 6 forebrain regions from each animal, and the results were correlated with the per cent damage to each raphe nucleus. Tyrosine hydroxylase was also assayed in 5 of these regions; it was not significantly affected by any of the raphe lesions. Dorsal raphe lesions reduced tryptophan hydroxylase activity in the striatum, thalamus, cortex, and hypothalamus, but not in the septal nuclei or hippocampus. Damage to B8 resulted in decrements in this serotonergic enzyme in the septal nuclei, hippocampus, cortex, and hypothalamus, but not in the striatum or thalamus. Lesions of the scattered B9 cells had no significant effect on enzyme activity in any region examined. These data suggest that the dorsal and median raphe nuclei provide two distinct though perhaps overlapping serotonergic systems innervating different parts of the forebrain: a mesostriatal pathway originating in B7 and a mesolimbic system derived from B8. Behavioral studies on the animals, which are presented in a companion paper, indicated that damage to the median nucleus is responsible for many of the behavioral effects previously reported after combined lesions of both major raphe nuclei.",
