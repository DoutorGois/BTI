     "AB": "Protein synthesis was investigated in rats subjected to 30 min of bicuculline-induced seizures using biochemical and autoradiographic techniques. Incorporation studies were performed on freely convulsive animals following systemic administration of either a tracer dose of L-[1-14C]tyrosine or a flooding dose (7.5 mmol/kg) of L-[1-14C]valine. Using a tracer dose, amino acid incorporation was only moderately reduced (forebrain) or slightly enhanced (cerebellum/brainstem and spinal cord) but the specific radioactivity of [14C]tyrosine in the acid-soluble pool was increased 3- to 5-fold in experimental animals. After a flooding dose of [14C]valine the specific activity of the precursor amino acid was similar in control and convulsed animals. Under these conditions incorporation rates in forebrain and cerebellum/brainstem were reduced to 54 and 75%, respectively. Reduction of amino acid incorporation was even more pronounced in extraneural tissues, e.g. liver (6%), intestine (14%) and kidney (15%). Inhibition of protein synthesis in forebrain and cerebellum/brainstem was paralleled by a similar extent of polyribosome disaggregation in these regions (53 adn 78% of controls). In anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated rats, 30 min of seizure activity reduced forebrain polyribosomes to a similar extent (57%). Extraneural (hepatic) protein synthesis was also affected in physiologically controlled rats, but cerebellar polysomes were completely preserved. Autoradiographic studies using 3H-labelled amino acids were carried out to identify nerve cell populations most heavily affected. In freely convulsive rats both tracer dose and pool overloading revealed a similar regional pattern with preferential inhibition of amino acid incorporation in forebrain cortex, thalamus and the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus. These sites were also affected in the physiologically controlled animal, but the focal distribution of hippocampal and thalamic neurones with reduced protein synthesis differed from that in freely convulsive rats.",
