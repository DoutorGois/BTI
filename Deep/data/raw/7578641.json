     "AB": "Schizophrenia is often characterized by compromised neuropsychological functioning, especially on tasks sensitive to frontal and temporohippocampal functions but the extent to which cognitive dysfunction can be modified in schizophrenics remains unclear. Twenty-four inpatient schizophrenics and 24 intellectually and demographically matched, inpatient mood-disordered controls were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. Subjects assigned to the cued condition received instructional cues on measures of visual and semantic memory, executive function, and constructional ability. Subjects in the standard condition performed the same neuropsychological measures without cues. The present study revealed some degree of plasticity of neurobehavioral function in schizophrenia.",
