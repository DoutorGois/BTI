     "AB": "The presence of alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, a serine proteinase inhibitor with a high affinity for cathepsin G, is demonstrated in the normal human central nervous system (CNS) by immunohistochemical techniques. Paraffin-embedded normal human CNS tissue from five adult, two fetal, one neonatal and three newborn autopsies were stained with monospecific rabbit antibodies to human alpha-1-antichymotrypsin using biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibodies and an avidinbiotin-peroxidase complex. Positive immunostaining was seen in neurons and glial cells in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord of the adults. The epithelium of the adult choroid plexus had the most intense staining in apical granular organelles corresponding in position to lysosomes or secretory granules. Ependymal cells, particularly those near the choroid plexus, were immunostained. The fetal CNS had no alpha-1-antichymotrypsin staining. Limited staining of choroid plexus, ependyma, and frontal lobe was found in the newborns. Immunostaining in the neonatal temporal lobe was only found in the choroid-plexus epithelium. These observations establish a widespread distribution of this proteinase inhibitor in the normal human CNS. Developmental regulation of this inhibitor in the human CNS is also indicated.",
