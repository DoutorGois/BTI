     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Isoflurane and sevoflurane are widely used anesthetics in surgery and administration of these anesthetics could lead to postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). However, the mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: Aged Wistar rats were exposed to isoflurane and sevoflurane for 2 or 4h. Recognition memory and spatial working memory were measured using Novel object recognition (NOR) and Y-maze test, respectively. Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL staining. miRNA expression was measured by Real-time PCR while protein expression was measured by Western blot. Dual-Luciferase reporter assay was used to establish the direct relationship between miRNAs and Gabra5 and gephyrin gene expression. RESULTS: Exposure to isoflurane and sevoflurane for 2 or 4h significantly decreased the NOR index in the NOR test and spontaneous alternations in arm entries in the Y-maze test in aged rats. TUNEL staining showed that isoflurane and sevoflurane administration significantly induced apoptosis in the mPFC and hippocampus. The protein level of alpha5 GABAA receptor (alpha5GABAAR), gephyrin, and dystrophin were significantly increased, whereas the expression of miR-30a, miR-31, miR-190a, and miR-190b was significantly decreased in the hippocampus and mPFC in aged rats exposed to isoflurane and sevoflurane compared to control rats. The protein levels of alpha5GABAAR, gephyrin, and dystrophin protein in the hippocampus and the mPFC significantly correlated with NOR index and spontaneous alternations. Dual-Luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-30a and miR-190a/b mimics significantly inhibited Gabra5 and gephyrin gene expression, respectively. CONCLUSION: There might be a miRNAs-GABAergic transmission pathway which may be involved in the pathophysiological alteration in anesthetics-induced POCD.",
