     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of nimodipine on the cognition status and the changes of metabolites in brain tissue in the patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in order to evaluate the significance of intervening MCI with medication. METHODS: 31 patients with MCI were selected 16 cases were in a treatment group taking nimodipine for 3 months besides taking basic internal medication and 15 cases in a control group taking only basic internal medication. Before and after treatment, multiple cognition tests were carried out in both groups and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in Hippocampus region was carried out in 5 patients of the treatment group. RESULTS: Verbal instant recall scores, symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) scores and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) total scores in the treatment group were improved significantly after treatment as compared with those in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Nimodipine can improve memory ability as well as attention ability of the patients with MCI to a certain extent and make the general cognition function improved.",
