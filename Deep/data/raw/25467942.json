     "AB": "We investigated the extent to which decline in memory and working memory in beta-amyloid (Abeta) positive non-demented individuals was related to hippocampal atrophy and Abeta accumulation over 36 months. Cognitively normal older adults (CN) (n = 178) and adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 49) underwent positron emission tomography neuroimaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive assessments at baseline, 18- and 36-months. Relative to Abeta- CNs, Abeta+ CNs and Abeta+ MCIs showed greater rates of cognitive decline, Abeta accumulation, and hippocampal atrophy. Analysis of interrelationships between these Alzheimer's disease markers in Abeta+ CNs and MCIs indicated that rate of Abeta accumulation was associated with rate of hippocampal atrophy (beta = -0.05, p = .037), which was in turn associated independently with rate of decline in memory (beta = -0.03, p = .032). This suggests that Abeta accumulation precedes any neurodegeneration or clinical symptoms, and that the relationship between Abeta and cognitive decline is mediated by hippocampal atrophy.",
