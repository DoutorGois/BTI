     "AB": "The effects of electrostimulation of caput nuclei caudati (CNC) were investigated in 57 patients. Long-term implanted multicontact electrodes were used in 38 patients. In 23 cases, completely implanted neurostimulators and in the remaining 15 cases externalized electrodes were used. Investigations demonstrated that a low-frequency (4-6 Hz) stimulation of certain points of the ventral part of CNC reliably led to (1) a decrease of interparoxysmal activity in the neocortical and mesial temporal epileptic foci; (2) a decrease of focal discharges in the aforementioned areas, and (3) abrupt cessation of spreading and generalized discharge.",
