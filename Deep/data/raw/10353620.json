     "AB": "This experiment was designed to assess the role of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic (ACh) system in the deleterious effects produced by systemic benzodiazepine injection on learning processes in rats. Retention of a step through passive avoidance task was analysed after systemic injection of increasing doses of either scopolamine or diazepam applied alone 30 min before the acquisition phase. Results indicated a dose related impairment of retention by each drug: in addition, sub-threshold doses of scopolamine and diazepam applied in combination (diazepam: 2mg/kg plus scopolamine: 0.3mg/kg) produced a decrease of retention latencies, thus showing an additive effect of the combined treatment. Secondly, a sub-threshold dose of scopolamine (15microg/0.5microl) was also administered into the medial septal area, together with an i.p. injection of 2mg/kg of diazepam. This combined treatment produced a severe impairment of retention, in parallel with a large reduction in emotionality (number of faeces). The data are consistent with the hypothesis that peripheral administration of behaviorally effective doses of diazepam on passive avoidance learning might act partially via a septal ACh-GABA/benzodiazepine mechanism. It is also suggested that this mechanism subserves both anxiety and the memorisation of contextual stimuli associated with passive avoidance acquisition, through the modification of the septo-hippocampal activity.",
