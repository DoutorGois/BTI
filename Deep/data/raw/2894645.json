     "AB": "The levels of immunoreactive dynorphin A(1-8) (ir-DYN8) were measured in discrete brain regions of lean Zucker rats subjected to food deprivation for 72 hr and to a high fat diet, and in fatty Zucker rats after food deprivation for 72 hr. Fatty rats showed higher concentrations of ir-DYN8 in the cortex and midbrain, when compared to lean rats fed a stock diet ad lib. Food deprivation increased ir-DYN8 levels in the cortex of lean rats and fatty rats and in the hippocampus of fatty rats, but decreased its content in the striatum of lean rats and in the midbrain of fatty rats. The high fat diet increased ir-DYN8 levels in the cortex and midbrain of lean rats. These results suggest that ir-DYN8 levels in extrahypothalamic structures of Zucker rats could be differentially modified under conditions of hereditary obesity and dietary manipulations.",
