     "AB": "To assess the role of nitric oxide (NO) in cerebral ischemia, we investigated the effect of L-arginine, a substrate of NO synthase (NOS), and NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), a NOS inhibitor, on neuronal death in the CA1 hippocampal region. Seventy-two Mongolian gerbils were used in the study. Both carotid arteries were occluded for 4 min to induce forebrain ischemia. Temporal muscle temperature was strictly maintained at 37.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C during the ischemia. L-arginine (10 and 100 mg kg-1) or L-NNA (1, 10 and 100 mg kg-1) was administered intraperitoneally 4 times: 30 min before, 3 h, 6 h and 24 h after induction of ischemia. Four days after ischemic insult, the animals were perfusion-fixed, and the neuronal densities in the medial, middle and lateral CA1 subfield were estimated. Average neuronal cell density of the control group was 2-3 mm in each subfield. L-arginine at doses of 10 and 100 mg kg-1 did not prevent neuronal death. L-NNA at doses of 1 and 10 mg kg-1 did not protect neuronal cells from ischemia either. However, in ischemia gerbils treated with 100 mg kg-1 L-NNA, the average neuronal cell density in the lateral CA1 subfield was 54.4 +/- 19.1, L-NNA (100 mg kg-1) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the occurrence of neuronal death in the lateral CA1 subfield. The present results suggest that NO plays an important role in the development of neuronal injury after global ischemia.",
