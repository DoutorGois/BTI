     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Recently, a mouse model showed that progranulin, a mediator in neuroinflammation and a neuronal growth factor, was elevated in the hippocampus after status epilepticus (SE). This elevated level might mirror compensating neuronal mechanisms after SE. Studies concerning neuronal recovery and neuroprotective mechanisms after SE in humans are scarce, so we tested for progranulinin the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after various types of SE. METHOD: We performed a retrospective analysis of progranulin levels in CSF in patients (n = 24) who underwent lumbar puncture as part of diagnostic workup after having SE and in patients after having one single tonic-clonic seizure who comprised the control group (n = 8). RESULTS: In our group with SE, progranulin levels in CSF were not significantly elevated compared to our control group. Furthermore, there was no correlation between progranulin levels and the time interval between lumbar puncture and SE. Additionally, in cases of higher CSF progranulin levels, we found no impact on the clinical outcome after SE. CONCLUSION: Although our cohort is heterogeneous and not fully sufficient, we conclude that progranulin in CSF is not elevated after SE in our cohort. Therefore, our results do not suggest a change in cerebral progranulin metabolism as a possible neuroregenerative or neuroprotective mechanism in humans after SE in acute and subacute phases. A larger cohort study is needed to further strengthen this result. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \"Status Epilepticus\".",
