     "AB": "It is widely assumed that behavioral learning reflects adaptive properties of the neuronal networks underlying behavior. Adaptive properties of networks in turn arise from the existence of biochemical mechanisms that regulate the efficacy of synaptic transmission. Considerable progress has been made in the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in synaptic plasticity at central synapses and especially those responsible for the phenomenon of long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in hippocampus. While the nature and the timing requirements of the triggering steps are reasonably well known, there is still a lot of uncertainty concerning the mechanisms responsible for the long-term changes. Several biochemical processes have been proposed to play critical roles in promoting long-lasting modifications of synaptic efficacy. This review examines first the triggers that are necessary to produce LTP in the hippocampus and then the different biochemical processes that have been considered to participate in the maintenance of LTP. Finally, we examine the relationships between LTP and behavioral learning.",
