     "AB": "Sprague-Dawley rats were maternally and permanently exposed to Pb (1000 ppm in their drinking water as lead acetate). Behavioral functions were examined starting at post-natal day (PN) 84. Lead exposure did not change spatial learning in the radial arm maze, but induced higher locomotor activity as observed in the open-field and in the radial arm maze. Lead treatment did not impact motor coordination. Autoradiographic analysis of brain sections indicated that Pb-exposure did produce a decrease in [125I]sulpride (D2 receptor antagonist) binding in the cerebral cortex, but not in the striatum and thalamus nucleus. No change was found in [125I]SCH-23982 (D1 receptor antagonist) binding. Since the cortical dopaminergic system is critical for cognitive processes and motor behavior, it is possible that Pb-related change in D2 receptors may mediate to it induced hyperlocomotor activity.",
