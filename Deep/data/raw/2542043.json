     "AB": "Neurotransmitter receptor binding and Na+, K+-ATPase activity were examined in the brains of six rats exposed to 7 days of microgravity during the flight of Spacelab 3. The same variables were examined in a group of six ground control rats. 5-HT1 receptor number in the hippocampus was significantly elevated by exposure to the microgravity environment, and cortical sodium-potassium pump activity was significantly depressed. A marginal depression in dopamine D-2 binding in the striatum was noted. Dopamine and 5-HT binding in a wide variety of other central regions, in addition to GABAA, muscarinic acetylcholine, adenosine A1, and opiate receptor binding, and adrenoceptor binding, was unaffected by microgravity exposure.",
