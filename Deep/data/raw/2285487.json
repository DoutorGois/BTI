     "AB": "Three-month-old infant monkeys with neonatal ablations of either cortical area TE or the amygdala and hippocampus and age-matched normal infants were trained in a concurrent object discrimination task with 24-hr intertrial intervals. Neonatal area TE lesions yielded a transient deficit in visual habit formation, present in the female monkeys only, whereas the same lesions in adult monkeys yielded a severe and long-lasting deficit in both males and females. Although pointing to a greater neural compensation for the early loss as compared with the later loss of cortical area TE, the results also corroborate a recent suggestion (Bachevalier, Hagger, & Bercu, 1989) that, at 3 months of age, area TE is more fully functional in females than in males. Neither early nor late amygdalohippocampal lesions impaired the ability to form visual discrimination habits, strengthening the proposal that the habit system uses a corticononlimbic circuit.",
