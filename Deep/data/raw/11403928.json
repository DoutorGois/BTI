     "AB": "Control of seizure-induced neuronal death may involve members of the Bcl-2 family of cell death regulating proteins. Bcl-w is a newly described anti-apoptotic member of this family that may confer neuroprotective effects. We therefore investigated Bcl-w expression in rat brain following focally evoked limbic seizures. Seizures were induced by unilateral microinjection of kainic acid into the amygdala of the rat and terminated after 40 min by diazepam. Constitutive Bcl-w expression was detected by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Bcl-w expression was increased 4-72 h following seizures within the injured hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry determined Bcl-w was predominantly expressed in neurons and seizures increased Bcl-w immunoreactivity within piriform cortex and surviving regions of the injured hippocampus. These data suggest Bcl-w may be involved in the modulation of seizure-induced brain injury.",
