     "AB": "A 14-year-old girl was diagnosed as having herpes simplex encephalitis by a polymerase chain reaction examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. MRI showed diffuse high signal areas at the bilateral temporal lobes and right frontal lobe. She was treated with a total of 350 mg/kg of acyclovir for 23 days, and discharged without abnormal neurological findings. On the 90th day after the onset, however, she became excitable and aggressive to her family. She excessively seeked relations with several boy friends. MRI revealed dilation of the bilateral ventricles and atrophy of the temporal lobes. These pathologic changes including the atrophy of hippocampus may be responsible for the character changes in this case.",
