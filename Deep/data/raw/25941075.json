     "AB": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) refers to a series of clinical syndromes, including symptoms such as nightmares, hallucinations, severe anxiety, fear, and trauma related to the environment. These symptoms tend to occur after intense psychological trauma or physiological stress. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play key roles in various biological processes, although it is unknown whether they have important functions in PTSD. Here, we present the first study exploring the connection between lncRNAs and a PTSD-like syndrome in rats. We find distinct expression profiles of lncRNAs between PTSD-like syndrome rats and a control group, which provides information for further research on the differentiation of PTSD and transdifferentiation between the PTSD-like syndrome and the control group. This information will be helpful for finding new therapeutic targets for the treatment of PTSD.",
