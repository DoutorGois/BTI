     "AB": "Activation of large conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium (BK) channels hastens action potential repolarisation and generates the fast afterhyperpolarisation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. A rapid coupling of Ca(2+) entry with BK channel activation is necessary for this to occur, which might result from an identified coupling of Ca(2+) entry through N-type Ca(2+) channels to BK channel activation. This selective coupling was extremely rapid and resistant to intracellular BAPTA, suggesting that the two channel types are close. Using reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, we found that N-type channels were more abundantly associated with BK channels than L-type channels (Ca(V)1.2) in rat brain. Expression of only the pore-forming alpha-subunits of the N-type (Ca(V)2.2) and BK (Slo(27)) channels in a non-neuronal cell-line gave robust macroscopic currents and reproduced the interaction. Co-expression of Ca(V)2.2/Ca(V)beta(3) subunits with Slo(27) channels revealed rapid functional coupling. By contrast, extremely rare examples of rapid functional coupling were observed with co-expression of Ca(V)1.2/Ca(V)beta(3) and Slo(27) channels. Action potential repolarisation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons was slowed by the N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not by the L-type channel blocker isradipine. These data showed that selective functional coupling between N-type Ca(2+) and BK channels provided rapid activation of BK channels in central neurons.",
