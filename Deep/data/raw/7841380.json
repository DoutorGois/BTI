     "AB": "Regulation of CNTF mRNA was investigated in primary cortical astrocytes cultured from newborn rats and in C6 glioma cells. Northern blot analysis indicated that semi-confluent astrocyte cell cultures. CNTF added to confluent astrocyte cultures down-regulated CNTF message in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, when CNTF was given to semi-confluent astrocyte cultures the level of CNTF mRNA was up-regulated. C6 glioma cells also showed a cell density-dependent expression of CNTF: cells from confluent cultures expressed detectable amounts of CNTF mRNA whereas those from semi-confluent cultures did not. Thus, CNTF mRNA expression by astroglial and glioma cells is regulated by cell contact and exogenous CNTF in vitro.",
