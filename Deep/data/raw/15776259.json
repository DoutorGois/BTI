     "AB": "For about 5,000 years, cannabis has been used as a therapeutic agent. There has been growing interest in the medical use of cannabinoids. This is based on the discovery that cannabinoids act with specific receptors (CB1 and CB2). CB1 receptors are located in specific brain areas (e.g. cerebellum, basal ganglia, and hippocampus) and CB2 receptors on cells of the immune system. Endogenous ligands of the cannabinoid receptors were also discovered (e.g. anandamids). Many physiologic processes are modulated by the two subtypes of cannabinoid receptor: motor functions, memory, appetite, and pain. These innovative neurobiologic/pharmacologic findings could possibly lead to the use of synthetic and natural cannabinoids as therapeutic agents in various areas. Until now, cannabinoids were used as antiemetic agents in chemotherapy-induced emesis and in patients with HIV-wasting syndrome. Evidence suggests that cannabinoids may prove useful in some other diseases, e.g. movement disorders such as Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and pain. These new findings also explain the acute adverse effects following cannabis use.",
