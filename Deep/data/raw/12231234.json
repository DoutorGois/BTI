     "AB": "Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were treated with the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine to study induced seizure-like activity and changes in neurotrophin and neuropeptide expression. For establishment of a seizure-inducing protocol, 2-week-old cultures derived from 6-8-day-old rats were exposed to 0.1 mM to 5 mM of pilocarpine for 4 h to 7 days. Other cultures were treated with pilocarpine for 7 days and left for 7-14 days in normal medium. Age-matched, non-treated cultures served as controls. Intracellular recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells revealed increased spontaneous activity in 31 of 35 cultures superfused with 0.1 or 5 mM pilocarpine. Epileptiform discharges were recorded in 17 of the 31 cultures, and 19 displayed frequencies specifically in the 6-12-Hz (Theta rhythm) range when superfused with pilocarpine. The pilocarpine effect was blocked by simultaneous superfusion with the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (100 microM). Regardless of dose and exposure time, the pilocarpine treatment induced very limited neuronal cell death, recorded as cellular propidium iodide uptake. Cultures exposed to 5 mM pilocarpine for up to 7 days displayed increased BDNF expression when analyzed by Western blot and ELISA. This BDNF increase correlated with increased neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity, known to accompany seizure activity. Addition of BDNF (200 ng/ml) to otherwise untreated cultures also upregulated NPY expression. The pilocarpine-induced seizure-like activity in hippocampal slice cultures, with concomitant increase in BDNF and NPY expression, is compared with in vivo observations and discussed in terms of the potential use of the easily accessible slice cultures in experimental seizure research.",
