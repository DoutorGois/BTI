     "AB": "Serial measurements of auditory brainstem-evoked responses (BERs) were conducted in 15 patients with supratentorial mass lesions. Significant prolongation of the latency of wave V BERs, which originates in the inferior colliculus, occurred when the intracranial pressure (ICP) approached 30 mmHg. In four of five patients whose BERs were measured before pupillary changes, a significant lengthening of wave V latency was observed prior to clinical manifestation of uncal herniation. These results suggest that immediate medical or surgical decompression of ICP should be performed when ICP approaches 30 mmHg with significant prolongation of wave V latency.",
