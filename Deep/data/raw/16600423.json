     "AB": "Synaptic plasticity, the activity-dependent change in the strength of neuronal connections, is a proposed cellular mechanism of memory storage that is critically regulated by protein kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Despite the fact that a neuron contains thousands of synapses, the expression of synaptic plasticity can be specific to subsets of synapses. This is surprising because signal transduction pathways underlying synaptic plasticity involve diffusible second messenger molecules such as cAMP and diffusible proteins such as the catalytic subunit of PKA. One way in which this specificity can be achieved is by the localization of signal transduction molecules to specific subcellular domains. Spatial compartmentalization of PKA signaling is achieved via binding to A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs). We report here that pharmacological inhibition of PKA anchoring impairs synaptically activated late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in hippocampal slices. In contrast, potentiation that is induced by the pharmacological activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway, which can potentially affect all synapses within the neuron, is not impaired by inhibition of PKA anchoring. These results suggest that PKA anchoring may be particularly important for events that occur at the synapse during the induction of L-LTP, such as synaptic tagging and capture. Indeed, our results demonstrate that blocking PKA anchoring impairs synaptic tagging and capture. Thus our data highlight the idea that PKA anchoring may allow for specific populations of synapses to change in synaptic strength in the face of plasticity-related transcription that is cell-wide.",
