     "AB": "The resolution of racemic nicotine to provide optically pure (+)-nicotine and the synthesis of radiolabeled nicotine with high specific activity have facilitated the study of nicotine binding in brain. The actions of the stereoisomers of nicotine on the central nervous system are qualitatively similar in most tests but (-)-nicotine is more potent than the unnatural (+)-isomer by 10-fold or greater. Binding of radiolabeled nicotine to brain has both saturable and nonsaturable components. Only saturable binding is affected by incubation conditions such as time, temperature, pH and ion concentration. Excess concentrations of the stereoisomers are equally effective in displacing (-)-[3H]-nicotine from brain homogenates. Nevertheless, a direct comparison of (+)-[3H]-nicotine and (-)-[3H]-nicotine binding shows that the latter has a KD three times lower than the former. (-)-[3H]-Nicotine is bound to the greatest degree in hypothalamus and hippocampus, areas that also exhibited the most stereoselectivity for nicotine. However, differences in the binding affinities of the two isomers were far less than the pharmacological stereospecificity observed.",
