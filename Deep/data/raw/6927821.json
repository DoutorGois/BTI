     "AB": "Repeated electrical low intensity stimulation of various regions of the brain has been shown to induce epileptic seizure activity. This experimental model of epilepsy has been used in our laboratory in rats. Male rats, anaesthetized with nembutal (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and ketalar (60 mg/kg, i.p.) were implanted stereotaxically with electrodes in the dorsal hippocampus and neocortex and received 2 hours stimulation sessions via the hippocampal electrodes (1 sec, 60 Hz, 200-800 microA) one stimulus per minute, during which electrographical and behavioral seizures were induced. The effect of anticonvulsant drugs was tested on this model: phenobarbital (40 mg/kg) reduced the quantity of epileptic electrographic activity and abolished the behavioral aspects of the seizures; diphenylhydantoin (20 mg/kg) reduced the quantity of epileptic electrographic activity, but had no effect on the behavioral component of the seizures; diazepam (6 mg/kg) only blocked the behavioral component of the seizures leaving the animal stuporous and immobile, but the electrographical component was unaffected; carbamazepine (10 mg/kg) had no effect on the electrographical epileptic seizures and reduced the behavioral aspects, but to a lesser extent than diazepam.",
