     "AB": "Field potentials of the hippocampus and the medial septal-diagonal band complex (MSDB) were recorded in the control and during the kindling stimulation of the perforant path in waking guinea pigs. Changes in the correlation of activities of these structures during stimulation-evoked seizures (model of acute epilepsy) and during epileptogenesis elicited by the kindling (model of chronic epilepsy) were analysed. In the control, a high correlation between the background activities of the hippocampus and MSDB was observed. In the first days of stimulation at the parameters that evoked seizure discharges in the hippocampus, the MSDB did not show the epileptiform activity; however, repeated daily stimulation gave rise to epileptiform discharges, which increased with time. As a result of kindling, the MSDB became capable of generating seizure activity irrespective of the hippocampus. The degree of correlation between the activities of the two structures sharply decreased during \"acute\" and \"chronic\" seizures. In the process of kindling, a progressive disintegration of activities of the hippocampus and MSDB was revealed, indicating the disturbance of the functioning of septohippocampal network during epileptogenesis. The data obtained add to the knowledge about the mechanisms of temporal lobe epilepsy and may help to develop new approaches to the therapy of this disease.",
