     "AB": "Glucocorticoids (GCs) mediate the effects of stress to cause structural plasticity in brain regions such as the hippocampus, including simplification of dendrites and shrinkage of dendritic spines. However, the molecular mechanics linking stress and GCs to these effects remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrated that corticosterone (CORT) reduces the expression levels of caldesmon (CaD), causing dendritic spines to become vulnerable. CaD regulates cell motility by modulating the actin-myosin system and actin filament stability. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, CaD localized to dendritic spines by binding to filamentous actin (F-actin), and CaD expression levels increased during spine development. CaD stabilized the F-actin dynamics in spines, thereby enlarging the spine heads, whereas CaD knockdown decreased the spine-head size via destabilization of the F-actin dynamics. CaD was also required for chemical LTP-induced actin stabilization. The CaD expression levels were markedly decreased by exposure to CORT mediated by suppression of serum response factor-dependent transcription. High CORT levels reduced both the spine-head size and F-actin stability similarly to CaD knockdown, and overexpressing CaD abolished the detrimental effect of CORT on dendritic spine development. These results indicate that CaD enlarges the spine-head size by stabilizing F-actin dynamics, and that CaD is a critical target in the GC-induced detrimental effects on dendritic spine development.",
