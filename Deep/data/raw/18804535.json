     "AB": "Preconditioning brain with a sub-lethal stressor can temporarily generate a damage-refractory state. Microarray analyses have defined the changes in hippocampal gene expression that follow brief preconditioning seizures, but not the transcriptome after a prolonged and otherwise injurious seizure in previously preconditioned brain. Presently, microarray analysis was performed 24 h after status epilepticus in mice that had received previously either seizure preconditioning (tolerance) or sham-preconditioning (injury). Transcriptional changes in the hippocampal CA3 subfield of >or=2 fold were detected for 1357 genes in the tolerance group compared to a non-seizure control group, with 54% up-regulated. Of these regulated genes, 792 were also regulated in the injury group. Among the remaining 565 genes regulated only in tolerance, 73% were down-regulated. Analysis of the genes differentially suppressed in tolerance identified calcium signaling, ion channels and excitatory neurotransmitter receptors, and the synapse as over-represented among pathways, functions and compartments. Finally, 12 days continuous EEG recordings determined mice with induced tolerance had fewer spontaneous electrographic seizures compared to the injury group. Our data suggest the transcriptional phenotype of neuroprotection in tolerance may be dictated by the biology of the preconditioning stressor, functions by transcriptional reduction of vulnerability to excitotoxicity, and has anti-epileptogenic effects.",
