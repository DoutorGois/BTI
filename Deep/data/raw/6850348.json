     "AB": "Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the acetylcholine (ACh) synthesizing enzyme, has been localized immunocytochemically with a monoclonal antibody in light and electron microscopic preparations of rat central nervous system (CNS). The antibody was an IgG1 subclass immunoglobulin that removed ChAT activity from solution. The specificity of the antibody and immunocytochemical methods has been confirmed by the demonstration of ChAT-positive neurons in a number of well-characterized cholinergic systems. For example, ChAT-positive reaction product was present in the cell bodies of spinal and cranial nerve motoneurons, as well as in their axons and terminations as motor end-plates in skeletal muscle. In addition, the somata of preganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons were ChAT-positive. The specificity of staining was further supported by a lack of reaction product in several groups of neurons thought to use neuroactive substances other than acetylcholine. No specific staining was observed in control specimens. The findings indicated that ChAT had an extensive intraneuronal distribution in many cholinergic neurons, being present in cell bodies, dendrites, axons and axon terminals. ChAT-positive somata were found in the medial septum and diagonal band, the medial habenula, and the basal nucleus of, the forebrain, 3 regions that are sources of cholinergic afferents to the hippocampus, interpeduncular nucleus and cerebral cortex, respectively. In addition, positively stained cell bodies were present within the cerebral cortex. ChAT-positive punctate structures were observed in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, where electron microscopic studies demonstrated that some of these structures were synaptic terminals. Other regions containing numerous ChAT-positive puncta included the hippocampus, the interpeduncular nucleus and the cerebral cortex. The light microscopic appearance of these putative cholinergic terminals varied among different brain regions. Large punctate structures related to well-defined post-synaptic elements were characteristic of some regions, such as the ventral horn of the spinal cord, while smaller punctate structures and varicose fibers with a diffuse pattern of organization distinguished other regions, such as the cerebral cortex.",
