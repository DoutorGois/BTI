     "AB": "Lurcher mutants are mice with functional mutation in the 82 glutamate receptor (GluRdelta2) that is predominantly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells and plays a crucial role in cerebellar functions. These mice display ataxia and impaired motor-related learning tasks. In order to elucidate the role of dopaminergic receptor system in coping with mutation in delta2 glutamate receptor the behavioral effect (spatial learning) of D1 dopamine receptor activation and inhibition and changes in D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors in striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum in C57BI/7 and C3H Lurcher mutants and wild type mice were studied. We have found that Lurcher mutants were worse in the spatial learning but mice of both types reacted similarly to D1 dopamine receptor agonist (without effect) and antagonist (worsening). Moreover, Lurchers revealed substantial higher density of both D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors in hippocampus in C57BI/7 strain, while in C3H strain only D1-like dopamine receptors were higher. In C57BI/7 strain, D-like dopamine receptors were lower in cerebellum; D2-like dopamine receptors were not affected. In the striatum, the receptor densities were similar to the wild type counterparts. Our results suggest specific participation of dopamine receptor system in coping with olivocerebellar degeneration.",
