     "AB": "For this study, I developed a software that converts SVG outputs from Inkscape to tactile graphics. Inkscape is easy to learn because it can be manipulated like any other typical drawing application and has a layer function which is enables robust support in the creation of tactile graphics In a simple evaluation, it is confirmed that the method of drawing a master in Inkscape and converting it with SVG2DOT was nearly as efficient as using a conventional tactile graphics drawing application.",
