     "AB": "Ethanol alters almost all membrane functions, but it behaves essentially like a benzodiazepine-type GABAergic agonist. The mechanism by which ethanol affects the GABA/benzodiazepine complex is not clear. We studied the possible changes in [3H]flunitrazepam binding induced by chronic ethanol treatment, using light microscopic autoradiography, to try to elucidate the controversy underlying this topic. This technique allows us to measure densities of benzodiazepine receptors in different anatomical brain areas--visual cortex and hippocampus--which seem to constitute the anatomical support for the behavioral and physiological responses affected by ethanol. Autoradiographic studies on the visual cortex and hippocampus from rats chronically treated with ethanol do not show statistically significant differences in the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam with respect to control animals. Furthermore, we did not find either rostro-caudal or medio-lateral differences in benzodiazepine receptor densities in each layer of the visual cortex.",
