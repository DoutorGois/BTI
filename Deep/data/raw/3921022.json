     "AB": "A novel effect of metal ions in the brain is described. Mn was found to alter heme metabolism and the cytochrome P-450-dependent mixed-function oxidase activities in rat brain. A more than 2-fold increase in benzo(alpha)pyrene hydroxylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin deethylase activities were observed in the brain of rats treated for 7 days with Mn. The increases were regionally distributed; the highest elevations were observed in the hippocampus, pons and the caudate putamen. Moreover, in rats treated with Mn for 1 or 7 days a marked depression in the activity of the mitochondrial ALA synthetase was observed. The activity of the microsomal heme oxygenase was also inhibited at 7 days, but not 1 day, after Mn treatment. These inhibitions were reflected in an initial decrease, followed by a rebound return to normal, in the concentration of cytochrome P-450 in the brain. Mn was ineffective in vitro in altering heme and drug metabolism activities. It is suggested that Mn-mediated alterations in heme metabolic activities promote changes in the composition of cytochrome P-450 species in the brain microsomal fractions, such that the relative concentrations of the molecular species which catalyse aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity become selectively increased.",
