     "AB": "Early persistent negative symptoms (PNS) following a first episode of psychosis (FEP) are linked to poor functional outcome. Reports of reduced amygdalar and hippocampal volumes in early psychosis have not accounted for heterogeneity of symptoms. Age is also seldom considered in this population, a factor that has the potential to uncover symptom-specific maturational biomarkers pertaining to volume and shape changes within the hippocampus and amygdala. T1-weighted volumes were acquired for early (N=21), secondary (N=30), non-(N=44) PNS patients with a FEP, and controls (N=44). Amygdalar-hippocampal volumes and surface area (SA) metrics were extracted with the Multiple Automatically Generated Templates (MAGeT)-Brain algorithm. Linear mixed models were applied to test for a main effect of group and age x group interactions. Early PNS patients had significantly reduced left amygdalar and right hippocampal volumes, as well as similarly lateralized negative age x group interactions compared to secondary PNS patients (P<0.017, corrected). Morphometry revealed decreased SA in early PNS compared with other patient groups in left central amygdala, and in a posterior region when compared with controls. Early and secondary PNS patients had significantly decreased SA as a function of age compared with patients without such symptoms within the right hippocampal tail (P<0.05, corrected). Significant amygdalar-hippocampal changes with age are linked to PNS after a FEP, with converging results from volumetric and morphometric analyses. Differential age trajectories suggest an aberrant maturational process within FEP patients presenting with PNS, which could represent dynamic endophenotypes setting these patients apart from their non-symptomatic peers. Studies are encouraged to parse apart such symptom constructs when examining neuroanatomical changes emerging after a FEP.",
