     "AB": "We analyzed the histories of 58 patients who had temporal lobectomy for seizure control. A good outcome was more likely if a definite lesion was removed. Unlike other pathologies, including nonspecific hippocampal sclerosis (NSHS), Ammon's horn sclerosis (AHS) was strongly related to a history of a prolonged childhood convulsion as the first epileptic event. Partial seizures developed at a younger age in patients with AHS than with NSHS or nonspecific changes. Epigastric rising sensations were associated with a greater chance of a good outcome than were other forms of simple partial seizure.",
