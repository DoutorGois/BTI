     "AB": "Acute amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition has been observed in young traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, leading to the hypothesis that elevated extracellular Abeta levels could underlie the increased risk of dementia following TBI. However, a recent microdialysis-based study in human brain injury patients found that extracellular Abeta dynamics correlate with changes in neurological status. Because neurological status is generally diminished following injury, this correlation suggested the alternative hypothesis that soluble extracellular Abeta levels may instead be reduced after TBI relative to baseline. We have developed a methodologically novel mouse model that combines experimental controlled cortical impact TBI with intracerebral microdialysis. In this model, we found that Abeta levels in microdialysates were immediately decreased by 25-50% in the ipsilateral hippocampus following TBI. This result was found in PDAPP, Tg2576, and Tg2576-ApoE2 transgenic mice producing human Abeta plus wild-type animals. Changes were not due to altered probe function, edema, changes in APP levels, or Abeta deposition. Similar decreases in Abeta were observed in phosphate buffered saline-soluble tissue extracts. Hippocampal electroencephalographic activity was also decreased up to 40% following TBI, and correlated with reduced microdialysate Abeta levels. These results support the alternative hypothesis that post-injury extracellular soluble Abeta levels are acutely decreased relative to baseline. Reduced neuronal activity may contribute, though the underlying mechanisms have not been definitively determined. Further work will be needed to assess the dynamics of insoluble and oligomeric Abeta after TBI.",
