     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the duration of tau hyperphosphorylation and spatial memory retentive deficit induced by single injecting with Forskolin, a protein kinase A activator, into lateral ventricle of rats, and the correlation between the two pathological alterations. METHODS: Forskolin (80 micromol/L, 40 microl) was injected into the lateral ventricle by stereotaxic injection. Tau phosphorylation and spatial memory retention were measured by Western blot/immunocytochemistry and Morris-Water-Maze test, respectively. RESULTS: The phosphorylation levels of tau at Tau-1, PHF-1, and pS214 epitopes were significantly elevated at 24, 48 and 72 h after single administration of Forskolin (P < 0.05). The most significant elevation was seen at 48 h (P < 0.01) and it tended to recover at 72 h (P < 0.05) after injection. The correlation between the two pathological alterations was positive at PHF-1 site (r = 0.97, P < 0.05), negative at Tau-1 site (r = -0.963, P < 0.05), and not significant at pS214 site (r = 0.705, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Forskolin can induce tau hyperphosphorylation and spatial memory retentive deficit within a certain period of time. The level of tau phosphorylation in hippocampus is somehow correlated with the spatial memory deficit in rats.",
