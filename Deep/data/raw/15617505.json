     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study neuroprotective effects of astragulus membraneaceus on a neonatal rat hippocampus of hypoxia-ischemia brain damage (HIBD). METHOD: The neonatal hypoxia-ischemia model was established with 7-day-old rat pups. Brain injury was examined by neuron death rate in the hippocampal CA1 area. Caspase-3 (cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase) mRNA expression in ipsilateral hippocampal was measured by half-quantitative reverse transcription and polymerization chain reaction (RT-PCR). 90-day-old rats were used in tri-equal-arm maze to observe discrimination learning ability. Sham, model and astragulus-membraneaceus treated groups were set up. RESULT: In model group, caspase-3 mRNA showed an increase at 6h, with maximum arrivimg at 24 h - 48 h after HI. In astragulus-membraneaceus treated group, neurons death rate and caspase-3 mRNA were significantly reduced by astragulus membraneaceus, and discrimination learning ability of developed rats were improved obviously. CONCLUSION: Astragulus membraneaceus has a strong protective effect on neuronal damage in the immature rat hippocampus, which is ralated reducing caspase-3 expression.",
