     "AB": "Rabies was diagnosed in 2 adult Quarter Horses with hindlimb hyperesthesia and progressive weakness. Microscopic examination of the cord and brain of the first horse revealed nonsuppurative meningomyelitis and ganglioneuritis in the cord extending cranially to the 6th cervical segment. Fluorescent antibody test results of both horses were positive for rabies in hindlimb peripheral nerve specimens, but negative in sections of the upper lip. Salivary gland, cerebrum, cerebellum, hippocampus, musculocutaneous nerve, cornea, and optic nerve specimens were tested for rabies by fluorescent antibody technique to determine viral distribution in the body of the second horse.",
