     "AB": "It is suggested that secretogranins/chromogranins play a role in regulating secretion of various proteins and amines, including neurotransmitters from secretory granules. Several studies have implicated the importance of altered synaptic connectivity in schizophrenia. We employed immunohistochemical techniques to determine if the level of chromogranin A (CgA)-immunoreactivity (IR) was altered in the subjects with schizophrenia. Nine subjects with schizophrenia and nine age- and sex-matched control subjects were selected for this study. Immunohistochemistry using specific antibody against CgA was performed on sections of prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Images of CgA-IR were analyzed by computer-based image analyzing software. CgA-IR was significantly decreased in layers III-V of the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenic subjects compared with control subjects. In the hippocampus, no significant difference was observed between two groups. The results indicate that there may be a decrease in the number of CgA positive large dense-core vesicles per terminal, and/or in the number of CgA positive terminals, suggesting possible functional impairment of prefrontal synaptic contact in schizophrenia.",
