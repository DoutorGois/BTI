     "AB": "Rats with a neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion (NVHL) have been used to model certain features of schizophrenia because they display dopaminergic activity and behavioral alterations consistent with a dysfunctional prefrontal cortex after puberty. Microdialysis studies in normal rats demonstrated increased prefrontal dopamine release during the incentive phase of behavior in an experimental situation specifically designed to evidence this behavioral aspect: the so called \"sensory-specific satiety\" procedure. Our hypothesis is that if dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex of NVHL rats differs from sham lesioned rats, the responsiveness to the aforementioned experimental situation should also be different. Extracellular medial prefrontal dopamine outflow increased in hungry control rats when they had access to food and decreased across satiety. It increased again when a new food was presented, even when the rats were satiated. NVHL rats also had increased dopamine prefrontal outflow in these conditions, but it remained high after the end of the consumption period. The food consumption behavior declined less rapidly and the reinstatement of food consumption, usually produced by new food, did not occur in NVHL rats, provided the lesions were large. These data were discussed in relation to several theoretical backgrounds developed about the incentive aspect of behavior and for understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",
