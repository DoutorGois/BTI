     "PG": "527-30",
     "AB": "Kindling induced by 13 intraperitoneal injections of 40 mg/kg pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) over a period of 4 weeks resulted in a significant long-lasting increase in both the convulsive susceptibility of animals to the convulsant and the density of the specific [3H]-L-glutamate binding sites in the hippocampus. The quisqualate- and kainate-sensitive [3H]-L-glutamate binding sites were increased 24 h after the final PTZ injection, whereas the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-sensitive sites had only a tendency to be enhanced. Furthermore, we investigated [3H]-L-glutamate binding on metabotropic receptors and found a significant increase in the hippocampus following PTZ kindling. In addition, in hippocampal tissue of kindled rats (+/-)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (trans-ACPD)-stimulated inositol phosphate formation is increased. It can be concluded that the increase in metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) density may be the expression of a specific enhancement in susceptibility of the glutamatergic systems to this excitatory amino acid developing in the course of PTZ-induced kindling.",
