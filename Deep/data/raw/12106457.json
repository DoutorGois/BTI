     "AB": "Release properties of intrahippocampal transplants of noradrenergic neurons were monitored by microdialysis in awake and halothane-anaesthetized rats. Fetal locus coeruleus neurons were implanted as a cell suspension into hippocampi deprived of their innate noradrenalin (NA) innervation by intraventricular 6-hydroxydopamine treatment. Dialysis probes of the loop type were implanted into the dorsal hippocampus 1 - 2 days before each experiment, i.e. 7 - 11 months after grafting. Age-matched intact and lesion-only animals served as controls. Microscopic analysis showed a graft-derived tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive, presumably noradrenergic, fibre network throughout the dorsal hippocampal formation, surrounding the probe site. The innervation density varied from sub- to supranormal. The grafts restored baseline NA release in the graft-reinnervated hippocampus to near-normal levels both in awake and halothane-anaesthetized animals. Potassium chloride (100 mM) in the perfusion fluid induced a dramatic increase in NA release that was similar in magnitude in the grafted and intact hippocampi. A NA uptake blocker (desipramine) added to the perfusion fluid at 5 microM induced a similar increase in NA output in the grafted and intact hippocampi, and the output was substantially reduced by tetrodotoxin, added at 1 microM in the presence of uptake blockade. Electrical stimulation of the lateral habenular nucleus (15 Hz, 0.5 mA) in halothane-anaesthetized rats induced a significant increase in NA output both in the intact and grafted hippocampi. This effect was abolished by transection of the fasciculus retroflexus, which carries the efferent projections of the habenular complex. Behavioural activation through handling induced a consistent increase in NA release only in the intact animals, but in a few grafted rats (which also responded to habenular stimulation) the NA output was clearly elevated by handling. Forced immobilization induced a significant increase in NA output both in the intact and grafted hippocampi, but in the grafted ones the response was somewhat smaller and more transient. In the same set of animals, swimming in warm water (25 - 30 degrees C) induced a sharp increase in NA output in the intact animals, whereas only one of the grafted rats responded by increased NA output. The results indicate that the locus coeruleus grafts, despite their ectopic location, can become functionally integrated with the host brain, and that the activity of the transplanted noradrenergic neurons can, under some circumstances, be modulated from the host brain in response to environmental challenges.",
