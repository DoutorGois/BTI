     "AB": "Benzodiazepine binding sites have generally been labelled with benzodiazepine agonists: (3H)flunitrazepam and (3H)diazepam in vivo. We studied the in vivo binding of the antagonist (3H)Ro 15-1788 in mice and compared it to the in vivo binding of (3H)flunitrazepam. For this in vivo labelling, mice were injected with labelled and unlabelled ligands. Animals were then sacrificed and bound radioactivity was measured after homogenization of the excised brain and filtration of the homogenate. (3H)Ro 15-1788 is a better tool than (3H)flunitrazepam for in vivo labelling of benzodiazepine receptors since 1) it labels specifically the central type binding sites, 2) injection of 4 times less (3H)Ro 15-1788 (50 microCi/kg) than (3H)flunitrazepam (200 microCi/kg) produced the same amount of bound radioactivity, 3) 70-90% of the total (3H)Ro 15-1788 present in the brain is membrane bound instead of 45-55% with (3H)flunitrazepam, 4) maximal binding of (3H)Ro 15-1788 is reached within 3 min, 5) only 5% of the membrane bound (3H)Ro 15-1788 is nonspecific instead of 15% for (3H)flunitrazepam.",
