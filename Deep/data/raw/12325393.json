     "AB": "Ozone exposure increases the production of free radicals that causes oxidative stress (OS), a state that also occurs during aging and in neurodegenerative diseases. This study identified ultrastructural alterations produced by OS induced by acute ozone exposure in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in aged compared with young rats. Animals were exposed to 0.70 ppm ozone for 4 h, and controls to flowing air. After the exposure, the tissues were processed for ultrastructural analysis. Results showed increased ultrastructural alterations in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in the aged exposed animals compared with controls. OS enhanced the modifications induced by the aging process in those areas related with learning and memory functions, which are the first where degenerative aging changes are observed.",
