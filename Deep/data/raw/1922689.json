     "AB": "The behavioural and neuropathological effects of tetanus toxin, injected into the dentate gyrus, were studied in rats. The monolateral injection of a single dose (1000 mouse minimum lethal doses, MLDs; n = 14 rats) of tetanus toxin produced time-dependent behavioural stimulation. Wet-dog shakes and facial stereotypy were observed 3-4 days after the injection, culminating 4-5 days after treatment, in \"limbic motor seizures\". Ten days after injection, histological examination revealed death of dentate granule cells in the tetanus toxin-treated side but not in the contralateral, control side (treated with neutralized toxin). This effect was observed in all rats (n = 5) receiving tetanus toxin in the dentate gyrus and no damage was reported in other sectors (e.g. CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers) of the hippocampus. Quantification of the neuronal damage yielded an approximately 70% reduction (P less than 0.01) in the number of granule cells in the toxin-injected dentate gyrus, compared with the control side. This was greater than that previously reported (30% reduction) in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of rats receiving the same dose of toxin, into the regio superior of the hippocampus. In conclusion, the present experiments have shown that the focal injection of tetanus toxin into the dentate gyrus produced behavioural excitation and selective death of dentate granule cells.",
