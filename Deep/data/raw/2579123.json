     "AB": "An antiserum to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was tested for the localization of GABAergic neurons in the central nervous system using the unlabeled antibody enzyme method under pre- and postembedding conditions. GABA immunostaining was compared with glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactivity in the cerebellar cortex and in normal and colchicine-injected neocortex and hippocampus of cat. The types, distribution, and proportion of neurons and nerve terminals stained with either sera showed good agreement in all areas. Colchicine treatment had little effect on the density of GABA-immunoreactive cells but increased the number of GAD-positive cells to the level of GABA-positive neurons in normal tissue. GABA immunoreactivity was abolished by solid phase adsorption to GABA and it was attenuated by adsorption to beta-alanine or gamma-amino-beta-hydroxybutyric acid, but without selective loss of immunostaining. Reactivity was not affected by adsorption to glutamate, aspartate, taurine, glycine, cholecystokinin, or bovine serum albumin. The concentration (0.05-2.5%) of glutaraldehyde in the fixative was not critical. The antiserum allows the demonstration of immunoreactive GABA in neurons containing other neuroactive substances; cholecystokinin and GABA immunoreactivities have been shown in the same neurons of the hippocampus. In conclusion, antisera to GABA are good markers for the localization of GABAergic neuronal circuits.",
