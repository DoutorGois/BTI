     "AB": "Different, established or putative animal models of learning were studied by electrophysiological (EEG) and neurochemical methodologies. The training of rats to new behavioral patterns proved to result in the stimulation of total RNA synthesis rate in specific brain structures, as well as in modifications of the EEG organization of hippocampus. This two-fold approach to the assessment of modifications in learning-involved brain structures was extended to the study of mirror focus and kindling, to verify the suitability of these phenomena as experimental models of learning. Reduced (3H) uridine incorporation and proportion of poly (A)-associated RNA were found in mirror focus in comparison with control regions. These variations seem related to brain damage rather than be congruent with learning-related modifications. Further studies are necessary to verify whether the kindling phenomena are to be equated to learning models.",
