     "AB": "Lithium inhibits the agonist-induced hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and the synthesis of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in rat brain preparations, each of which is linked to activation of specific protein kinases. Therefore, we examined the effects of chronic lithium treatment on protein kinase activities in rat hippocampus. Chronic lithium treatment did not alter the distribution or activity of protein kinase C in hippocampal soluble or particulate fractions. However, chronic lithium treatment increased protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of four endogenous proteins in the soluble fraction (16,17,20,22 kD) and reduced the phosphorylation of three proteins (18,19,87 kD) in the particulate fraction. Chronic lithium treatment did not alter cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous proteins in the soluble fraction but reduced phosphorylation of two proteins (54 and 71 kD) in the particulate fractions. These results demonstrate that besides inhibiting second messenger production in brain, chronic lithium treatment also causes specific alterations in the phosphorylation of endogenous proteins.",
