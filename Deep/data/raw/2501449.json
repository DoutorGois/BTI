     "AB": "11C-labelled L-deprenyl in vitro autoradiography was used to study the regional distribution of MAO-B in human brain. 80 microns thick cryosections from two human brains, a 67 years old female and a 58 years old male, were taken on tape/paper and transferred on to a gelatinized glass plate. The sections were then incubated with 34 and 54 nM 11C-L-deprenyl for 15 min and exposed to a film sensitive to high energy radiation for 2 hours. The autoradiograms obtained were analyzed by computerized densiotometry. High 11C-deprenyl binding was found in the caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, substantia nigra, medial and lateral geniculate bodies, hippocampus and periaqueductal gray. Moderate to low binding was observed in cerebral cortex. Cerebral cortex and white matter showed the lowest binding. The autoradiographic technique described proved to be a fast and reliable method to investigate the topographic localization of MAO-B in large cryosections of human brain.",
