     "AB": "Rutin, a flavonoid glycoside, has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects. Loss of the endogenous estrogen and dysregulation of the estrogen receptor (ER) signaling pathway are associated with the increased risk of stroke in women after menopause. This study was performed to investigate whether rutin could protect against cerebral ischemia by modulating ER pathway. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats were given intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (DMSO), rutin (100 mg/kg) or 17beta-estradiol (100 mug/kg) for 5 continuous days. Then, the rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 h followed by a 24-h reperfusion to establish the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We found that rutin improved the sensorimotor performance and recognition memory of I/R rats, decreased the infarct size and attenuated the neuron loss. Rutin treatment also increased the levels of ERalpha, ERbeta, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), TrkB and phospho-cAMP-responsive element binding protein (p-CREB) in rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The protective effects of rutin were comparable to that of 17beta-estradiol, and were partially blocked by ICI182780, an ER antagonist. The above results suggest that rutin preconditioning ameliorates cerebral I/R injury in OVX rats through ER-mediated BDNF-TrkB and NGF-TrkA signaling.",
