     "AB": "We have used reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification to investigate changes in expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA in immortalized hippocampal neurons after treatment with the glucocorticoids dexamethasone and corticosterone, the glucocorticoid antagonist RU38486, and the gonadal steroids progesterone and 17-beta oestradiol. We found that NGF mRNA levels rise after application of either dexamethasone or corticosterone, and that this rise is prevented by the antagonist. Thus, neurotrophin expression is modulated by the physiological glucocorticoid and is mediated by type II glucocorticoid receptors. Progesterone has no effect, while 17-beta oestradiol suppresses NGF mRNA in a postnatally-derived cell line but does not change levels in an embryonic line. An increase in neurotrophin expression is therefore not a general response to steroid hormone application, and may be a specific defence against the presence of metabolically endangering glucocorticoids.",
