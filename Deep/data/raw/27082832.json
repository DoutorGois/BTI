     "AB": "Episodic memory is characterized by remembering events as unique combinations of features. Even when some features of events overlap, we are later often able to discriminate among them. Here we ask whether hippocampally mediated reactivation of an earlier event when a similar one occurs supports subsequent memory that two similar but not identical events occurred (mnemonic discrimination). In two experiments, participants viewed objects (Experiment 1) or scenes (Experiment 2) during functional MRI (fMRI). After scanning, participants had to remember whether repeated items had been identical or similar. In Experiment 2, representational similarity between the 1st and 2nd presentation predicted participants' ability to remember that the presentations were different, suggesting that the first item was reactivated while viewing the second. A similar but weaker result was found in Experiment 1 that did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, both experiments yielded evidence that the hippocampus was involved in reactivation; hippocampal pattern similarity (and, in Experiment 2, hippocampal activity during the 2nd presentation) correlated with pattern similarity in several regions of visual cortex. These results provide the first fMRI evidence that hippocampally mediated reactivation contributes to the later memory that two similar, but different events occurred.
