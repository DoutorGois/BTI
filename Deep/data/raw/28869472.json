     "AB": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is proposed to trigger memory deficits and synaptic damage at the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is unknown how mitochondria dysfunction might trigger synaptotoxicity and if a differential susceptibility of mitochondria located in synapses underlies the greater glutamatergic than GABAergic synaptotoxicity in early AD. Hippocampal synaptosomes (purified synapses) of a rat model of early AD, typified by selective memory deficits two weeks after intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta1-42, 2 nmol), simultaneously displayed three mitochondria-associated deleterious alterations: 1) hampered metabolism (decreased MTT reduction); 2) increased oxygen radical production (increased hydrogen peroxide production); 3) increased caspase-3 activity. The direct exposure of hippocampal synaptosomes to Abeta1-42 (500 nM) similarly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (TMRM+ fluorescence) and increased mitochondria-derived oxygen radicals (MitoTraker(R)red-CM-H2Xros fluorescence) in individual glutamatergic (vesicular glutamate transporter-immunopositive) and GABAergic (vesicular GABA transporter-immunopositive) synaptosomes. However, significantly more glutamatergic than GABAergic synaptosomes were endowed with mitochondria (Tom20-immunopositive). These results indicate that dysfunctional mitochondria located in synapses can trigger synaptotoxicity through multifaceted mechanisms and that it is not the susceptibility of mitochondria to Abeta but more likely a different impact of dysfunctional mitochondria that underlies the greater sensitivity to synaptotoxicity of glutamatergic than GABA synapses in early AD.",
