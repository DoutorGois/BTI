     "AB": "1. Long-term potentiation and its counterpart long-term depression are two forms of activity dependent synaptic plasticity, in which protein kinases and protein phosphatases are essential. 2. B-50/GAP-43 and RC3/neurogranin are two defined neuronal PKC substrates with different synaptic localization. B-50/GAP-43 is a presynaptic protein and RC3/neurogranin is only found at the postsynaptic site. Measuring their phosphorylation state in hippocampal slices, allows us to simultaneously monitor changes in pre- and postsynaptic PKC mediated phosphorylation. 3. Induction of LTP in the CA1 field of the hippocampus is accompanied with an increase in the in situ phosphorylation of both B-50/GAP-43 and RC3/neurogranin, during narrow, partially overlapping, time windows. 4. Pharmacological data show that mGluR stimulation results in an increase in the in situ phosphorylation of B-50/GAP-43 and RC3/neurogranin.",
