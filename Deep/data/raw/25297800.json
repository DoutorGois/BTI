     "AB": "Microglia are CNS resident immune cells and a rich source of neuroactive mediators, but their contribution to physiological brain processes such as synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory is not fully understood. In this study, we used mice with partial depletion of IkappaB kinase beta, the main activating kinase in the inducible NF-kappaB pathway, selectively in myeloid lineage cells (mIKKbetaKO) or excitatory neurons (nIKKbetaKO) to measure synaptic strength at hippocampal Schaffer collaterals during long-term potentiation (LTP) and instrumental conditioning in alert behaving individuals. Resting microglial cells in mIKKbetaKO mice showed less Iba1-immunoreactivity, and brain IL-1beta mRNA levels were selectively reduced compared with controls. Measurement of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked by stimulation of the CA3-CA1 synapse in mIKKbetaKO mice showed higher facilitation in response to paired pulses and enhanced LTP following high frequency stimulation. In contrast, nIKKbetaKO mice showed normal basic synaptic transmission and LTP induction but impairments in late LTP. To understand the consequences of such impairments in synaptic plasticity for learning and memory, we measured CA1 fEPSPs in behaving mice during instrumental conditioning. IKKbeta was not necessary in either microglia or neurons for mice to learn lever-pressing (appetitive behavior) to obtain food (consummatory behavior) but was required in both for modification of their hippocampus-dependent appetitive, not consummatory behavior. Our results show that microglia, through IKKbeta and therefore NF-kappaB activity, regulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity and that both microglia and neurons, through IKKbeta, are necessary for animals to modify hippocampus-driven behavior during associative learning.",
