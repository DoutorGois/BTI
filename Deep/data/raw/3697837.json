     "AB": "Changes in presynaptic terminal axon excitability produced by enflurane in the rat hippocampal slice preparation were investigated by stimulation of Schaeffer collateral terminal axons and by recording single unit antidromic action potentials. Stimulating pulses were preceded by conditioning hyperpolarizing or depolarizing current pulses. A plot of net threshold for action potential generation against the conditioning pulse yields an \"accommodation curve;\" changes in this curve can be used to assess the mechanism by which changes in excitability are produced. Enflurane, at a concentration equivalent to approximately equal to 1.3 times the minimum alveolar concentration, reduced excitability of terminal axons and increased accommodation in a manner consistent with a possible change in the inactivation of gNa.",
