     "AB": "The presence of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) (300-600 microM) in the incubation medium of rat hippocampal slices led to an increase of intracellular cyclic GMP and inositol phosphates. This phenomenon is dependent on the time and the dose of GHB used and might be the result of the stimulation of GHB receptor sites which are abundant in rat hippocampus. The increase of cyclic GMP and inositol phosphates is blocked by some anticonvulsants and opiate antagonists. These results seems to indicate that, like many substances inducing epileptic phenomena, GHB provokes neuronal depolarization in hippocampus which is accompanied by formation of cyclic GMP and inositol phosphates. The effect of opiate antagonists can be explained by the possible implication of an opiate synapse which mediates GHB effects in rat hippocampus.",
