     "AB": "Persistent activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and phosphorylation of c-Jun has been shown in various cell death paradigms. Inhibition of the JNK signal transduction pathway prevented neuronal cell death both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, nuclear phospho-c-Jun immunoreactivity became apparent selectively in vulnerable hippocampal CA1 neurons at 24 h after transient global cerebral ischemia. A high constitutive expression of phospho-JNK1 was detected by immunoblot analysis of hippocampal extracts. Expression of JNK interacting protein-1 (JIP-1), which facilitates JNK signaling, remained unchanged in post-ischemic hippocampal neurons. By contrast, p53-activated gene 608 (PAG608), which promotes cell death in vitro, was strongly induced in post-ischemic CA1 neurons. Our data suggest that transcription factors p53 and phospho-c-Jun may contribute to programmed CA1 cell death following ischemia.",
