     "AB": "Cerebral ischemia followed by oxygen reperfusion induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) but not in Wistar Kyoto rats. Oxygen radicals were involved in reoxygenation injury after hypoxia in hippocampal slices. Vitamin E inhibited the reoxygenation injury in cultured cortical neurons. In addition, the temporal cortices in Alzheimer's disease have increased sensitivity to oxygen radicals, and Vitamin E slowed the progression of the disease. Thus we fed Wistar Kyoto and SHRSP rats either a normal diet or a high Vitamin E diet for 3 weeks. We measured Vitamin E concentrations of plasma and brain by applying the HPLC method. Vitamin E increased its concentration in plasma, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus (p < 0.01) during a 3-week pretreatment. In addition, we clipped both common carotid arteries in these rats for 30 minutes. After the blocking, the rats were reperfused for 6 and 9 days, respectively, and then killed. We cut the brains coronally, removed the hippocampal CA1 regions, and examined the neurons using an electron microscope. SHRSP rats with normal cerebral circulation had 30.4+/-8.0 apoptotic neurons per 1000 neurons. Cerebral ischemia followed by 6 and 9 days of reperfusion, respectively, increased apoptotic neurons in SHRSP rats fed a normal diet (6 days: 542.5+/-154.1 per 1000 neurons; 9 days: 657.5+/-110.2 per 1000 neurons). In contrast, apoptotic neurons in SHRSP rats fed a high Vitamin E diet were significantly (p < 0.01) small in number (6 days: 41.3+/-27.5 per 1000 neurons; 9 days: 35.5+/-19.7 per 1000 neurons) even though the rats were treated in the same way. These data demonstrate that oxygen radical generation occurs after reperfusion and that free radicals heavily damage the neurons in SHRSP rats. Vitamin E reacts with the radicals and prevents neuronal apoptosis caused by cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Therefore, Vitamin E seems to be an important agent in lowering radical damage to hippocampal neurons.",
