     "AB": "Monoamines are implicated in the modulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in depression models and following chronic antidepressant treatment. Given the key role of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in adult neurogenesis, we examined whether monoaminergic perturbations regulate the expression of Shh or its co-receptors Smoothened (Smo) and Patched (Ptc). Combined depletion of both serotonin and norepinephrine with para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) resulted in a significant decrease in Smo and Ptc mRNA within the dentate gyrus subfield of the hippocampus. However, selective depletion of serotonin, using the serotonergic neurotoxin 5,7-dihyrdroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), or norepinephrine, using the noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP-4, did not alter expression of Shh and its co-receptors, Smo and Ptc. Acute treatment with the monoamine releasing agent, para-chloroamphetamine (PCA) significantly upregulated Smo mRNA within the dentate gyrus. However, acute or chronic treatment with pharmacological antidepressants that modulate monoaminergic neurotransmission did not regulate Shh cascade expression. These results indicate that robust changes in monoamine levels can regulate the expression of the Shh signaling cascade in the adult rodent brain.",
