     "AB": "Sevoflurane, a typical inhaled anesthetic, is widely used in patients of all ages during surgery. The negative effects, such as inducing cell death and damaging spatial memory, of sevoflurane on neurodevelopment have raised increasing concerns in recent years. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. This study focused on the crucial role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in sevoflurane-induced hippocampal injury. Three-week-old rats were exposed to sevoflurane or control air for 5 h with or without ER stress inhibitor (4-phenylbutyric acid, 4-PBA) injection. The hippocampus was harvested to measure the ER stress sensors by western immunoblotting. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling staining was used to detect cell apoptosis and electrophysiology was used to measure the intrinsic excitability of neurons in hippocampus. We measured learning and memory ability by Morris water maze tests 5 weeks after sevoflurane exposure. Interestingly, persistent sevoflurane exposure significantly increased the levels of ER stress sensors in hippocampus. But it resulted in different effects in CA1 and dentate gyrus. Greatly increased caspase-12-mediated apoptotic cells, which were proved to be the neural stem cells, were detected in the dentate gyrus. Meanwhile, CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibited significantly reduced intrinsic excitability. Furthermore, the administration of ER stress inhibitor attenuated the above mentioned detrimental effects evidently and prevented the following relevant learning and memory deficits. In conclusion, sevoflurane-mediated ER stress performs distinct effects on the different subfields of the immature hippocampus and inhibiting ER stress during sevoflurane anesthesia will be a potential method to prevent the following learning and memory deficits in adulthood.",
