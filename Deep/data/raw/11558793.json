     "AB": "Neonatal seizures caused by hypoxia can be refractory to conventional anticonvulsants. Currently, there is no effective postnatal intervention for newborn infants with hypoxic encephalopathy to prevent brain injury and long-term neurologic sequelae. We previously developed a rat model of perinatal hypoxia-induced seizures with subsequent long-term increases in seizure susceptibility and showed that these epileptogenic effects are selectively blocked by the alpha-amino-3-hydoxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist 6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo(f)quinoxaline-2,3-dione. Using this model of perinatal seizures, we evaluated the efficacy of topiramate, a structurally novel anticonvulsant drug recently shown to attenuate AMPA/kainate currents. Topiramate effectively suppressed acute seizures induced by perinatal hypoxia in a dose-related manner with a calculated ED50 of 2.1 mg/kg, i.p. Furthermore, in animals that had seizures suppressed by topiramate during acute hypoxia, there were no long-term increases in susceptibility to kainate-induced seizures and seizure-induced neuronal injury. Our results suggest that topiramate may have clinical potential as a therapeutic agent for refractory seizures in human neonates.",
