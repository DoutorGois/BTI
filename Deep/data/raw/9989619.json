     "AB": "The sequestration of RNA in Alzheimer's disease (AD) senile plaques (SPs) and the production of intraneuronal amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) prompted analysis of the mRNA profile in single immunocytochemically identified SPs in sections of AD hippocampus. By using amplified RNA expression profiling, polymerase chain reaction, and in situ hybridization, we assessed the presence and abundance of 51 mRNAs that encode proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. The mRNAs in SPs were compared with those in individual CA1 neurons and the surrounding neuropil of control subjects. The remarkable demonstration here, that neuronal mRNAs predominate in SPs, implies that these mRNAs are nonproteinaceous components of SPs, and, moreover, that mRNAs may interact with Abeta protein and that SPs form at sites where neurons degenerate in the AD brain.",
