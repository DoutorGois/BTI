     "AB": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs [constituted by pentameric association of alpha2-10 and beta2-4 subunits]) and P2X receptors (P2XRs [activated by ATP and constituted by multimeric association of P2X1-7 subunits]) are both ionotropic receptors permeable to cations, which have in common the disparity between the wealth of data showing their presence in the brain and little evidence of their participation in mediating synaptic transmission. This has led to the proposal that both nAChRs and P2XRs might primarily modulate rather than directly mediate synaptic transmission, which is in accordance with the predominant presynaptic localization of both receptor subtypes (Role and Berg, 1996; Cunha and Ribeiro, 2000). Interestingly, both functional neurochemical (Allgaier et al., 1995; Salgado et al., 2000; Diaz-Hernandez et al., 2002) and electrophysiological studies (Barajas-Lopez et al., 1998; Searl et al., 1998; Zhou and Calligan, 1998; Khakh et al., 2000) indicated a close interaction between nAChRs and P2XRs, which is paralleled by a co-release of ATPand ACh from central terminals (e.g., Richardson and Brown, 1987). Because glutamate release in the hippocampus is controlled by both nAChRs (e.g., McGehee et al., 1995) and P2XRs (Khakh et al., 2003; Rodrigues et al., 2005), we investigated if there was a functional interaction between these two presynaptic ionotropic receptors in the control of glutamate release in the rat hippocampus.",
