     "AB": "Nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) signaling plays ubiquitous roles in inflammation, immune response and neurogenesis. G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) can protect neurons from degeneration. GRK5 also mediates tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)-induced NFkappaB signaling through the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha. Here, we show that NFkappaB signaling is involved in neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation. The IkappaBalpha/p65 pathway was activated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a stimulator of protein kinase C (PKC). Once the NFkappaB was activated, the initial stage of neural differentiation was induced, with an increased level of GRK5 in NSCs. This finding was reversed in response to the NFkappaB inhibitor N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). To evaluate the effect of GRK5-NFkappaB signaling crosstalk on NSC neurogenesis and apoptosis, GRK5 was knocked down by siRNAs in cell culture. SiRNAs against GRK5 not only impaired neural differentiation and axogenesis, but also induced apoptosis of NSC. GRK5 knockdown affected the transcription of NFkappaB, phosphorylation of the liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and the activity of caspase 3, thereby modulated neurogenesis and apoptosis. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel function of GRK5 in neurogenesis and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.",
