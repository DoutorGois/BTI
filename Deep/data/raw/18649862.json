     "AB": "The dynamics, the histochemical and morphological characteristics of brain lipopigment (LP: lipofuscin and ceroid) were studied after 8 weeks of daily administration of Antagonic-Stress (AS), a new combination of various compounds used in cerebroprotection and the treatment of cerebral senescence. LP features of treated old (TO), control old (CO) and control adult (CA) groups of 60 Wistar male rats were compared by morphometry, light and fluoresence microscopy. AS administration produced a general, intense and selective decrease of LP from TO group: 48. 1 and 39.6% in various cerebral cortex areas, 47.5% in hippocampus, 47.3-37.2% in brain stem reticular formation, 38.8% in hypothalamus and 34.1% in Purkinje cell layer in comparison with CO group. In addition, histochemical and morphological characteristics of LP in TO group were modified and were close to those of CA group, represented by an active transformation of their chemical constituents and intracellular architecture. The decrease and dissolution of LP may be explained by the inhibition of LP genesis, associated with the acceleration of LP lysis (lipofuscinolysis and ceroidolysis), transfer and elimination. Our findings indicate that LP dynamics, histochemical and morphological characteristics may be manipulated by nootropic and anti-aging drugs, which actively interfere with LP genesis and lysis.",
