     "AB": "The mianserin (MIS) distribution in 12 brain regions was investigated after 2- and 14-day continuous MIS infusion, starting with 19 mg/kg/day on the first day. There was no significant difference between the 2nd and 14th day with respect to MIS concentration, brain/serum concentration ratio in whole brain or MIS serum level. The MIS distribution was heterogeneous on the 2nd and 14th day and did not change with time. The concentrations were highest in cortex and hippocampus and lowest in cerebellum, hypothalamus, and bulbus olfactorious and septum. This distribution pattern differs from those found with tricyclic antidepressant drugs.",
