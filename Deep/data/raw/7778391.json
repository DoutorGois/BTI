Aged memory-impaired rats (compared with young adults) showed alteration in the ultrastructure of mossy fiber expansions and the loss of axospinous synapses formed by them. These changes were more pronounced than in memory-non-impaired rats. There were no significant differences between aged memory impaired and aged memory non-impaired rats except for a significant decrease in volume density of postsynaptic density in axodendritic synapses formed by mossy fiber expansions in memory impaired animals.",
