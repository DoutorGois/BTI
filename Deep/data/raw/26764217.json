     "AB": "The neuropeptide galanin is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems and part of a bigger family of bioactive peptides. Galanin exerts its biological activity through three G-protein coupled receptor subtypes, GAL1-3R. Throughout the last 20years, data has accumulated that galanin can have a neuroprotective effect presumably mediated through the activation of GAL1R and GAL2R. In order to test the pharmaceutical potential of galanin receptor subtype selective ligands to inhibit excitotoxic cell death, the GAL1R selective ligand M617 and the GAL2R selective ligand M1145 were compared to the novel GAL1/2R ligand M1154, in their ability to reduce the excitotoxic effects of intracerebroventricular injected kainate acid in rats. The peptide ligands were evaluated in vitro for their binding preference in a competitive (125)I-galanin receptor subtype binding assay, and G-protein signaling was evaluated using both classical signaling and a label-free real-time technique. Even though there was no significant difference in the time course or severity of the kainic acid induced epileptic behavior in vivo, administration of either M617 or M1154 before kainic acid administration significantly attenuated the neuronal cell death in the hippocampus. Our results indicate the potential therapeutic value of agonists selective for GAL1R in the prevention of neuronal cell death.",
