The technique has been used to study the regional distribution of glucose transporter proteins. Binding sites within the cerebellum and hippocampus were more concentrated in the synaptic zones, which would be expected to display relatively high metabolic rates for glucose. However, a general inter-regional correlation of cytochalasin B binding with metabolic rates was not apparent.",
