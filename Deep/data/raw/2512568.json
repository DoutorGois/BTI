     "AB": "Our earlier experiments have shown that the facilitating action of angiotensin II (AII) on recall of passive avoidance is mediated by dopaminergic systems. In an attempt to find the site of action of AII on memory in the brain, bilateral lesions of the two structures belonging to the limbic system, receiving efferentation from A 10 dopaminergic neurons, were made in 32 male rats before behavioral testing of the influence of intracerebroventricular AII injection on recall in a passive avoidance situation. 32 additional rats served as sham operated controls. Bilateral lesions to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and olfactory tubercle did not significantly change the facilitating effect of AII on recall. The results may suggest that dopaminergic projections from A 10 neurons of the ventral tegmental area to the dentate gyrus and olfactory tubercle are not responsible for the enhancing effect of AII on recall of passive avoidance.",
