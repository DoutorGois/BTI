     "AB": "Neuromodulation of neural networks, whereby a selected circuit is regulated by a particular modulator, plays a critical role in learning and memory. Among neuromodulators, acetylcholine (ACh) plays a critical role in hippocampus-dependent memory and has been shown to modulate neuronal circuits in the hippocampus. However, it has remained unknown how ACh modulates hippocampal output. Here, using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we show that ACh, by activating oriens lacunosum moleculare (OLM) interneurons and therefore augmenting the negative-feedback regulation to the CA1 pyramidal neurons, suppresses the circuit from the hippocampal area CA1 to the deep-layer entorhinal cortex (EC). We also demonstrate, using mouse behavior studies, that the ablation of OLM interneurons specifically impairs hippocampus-dependent but not hippocampus-independent learning. These data suggest that ACh plays an important role in regulating hippocampal output to the EC by activating OLM interneurons, which is critical for the formation of hippocampus-dependent memory.",
