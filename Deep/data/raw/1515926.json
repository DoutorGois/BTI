     "AB": "Previous studies have shown that there is an age-related loss of responsiveness in several different receptor systems (e.g. beta-adrenergic, dopaminergic and muscarinic). Our research, using perifused striatal slices and examining muscarinic agonist enhancement of K(+)-evoked dopamine release, has determined that at least part of the loss of sensitivity in muscarinic receptors (mAChR) may occur early in the post-receptor signal transduction process. The present study was carried out to further characterize and localize this deficit by examining carbachol- and oxotremorine-stimulated low-KM guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity in striatal as well as hippocampal tissue obtained from adult (6 months) and old (24 months) Wistar rats. Receptor stimulated low-KM GTPase catalyzes the conversion of GTP to GDP to end the signal transduction cycle and is an indicator of receptor-G-protein coupling/uncoupling. The results showed that stimulated GTPase activity was significantly reduced in hippocampal and striatal tissue from the old animals. These findings suggest that there may be an age-related coupling/uncoupling deficit between muscarinic receptor and G-proteins, and that this deficit may contribute to the reduced mAChR responsiveness in senescence.",
