     "AB": "We report the characterization of a new member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family designated LRP10. Human LRP10 cDNA encodes a 1905 amino acid type I membrane protein consisting of five functional domains characteristic of the LDLR gene family. CHO-ldlA7 cells transfected with human LRP10 cDNA bound LDLR-associated protein, but not beta-VLDL and HDL. Human LRP10 transcripts were primarily found in the brain, muscle and heart. In situ hybridization of the rat brain showed that the transcripts were intensely present in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, choroid plexus, ependyma and granular layer. In the developing rat brain, transcript levels gradually increased from postnatal day 1 to 20. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that LRP10 was observed in the ventricular zone of the embryonic day 14.5 mouse cerebral cortex. The present studies suggest that LRP10 may play a significant role in the brain physiology other than lipoprotein metabolism.",
