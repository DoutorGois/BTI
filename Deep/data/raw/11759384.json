     "AB": "Since the late 1960's, the production of new neurons was known to occur in the brains of adult rodents however, only recently, neurogenesis was documented in the hippocampus of adult mammals. This region in the brain is related to the function of learning and memory. Hence, the finding that in response to training on associative learning tasks that require the hippocampus the number of newly generated neurons increases, could be highly significant.",
