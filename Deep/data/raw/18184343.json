     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the value of remifentanil in intraoperative evaluation of spike activity in patients undergoing surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients undergoing temporal lobectomy for medically intractable MTLE were enrolled in the study. Electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings were performed on the intraventricular hippocampus and from the anterior inferior temporal and lateral neocortex before and after a 300 microg intravenous bolus of remifentanil. Spike activity was quantified as spike-count per minute. RESULTS: A significant increase (P < 0.005) in spike activity was observed after administration of remifentanil in 23 of 25 patients (92%). Furthermore, two patients who did not have any spike activity on the baseline ECoG developed spikes after administration of remifentanil. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that remifentanil can enhance spike activity in the epileptogenic zone and reveal otherwise concealed epileptogenic tissue in patients with MTLE. Thus, remifentanil may prove to be an important diagnostic tool during surgical treatment for intractable focal epilepsy.",
