     "AB": "Hypobaric hypoxia (HH), a predisposing environmental condition at high altitude (HA), encountered by many mountaineers, jeopardizes their normal physiology like motor coordination and cognitive functions. A large body of evidence shows that HH has deleterious effect on cognitive functions. Among them the hippocampal dependent memory deficit is well known. However, our current understanding of the mechanistic details of cognitive deficits at HA remains largely unclear and hence limits a solution for this problem. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the temporal component of the hippocampal pyramidal neuron damage in the rat brain subjected to chronic HH exposure. Three groups (sham HH, 3 days HH and 7 days HH) of rats were exposed to simulated HH equivalent to 6100 m in an animal decompression chamber for 3 or 7 days. Later, the hippocampal (CA1 and CA3) neurons were analysed for the cell morphology, neurodegeneration and DNA fragmentation. The CA1 and CA3 neurons showed HH induced neuronal pyknosis, cell shrinkage, and consequent inter-cellular vacuolization in the CA1 and CA3 areas. In addition, the total neuron (intact) numbers and mean surface area were decreased. The number of dead neurons increased significantly following exposure to HH for 3 or 7 days. The neurodegenerative (Fluoro jade B) and apoptotic (TUNEL) markers were more positive in CA1 and CA3 neurons. The magnitude of morphological changes, neurodegeneration and apoptosis was enhanced in 7 days HH group than 3 days HH group. Our studies indicate that CA3 neurons are more vulnerable to HH than CA1 neurons, and that may destabilize the neural circuits in the hippocampus and thus cause memory dysfunction.",
