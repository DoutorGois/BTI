     "AB": "This study investigated the actions of proline on CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells with use of slice preparations. Bath-applied L-proline first induced these cells to fire multiple orthodromic population spikes in response to a single stimulus and then blocked their response to both orthodromic and antidromic stimulation. These effects could be explained by postsynaptic depolarization followed by depolarization block. Grease-gap studies confirmed that L-proline depolarizes CA1 pyramidal cells. D-Proline was inactive in these tests. Excitatory amino acid antagonists reduced depolarizing responses to proline and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) in parallel. Mn2+ failed to attenuate proline-evoked depolarizations at concentrations that substantially inhibited synaptic transmission, but at a higher concentration it reduced responses to both proline and NMDA. These results suggest that proline depolarized CA1 pyramidal cells mainly by activating postsynaptic NMDA receptors. The neuroexcitatory and neurotoxic actions of proline in the hippocampus may contribute to the seizures and mental retardation associated with hyperprolinemia.",
