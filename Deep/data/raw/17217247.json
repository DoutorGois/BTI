     "AB": "The spectral analysis of the EEG activity of several brain structures (somatosensory, visual and auditory areas of the cortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus and central medial thalamic nucleus) in the wakefulness-sleep cycle in Krushinskii--Molodkina strain rats with inherited predisposition to audiogenic seizures using long-lastint reducing of the seizure readiness level revealed in these animals after frequentative audiogenic generalized tonicclonic seizures, was performed. The reducing susceptibility to convulsiogenic sound stimuli in rats correlated with a decrease of the theta-range' waves level and increase of the expression alpha-range waves in the EEG during wakefulness. Probable role of reorganized functions of ascending activating brain systems in origination of the long reduction of susceptibility to the sound after frequentative audiogenic convulsions in rats is discussed.",
