     "AB": "In the present study, effects of intra-hippocampal CA1 (intra-CA1) injections of GABA(B) receptor agonist and antagonist on the acquisition and expression of morphine-induced place preference in male Wistar rats have been investigated. Subcutaneous administration of different doses of morphine sulphate (0.5-6 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent conditioned place preference (CPP). Using a 3-day schedule of conditioning, it was found that the GABA(B) receptor agonist, baclofen (0.5-2 microg/rat; intra-CA1), or the GABA(B) receptor antagonist, phaclofen (1-3 microg/rat; intra-CA1), did not produce a significant place preference or place aversion. Intra-CA1 administration of baclofen (1 and 2 microg/rat; intra-CA1) decreased the acquisition of CPP induced by morphine (3 mg/kg; s.c.). On the other hand, intra-CA1 injection of phaclofen (1 and 2 microg/rat; intra-CA1) in combination with a lower dose of morphine (1 mg/kg) elicited a significant CPP. The response of baclofen (2 microg/rat; intra-CA1) was reversed by phaclofen (4 and 6 microg/rat; intra-CA1). Furthermore, intra-CA1 administration of baclofen but not phaclofen before testing significantly decreased the expression of morphine (3 mg/kg; s.c.)-induced place preference. Baclofen or phaclofen injections had no effects on locomotor activity on the testing sessions. It is concluded that the GABA(B) receptors in dorsal hippocampus may play an active role in morphine reward.",
