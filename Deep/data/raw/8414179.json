     "AB": "Evoked population spikes and interneuronal discharges were recorded throughout the sleep-wake cycle in hippocampal regions CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) of ten chronically implanted rats. During quiet wakefulness (QW) and slow-wave-sleep (SWS) (non-theta rhythm states), the primary shock of paired stimuli evoked in CA1 both high amplitude population spikes and multiple interneuron discharges when compared to active wakefulness (AW) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep (theta rhythm states). A second shock was delivered to CA1 afferents 60 ms after the first shock. This second shock evoked a small population spikes during non-theta states, whereas it evoked higher amplitude population spikes in theta states. The second shock also evoked unit interneuron discharges in non-theta states but not in theta states. In the dentate gyrus, identical primary afferent stimulation evoked similar interneuron activity and uniform amplitude population spikes throughout the sleep-wake cycle. In contrast, the secondary shocks evoked a striking potentiation of the field population spike during sleep, SWS and REM sleep compared to AW and OW. Evoked DG interneuron spikes following the second population spike were greater in number during SWS compared to the other stages. Our findings suggest that hippocampal field potentials and interneuron activity recorded in vivo are regionally regulated, have unique state-dependent expression and are strongly influenced by inhibitory feed-forward mechanisms.",
