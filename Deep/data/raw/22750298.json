     "AB": "Intersectin 1 (ITSN1) is a multidomain adaptor protein that functions in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and signal transduction. This protein is highly abundant in neurons and is implicated in Down syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and, possibly, other neurodegenerative disorders. Here we used an in vitro binding assay combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to identify novel binding partners of ITSN1. We found that the neuron-specific isoform of the stable tubule-only polypeptide (STOP) interacts with SH3A domain of ITSN1. STOP and ITSN1 were shown to form a complex in vivo and to partially co-localize in rat primary hippocampal neurons. As STOP is a microtubule-stabilizing protein that is required for several forms of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, identification of this interaction raises the possibility of ITSN1 participation in this process.",
