     "AB": "Long term depression (LTD) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, induced with a 20-Hz, 30 s tetanus to Schaffer collaterals, is enhanced in sleep-deprived (SD) rats. In the present study, we investigated the role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B receptors (GABA(B)-Rs) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) in the LTD of the population excitatory postsynaptic potential (pEPSP). The requirement of Ca(2+) from L- and T-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and intracellular stores was also studied. Results indicate that mGluRs, a release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores and GABA(B)-Rs are required for LTD. Interestingly, while mGlu1Rs seem to be involved in both short-term depression and LTD, mGlu5Rs appear to participate mostly in LTD. CGP 55845, a GABA(B)-R antagonist, partially suppressed LTD in normally sleeping (NS) rats, while completely blocking LTD in SD rats. Moreover, GS-39783, a positive allosteric modulator for GABA(B)-R, suppressed the pEPSP in SD, but not NS rats. Since both mGluRs and GABA(B)-Rs seem to be involved in the LTD, especially in SD rats, we examined if the receptor expression pattern and/or dimerization changed, using immunohistochemical, co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation techniques. Sleep-deprivation induced an increase in the expression of GABA(B)-R1 and mGlu1alphaR in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In addition, co-localization and heterodimerization between mGlu1alphaR/GABA(B)-R1 and mGlu1alphaR/GABA(B)-R2 is enhanced in SD rats. Taken together, our findings present a novel form of LTD sensitive to the activation of mGluRs and GABA(B)-Rs, and reveal, for the first time, that sleep-deprivation induces alterations in the expression and dimerization of these receptors.",
