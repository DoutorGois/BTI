     "AB": "Magnetic resonance imaging is playing an increasingly important role in the evaluation of the hippocampus, particularly in epilepsy, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's dementia. Because of the complex configuration of the hippocampus, it is difficult to compare from patient to patient. We developed a system to allow comparison of the hippocampus on coronal images. We performed 34 magnetic resonance studies on 29 normal subjects. Ten anatomic landmarks were identified. These landmarks have a consistent 5-mm periodicity regardless of usual head flexion. In the second phase of our investigation, we showed that the amygdala, hippocampal head, hippocampal body, and hippocampal tail have a consistent relationship to the coronal magnetic resonance imaging landmarks.",
