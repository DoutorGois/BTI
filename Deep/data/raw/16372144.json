     "AB": "The effect of midazolam on expression of c-Fos protein was examined in the rat hippocampus, following the open field test of neophobia. It was found that pretreatment of rats with midazolam, at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg, enhanced rat exploratory behavior, and inhibited neophobia related stimulation of c-Fos in the CA-1 and CA-3 areas of the hippocampus. The presented results provide new immunocytochemical data on the involvement of hippocampus in emotional processes related to neophobia, and indicate a possible site of action of benzodiazepines.",
