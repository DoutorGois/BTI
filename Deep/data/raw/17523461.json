     "AB": "Hippocampal unit activity in the right and left CA1 fields was studied in rats divided in two groups by the method of \"emotional resonance\": the animals that did (A) and did not stop (E) crying of rat-partner. The rate of neuron firing was studied in the state of hunger, satiation, and under exposure to intracranial electrical stimulation of the emotional positive and negative structures of the brain. It was shown that the intracranial stimulation, especially positive, increased the rate of firing. Under exposure to emotional stimuli, the neural activity was asymmetric only in the A rats. The activity at the left was more intensive than the right-sided activity and did not depend on the sigh of emotion.",
