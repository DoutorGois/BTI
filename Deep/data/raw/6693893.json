     "AB": "The effect of bilateral cerebral ischemia on noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin concentrations in six brain regions (i.e., the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, midbrain-diencephalon, cerebellum, and pons-medulla oblongata) was examined in the gerbil stroke model. The relative changes in regional cerebral blood flow after bilateral common carotid occlusion were also assessed using the radioactive microsphere technique. At 1 h after bilateral carotid occlusion, a significant decrease of monoamine concentration was observed in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain-diencephalon whereas no significant change was detected in the cerebellum and pons-medulla oblongata. The fall in NA content was most prominent in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and percentage reductions of dopamine and serotonin were greatest in the striatum and cerebral cortex, respectively. These results suggest that the monoamine neurons in various brain regions might have different vulnerabilities to ischemic insult and show no evidence of transtentorial diaschisis.",
