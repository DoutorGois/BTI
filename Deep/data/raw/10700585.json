     "AB": "The present study investigated the effect of N-(4-acetyl-1-piperazinyl)-p-fluorobenzamide monohydrate (FK960), a piperazine derivative developed as antidementia drug, on hippocampal neurotransmission. FK960 increased the amplitude of population spikes (PSs) from the granular cell layer in rat hippocampal slices in a bell-shaped dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranged from 10 nM to 10 microM. A similar potentiation was found in the intact mouse hippocampus, the action being still evident 120 min after injection; a maximal effect was obtained with 3 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of FK960 at concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 5 mg/kg. The facilitatory action induced by FK960 did not occlude the potentiation induced by tetanic stimulation. The results of the present study indicate that FK960 induces a long-lasting facilitation of hippocampal neurotransmission, but by a mechanism independent of the tetanic long-term potentiation. This may account for the memory enhancing action of FK960.",
