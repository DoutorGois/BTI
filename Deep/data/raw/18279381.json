     "AB": "Reactive oxygen species contribute to the development of various human diseases. Ischemia is characterized by both significant oxidative stress and characteristic changes in the antioxidant defense mechanism. Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) has a potent ability to increase cell survival in response to oxidative stress. In the present study, we have investigated the protective effects of PEP-1-HSP27 against cell death and ischemic insults. When PEP-1-HSP27 fusion protein was added to the culture medium of astrocyte and primary neuronal cells, it rapidly entered the cells and protected them against cell death induced by oxidative stress. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that, when PEP-1-HSP27 fusion protein was intraperitoneally injected into gerbils, it prevented neuronal cell death in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in response to transient forebrain ischemia. Our results demonstrate that transduced PEP-1-HSP27 protects against cell death in vitro and in vivo, and suggest that transduction of PEP-1-HSP27 fusion protein provides a potential strategy for therapeutic delivery in various human diseases in which reactive oxygen species are implicated, including stroke.",
