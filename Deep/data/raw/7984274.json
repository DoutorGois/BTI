     "AB": "SDZ 216,525 has been proposed to be a silent 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. The present study examined the potential intrinsic agonist action of SDZ 216,525 using two in vivo models of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor function: 5-HT release using microdialysis and feeding behaviour of satiated animals. SDZ 216,525 (1 mg/kg s.c.) and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (1 mg/kg s.c.) significantly decreased hippocampal 5-HT release. In addition, SDZ 216,525 (3 and 10 mg/kg s.c.) and prazosin (3 and 10 mg/kg s.c.) significantly increased food intake in satiated rats. The selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (RS)-WAY100135 (10 mg/kg s.c.) which has been demonstrated to block the effects of 8-OH-DPAT on 5-HT release and food intake had no significant effect on the response induced by SDZ 216,525. In contrast, the non-selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (-)-pindolol (8 mg/kg s.c.) attenuated both SDZ 216,525 responses. The decrease in hippocampal 5-HT release and increase in food intake induced by SDZ 216,525 suggest that the compound may be a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist. However, the failure of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (RS)-WAY100135 to block the SDZ 216,525 responses suggests that SDZ 216,525 decreases 5-HT release and increases food intake by a mechanism other than 5-HT1A receptor agonism. The high affinity of SDZ 216,525 for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor, and the ability of prazosin to decrease 5-HT release and increase food intake, suggest that the effects of SDZ 216,525 may be mediated via an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist action.",
