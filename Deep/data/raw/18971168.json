     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of neurogulin-1 (NRG1) on the transmission and plasticity of CA1 synapses in mouse hippocampal slices at different temperatures. METHODS: Under room temperature (26-/+1 degrees C) or physiological temperature (32-/+1 degrees C), field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) evoked by extracellular microelectrode recording technique was recorded in the CA1 region in adult mouse hippocampal slices, and the long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by high frequency stimulation (HFS). The effects of NRG1 on the baseline fEPSP and induction of LTP in CA1 region were observed. RESULTS: No significant variation in the slope of fEPSP relative to the baseline fEPSP was observed after perfusion with NRG1 at room temperature or physiological temperature (P > 0.05). After HFS at the room temperature, the mean slope of fEPSP in the slices perfused with NRG1 was similar to that of the control group (P > 0.05), but HFS at the physiological temperature resulted in significant reduction in the mean slope of fEPSP in the slices perfused with NRG1 (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: NRG1 may temperature-dependently inhibit the induction of LTP in the CA1 region in mouse hippocampal slices.",
