     "AB": "Chronic psychoemotional stress of social defeats produces development of experimental anxious depression in male mice similar to this disorder in humans. 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels, TPH and MAO A activities, 5-HT1A-receptors in different brain areas were investigated at different stages of development of experimental disorder. It has been shown that initial stage (3 days of social stress) is accompanied by increase of 5-HT level in some brain areas. Decreased 5-HIAA levels in the hippocampus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens were discovered at the stage of forming depression (10 days of social stress). Pharmacological desensitisation and decreased number of 5-HT1A-receptors were shown in frontal cortex and amygdala. At the stage of pronounced depression (20 days of stress), there were no differences in 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in all brain areas (excluding hypothalamus) of depressive animals. However increased number of 5-HT1A-receptors and decreased affinity in amygdala and decreased TPH and MAOA activities in hippocampus were found in depressive mice. Hypofunction of serotonergic system is suggested at the stage of pronounced depression state in animals. Similar processes had place in brain dopaminergic systems. It is concluded that dynamic changes of brain monoaminergic activities accompany the development of anxious depression in animals. Various parameters of monoaminergic systems are differently changed depending on brain area, mediator system and stage of disorder.",
