     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the homeostasis of zinc in central nervous system. METHODS: Expression of MT1/MT2/MT3 on various concentration of zinc exposure (0-150 micromol/L) was determined and their expression on 100 micromol/L zinc exposure after 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours in primary culture rat hippocampal neurons was measured by real-time fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Amount of MT3 mRNA was highest followed by MT1 mRNA, MT2 mRNA ranked third. Expression of MT1 and MT2 mRNA could be up-regulated significantly on 75-100 micromol/L zinc exposure, and then, reach to a plateau on 125-150 micromol/L. Their peak mRNA levels appeared at about 6 h after addition of zinc was added. However, the MT3 mRNA was decreased by about 60% after zinc was added 6 h later. CONCLUSION: The results showed that not only the MT3 but also the MT1 and MT2 were involved in the regulation of zinc homeostasis in neurons, just like neuroglial cell do.",
