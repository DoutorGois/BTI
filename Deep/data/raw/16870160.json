     "AB": "A member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), TROY/TNFRSF19/TAJ, is highly expressed in the brain of adult mice. Northern blot analysis using mRNA taken from regions of the adult CNS showed the expression of TROY in all regions examined, including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that TROY mRNA and protein were strongly expressed in the rostral migratory stream (RMS) and subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult mice. In the adult SVZ, some glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells (type B cells) are thought to be multipotent neural stem cells. These type B cells divide slowly and generate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive transit-amplifying precursor cells (type C cells) in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF). Type C cells give rise to neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (TuJ1)-positive neuroblasts (type A cells) that migrate to the olfactory bulb along the RMS. TROY-expressing cells were GFAP-positive, EGFR-positive, and TuJ1-negative in the adult SVZ. From these findings, TROY appears to be expressed in type B and type C cells, but not in type A cells, which was supported by immunoelectron microscopy. In addition, TROY was expressed in GFAP-positive astrocytes of the various regions, such as the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. Thus, TROY was expressed in uncommitted precursor cells and astroglial lineage cells, suggesting that TROY plays some roles in the regulation of gliogenesis in the adult CNS.",
