     "AB": "Familial, early onset, generalized torsion dystonia is the most common and severe primary dystonia. The majority of cases are caused by a 3-bp deletion (GAG) in the coding region of the DYT1 (TOR1A) gene. The cellular and regional distribution of torsinA protein and its message has been described previously in several regions of normal adult human and rodent brain. This study examines the expression of torsinA in the developing human brain of fetuses, infants and children up to 7 years of age in four selected brain regions. Expression of torsinA protein was detectable beginning at 4 to 8 weeks of age postnatally in the cerebellum (Purkinje cells), substantia nigra (dopaminergic neurons), hippocampus and basal ganglia. Prominent torsinA immunoreactivity was not seen before 6 weeks of age postnatally, a period associated with synaptic remodeling, process elimination and the beginning of myelination. Our results indicate that torsinA protein expression is temporally and spatially regulated and is present in all brain regions studied by the age of 2 months on into adulthood.",
