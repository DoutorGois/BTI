     "AB": "Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) is one of the common complications of diabetes. Depression (DP) is also one of the common complications of diabetes. P2X7 receptors play an important role in the transmission of nociceptive signal and are associated with depressive illness. In the study, the hyperalgesia, allodynia and depressive behaviours of rats with comorbidity of DNP and DP were confirmed by the thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) test, mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) test, sucrose preference test (SPT), immobility time of forced swimming test (IMFST) and open-field test (OFT). The change in expression of the P2X7 receptor of the hippocampus was observed through RT-PCR, qPCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining methods The results showed that palmatine treatment can alleviate the hyperalgesia, allodynia and depressive behaviours of rats with comorbidity of DNP and DP. Meanwhile, the expression of P2X7 receptors, GFAP, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in the hippocampus of the rats with comorbidity of DNP and DP was significantly increased compared with the control rats, and palmatine treatment could decrease the expression. Furthermore, the enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the hippocampus of rats with DNP and DP was decreased noticeably by palmatine treatment. The results of this study suggest that palmatine can alleviate the comorbidity of DNP and DP by inhibiting the expression of P2X7 receptors in the hippocampus, and its action may be related to suppression of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the release of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in the hippocampus.",
