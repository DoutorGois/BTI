     "AB": "Bacterial compounds induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in meningitis. Rifampin releases smaller quantities of proinflammatory compounds from Streptococcus pneumoniae than do beta-lactam antibiotics. Therefore, rabbits infected intracisternally with S. pneumoniae were treated intravenously either with rifampin 5 mg/kg/h or ceftriaxone 10 mg/kg/h (n=9 each). Before initiation of antibiotic treatment, a strong positive correlation between ROS production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phagocyte populations and bacterial CSF titers was observed (granulocytes: rs=.90, P<.0001; monocytes: rs=.81, P<.0001). CSF leukocytes from rifampin-treated rabbits produced less ROS (monocytes at 2 h after initiation of treatment: P=.045; at 5 h: P=.014; granulocytes at 5 h: P=.036) than did leukocytes from animals receiving ceftriaxone. The CSF malondialdehyde concentrations and the density of apoptotic neurons in the dentate gyrus were lower in rifampin- than in ceftriaxone-treated animals (P=.002 and.005). The use of rifampin to reduce the release of ROS and to decrease secondary brain injury appears promising.",
