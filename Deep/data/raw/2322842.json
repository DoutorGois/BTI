     "AB": "Following brief cerebral ischemia, neurons are selectively damaged and die, whereas glial cells and blood vessels survive. This phenomenon of selective vulnerability is well illustrated in the hippocampal CA1 region. Five min of forebrain ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil produced selective neuronal necrosis in the hippocampal CA1 sector. After destruction and loss of CA1 neurons, a remarkable glial reaction (gliosis) was seen. The thickness of the CA1 subfield remained unchanged until 1 month after ischemia and then gradually shrank over several months. Ultrastructural observation of this region revealed persistent maintenance of presynaptic structures. Numerous presynaptic terminals containing synaptic vesicles were scattered throughout the gliotic scar tissue. These presynaptic terminals were apposed to degenerative structures which seemed most likely to be remnants of dendrites. In another group of animals, at one month following ischemic damage in the CA1 sector, the CA3 neurons were destroyed by kainic acid injection. In these animals, numerous degenerating presynaptic boutons were seen in the CA1 sector when fixed 4 days following kainate injection. These results indicate that even in gliotic tissue, presynaptic terminals can survive and maintain their structural characteristics although neuronal cell bodies are almost absent.",
