     "AB": "A study was made of the effect of the central nervous system stimulant ethymizol on RNA-polymerase activity of cell nuclei of the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus during learning with different reinforcements. Ethymizol stimulated the incorporation of 3H-UTP in the TCA-insoluble fraction of hippocampal nuclei during training of the animals in the avoidance response to the light in a Y-shaped mize and training in the reaction of spontaneous alternation of food reinforcements in a complex mize, and decreased the ratio brain cortex/hippocampus RNA-polymerase activity. The data obtained are discussed from the standpoint that the action of ethymizol is consequent on the activation of the genome of nervous cells.",
