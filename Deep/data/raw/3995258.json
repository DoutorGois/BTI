     "AB": "Chandelier or axo-axonic cells (AACs) are specialized interneurons terminating on the axon initial segments of pyramidal neurons. Two AACs have been localized by Golgi impregnation, one in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and one in the visual cortex of cat, for structural analysis and for the identification of their transmitter. They had 323 and 268 terminal bouton rows, respectively, probably making synapses with an equal number of initial segments. The distribution of the dendrites of the hippocampal cell was strikingly similar to that of pyramidal cells suggesting a similar input. Using an antiserum to GABA and postembedding GABA-immunocytochemistry, developed for Golgi-impregnated neurons, both cells were found to be GABA-immunoreactive. The strategic location of their synapses and the presence of GABA in AACs suggest that in normal cortical tissue they play a major role in GABA-mediated inhibition.",
