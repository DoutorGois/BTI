     "AB": "The effect of propentofylline on regional [3H]-leucine incorporation into brain proteins was investigated during early reperfusion following permanent occlusion of vertebral arteries and reversible occlusion of the common carotid arteries of awake rats. In rats subjected to 5 min ischemia/50 min reperfusion the total brain radioactivity and TCA-precipitable radioactivity were reduced in the cerebellum, medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, cortex, striatum and hippocampus and the fractional protein radioactivity was decreased in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus. Propentofylline pretreatment at a dose of 25 mg/kg p.o. daily for 14 days completely reversed the reduction in total radioactivity and partially reversed the reduction in TCA-precipitable radioactivity in all brain regions studied and decreased the reduction in fractional protein radioactivity in the hippocampus. The results suggest that the protective effect of propentofylline on transient ischemia-induced brain damage may be related to improvement of [3H]-leucine incorporation into brain proteins.",
