     "AB": "The pattern and intensity of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and heat shock 70 protein (Hsp 70) changes in the hippocampus and brain cortex of adult Wistar rat males exposed to acute (immobilization, cold) and chronic (social isolation, crowding, daily swimming) stress or their combinations were followed by Western immunoblotting. Plasma ACTH and CORT were measured by chemiluminescent method and RIA. A significant decrease in cytosol GR and Hsp 70 was observed after acute stress, while chronic stresses led to negligible changes in both these proteins and caused a reduced responsiveness to a novel acute stress. This was valid irrespective of the type of chronic or acute stress combinations for both hippocampal and cortical GR and Hsp 70. The results support the hypothesis that chronic stress-induced deregulation of the LHPA axis may be caused, at least in part, by partial disruption of intracelullar negative feedback control in the higher centers of the brain.",
