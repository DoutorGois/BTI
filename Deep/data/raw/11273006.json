     "AB": "Traumatic brain injury results in a profound decline in intracellular magnesium ion levels that may jeopardize critical cellular functions. We examined the consequences of preinjury magnesium deficiency and post-traumatic magnesium treatment on injury-induced cytoskeletal damage and cell death at 24 h after injury. Adult male rats were fed either a normal (n = 24) or magnesium-deficient diet (n = 16) for 2 wk prior to anesthesia and lateral fluid percussion brain injury (n = 31) or sham injury (n = 9). Normally fed animals were then randomized to receive magnesium chloride (125 micromol, i.v., n = 10) or vehicle solution (n = 11) at 10 min postinjury. Magnesium treatment reduced cortical cell loss (p < 0.05), cortical alterations in microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) (p < 0.05), and both cortical and hippocampal calpain-mediated spectrin breakdown (p < 0.05 for each region) when compared to vehicle treatment. Conversely, magnesium deficiency prior to brain injury led to a greater area of cortical cell loss (p < 0.05 compared to vehicle treatment). Moreover, brain injury to magnesium-deficient rats resulted in cytoskeletal alterations within the cortex and hippocampus that were not observed in vehicle- or magnesium-treated animals. These data suggest that cortical cell death and cytoskeletal disruptions in cortical and hippocampal neurons may be sensitive to magnesium status after experimental brain injury, and may be mediated in part through modulation of calpains.",
