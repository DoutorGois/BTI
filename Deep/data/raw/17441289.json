     "AB": "Clinical and experimental studies clearly demonstrate that prolonged seizures and status epilepticus induce neuronal cell death in the brain. Recent evidence suggests that induction of apoptosis contributes greatly to seizure-induced brain damage. We recently demonstrated that intrahippocampal delivery of botulinum neurotoxin E (BoNT/E) in the rat hippocampus is able to prevent neuronal loss, which occurs after kainic-acid-induced seizures. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of BoNT/E-mediated neuroprotection. We found that intrahippocampal administration of BoNT/E prevents the upregulation of apoptotic proteins (phosphorylated c-Jun and cleaved caspase 3), which occurs in hippocampal neurones following kainic acid seizures. These results demonstrate that the neuroprotective action of BoNT/E on seizure-injured hippocampal neurons involves the blockade of well-characterized apoptotic pathways.",
