     "AB": "In the present study, we observed the changes of endogenous expression of glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase) in the gerbil hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia and investigated the correlation between GDNF and PI-3 kinase in the ischemic hippocampus. In the sham-operated group, GDNF and PI-3 kinase immunoreactivity was not found in any cells in the hippocampal CA1 region. GDNF, not PI-3 kinase, immunoreactivity was expressed in non-pyramidal cells in the CA1 region at 6 h after ischemic insult. At 12-24 h after ischemia, GDNF and PI-3 kinase immunoreactivity in the CA1 region was similar to that of the sham-operated group. From 2 days after ischemic insult, GDNF- and PI-3-kinase-immunoreactive astrocytes were detected in the CA1 region, and GDNF and PI-3 kinase immunoreactivity in astrocytes was highest in the CA1 region 4 days after ischemic insult. Moreover, at this time point, GDNF and PI-3 kinase were co-localized in some astrocytes. Western blotting showed that ischemia-related changes of GDNF and PI-3 kinase protein levels were similar to the immunohistochemical changes after ischemia. These results suggest that GDNF and PI-3 kinase may be related to delayed neuronal death and that GDNF and PI-3 kinase may be involved in activation of astrocytes.",
