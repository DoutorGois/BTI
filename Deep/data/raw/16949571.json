     "AB": "Systemic administration does not allow a clear differentiation between the anticonvulsant properties of GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) modulators. For this reason, various GABAA modulators have previously been micro-infused into seizure controlling substrates (area tempestas, substantia nigra) in the rat brain as a screening method for potential systemic administration. The purpose of the present study was to examine the anticonvulsant impact of the GABAergic modulators muscimol, ethanol, and propofol (screened by micro-infusions) when each drug was combined with procyclidine and administered systemically. The results showed that all 3 combinations could effectively terminate soman-induced (100 microg/kg s.c.) seizures when administered 30-35 min after onset. Procyclidine and propofol were considered as the most relevant double regimen to replace a previous triple regimen (procyclidine, diazepam, pentobarbital) against soman-induced seizures. Additionally, it was shown that unilateral implantation of hippocampal electrodes resulted in increased resistance to aphagia/adipsia and neuropathology, but not to lethality following soman. Efficient pharmacological treatment of soman-induced seizures at an early stage (< 20 min) is crucial to avoid neuropathology and cognitive deficits.",
