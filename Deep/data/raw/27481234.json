     "AB": "Epilepsy is one of the prevalent and major neurological disorders, and approximately one-third of the individuals with epilepsy experience seizures that do not respond well to available medications. We investigated whether oxysophocarpine (OSC) had anticonvulsant and neuroprotective property in the pilocarpine (PILO)-treated mice. Thirty minutes prior to the PILO injection, the mice were administrated with OSC (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) once. Seizures and electroencephalography (EEG) were observed, and then the mice were killed for Nissl and Fluoro-jade B (FJB) staining. The oxidative stress was measured at 24 h after convulsion. Western blot analysis was used to examine the expressions of the Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase-3. In this study, we found that pretreatment with OSC (40, 80 mg/kg) significantly delayed the onset of the first convulsion and status epilepticus (SE) and reduced the incidence of SE and mortality. Analysis of EEG recordings revealed that OSC (40, 80 mg/kg) significantly reduced epileptiform discharges. Furthermore, Nissl and FJB staining showed that OSC (40, 80 mg/kg) attenuated the neuronal cell loss and degeneration in hippocampus. In addition, OSC (40, 80 mg/kg) attenuated the changes in the levels of Malondialdehyde (MDA) and strengthened glutathione peroxidase and catalase activity in the hippocampus. Western blot analysis showed that OSC (40, 80 mg/kg) significantly decreased the expressions of Bax, Caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2. Collectively, the findings of this study indicated that OSC exerted anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects on PILO-treated mice. The beneficial effects should encourage further studies to investigate OSC as an adjuvant in epilepsy, both to prevent seizures and to protect neurons in brain.",
