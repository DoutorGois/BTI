     "AB": "The components of the medial temporal lobes (MTL) receive different kinds of input. The perirhinal cortex receives primarily object/item information, the parahippocampal cortex receives contextual information, and the hippocampus receives high-level inputs that include object/item, context, and other information. Critically, the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices have similar cytoarchitectonics, which differ considerably from that of the hippocampus and suggest that these cortices process their inputs differently from the way that the hippocampus processes its inputs. Much evidence indicates that the hippocampus is designed to rapidly bind together pattern-separated representations that support recall/recollection well. In contrast, the newer MTL cortices rapidly create poorly pattern-separated memories that support familiarity well, but recall/recollection very poorly. For over a decade, there has been disagreement about whether recall/recollection is primarily mediated by the hippocampus and familiarity by the evolutionarily newer MTL cortices or whether the MTL mediates these kinds of memory in an integrated, homogeneous fashion. Common misconceptions about familiarity, recollection, item, and associative memory are discussed as are methodological problems with MTL lesion and functional imaging research. The possible confound of familiarity with weaker memory and recollection with stronger memory is discussed and the implications of the Montaldi et al. (2006) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study, which matched memory strength between strong familiarity and recollection, finding that only recollection activated the hippocampus, are discussed. A suggestion is made about how the long-running conflict of findings in the human hippocampal lesion literature may be resolved.",
