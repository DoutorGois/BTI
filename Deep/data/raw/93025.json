The cellular morphology ranges from fusiform to multiangular with most cells showing radiating processes characteristic of neurons in the reticular core. Dendrites are long and relatively smooth, with a few sparsely distributed spinous processes. These cells are comparable to the cholinergic cells of the median septal/diagonal band area which also project into the hippocampal formation.",
