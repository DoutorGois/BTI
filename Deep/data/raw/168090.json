Cholinomimetic agents at 10(-5) M (carbamylcholine, pilocarpine, acetylcholine and eserine) and papavering at 14(-4) M significantly elevated cyclic GMP accumulation in the cerebral cortex. Three min incubation with carbamylcholine (10(-5) M) did not increase cyclic nucleotide accumulation in the remaining brain regions.",
