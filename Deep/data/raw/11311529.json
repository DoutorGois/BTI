     "AB": "The effect of toosendanin, a selective presynaptic blocker and effective antibotulismic agent, on large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels was studied in inside-out patches of pyramidal neurons freshly isolated from the hippocampal CA1 region of the rat. Toosendanin (1 x 10(-6)g/ml approximately 1 x 10(-4)g/ml) was found to inhibit large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels by reducing its open probability significantly in a concentration-dependent manner, although the effective concentration of toosendanin was lower in a symmetrical K(+) (150 mM) solution than under asymmetrical conditions (changing K(+) concentration in pipette solution to 5mM). The action was partially reversible by washing. By decreasing the slow open time constant, toosendanin shortened the open dwell time of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels in a dose-dependent manner. A dose-dependent reduction of unitary current amplitude of the channel was detected after toosendanin perfusion. On elevating the intracellular free calcium concentration from 1 to 10 microM, a similar effect on large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels by toosendanin was also observed, but its efficacy was diminished. These results show that toosendanin inhibits large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels in hippocampal neurons by reducing the open probability and unitary current amplitude of the channel, and that Ca(2+) interferes with the effect. These data provide an explanation for toosendanin-induced facilitation of neurotransmitter release and the antibotulismic effect of the drug.",
