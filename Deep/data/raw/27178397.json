     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To find a difference in fractional anisotropy (FA) between young adult males with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) and healthy controls (HCs). METHODS: Sixteen males with SPD and sixteen HCs were selected from 3500 freshmen across two universities. The 32 participants were evaluated by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) (Chinese Version Sc>/=70) and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ). Structured diagnostic interview was carried out and all the subjects in the SPD group met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for SPD. All participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, and their diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data was collected. DTI data was analysed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), and the neurofibre connection from the hippocampus to the right entorhinal cortex was traced. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. RESULTS: (1) SPD and HCs had a significant difference in SPQ symptoms (P<0.05). (2) There was a significant difference in the fractional anisotropy of two clusters of the brain between the two groups (P<0.05). The first cluster included the right pallidum, right retro-lenticular part of the internal capsule, right inferior longitudinal fasciculus (rILF), right posterior parietal lobe, right temporal lobe and right occipital lobe. The second cluster included the right hippocampus, right fornix, and right temporal lobe. (3) FA volume in the rILF positively correlated with scores related to the \"lack of friends\" subscale of the SPQ. CONCLUSION: These results suggest reduced white matter in two brain clusters of young adult males with SPD. These findings are similar to previous reports on patients experiencing their first schizophrenic episode.",
