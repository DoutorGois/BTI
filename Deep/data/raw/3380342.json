     "AB": "The postnatal development of the hippocampus of the inbred mice strains BALB/c, C57BL/6, and DBA/2 was studied in organotypic explant cultures using the roller-tube technique. In vivo, mice exhibit strain-specific mossy fiber distribution patterns. As a main result we found, that after cultivation of 3-4 weeks, similar strain-specific patterns became apparent in vitro, as visualized by a modified Timm staining. From this experiment we can conclude that a postnatal extrinsic influence cannot be the cause of the strain-specific hippocampal features.",
