     "AB": "Freely ambulant wistar adult rats of both sexes when exposed to a hot water jet on the head (50 degrees C - 55 degrees C) for a period of 8-10 minutes, manifested seizure activity similar to the ones noted in 'hot-water epilepsy' (HWE) in humans. Depth electrode recording from the hippocampus revealed seizure discharges during the ictus lasting from 34 seconds to three minutes, followed by low voltage indeterminate activity and a quiescent resting phase. Seizure initiation was noted to be critically dependent on the rectal temperature of 41.5 degrees C and regional hippocampal temperature of 37 degrees C. There appeared to be no clear evidence for kindling phenomenon. Intervention of hyperthermia by cooling the body after the ictus prevented subsequent occurrence of spontaneous seizures. Pathological study of the brain revealed ischaemic changes in specific topographic areas like Sommer's sector in hippocampus, layer 4 and 5 neurons of the cerebral cortex and reticular neurons in the brain stem- a pathological feature reminiscent of the human epileptic brain. Seizure initiation by hyperthermic stimulation with hot water poured over the head, the progression and the EEG recording the seizure activity in these rats appears to resemble the HWE in human subjects and could thus serve as the first animal model for this form of \"reflex' epilepsy. This has given new insight into the understanding of human HWE. Our preliminary observations in humans has suggested that HWE is a type of hyperthermic seizure similar to febrile convulsion but differs from it with respect to stimulus and rate of rise in temperature in a susceptible individual.",
