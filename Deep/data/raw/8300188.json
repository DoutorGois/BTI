     "AB": "Numerous ectopic granule cells are found in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in NZB/BlNJ and dreher mutant mice. These ectopic neurons occur either singly or in small clusters. In contrast, few ectopic granule cells are seen in the dentate molecular layer of C57BL/6J mice and dreher control littermates. In this investigation we have examined the morphology, number, and distribution of molecular layer astrocytes in NZB/BlNJ, dreher homozygotes, dreher littermate controls, and C57BL/6J mice to determine the effect of the presence of ectopic granule cells. In the molecular layer of C57BL/6J mice and dreher control littermates, astrocytes have a typical stellate appearance with processes emanating in all directions. The arborization of astrocytes in areas devoid of ectopic granule cells in NZB/BlNJ mice and dreher homozygotes was similar to that in C57BL/6J mice and dreher control littermates. In contrast, the morphology of astrocytes in the immediate vicinity of ectopic granule cells or ectopic clusters was distinctly non-stellate. Furthermore, the somata and processes of these astrocytes occasionally appeared to make intimate contact with the ectopic granule cells. A quantitative analysis of the number and distribution of astrocytes in NZB/BlNJ vs C57BL/6J mice and dreher vs. control littermates indicated that these parameters were not altered by the presence of the ectopic neurons. We conclude that the trophic effects of ectopic neurons on glial cells can affect the growth and orientation of astrocytic processes without a concomitant effect on glial cell number.",
