     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of Yizhitongxuan decoction on learning and memory abilities, Gaq/11 expression and Na(+)-K(+)-ATP enzyme activity in rat models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) caused by injecting Abeta25-35 into the hippocampus. METHODS: Ninety male Wistar rats (age > or = 10 months) were selected and injected with Abeta25-35 into their hippocampi to establish model animals, which were randomly divided into six groups including a sham-operated group (blank group), a model group, a donepezil HCL group (Western Medicine group), and a high/general/dilute concentrations of Yizhitongxuan decoction groups (TCM I II III group). The Morris water maze was used to examine the learning and memory abilities of rats in each group by place navigation and spatial probe tests. Then, the rats were sacrificed to collect the hippocampi for biochemical tests, using western blotting to detect the expression of Gaq/11 and an ultramicro Na(+)-K(+)-ATP enzyme kit to measure Na(+)-K(+)-ATP enzyme activity. RESULTS: Yizhitongxuan decoction improved model rats' learning and memory abilities, and increased the expression of Gaq/11 in the hippocampus and the level of Na(+)-K(+)-ATP enzyme activity in brain tissue. CONCLUSION: Yizhitongxuan decoction could improve model rats' learning and memory abilities, and had a regulating effect on the expression of Gaq/11 and Na(+)-K(+)-ATP enzyme activity.",
