     "AB": "The present study examined the effect of glucocorticoid manipulations on local cerebral blood flow in the hippocampus. We measured local cerebral blood flow in the hippocampus at 1-h intervals over a 1-day period in freely moving rats, by means of the H2 clearance method, before and after sham adrenalectomy, adrenalectomy or adrenalectomy with corticosterone replacement. We also measured local cerebral blood flow in the prefrontal cortex before and after adrenalectomy. Four weeks after the adrenalectomy, hippocampal blood flow at each time of day was an average of 47% greater than before the operation, showing diurnal variation as before. After the sham adrenalectomy or adrenalectomy with corticosterone replacement, hippocampal blood flow did not change significantly with respect to either its level or its diurnal variation. Local cerebral blood flow in the prefrontal cortex increased by only 19% after adrenalectomy. The present study demonstrates that adrenalectomy causes a remarkable increase in hippocampal blood flow, probably due to a lack of corticosterone.",
