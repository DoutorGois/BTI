     "AB": "Opioid peptides, deriving from prodynorphin, proenkephalin and proopiomelanocortin genes, have been shown to modulate brain development. Prodynorphin gene expression was studied here by in situ hybridization in the developing rat hypothalamus using oligodeoxynucleotide probes. Prodynorphin mRNA-synthetizing cells were observed in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, the supraoptic and the paraventricular nuclei from embryonic days 16, 18 and 21, respectively. We detected no transient expression of prodynorphin gene in the rat hypothalamus. Prodynorphin mRNA-containing cells were also observed prenatally in the striatum, the cortex, the hippocampus and the amygdala. When compared with data from the literature, our results suggest that translation may immediately follow transcription of prodynorphin gene in the supraoptic nucleus. The presence of prodynorphin mRNA in the developing rat hypothalamus also raises the possibility of an involvement of prodynorphin-derived peptides in developmental processes and/or in the maturation of adult neural regulations.",
