     "AB": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with loss of motor and sensory functions below the injury level. Cell based therapies are experimented in pre-clinical studies around the world. Neural stem cells are located intra-cranially in subventricular zone and hippocampus which are highly invasive sources. The olfactory epithelium is a neurogenic tissue where neurogenesis takes place throughout the adult life by a population of stem/progenitor cells. Easily accessible olfactory neuroepithelial stem/progenitor cells are an attractive cell source for transplantation in SCI. Globose basal cells (GBCs) were isolated from rat olfactory epithelium, characterized by flow cytometry and immunohistochemically. These cells were further studied for neurosphere formation and neuronal induction. T10 laminectomy was done to create drop-weight SCI in rats. On the 9(th) day following SCI, 5 x 10(5) cells were transplanted into injured rat spinal cord. The outcome of transplantation was assessed by the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale, motor evoked potential and histological observation. GBCs expressed neural stem cell markers nestin, SOX2, NCAM and also mesenchymal stem cell markers (CD29, CD54, CD90, CD73, CD105). These cells formed neurosphere, a culture characteristics of NSCs and on induction, differentiated cells expressed neuronal markers betaIII tubulin, microtubule-associated protein 2, neuronal nuclei, and neurofilament. GBCs transplanted rats exhibited hindlimb motor recovery as confirmed by BBB score and gastrocnemius muscle electromyography amplitude was increased compared to controls. Green fluorescent protein labelled GBCs survived around the injury epicenter and differentiated into betaIII tubulin-immunoreactive neuron-like cells. GBCs could be an alternative to NSCs from an accessible source for autologous neurotransplantation after SCI without ethical issues.",
