     "AB": "Nitrendipine binding-inhibitory activity was extracted and partially purified from rat brain. This preparation also decreased veratridine-stimulated Ca2+ uptake in cultured cerebellar granule cells. It failed to inhibit 3H-nitrendipine binding by sequestering Ca2+ that is required for the high affinity binding of nitrendipine. An allosteric modulation of nitrendipine recognition sites by this preparation is suggested.",
