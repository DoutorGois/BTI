     "AB": "A 39-year-old woman, with a 23-year history of medically intractable seizures of the complex partial type, underwent a left anterior temporal lobectomy and hippocampectomy. Histologic examinations revealed a massive occurrence of corpora amylacea, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus. The distribution of corpora amylacea in this case was quite distinctive and unlike the patterns of \"nonspecific\" corpora amylacea formation seen in aging or other neurodegenerative conditions. The pathogenetic aspects of the accumulation of these peculiar bodies are discussed in relation to hippocampal sclerosis.",
