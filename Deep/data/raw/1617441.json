     "AB": "The effect of chronic ethanol exposure on inhibition in the rat hippocampal slice was investigated using paired-pulse stimulation techniques with stimulation in stratum radiatum or stratum oriens of CA1. Experimental animals were fed ethanol in a liquid diet for 20 weeks and were withdrawn for at least 8 weeks prior to electrophysiological recording. Prior ethanol treatment had no effect on basic input-output relationships for the extracellular population spike. Ethanol treatment significantly reduced the recurrent inhibition produced by antidromic stimulation in a manner dependent upon stimulus intensity. In addition, with orthodromic paired-pulse stimulation of either stratum radiatum or oriens, a trend toward an augmentation of the facilitation of population spike amplitude was observed, suggesting that feedforward inhibition may also be reduced. These results are similar to those found with treatments that reduce inhibition. Therefore, we conclude that chronic ethanol exposure produces an enduring disruption of inhibitory neuronal function in the rat hippocampus.",
