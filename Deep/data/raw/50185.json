     "AB": "EEG recordings have been made from freely moving, seizure sensitive gerbils during seizures of varying severity. The localization of seizure activity in various brain areas and the generalization of this activity could be correlated with the observed motor manifestations. Paroxysmal observed motor manifestations. Paroxysmal bursting has also been recorded in the parietal cortex of a xeizure sensitive animal in which no concomitant peripheral motor activity was evident. These observations strengthen the suggestion that selectively bred epileptic strains of Meriones unguiculatus may be a suitable animal model for the study of the epilepsies.",
