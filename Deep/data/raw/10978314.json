     "AB": "Adenosine and arachidonate (AA) fulfil opposite modulatory roles, arachidonate facilitating and adenosine inhibiting cellular responses. To understand if there is an inter-play between these two neuromodulatory systems, we investigated the effect of AA on extracellular adenosine metabolism in hippocampal nerve terminals. AA (30 microm) facilitated by 67% adenosine evoked release and by 45% ATP evoked release. These effects were not significantly modified upon blockade of lipooxygenase or cyclooxygenase and were attenuated (52-61%) by the protein kinase C inhibitor, chelerythrine (6 microm). The ecto-5'-nucleotidase inhibitor, alpha,beta-methylene ADP (100 microm), caused a larger inhibition (54%) of adenosine release in the presence of AA (30 microm) compared with control (37% inhibition) indicating that the AA-induced extracellular adenosine accumulation is mostly originated from an increased release and extracellular catabolism of ATP. This AA-induced extracellular adenosine accumulation is further potentiated by an AA-induced decrease (48%) of adenosine transporters capacity. AA (30 microm) increased by 36-42% the tonic inhibition by endogenous extracellular adenosine of adenosine A(1) receptors in the modulation of acetylcholine release and of CA1 hippocampal synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices. These results indicate that AA increases tonic adenosine modulation as a possible feedback loop to limit AA facilitation of neuronal excitability.",
