     "AB": "Deafferentation is known to induce axonal sprouting in adult brain, but the signals that direct this response are not understood. To evaluate the possible roles of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in central axonal sprouting, the present study used in situ hybridization to evaluate IGF-1 and bFGF mRNA expression in entorhinal deafferented rat hippocampus. Alternate tissue sections were processed for Fink-Heimer impregnation of axonal degeneration, Bandeiraea simplicifolia (BS-1) labeling of microglia, and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunocytochemistry. In control hippocampus, IGF-1 mRNA was localized to a few neurons, with no labeled cells in the dentate gyrus molecular layer; bFGF cRNA hybridization was diffuse in dendritic fields but was dense in CA2 stratum pyramidale. Both mRNA species were increased by deafferentation. The distribution of elevated IGF-1 mRNA corresponded precisely to fields of axonal degeneration and was greatest in the dentate gyrus outer molecular layer and stratum lacunosum moleculare. In these fields, IGF-1 mRNA was elevated by 2 days, reached maximal levels at 4 days, and declined by 10 days postlesion. Double labeling revealed that the majority of IGF-1 cRNA-labeled cells were microglia. In deafferented hippocampus, bFGF mRNA was broadly increased across fields both containing and lacking axonal degeneration. In the dentate, bFGF mRNA levels peaked at 5 days postlesion and remained elevated through 14 days. These results demonstrate that reactive microglia within deafferented hippocampal laminae express IGF-1 mRNA just prior to and during the period of reactive axonal growth and suggest that IGF-1 plays a role in directing the sprouting of spared afferents into these fields.",
