     "AB": "The influence of physiological Ca(2+)-inducing stimuli and agents mimicking ischemic conditions on mitochondrial potential was studied in postnatal (P1) hippocampal astrocytes. Cytosolic Ca(2+) loads with characteristic kinetics of rise and duration, detected by Fura-2, were provoked by extracellular Ca(2+) influx, release from InsP(3)-sensitive intracellular stores, or inhibition of the reloading of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores. Inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration caused only moderate release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores, inducing a rise of less than 60 nM. The maximal Ca(2+) rise was found with InsP(3)-mediated responses (500 nM; via ATP) or with ionophore (4-Br-A23187)-mediated Ca(2+) influx from extracellular medium (770 nM). Remarkably, all these agents causing significant rise of cytosolic Ca(2+), only minimally depolarized the mitochondria. Membrane potential of mitochondria was monitored by Rh123 or TMRE. Depolarization was only found with very high cytosolic Ca(2+) levels (above 60 microM; measured by fura FF). These were achieved with external Ca(2+) influx by ionophore in combination with inhibition of glycolysis. Thus, mitochondria in the astrocytes are obviously not sensitive to moderate cytosolic Ca(2+) loads, irrespective of the source of Ca(2+). Furthermore, isolated rat brain mitochondria display a low sensitivity of respiratory activity to Ca(2+), which is consistent with the data obtained with the astrocytes in vitro. The capacity of isolated mitochondria to build up a potential was gradually reduced at low micromolar Ca(2+) and totally compromised only at Ca(2+) concentrations in the 100 microM range.",
