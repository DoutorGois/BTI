     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Our objective in this retrospective study was to assess the hippocampal abnormalities, associate them with various congenital brain malformations, and define the frequency of the association in specific anomaly subgroups. METHODS: A total of 62 patients with congenital malformations of the brain who had thin-slice coronal T2-weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, IR, or T1-weighted 3D gradient echo images were retrospectively evaluated for the type of congenital brain malformation and morphological or rotational hippocampal abnormalities. Medical records were reviewed for age, sex, and symptoms. CONCLUSION: Hippocampal abnormalities are found in 55.8% of all patients with different kinds of congenital brain malformations that are mostly associated with cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly, and total agenesis of the corpus callosum. The severity of the injury may have an effect on the extent of the involvement of the brain.",
