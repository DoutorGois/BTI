     "AB": "The volume of temporal lobe structures was examined in twenty-seven older (mean age of 69.2 +/- 8.3 years) and ten younger subjects (mean age of 26.1 +/- 4.1 years) using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods. Multiple regression analysis, using gender, overall atrophy, and head size as covariates, showed unique contributions of age to variance in both medial and lateral temporal lobe volumes. Temporal lobe subregions that showed the strongest unique age-related reductions were the hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampus. These results suggest age-related reductions in temporal lobe subvolumes.",
