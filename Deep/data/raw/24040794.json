     "AB": "Total bakkenolides is the major component of the rhizome of Petasites trichinous Franch.. In this study, we investigated its neuroprotective effects in a rat transient focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model, and in an in vitro cerebral ischemia model, oxygen-glucose deprivation of cultured nerve cells. Oral administration of total bakkenolides immediately after reperfusion at doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg markedly reduced brain infarct volume and neurological deficits. Total bakkenolides significantly attenuated cell death and apoptosis in primarily cultured neurons subject to 1-h hypoxia followed by 24-h reoxygenation. Morphologic observations directly confirmed its protective effect on neurons. We also demonstrated that total bakkenolides could inhibit nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation by blocking the classic activation pathway through suppression of phosphorylation of IkappaB-kinase complex, NF-kappaB/p65 and inhibitor protein IkappaB, inducing nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB/p65 and degradation of IkappaB. Further, total bakkenolides inhibited the activation of Akt and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, two important upstream activators of NF-kappaB. In conclusion, our results provide a strong pharmacological basis for further understanding the potential therapeutic role of total bakkenolides in cerebral ischemic disease and shed new light on its neuroprotective mechanism.",
