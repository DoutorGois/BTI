     "AB": "We have previously demonstrated that bilobalide, a constituent of the Ginkgo biloba extract, possesses anticonvulsant activity, and suggested that the mechanism of its anticonvulsant action involves modulation of y-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-related neuronal transmission. This study examined the effects of bilobalide on the level of GABA and glutamate, the activity and the amount of glutamic acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15), and the function of GABA(A) receptors in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and striatum of the mouse. GABA levels, glutamic acid decarboxylase activity, and the protein amount of 67 kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase in the hippocampus of mice treated with bilobalide (30 mg/kg, p.o., once a day for 4 days) were significantly higher than those in controls. However, there were no significant differences in glutamate levels or, the number and the dissociation constants of GABA(A) receptors in the hippocampus between control and bilobalide-treated mice. These results suggest that the anticonvulsant effect of bilobalide is due to elevation of GABA levels, possibly through potentiation of glutamic acid decarboxylase activity and enhancement of the protein amount of 67 kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase by bilobalide.",
