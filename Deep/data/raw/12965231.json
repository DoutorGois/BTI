     "AB": "SIB-1553A ((+/-)-4-[2-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)ethyl]thiophenol HCl) is a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) ligand which is active in rodent and primate models of cognition. In functional assays, SIB-1553A exhibits marked subtype selectivity for nAChRs as compared to nicotine. In addition SIB-1553A also exhibits affinities to histaminergic (H3) and serotonergic (5-HT1 and 5HT2) receptors and sigma binding sites. In the present investigation, we characterized SIB-1553A-induced neurotransmitter release in vivo. Following subcutaneous injection (s.c., 10 mg/kg), SIB-1553A rapidly entered the brain achieving concentration of approximately 20 microM 15 min post-injection and was eliminated from plasma with a terminal half-life of approximately 32 min. In freely moving rats, SIB-1553A (1-40 mg/kg, s.c.), markedly increased ACh release in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In both regions, the magnitude of SIB-1553A-induced ACh release was greater than that seen with the prototypical nAChR agonist, nicotine (0.4 mg/kg, s.c.). Both isomers of SIB-1553A induced similar levels of increase in hippocampal ACh release. Increased hippocampal ACh release was also observed following oral administration of SIB-1553A (40 mg/kg) or after local perfusion into the hippocampus (1 mM). SIB-1553A-induced hippocampal ACh release was significantly attenuated by two nAChR antagonists, mecamylamine (MEC) and dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE), and by the dopamine (DA) (D1) antagonist, SCH-23390, arguing that ACh release, in part, involves activation of nAChRs and a permissive DA synapse. In contrast to its robust effects on ACh release, SIB-1553A (40 mg/kg, s.c.) modestly increased striatal DA release (approximately 180% of baseline). Due to the proposed role of cholinergic pathways in learning and memory, the neurochemical profile of SIB-1553A suggests a potential for it to treat cognitive dysfunction.",
