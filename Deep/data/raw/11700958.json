     "AB": "In order to characterize the ontogenetic profile of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors coupled to phospholipase D (PLD) we examined the effects of selected mGlu agents on PLD activity in immature and adult rat hippocampus. The group I mGlu receptor agonist 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine stimulated PLD in immature tissue, but reduced the PLD response evoked by the nonselective mGlu receptor agonist (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylate [(1S,3R)-ACPD] in adult hippocampus. (2R,1'S,2'R,3'S)-2-(2'-Carboxy-3'-phenylcyclopropyl) glycine (PCCG-13), a recently characterized selective antagonist of PLD-coupled mGlu receptors, displayed a much greater activity in reducing the PLD response to (1S,3R)-ACPD in adult than in neonate hippocampus. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that glutamatergic activation of PLD in the rat hippocampus is developmentally regulated.",
