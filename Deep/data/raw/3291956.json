     "AB": "Chemical and morphological changes in cholinergic marker enzymes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) of striatum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex were studied following haloperidol treatment of rats. After short-term (7-21 days) haloperidol treatment, the levels of both enzymes (AChE and ChAT) were increased in striatum and hippocampus (greater than 25%), but not in cortex. After long-term (+40 days) haloperidol treatment, the level of AChE activity returned to control levels in all brain areas, whereas the levels of striatal and hippocampal ChAT decreased by 26% and 29%, respectively. No change in levels of both enzymes was detected after acute treatment (single dose) of haloperidol or chronic treatment with either clozapine or imipramine. Morphological analysis of cholinergic neurons and their processes using monoclonal antibody to ChAT showed two types of changes following 40 days of haloperidol treatment. First, parallel to the observed decrease in the levels of ChAT activity there was a visual decrease in the immunoreactivity in neurons as well as in their processes in striatum and hippocampus. Second, there was an apparent reduction in the size and number of stained neurons and their processes. No changes were seen in immunoreactivity after an acute treatment with haloperidol. These results indicate that the chronic haloperidol treatment in rats causes changes in central cholinergic systems that may be relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and its treatment.",
