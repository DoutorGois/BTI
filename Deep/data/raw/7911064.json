     "AB": "Systemic administration of the drug 1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl)-piperidine (1-BCP) has been reported to enhance monosynaptic responses in the hippocampus in vivo and to improve spatial and olfactory memory in rats. The drug's mechanism of action was investigated in the present study using membrane patches excised from cultured hippocampal slices. The decay time of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor mediated inward currents was greatly increased by 1-BCP in a concentration dependent and reversible fashion; peak current was also enhanced but to a lesser degree. In vitro slice experiments indicated that the drug has parallel effects on the field EPSP. It is concluded that 1-BCP is a centrally active modulator of the AMPA receptor.",
