     "AB": "The Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger gene, NCX1, is widely expressed in many tissues, encoding several isoforms through alternative RNA splicing. NCX1 deficient mice are known to be lethal at embryonic day 9-10 (E9-10). However, its expression pattern during embryogenesis is largely unknown. Therefore, to identify and compare the localization and alternatively spliced isoforms of NCX1 mRNA expressed in the developmental stages, we analyzed the mouse embryo. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that NCX1 mRNA was expressed from the earliest stage examined, E7. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that NCX1 mRNA was expressed in the heart alone until E10.5. However, at E14.5 and 16.5, NCX1 mRNA was expressed not only in the heart, but also in neuronal cells. In addition, the expression of NCX1 mRNA in the adult brain was most abundant in the hippocampus. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we also identified the alternatively spliced isoforms expressed during each developmental stage. The restricted expression of the NCX1 gene suggested that NCX1 may play an important role in the developing mouse embryo.",
