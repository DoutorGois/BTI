     "AB": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based differential display was used to screen for alterations in gene expression in the mesolimbic system of the human alcoholic brain. Total RNA was extracted from the nucleus accumbens of five alcoholic and five control brains. A selected subpopulation of mRNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA and amplified by PCR. A differentially expressed cDNA fragment was recovered, cloned, and sequenced. Full sequence analysis of this 467 bp fragment revealed 98.2% homology with the human mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. Dot-blot analysis showed increased expression of this gene in nucleus accumbens and hippocampus, but not in the superior frontal cortex, primary motor cortex, caudate, and pallidus/putamen in a total of eight human alcoholic brains, compared with seven control brains. A similar increased expression was observed by dot-blot analysis, using RNA from the cerebral cortex of rats chronically treated with alcohol vapor. Hybridization of a 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probe indicated that the expression of both rRNAs genes was significantly increased in nucleus accumbens. These results indicate that chronic alcohol consumption induces alteration in expression of mitochondrial genes in selected brain regions. The altered gene expression may reflect mitochondrial dysfunction in the alcohol-affected brain.",
