     "AB": "The effect of central microinjections of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) on muricide behavior was investigated in rats with chronically implanted cannulas into one of the limbic structures: the amygdala, the hippocampus or the nucleus accumbens. The rats were made aggressive by p-chlorophenylalanine administration. Saline injection did not inhibit muricide, whereas TRH (10 micrograms in 0.5 microliter per side) significantly suppressed mouse-killing reaction upon injection into each of three regions. It is suggested that the observed antiaggressive effect of TRH may involve stimulation of the central noradrenergic and/or serotonergic transmission.",
