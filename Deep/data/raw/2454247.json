     "AB": "The pattern of direct connections between the amygdala and the hippocampal formation in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) was delineated by using both anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing techniques. From the amygdala the accessory basal, medial basal, and the cortical nuclei and the cortical amygdaloid transition area send projections to the hippocampal formation. The efferents from the magnocellular part of the accessory basal nucleus and the cortical nuclei terminate in the molecular layer of subfields CA3, CA2, and CA1', and to a lesser extent in the molecular layer and the superficial part of the pyramidal cell layers of the prosubiculum. In contrast, the projections from the medial basal nucleus and the cortical amygdaloid transition area terminate in the molecular layer and the superficial part of the pyramidal cell layers of the prosubiculum only. From the hippocampal formation, subfield CA1' and the prosubiculum send efferents that terminate in the medial basal nucleus, the cortical transition area, and the ventral part of the cortical nuclei. In addition, the CA1' subfield projects to the ventral, parvicellular part of the accessory basal nucleus. The present data emphasize an important role for the prosubiculum and the CA1' subfield in medial temporal lobe area connections. Both regions, in addition to supporting direct connections between the amygdala and the hippocampal formation, also have extensive connections with the entorhinal cortex. As for the amygdala, the accessory basal nucleus sends efferents to both the hippocampal formation and the entorhinal cortex. The data demonstrate an anatomical means by which the amygdala, hippocampal formation, and the entorhinal cortex may interact. It is proposed that these connections may be important in the limbic memory system.",
