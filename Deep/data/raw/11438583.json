     "AB": "Chronic activity blockade increases synaptic levels of NMDA receptor immunoreactivity in hippocampal neurons. We show here that blockade-induced synaptic NMDA receptors are functional and mediate enhanced excitotoxicity in response to synaptically released glutamate. Activity blockade increased the cell surface association of NMDA receptors. Blockade-induced synaptic targeting of NMDA receptors did not require protein synthesis but required phosphorylation and specifically cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Furthermore, activation of PKA was sufficient to induce synaptic targeting of NMDA receptors regardless of receptor activity status. These results implicate PKA activity downstream of receptor blockade as a mediator of enhanced synaptic transport or stabilization of NMDA receptors. Synaptic clustering of NR1-green fluorescent protein was observed in living neurons in response to NMDA receptor and cAMP phosphodiesterase antagonists and occurred gradually over the course of a day. This pathway represents a cellular mechanism for synaptic homeostasis and is likely to function in metaplasticity, long-term regulation of the ability of a synapse to undergo potentiation or depression.",
