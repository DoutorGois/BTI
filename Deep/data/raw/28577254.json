     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To validate the value of whole-brain computed tomography perfusion (CTP) and CT angiography (CTA) in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Whole-brain CTP and four-dimensional CT angiography (4D-CTA) images were acquired in 30 MCI, 35 mild AD patients, 35 moderate AD patients, 30 severe AD patients and 50 normal controls (NC). Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), time to peak (TTP), and correlation between CTP and 4D-CTA were analysed. RESULTS: Elevated CBF in the left frontal and temporal cortex was found in MCI compared with the NC group. However, TTP was increased in the left hippocampus in mild AD patients compared with NC. In moderate and severe AD patients, hypoperfusion was found in multiple brain areas compared with NC. Finally, we found that the extent of arterial stenosis was negatively correlated with CBF in partial cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and positively correlated with TTP in these areas of AD and MCI patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that whole-brain CTP and 4D-CTA could serve as a diagnostic modality in distinguishing MCI and AD, and predicting conversion from MCI based on TTP of left hippocampus. KEY POINTS: * Whole-brain perfusion using the full 160-mm width of 320 detector rows * Provide clinical experience of 320-row CT in cerebrovascular disorders of Alzheimer's disease * Initial combined 4D CTA-CTP data analysed perfusion and correlated with CT angiography * Whole-brain CTP and 4D-CTA have high value for monitoring MCI to AD progression * TTP in the left hippocampus may predict the transition from MCI to AD.",
