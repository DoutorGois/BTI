     "AB": "Granule cell lesions cause an increase in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. The source of this response was examined by combining granule cell lesions with lesions of the fornix-fimbria, thereby removing the cholinergic input from the septum to the hippocampus. The increased AChE staining was present in animals with granule cell lesions regardless of whether the fornix was lesioned or intact. The increase in AChE staining occurred without a corresponding increase in choline acetyltransferase staining. These findings suggest that an AChE-positive, but non-cholinergic, sprouting response occurred within the dentate gyrus following selective lesions of the granule cells. The source of this sprouting may be from AChE-positive hilar interneurons.",
