     "AB": "The cerebral accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) is one of the key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is also found in bodily fluids such as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. However, the significance of Abeta accumulation in the brain and different bodily pools, as well as its correlation with aging and cerebral amyloid pathology, is not completely understood. To better understand this question, we selected the rhesus monkey, which is phylogenetically and physiologically highly similar to the human, as a model to study. We quantified the levels of the two main Abeta isoforms (Abeta42 and Abeta40) in different sections of the brain (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and hippocampus) and bodily fluids (CSF and plasma) of rhesus monkeys at different developmental phases (young, 5-9 years of age; mature, 10-19 years of age; and old, 21-24 years of age). We found that the levels of neuronal and insoluble Abeta42 increased significantly in the brain with aging, suggesting that this specific isoform might be directly involved in aging and AD-like pathophysiology. There was no significant change in the Abeta40 level in the brain with aging. In addition, the Abeta42 level, but not the Abeta40 level, in both the CSF and plasma increased with aging. We also identified a positive correlation between Abeta42 in the CSF and plasma and Abeta42 in the brain. Taken collectively, our results indicate that there is an association between Abeta accumulation and age. These results support the increased incidence of AD with aging.",
