     "AB": "A specific, rapid and sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for simultaneous determination of vinpocetine (VP) and its active metabolite, apovincaminic acid (AVA) in rat brain regions, such as hypothalamus, striatum, cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. Phenacetin was used as internal standard (IS). Brain tissue samples were precipitated protein by using 500 muL methanol. The separation was achieved on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 mum), using a methanol-water gradient elution at the flow rate of 0.20 mL/min. The detection was performed on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode via positive electrospray ionization source (ESI). The quantification was operated using the transitions of m/z 351 --> m/z 280 for VP, m/z 323 --> m/z 280 for AVA and m/z 180 --> m/z 110 for IS, respectively. The calibration curve was linear in concentration range from 0.100 to 60.0 ng/mL for VP and 0.103 to 6.18 ng/mL for AVA. The intra-day and inter-day precision (relative standard deviation, RSD) values were within 11.8%, the accuracy (relative error, RE) was from -1.7% to 3.0% for VP and 2.7% to 9.5% for AVA at all the three concentration levels of quality-control (QC) samples. The improved UPLC-MS/MS method was specific, rapid and sensitive, which was further successfully applied to simultaneous determination of VP and AVA in different rat brain regions after intragastric administration of 4 mg/kg VP. It was indicated that VP could be eliminated quickly in brain, while the elimination of AVA was slow and it could be maintained for more than 12 h in brain. Moreover, it was found that the contents of VP and AVA were much higher in the hypothalamus, striatum and cortex than those in the cerebellum and hippocampus, which verified the distribution characteristics of VP and AVA in different brain regions from the point of quantitation in rats.",
