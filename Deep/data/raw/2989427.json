     "AB": "Receptors for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the rat brain and the pituitary are heterogenous. The receptors were classified into four types according to the dissociation constant (KD). High-affinity receptors (KD less than 3 nM) are present in the pituitary, hypothalamus, amygdala, and limbic forebrain which contains the nucleus accumbens and the septum. Intermediate-affinity receptors (KD, 5-16 nM) are evidently present in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, and the brainstem, but may also be present in other regions. Low-affinity TRH receptors (KD, 50-80 nM) are seen in the limbic forebrain, amygdala, and the hypothalamus. Very-low-affinity receptors (KD, 215 nM) exist in the pituitary. Experiments using DN-1417 (gamma-butyrolactone-gamma-carbonyl-histidyl-prolinamide citrate), a synthetic TRH analogue with a more potent central activity, indicated the presence of TRH receptors having a high affinity to DN-1417 at least in the limbic forebrain but not in the pituitary. This type of receptor is not labeled by [3H](3-methyl-histidine2)-TRH. Density of the TRH receptor is the highest in the pituitary and next highest in the amygdala.",
