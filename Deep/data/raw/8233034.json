     "AB": "We investigated the binding of [3H]AH5183 (2-(4-phenylpiperidino)cyclohexanol) to rat brain synaptosomes and subcellular fractions. A high content of specific binding was observed in crude synaptosomes obtained from the striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The highest density of subcellular binding sites was observed in the synaptic vesicle-rich fraction. The affinities of AH5183 binding to crude synaptosomes and the synaptic vesicle-rich fraction were almost equivalent, but the density of binding sites was higher in the synaptic vesicle fraction. The present findings indicate that [3H]AH5183 binding to both synaptosomes and the synaptic vesicle-rich fraction is useful as a cholinergic marker, and that for quantitative studies, binding to the latter fraction is more preferable.",
