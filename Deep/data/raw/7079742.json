     "AB": "Volumetric estimates of the total number of granule cells in rats 30, 120, 200, and 365 days old increase linearly by approximately 35 to 43 percent between 1 month and 1 year. Total volume of the granular layer also grows linearly during that time. These results demonstrate a numerical increase in a neuronal population during adulthood in the mammalian brain.",
