     "AB": "Maple Syrup Urine Disease is an inborn error of metabolism caused by severe deficiency in the activity of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. Neurological disorder is common in patients with maple syrup urine disease. Although leucine is considered the main toxic metabolite, the mechanisms underlying the neuropathology of brain injury are poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated the possible preventive effect of the co-administration of creatine plus pyruvate on the effects elicited by leucine administration to female Wistar rats during pregnancy and lactation on some oxidative stress parameters as well as the activities of some enzymes involved in the phosphoryltransfer network in the brain cortex and hippocampus of the offspring at 21 days of age. Leucine administration induced oxidative stress and altered the activities of pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase, mitochondrial and cytosolic creatine kinase. Co-administration of creatine plus pyruvate was partially effective in the prevention of some alterations provoked by leucine administration on the oxidative stress but not in the enzymes of phosphoryltransfer network. These results suggest that non-treated maternal hyperleucinemia may be toxic to the brain of the offspring.",
