     "AB": "The slow Ca2+-activated K+ current, sIAHP, underlying spike frequency adaptation, was recorded with the whole cell patch-clamp technique in CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices. Inhibitors of serine/threonine protein phosphatases (microcystin, calyculin A, cantharidic acid) caused a gradual decrease of sIAHP amplitude, suggesting the presence of a basal phosphorylation-dephosphorylation turnover regulating sIAHP. Because selective calcineurin (PP-2B) inhibitors did not affect the amplitude of sIAHP, protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1) or 2A (PP-2A) are most likely involved in the basal regulation of this current. The ATP analogue, ATP-gamma-S, caused a gradual decrease in the sIAHP amplitude, supporting a role of protein phosphorylation in the basal modulation of sIAHP. When the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer (Rp-cAMPS) was coapplied with the phosphatase inhibitor microcystin, it prevented the decrease in the sIAHP amplitude that was observed when microcystin alone was applied. Furthermore, inhibition of PKA by Rp-cAMPS led to an increase in the sIAHP amplitude. Finally, an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (SQ22, 536) and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-specific type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Ro 20-1724 and rolipram) led to an increase or a decrease in the sIAHP amplitude, respectively. These findings suggest that a balance between basally active PKA and a phosphatase (PP-1 or PP-2A) is responsible for the tonic modulation of sIAHP, resulting in a continuous modulation of excitability and firing properties of hippocampal pyramidal neurons.",
