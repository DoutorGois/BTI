     "AB": "PURPOSE: Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often present mood disturbances, which may either exacerbate or remit following surgery. The objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between post-operative depressive/anxiety symptoms and hippocampal/amygdala volumes following anterior temporal lobectomy. METHODS: Thirty-five patients operated for TLE were assessed for mood disturbances by the Beck depression inventory (BDI) and Beck anxiety inventory (BAI). Post-operative MRI data were collected and volumetric analysis of the hippocampi (HV) and amygdala (AV) was performed. Correlations between volumetric data, measures of mood, and demographic and clinical data were calculated. RESULTS: BDI scores significantly correlated with the intact HV (p=0.029) as well as the absolute difference between the intact and remnant HV (p=0.021). This was evident in left-side resections (p=0.049); in right-side resections the correlation was marginally non- significant (p=0.057). Depressed patients also had smaller remnant AV (p=0.002). Furthermore, BAI was negatively correlated with the HV remnant in left-side resections (p=0.038). No other significant associations between post-operative mood disturbances and various demographic and clinical variables were observed. CONCLUSION: The severity of depressive symptomatology in operated epilepsy patients correlates with the extent of hippocampal and amygdala resection; this association appears to be more evident in left-side resections.",
