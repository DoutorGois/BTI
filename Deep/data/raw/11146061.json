     "AB": "Brain ischemia provoked by stroke or traumatic brain injury induces a massive increase in neurotransmitter release, in particular of the excitotoxin glutamate. Glutamate triggers a cascade of events finally leading to widespread neuronal cell damage and death. The aminomethylchroman derivative BAY x 3702 is a novel neuroprotectant which shows pronounced beneficial effects in various animal models of ischemic brain injury. As shown previously BAY x 3702 binds to 5-HT(1A) receptors of different species in subnanomolar range and is characterized as a full receptor agonist. In this study we investigated the influence of BAY x 3702 on potassium-evoked glutamate release in vitro and ischemia-induced glutamate release in vivo. In rat hippocampal slices BAY x 3702 inhibited evoked glutamate release in a dose-dependent manner (IC(50)=1 microM). This effect was blocked by the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY 100635, indicating that BAY x 3702 specifically acts via 5-HT(1A) receptors. In vivo, release of endogenous aspartate and glutamate was measured in the cortex of rats by microdialysis before and after onset of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. Single dose administration of BAY x 3702 (1 microg/kg or 10 microg/kg i.v.) immediately after occlusion reduced the increase and total release of extracellular glutamate by about 50% compared to non-treated animals, whereas the extracellular aspartate levels were not significantly affected. Inhibition of glutamate release may therefore contribute to the pronounced neuroprotective efficacy of BAY x 3702 in various animal models of ischemic brain damage.",
