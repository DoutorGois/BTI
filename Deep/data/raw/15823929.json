     "AB": "Male Wistar rats were trained in an eight-arm radial maze task (two sessions per day, delayed-non-matching-to-sample) that included an intramaze static magnetic field \"cue\" (185 microT) specific to the entrance point of one of the arms. Rats were exposed daily for 60 min to a complex magnetic field waveform (theta-burst pattern, 200-500 nT), presented with several different interstimulus intervals (ISIs), either immediately following training sessions or immediately preceding testing sessions. Application of the theta-burst stimulus with a 4000 ms ISI significantly improved the rats' memory for the arm of the radial maze whose position was indicated by the presence of a static magnetic field cue. Reference memory errors were homogeneously distributed among all eight arms of the maze for sham-exposed rats, and among the other seven arms of the maze for complex magnetic field-treated rats. These results suggest that static magnetic field cues may be salient orienting cues even in a microenvironment such as a radial maze, but their use as a cue during maze learning in rats is dependent on whole-body application of a specific time-varying complex magnetic field.",
