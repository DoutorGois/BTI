     "AB": "Antagonism of the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) has been reported to have anti-depressant-like properties. The dynorphin/KOR system is a crucial neurochemical substrate underlying the pathologies of addictive diseases, affective disorders and other disease states. However, the molecular underpinnings and neuroanatomical localization of the dysregulation of this system have not yet been fully elucidated. Utilizing the Porsolt Forced Swim Test (FST), an acute stressor commonly used as in rodent models measuring antidepressant efficacy, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subject to forced swimming for 15 min, treated 1h with vehicle or norbinaltorphimine (nor-BNI) (5 or 10mg/kg), and then 1 day later subject to FST for 5 min. In accordance with previous findings, nor-BNI dose dependently increased climbing time and reduced immobility. In comparison to control animals not exposed to FST, we observed a significant elevation in prodynorphin (pDyn) mRNA levels following FST using real-time optical polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the caudate putamen but not in the nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, amygdala, frontal cortex, or hippocampus. nor-BNI treatment did not affect pDyn mRNA levels in comparison to animals that received vehicle. The corresponding brain regions from the opposite hemisphere were analyzed for underlying chromatin modifications of the prodynorphin gene promoter region using chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies against specifically methylated histones H3K27Me2, H3K27Me3, H3K4Me2, and H3K4Me3, as well as CREB-1 and MeCP2. Significant alterations in proteins bound to DNA in the Cre-3, Cre-4, and Sp1 regions of the prodynorphin promoter were found in the caudate putamen of the FST saline-treated animals compared to control animals, with no changes observed in the hippocampus. Epigenetic changes resulting in elevated dynorphin levels specifically in the caudate putamen may in part underlie the enduring effects of stress.",
