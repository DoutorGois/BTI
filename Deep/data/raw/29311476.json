     "AB": "Appropriate axonal pathfinding is a necessary step for the function of neuronal circuits. The mossy fibers (MFs) in the hippocampus of CaMKIIalpha heterozygous knockout (CaMKIIalpha-hKO) psychiatric model mice project onto not only the stratum lucidum but also the stratum oriens region in the CA3, which is a projection pattern distinct from that in normal mice. Thus, we examined the electrophysiological properties of the MF-CA3 connection in this mutant mouse on field recordings and found a lower synaptic connection. This study suggested that the phenotype of abnormal MF pathfindings could induce aberrant neuronal functions, which may link to cognition and memory.",
