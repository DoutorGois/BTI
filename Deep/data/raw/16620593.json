     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To identify the effects of NMDA receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B expression in rat's hippocampus after exposure to 1800 MHz radiofrequency radiation. METHODS: Four-week old female Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups, with 12 animals for each. The subjects in two experimental groups had been continuously exposed to 1800 MHz microwave radiation (CW) with respective power density of 0.5 mW/cm(2) and 1.0 mW/cm(2) 12 hours each day for 21 days. Meanwhile, sham-controls were carried out. The brain tissue sections were performed by immunohistochemistry to demonstrate both expressions of NR2A, NR2B immune-activity in the hippocampal CA1, CA3 and DG by using computer-assisted image analysis system. RESULTS: In NR2A: the expression of 0.5 mW/cm(2) power density group was significantly lower than 0 mW/cm(2) power density group in CA3 [(8.5 +/- 1.5) vs (11.1 +/- 1.8), P < 0.01] and had not been significantly changed in CA1 and DG. The expression of 1.0 mW/cm(2) power density group was significantly lower than 0 mW/cm(2) power density group in CA1 and CA3 [(7.9 +/- 1.6) vs (9.7 +/- 1.5); (8.4 +/- 1.7) vs (11.1 +/- 1.8), respective P < 0.05, P < 0.01] and had not been significantly changed in DG. In NR2B: the expression of 0.5 mW/cm(2) power density group was significantly lower than 0 mW/cm(2) power density group in CA1 and CA3 [(16.4 +/- 1.0) vs (17.8 +/- 1.6); (9.6 +/- 1.9) vs (11.2 +/- 2.1), respective P < 0.05]. The expression of 1.0 mW/cm(2) power density group was significantly lower than 0 mW/cm(2) power density group in CA1, CA3 and DG [(13.1 +/- 2.4) vs (17.8 +/- 1.6); (9.3 +/- 1.4) vs (11.2 +/- 2.1); (7.3 +/- 0.1) vs (8.5 +/- 1.0), respective P < 0.01, P < 0.05, P < 0.05]. CONCLUSION: There were findings of the effects on NMDA receptor subunits in different hippocampus sections after exposure to 1800 MHz radiofrequency radiation.",
