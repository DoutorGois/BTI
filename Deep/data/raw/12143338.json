     "AB": "The human genome project is a milestone for molecular genetic studies on complex, sporadic disorders in the human central nervous system (CNS). Functional analysis and tissue-/cell-specific expression profiles will be of particular importance anticipating the magnitude of expressed genes in the brain and their dynamic epigenetic modifications. The recent progress in microarray technologies allows expression studies for a large number of genes. In combination with laser-microdissection and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technologies, such large-scale expression analyses can be successfully addressed in well-defined tissue specimens or cellular subpopulations. Complex, sporadic diseases, such as temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), are challenging for functional genomics. Issues of particular importance in this field include molecular mechanisms of neurodevelopmental abnormalities, neuronal plasticity and hyperexcitability as well as neuronal cell damage in affected CNS areas. The availability of anatomically well-preserved surgical specimens, i.e. hippocampus obtained from epilepsy patients with Ammon's horn sclerosis or focal lesions not affecting the hippocampus proper as well as comparisons with experimental TLE models may help to elucidate specific molecular-pathological mechanisms during epileptogenesis and in chronic conditions of the disease.",
