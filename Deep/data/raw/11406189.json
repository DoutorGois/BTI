     "AB": "The present study describes the pharmacological activity of two novel positive allosteric modulators at AMPA receptors in acutely isolated rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons and cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Currents elicited by application of glutamate (100 microM) to isolated cerebellar Purkinje neurons were potentiated by LY392098, LY404187, cyclothiazide, CX516 and aniracetam. The rank order of potency was LY404187> LY392098> cyclothiazide > CX516> aniracetam. LY392098 displayed a higher maximal efficacy than the other compounds examined. AMPA-activated inward currents in cultured rat hippocampal neurons were potentiated by LY392098, LY404187 and cyclothiazide in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner although considerable heterogeneity in the magnitude of response from cell to cell was observed. LY392098 was ineffective in potentiating AMPA receptor responses when dialyzed via the intracellular solution. The selectivity profiles of the two novel AMPA receptor potentiators were examined. LY392098 or LY404187 had minimal activity on NMDA receptor responses, on voltage-gated calcium channel currents in cultured hippocampal neurons and on GluR5 kainate receptor currents in acutely isolated rat dorsal root ganglion neurons.",
