     "AB": "p38MAPK has been implicated in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and apoptosis in vitro. To understand its role in neurodegeneration, we determined the time course and localization of the dually phosphorylated active form of p38MAPK in hippocampus after global forebrain ischemia. Phosphorylated p38MAPK and mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein 2 activity increased over 4 days after ischemia. Phosphorylated p38MAPK immunoreactivity was observed in microglia in regions adjacent to, but not in, the dying CA1 neurons. In contrast, neither c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 nor p42/p44MAPK activity was altered after ischemia. These results provide the first evidence for localization of activated p38MAPK in the CNS and support a role for p38MAPK in the microglial response to stress.",
