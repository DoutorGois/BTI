     "AB": "Temporopolar cortex (TP) can be subdivided into agranular, dysgranular, and granular components. The telencephalic input into the temporopolar cortex arises from the orbitofrontal and medial frontal regions, modality-specific visual and auditory association areas, paralimbic regions, the piriform olfactory cortex, the hippocampus, the amygdala, the claustrum, and the basal forebrain. Afferents from limbic and paralimbic regions are directed mostly to the agranular and dysgranular sectors of the temporal pole, whereas afferents from isocortical association areas are distributed predominantly within the granular sector. The temporopolar cortex provides a site for the potential convergence of sensory and limbic inputs. Auditory inputs predominate in the dorsolateral part of the temporopolar cortex whereas visual inputs become prominent only in the ventral portions of this region. Olfactory inputs are directed mostly to the medial parts of the temporal pole. These medial parts also receive more extensive projections from the amygdaloid nuclei.",
