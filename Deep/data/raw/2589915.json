     "AB": "By using fluorescence microscopy and microfluorimetric techniques, the effects of ageing and of 11 months acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) treatment on lipofuscin deposition within the cytoplasm of pyramidal neurons of rat prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (CA3 field) were assessed. No lipofuscin autofluorescence was observed in the nerve cell bodies of neurons under study in young rats (3 months of age), but lipopigment had accumulated in the same nerve cells of senescent rats (22 months of age). ALCAR administration significantly reduced the accumulation of lipofuscin within pyramidal neurons of the brain areas examined.",
