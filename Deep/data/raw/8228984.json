     "AB": "The mRNA levels of secretogranin II, chromogranin B, and VGF were compared in brains of control and AF64A-treated rats. This toxin induces specific lesions of the septohippocampal cholinergic pathway. As a consequence of this treatment, the chromogranin B message was elevated in the dentate gyrus granule cells of the hippocampus. In the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, a concomitant elevation of the messages of secretogranin II and corticotropin-releasing factor occurred in the parvocellular neurons, and an increase of those of secretogranin II and VGF occurred in a subgroup of magnocellular neurons. Further increases for secretogranin II were seen in the amygdaloid nuclei and the reticular thalamic nuclei and increases for chromogranin B in the temporal cortex, substantia nigra compacta, and ventral tegmental area. These results indicate that the toxin-induced lesion of the cholinergic pathway innervating the hippocampus apparently leads to the stimulation of several defined groups of neurons that react with an increase in the mRNA levels of their secretory peptides. We suggest that changes in mRNA expression of these peptides are useful parameters for defining neurons under chronic stimulation.",
