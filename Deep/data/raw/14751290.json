     "AB": "We have recently identified a third subtype of glutamate vesicular transporter (VGLUT) named VGLUT3. In the present study, we provide a detailed account of the regional and cellular distributions of VGLUT3 in the rat brain, using specific nucleotide probes and antisera. The distribution of VGLUT3 protein was compared with that of the other vesicular transporters (VGLUT1 and VGLUT2). All the areas expressing VGLUT3 also contain high levels of VGLUT1 and -2 proteins, but, at a finer level of analysis, the distribution of the three subtypes differs. Unlike VGLUT1 and -2, VGLUT3 expression is limited to discrete cell populations. Neurons containing VGLUT3 transcript are essentially observed in the caudate-putamen, the olfactory tubercle, the nucleus accumbens, the hippocampus, the interpeduncular nucleus and the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei. More scattered populations of VGLUT3 expressing neurons are found in the cerebral cortex. The distribution of the VGLUT3 protein, as determined with specific antisera, overlaps with that of the transcript in the caudate-putamen, olfactory tubercles, hippocampus, cortex, interpeduncular nucleus, and raphe nuclei, suggesting that VGLUT3 is essentially present in local projection neurons in these regions. Microscopic examination reveals staining of terminals and perikarya. Furthermore, co-localization studies indicate that VGLUT3 is present in GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus, as well as in the interpeduncular nucleus. However, other regions, such as the substantia nigra (pars compacta), the ventral tegmental area, and the parabigeminal nucleus, receive a dense VGLUT3 terminal labeling although they do not contain VGLUT3 expressing neurons. In these regions, VGLUT3 immunoreactivity may be present in terminals of long projecting neurons. This subclass of glutamatergic afferents differs from other \"classical\" excitatory terminals that express VGLUT1 or VGLUT2. The distribution of VGLUT3 in the rat brain suggests an unsuspected function of vesicular glutamate transport in subsets of interneurons and in neuromodulatory neurons.",
