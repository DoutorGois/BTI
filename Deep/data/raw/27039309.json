     "AB": "Realgar, a type of mineral drug-containing arsenic, exhibits neurotoxicity. Brain glutathione (GSH) is crucial to protect the nervous system and to resist arsenic toxicity. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to explore the neurotoxic mechanisms of realgar and the protective effects of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) by observing the effects of GA on the hippocampal GSH biosynthetic pathway after exposure to realgar. Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were randomly divided into five groups: a control group, a GA control group, a realgar alone group, a low-dose GA intervention group, and a high-dose GA intervention group. Cognitive ability was tested using an object recognition task (ORT). The ultrastructures of the hippocampal neurons and synapses were observed. mRNA and protein levels of EAAT1, EAAT2, EAAT3, xCT, Nrf2, HO-1, gamma-GCS (GCLC, GCLM), and MRP-1 were measured, as was the cellular localization of EAAT3, xCT, MRP-1, and Nrf2. The levels of GSH in the hippocampus, the levels of glutamate (Glu) and cysteine (Cys) in the extracellular fluid of hippocampal CA1 region, and the levels of active sulfur in the brain were also investigated. The results indicate that realgar lowered hippocampal GSH levels, resulting in ultrastructural changes in hippocampal neurons and synapses and deficiencies in cognitive ability, ultimately inducing neurotoxicity. GA could trigger the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, EAAT1, EAAT2, EAAT3, xCT, MRP-1, GCLC, and GCLM. Additionally, the expression of gamma-GT and the supply levels of Glu and Cys increased, ultimately causing a significant increase in hippocampal GSH to alleviate realgar-induced neurotoxicity. In conclusion, the findings from our study indicate that GA can antagonize decreased brain GSH levels induced by realgar and can lessen the neurotoxicity of realgar.",
