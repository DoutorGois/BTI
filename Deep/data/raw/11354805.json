     "AB": "The technique for synchronous electrophysiological recording from multiple single cells has been widely applied, but there is still a shortage of suitable data acquisition and analysis systems to fit electrophysiological equipment made in China or Japan. Recently we have developed an acquisition and analysis system for multiple-channel electrophysiological recording. In this paper, we present the pivotal technique of the system and some examples of applications.",
