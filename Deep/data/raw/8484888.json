     "AB": "According to configural association (CAS) theory (Sutherland & Rudy, 1989), an intact hippocampus is required for rats to solve learning problems that are based on \"configural\" processes. This theory identifies the negative patterning discrimination as a critical example of this type of problem. Rudy and Sutherland (1989) reported disruption of negative patterning following hippocampal formation damage produced by intracranial infusion of a mixture of kainic acid + colchicine (KA + COL). We assessed acquisition of negative patterning in rats with hippocampal damage produced by KA + COL compared with rats with more selective ibotenate lesions of hippocampus. Neither group showed impaired negative patterning relative to controls. A transfer test provided evidence that all groups used configural processes to solve the problem. Thus contrary to CAS theory, the hippocampus is not an important substrate for the operation of configural processes.",
