     "AB": "The effects of severe hypoglycemia on perforant path-evoked field potentials were examined in the rat hippocampus. Although a complete loss of this response was noted when blood glucose concentration fell below 1 mM, this occurred before cessation of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. Both spontaneous and evoked responses recovered partially following glucose readministration. D-2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate, an NMDA-sensitive acidic amino acid receptor antagonist, facilitated this recovery from the hypoglycemic challenge when administered via a dialysis probe.",
