     "AB": "Protein kinase C (PKC) activation stimulates release of secreted amyloid precursor protein (APPs) in several cell lines. To ascertain the role of PKC in regulating APP metabolism in vivo, we used an animal model (methylazoxymethanol-treated rats; MAM rats) in which PKC is permanently hyperactivated in selected brain areas, i.e., cortex and hippocampus. A significant decrease in membrane-bound APP concentration was found in synaptosomes derived from cortex and hippocampus of MAM rats, where PKC is up-regulated, with a concomitant increase in APPs production in soluble fractions of the same brain areas. In contrast, in a brain area not affected by MAM treatment (i.e., cerebellum), APP secretion is similar in control and MAM rats, indicating that altered metabolism of APP is restricted to only those areas in which the PKC system is up-regulated. In addition, phorbol esters or H-7 modulate APPs release in hippocampal slices from both control and MAM rats, further supporting an in vivo role for this enzyme in regulating metabolism of mature APP.",
