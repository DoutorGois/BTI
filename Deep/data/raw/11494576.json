     "AB": "To evaluate brain dysfunction in autism, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was performed for 29 autistic patients (5-15 y.o.) and 19 normal children (6-14 y.o.). We obtained magnetic resonance (MR) spectra of the left and right amygdaloid-hippocampal regions and the left cerebellar hemisphere with a STEAM sequence (TR = 5000 ms, TE = 18 ms). In addition to the evaluation of signal intensity ratios, the absolute concentration of three major metabolites (N-acetylaspartate [NAA], creatine/phosphocreatine [Cr] and choline-containing substances [Cho]) was quantified by an internal reference method using unsuppressed tissue water. Although no abnormal MR images were found in the three regions examined, the signal intensity and the concentration of NAA in the left amygdaloid-hippocampal region and the left cerebellar hemisphere were reduced significantly in autistic patients compared to normal children. We speculated that this decrease in NAA reflected neuronal loss, immaturity or hypofunction in these regions. The results of our study were in agreement with those of previous studies on autism, one by neuropathological methods and the other using a single photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc HMPAO. Disorders of the amygdaloid-hippocampal region and cerebellum are considered to play an important role in the characteristic cognitive and emotional dysfunction in autism. 1H-MRS is a valuable tool to clarify the pathophysiology of autism.",
