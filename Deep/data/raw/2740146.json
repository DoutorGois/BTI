     "AB": "One postulated final common pathway leading to neuronal death after hypoxic-ischemic insults is an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations. We examined the effect of pretreatment with flunarizine, a calcium channel antagonist known to pass the blood brain barrier, on the behavioral and histologic changes after an hypoxic-ischemic insult in the infant rat. The 21-d-old rats were subjected to unilateral carotid ligation, then to 2 h of hypoxia. They were pretreated with either flunarizine (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or with an equal volume of diluent. After 5 days of observation they were killed for histology. Acute behavioral abnormalities were observed in more controls than treatment animals, 52 vs 11% (p less than 0.002). Cerebral injury was almost entirely confined to the ligated side and was significantly worse in the control rats. Full thickness cortical infarction was noted in 56% of controls (n = 27) vs 4% of flunarizine-treated rats (n = 24), (p less than 0.001). Mean and maximum damage scores for all areas assessed including cortex, corpus striatum, thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus were improved markedly in treatment rats (p less than 0.005). These observations confirm that flunarizine, when given prophylactically, has a neuroprotective effect against hypoxic-ischemic injury in the developing brain.",
