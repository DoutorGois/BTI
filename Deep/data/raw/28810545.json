     "AB": "Studies have reported that electroacupuncture (EA) may reduce learning and memory impairment following cerebral ischemic injury. However, the precise mechanism of action remains unclear. In the present study, the attenuation of focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by EA in rats was investigated. EA at the Baihui (DU 20) and Shenting (DU 24) acupoints was demonstrated to significantly improve performance in the Morris water maze task, with shortened latency time and increased frequency of passing the platform. Molecular analysis revealed that EA activated the expression of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7nAChR) in the hippocampus. In addition, EA led to a decreased expression of the microglia/macrophage marker Iba1 and the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein in the hippocampus. EA treatment also led to decreased production of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta. Treatment with methyllycaconitine, an alpha7nAChR antagonist, attenuated the improvement of learning and memory following EA treatment and the inhibitory effects of EA on glial cell activation and inflammatory cytokine production. In conclusion, the findings of the present study demonstrate that EA is able to improve learning and memory function following cerebral ischemic injury via activation of alpha7nAChR, which significantly decreases the neuroinflammatory response.",
