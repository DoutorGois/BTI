The actions of diadenosine polyphosphates, diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), diadenosine pentaphosphate (Ap5A) and diadenosine hexaphosphate (Ap6A) in the nervous system have been reviewed. 2. In the peripheral nervous system, diadenosine polyphosphates bind to P2-purinergic receptors such as the P2Y in chromaffin cells and Torpedo synaptosomes, P2X in vas deferens and urinary bladder and also Torpedo synaptosomes and P2U in endothelial chromaffin cells. 3. In the central nervous system ApnA compounds can act through P2X-purinoceptors opening cation channels in nodose ganglion neurones. Diadenosine polyphosphates bind to a P2d-purinergic receptor in rat brain synaptic terminals and hippocampus, linked to protein kinase C (PKC) activation. 4. P4-purinoceptors are specific receptors for diadenosine polyphosphates, coupled to the Ca2+ influx, in the central synapses. This purinoceptor is not activated by ATP and synthetic analogs. The P4-purinoceptor could act as a positive modulator of the synaptic transmission, giving even more importance to diadenosine polyphosphates as neurotransmitters.",
