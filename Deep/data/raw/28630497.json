     "AB": "The present study aimed to assess whether our newly developed redox nanoparticle (RNP(N)) that has antioxidant potential decreases Abeta levels or prevents Abeta aggregation associated with oxidative stress. The transgenic Tg2576 Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice were used to investigate the effect of chronic ad libitum drinking of RNP(N) solution for 6 months, including memory and learning functions, antioxidant activity, and amyloid plaque aggregation. The results showed that RNP(N)-treated mice had significantly attenuated cognitive deficits of both spatial and non-spatial memories, reduced oxidative stress of lipid peroxide, and DNA oxidation. RNP(N) treatment increased the percent inhibition of superoxide anion and glutathione peroxidase activity, neuronal densities in the cortex and hippocampus, decreased Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42) and gamma (gamma)-secretase levels, and reduced Abeta plaque observed using immunohistochemistry analysis and thioflavin S staining. Our results suggest that RNP(N) may be a promising candidate for AD therapy because of its antioxidant properties and reduction in Abeta aggregation, thereby suppressing its adverse side effect.",
