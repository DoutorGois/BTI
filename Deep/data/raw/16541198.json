     "AB": "Both experimental and clinical studies suggests that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2. Hyperglycaemia leads to free radical generation and causes neural degeneration. In the present study we investigated the possible neuroprotective effect of mexiletine against streptozotocin-induced hyperglycaemia in the rat brain and spinal cord. 30 adult male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control, diabetic, and diabetic-mexiletine treated group. Diabetes mellitus was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg body weight). Mexiletine (50 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally every day for six weeks. After 6 weeks the brain, brain stem and cervical spinal cord of the rats were removed and the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord were dissected for biochemical analysis (the level of Malondialdehide [MDA], Nitric Oxide [NO], Reduced Glutathione [GSH], and Xanthine Oxidase [XO] activity). MDA, XO and NO levels in the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord of the diabetic group increased significantly, when compared with control and mexiletine groups (P < 0.05). GSH levels in the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord of the diabetic group decreased significantly when compared with control and mexiletine groups (P < 0.05). This study demonstrates that mexiletine protects the neuronal tissue against the diabetic oxidative damage.",
