     "AB": "The cellular elements responsible for the uptake of [3H]glycine into rat hippocampal slices were investigated. The diffuse laminar distribution of labelling observed under control conditions was greatly reduced seven days after intrahippocampal injection of a neurotoxic dose of quinolinic acid, suggesting a neuronal localization. Glycine was also taken up into glial cells, since dense clusters of silver grains were present on small sized cells throughout the hippocampus which were apparently increased in number after the lesion. The pattern of [3H]glycine uptake into rat cerebral cortex and cerebellar slices was also consistent with both neuronal and glial localization. These glycine transport sites may be strategically located to control excitatory neurotransmission mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate sub-type of glutamate receptors.",
