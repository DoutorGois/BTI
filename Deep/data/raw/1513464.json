     "AB": "Both the amygdala and the hippocampus are involved in the pathogenesis of a number of neurologic conditions, including temporal lobe epilepsy, postanoxic amnesia, and Alzheimer's disease. To enhance the investigation and management of patients with these disorders, we developed a protocol to measure the volumes of the amygdala and as much of the hippocampus as possible (approximately 90 to 95%) using high-resolution MRI. We present the anatomic basis of these two protocols and our results in normal control subjects. These volumetric studies of the amygdala may clarify the role of this structure in the pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy.",
