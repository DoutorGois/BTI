     "AB": "AIMS: We previously reported that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) function was impaired in vessels in the hippocampus in 3-month-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). In this study, we examined gene and protein expressions of P-glycoprotein, a representative efflux transporter of cerebral vessels, in the BBB-damaged hippocampal vessels of SHRSP and in the vessels of Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats as controls, to clarify roles of the efflux transporter in the BBB-damaged vessels. METHODS: The expression of P-glycoprotein in hippocampal and cortical samples was examined by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting and immunoelectron microscopic techniques. RESULTS: Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses revealed that the gene and protein expressions of P-glycoprotein were increased in the hippocampal samples of 3-month-old SHRSP compared with hippocampal samples of 3-month-old WKY rats or with cortical samples of SHRSP. The gene expression of P-glycoprotein was also increased in the hippocampal samples of 4-week-old SHRSP. Immunoelectron microscopic examination revealed that immunosignals of P-glycoprotein were seen in the luminal and ab-luminal cytoplasmic membranes of endothelial cells and the basal lamina, that the labelling density of P-glycoprotein in the vessel wall was higher in the hippocampus of 3-month-old SHRSP than in other groups and that the immunosignals of P-glycoprotein were occasionally co-located with those of albumin. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the expression of P-glycoprotein is increased in BBB-damaged hippocampal vessels in hypertensive SHRSP compared with those in WKY rats.",
