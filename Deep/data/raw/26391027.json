     "AB": "Several pathways involved in regulation of intracellular protein integrity are known as the protein quality control (PQC) system. Molecular chaperones as the main players are engaged in various aspects of PQC system. According to the importance of these proteins in cell survival, in the present study, we traced endoplasmic reticulum-specific markers and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)-associated factors as two main arms of PQC system in intra-hippocampal amyloid beta (Abeta)-injected rats during 10 days running. Data analysis from Western blot indicated that exposure to Abeta activates immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein (Bip) which is the upstream regulator of unfolded protein responses (UPR). Activation of UPR system eventually led to induction of pro-apoptotic factors like CHOP, calpain, and caspase-12. Moreover, our data revealed that protein disulfide isomerase activity dramatically decreased after Abeta injection, which could be attributed to the increased levels of nitric oxide. Besides, Abeta injection induced levels of 2 members of heat shock proteins (Hsp) 70 and 90. Elevated levels of Hsps family members are accompanied by increased levels of lysosome-associated membrane protein type-2A (Lamp-2A) that are involved in CMA. Despite the reduction in CHOP, calpain, caspase-12, and Lamp-2A protein levels, the levels of molecular chaperones Bip, Hsps70, and 90 increased 10 days after Abeta injection in comparison to the control group. Based on our results, 10 days after Abeta injection, despite the activation of protective chaperones, markers associated with neurotoxicity were still elevated.",
