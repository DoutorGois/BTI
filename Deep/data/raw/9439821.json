     "AB": "Ihara's genetically epileptic rat (IGER) is a rat mutant with genetically scheduled spontaneous convulsions mimicking human limbic seizures. In the present study, the possible changes of three neuropeptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY), somatostatin (SRIF) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), in the brains of IGER were investigated. Increased contents of immunoreactive (IR) NPY were found only in the hippocampus of 2-month IGERs before developing convulsive seizures, while similar increases of IR-NPY were discovered in the striatum and pyriform and entorhinal cortex as well as hippocampus in 8-month IGERs with repetitive seizures. There were no significant differences in the brain contents of IR-SRIF and IR-CRF between IGERs and the controls at both ages. These findings indicate an enhanced rate of NPY synthesis in this experimental model of epilepsy which may play a critical role in the development of epileptogenesis.",
