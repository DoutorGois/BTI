     "AB": "Postnatal lesion with ibotenic acid in the ventral hippocampus produces several behavioural effects that resemble the symptoms of schizophrenia. In the present study, we tested neonatally lesioned 1-year-old Sprague-Dawley rats for their social memory. It was found that social memory is worsened in lesioned rats. Subchronic treatment with haloperidol (0.025 mg/kg body weight) partly ameliorated this impairment. It was suggested that social memory might be a useful paradigm to test clinically used and potential antipsychotic drugs for their effects on learning and memory processes.",
