Elucidation of mechanisms underlying NMDA receptor functioning will promote understanding of the molecular bases of NMDA receptor-mediated processes. The localization of the phencyclidine (PCP) receptor within the ionophore of the NMDA receptor-gated ion channel permits the binding of PCP receptor ligands to serve as a functional marker of channel activation. We have previously demonstrated that the highly selective PCP receptor ligand [3H]MK-801 displays multiexponential kinetics of association, indicating that the NMDA receptor functions according to a multistate model. Using the fast component of [3H]MK-801 binding to PCP receptors as a marker for activated NMDA channels, we demonstrate here a Hill coefficient of 2 for activation of NMDA channels by L-glutamate. A multistate model of NMDA receptor functioning analogous to the model known to account for the functioning of nicotinic cholinergic and gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors fits well to our experimental data, supporting the concept that the NMDA receptor is properly classified in the Class 1 superfamily of ligand-gated channels.",
