     "AB": "Senktide, a potent neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3-R) agonist, increases acetylcholine (ACh) release in the striatum, the prefrontal cortex (Schable et al., 2011), the amygdala and hippocampus, presumably via postsynaptic mechanisms. A promnestic action of NK3-R agonists has been described in a variety of learning/memory tasks. The memory-enhancing effects of NK3-R agonists and their activating influence on ACh suggest a possible role of the NK3-R in learning and memory via cholinergic modulation. Deterioration of the cholinergic system in the basal forebrain has been associated with learning and memory deficits and cholinergic agents have promnestic effects in a variety of learning paradigms. The anticholinergic drug, scopolamine, a muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist, incurs deficits in a variety of learning tasks and provides a useful tool to investigate the role of the cholinergic systems in mechanisms underlying learning and memory. The aim of this study was to ascertain the effect of the NK3-R agonist, senktide, in the scopolamine-induced deficit model. We hypothesized that senktide treatment would attenuate scopolamine-induced (subcutaneous--s.c. 0.75 mg/kg) memory impairment in three novelty preference paradigms based on spontaneous object exploration: namely object recognition, object-place recognition and object recognition for temporal order. Administration of senktide reversed the scopolamine-induced memory deficits by re-establishing object recognition (s.c. 0.2 mg/kg), object-place recognition (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg), as well as object recognition for temporal order (0.4 mg/kg) in adult Wistar rats. These results indicate memory enhancing effects of senktide in animals subjected to scopolamine-induced memory impairments and indicate that the promnestic action of NK3-R agonists is mediated by muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms.",
