     "AB": "Experimental evidence for multiple memory systems grew initially from reports that integrity of the medial temporal lobes is necessary for some, but not all, types of memory formation. A primary inference from many studies of multiple memory systems is that they operate independently during encoding, storage, and retrieval of information. An accumulation of recent evidence, however, suggests that multiple memory systems may interact under some conditions. At the cellular level of analysis, it is accepted widely that protein synthesis is necessary for the formation of long-term memory and recent efforts have focused on the mechanisms by which learning-induced gene transcription and translation are regulated. The present review examines learning-induced activation of transcription factors among multiple memory systems. The results indicate that studies of transcriptional regulation, in conjunction with other experimental approaches, can provide complementary lines of evidence to further understanding of the extent to which multiple memory systems are independent or interactive.",
