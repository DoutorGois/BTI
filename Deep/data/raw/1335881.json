     "AB": "The action of gamma-hydroxybutyrate was studied on pre- and postsynaptic GABA(B) receptors in rat hippocampal neurones in vitro using intracellular recording. gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (1-10 mM) caused a 4-8 mV hyperpolarization of CA1 cells and a 20-80% decrease in monosynaptic excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in a concentration-dependent manner. These actions were reversibly inhibited by a novel and selective GABA(B) antagonist, CGP 36742 (20-500 microM) suggesting that gamma-hydroxybutyrate can activate presynaptic as well as postsynaptic GABA(B) receptors.",
