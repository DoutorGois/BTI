     "AB": "Angiotensin II receptors are highly localized in adult gerbil brain. Apparent receptor number is high in subfornical organ, vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, nucleus of the solitary tract, hippocampus, and in the anterior pituitary gland. In the hippocampus, binding is localized to the stratum oriens, radiatum, the lacunar molecular layers of the CA1 subfield, and the molecular layer of the gyrus dentatus, with a medial to lateral and anterior to posterior gradient in receptor expression. Binding is absent from the pyramidal layer of the CA1 subfield and from the granular cell layer of the gyrus dentatus, areas rich in angiotensin IV binding. Characterization in the hippocampus revealed the presence of a high affinity receptor, sensitive to incubation with the guanine nucleotide GTP gamma S, and displaced by angiotensin II = angiotensin III < Sar1-Ile8-angiotensin II, but not by angiotensin IV or other angiotensin fragments, the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan, or the AT2 ligands CGP 42112 or PD 123177. In other brain areas, binding was equally insensitive to displacement by AT1 or AT2 ligands, with the exception of binding in the olfactory bulb, which was totally displaced by CGP 42112 and PD 123177, but not by losartan. In the gerbil, most of the brain and pituitary angiotensin II receptors are different from the AT1, AT2 and AT4 subtypes, and should be considered 'atypical' until further characterization.",
