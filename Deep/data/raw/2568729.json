     "AB": "The inhibitory effect of an adenosine analogue, R-PIA, and an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, UK 14,304, on [3H]NA efflux from field-stimulated rat hippocampal slices was examined. The effect of 0.1 microM UK 14,304 was mimicked by 30 nM omega-conotoxin and by 10 microM cadmium chloride, inhibitors of N- and L-type Ca2+ channels. R-PIA (1 microM) had no effect per se, but caused a clear-cut inhibition after blockade of the pre-synaptic alpha 2-receptor by yohimbine. 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) caused a dose-dependent increase in evoked transmitter release. At 30 microM 4-AP did not affect the actions of omega-conotoxin or cadmium chloride. The pre-synaptic effect of R-PIA was similarly unaffected by 30 microM 4-AP. The pre-synaptic effect of UK 14,304 was virtually abolished by 4-AP (30 microM). The effect of UK 14,304 (0.1 microM) could be partly restored by reducing the Ca2+ concentration during treatment with 4-AP (22% inhibition compared to 42% with normal Ca2+). The magnitude of increase in evoked [3H]NA efflux by yohimbine (1 microM) was decreased by 4-AP in a concentration-dependent manner from 142% increase in controls to 21% at 100 microM 4-AP. The present results indicate that NA release is reduced by somewhat different mechanisms by pre-synaptic alpha 2- and adenosine A1-receptors. Furthermore, the results indicate that pre-synaptic A1-receptors on hippocampal NA neurons do not primarily regulate 4-AP-dependent potassium channels, but they might act directly on a Ca2+ conductance.",
