     "AB": "Neuropeptide Y-Y2 receptor mRNA and binding were investigated after local injection of excitatory amino acid receptor agonists into the rat hippocampus. The general metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist (1S,3R)ACPD (200 and 400 nmol) and the group I mGluR agonist DHPG (50 nmol) enhanced Y2 receptor mRNA levels in granule cells (by up to 470%) and [125I]PYY(3-36) binding in mossy fibers. The group I mGluR antagonist 4-CPG (200 nmol) inhibited the action of (1S,3R)ACPD. On the other hand, AMPA and NMDA enhanced Y2 receptor expression only at neurodegenerative doses (> 0.3 and 3 nmol, respectively). It is suggested that seizure-induced Y2 receptor expression in granule cells may be mediated by group I mGluRs.",
