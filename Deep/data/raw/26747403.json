     "AB": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the most active members of the neurotrophin family. BDNF not only regulates neuronal survival and differentiation, but also functions in activity-dependent plasticity processes such as long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), learning, and memory. Like other growth factors, BDNF is produced by molecular and cellular mechanisms including transcription and translation, and functions as a bioactive molecule in the nervous system. Among these mechanisms, a particular post-translational mechanism, namely the conversion of precursor BDNF into mature BDNF by proteolytic cleavage, was not fully understood. In this review, we discuss the manner through which this post-translational mechanism alters the biological actions of BDNF protein. In addition to the initially elucidated findings on BDNF, the biological roles of precursor BDNF and the BDNF pro-peptide, especially synaptic plasticity, will be extensively discussed. Recent findings on the BDNF pro-peptide will provide new insights for understanding the mechanisms of action of the pro-peptides of growth factors.",
