     "AB": "The endogenous amino acids glutamate and aspartate depolarize mammalian neurons to produce excitation, and the rigid glutamate analogue 1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid also has this effect. This compound exists as two pairs of geometric isomers, and in the present study the absolute configuration of the four isomers is assigned. The known (+)-S and (-)-R isomers of 3-oxocyclopentanecarboxylic acid were used as the basis for the synthesis. The cis and trans amino acids were obtained by fractional crystallization. Spectral data, including optical rotation, circular dichroism, and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, are presented. The compounds were evaluated as excitants by microiontophoretic ejection into the dendritic region of impaled CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slices. One isomer, cis-1R,3R, mimicked completely the actions elicited by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid; the other three isomers were alpha-kainic acid like.",
