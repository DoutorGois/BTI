     "AB": "Rats with surgical lesions of the hippocampal formation, amygdala, and nearby neocortex and pyriform cortex were impaired on a swim-to-platform test and on a passive avoidance test. These impairments were not increased by presurgical treatment with a series of 21 electroshock convulsions. To the extent that this rat preparation can be compared with human patients, the data suggest that a previous history of epileptic seizures does not increase the amnestic effect of temporal lobe lesions.",
