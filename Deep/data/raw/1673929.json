     "AB": "Chronic intraventricular infusion of the selective NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 appears to cause an impairment of spatial but not visual discrimination learning. However, Goddard (1986) has questioned whether this dissociation in task-selectivity reflects a difference in the underlying neural mechanisms or differential drug diffusion. Two experiments conducted to address this issue established (a) that chronic intraventricular infusion of AP5, at a dose sufficient to cause a spatial learning impairment, results in a relatively uniform distribution of the drug across the brain, and (b) that chronic bilateral intracortical infusion at sites very close to visual cortex also fails to impair visual discrimination learning. These findings argue against differential diffusion being a major cause of the sensitivity of spatial but not visual discrimination tasks to AP5, and raises the possibility that representational and procedural memory tasks may depend upon distinct cell-biological mechanisms of plasticity.",
