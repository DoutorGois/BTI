     "AB": "Kainate-induced status epilepticus is associated with both apoptotic and necrotic cell death and induction of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in hippocampal and cortical regions of the rodent brain. In the present study we have examined the temporal, spatial and cellular expression patterns of mRNAs for the highly inducible HSPs, HSP70 and HSP27, together with the apoptotic marker, caspase 3 (CPP32) in rat brain after systemic administration of kainate. HSP70 mRNA was transiently induced in the forebrain by kainate, principally in the CA1, CA3 and hilar cells of the hippocampal formation, in piriform cortex and discrete thalamic nuclei. Maximal expression was seen at 8 h after kainate which then declined to background levels by 7 days. Labelling was predominantly neuronal. In contrast, HSP27 mRNA expression was more widespread. Intense labelling was observed in CA1, CA3 and the hilar region at 8 h after kainate but the expression profile for HSP27 mRNA expanded considerably with intense signals seen in corpus callosum, cortex and thalamus at 24 h post kainate. Emulsion autoradiographs indicated a predominantly glial localisation for HSP27 mRNA. In the hilus, a distinct subpopulation of interneurones were found to express HSP27 mRNA. CPP32 mRNA was upregulated in CA1, CA3 and hilus of the hippocampal formation and in piriform cortex. CPP32 mRNA expression was more restricted and similar in distribution to HSP70 mRNA being localised to neurones. The present study demonstrates the unique early expression of HSP27 mRNA by glial cells and distinct populations of neurones which extends beyond those in which HSP70 and CPP32 induction occurs with subsequent cell loss.",
