     "AB": "The neural dynamics of the hippocampal network for memory encoding of novel temporal sequences is proposed based on the theta rhythm modulated firing of place cells called theta phase precession. It is hypothesized that theta phase precession is generated at the entorhinal cortex by phase locking between local field theta oscillation and neural oscillators and that the hippocampal closed network with feedforward and backward projections employ theta phase precession to create selectivity in the associative connections needed for temporal sequence storage. Our analyses and computer experiments reveal that the phase precession generated by phase locking instantaneously endows stable phase relations among neural activities in the successively changing neural population. It is concluded that theta phase precession provides biologically plausible dynamics for the memory encoding of novel temporal sequences as episodic events.",
