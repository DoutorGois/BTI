     "AB": "The cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) binds to several proteins that regulate the trafficking and processing of AbetaPP and affects amyloid-beta (Abeta) production. We previously reported that levels of AT-motif binding factor 1 (ATBF1) are increased in the brains of 17-month-old Tg2576 mice compared with wild-type controls, and that Abeta42 increases ATBF1 expression, inducing death in primary rat cortical neurons. Here, we show that ATBF1 levels are increased in the cytoplasm of hippocampal neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains compared with non-AD brains. Furthermore, cotransfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells with ATBF1 and AbetaPP695 increased steady-state levels of AbetaPP via the binding of ATBF1 to the AbetaPP cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 666-690), resulting in increased Abeta production and cellular and soluble AbetaPP (sAbetaPP) levels without affecting the activity or levels of AbetaPP processing enzymes (alpha-, beta-, or gamma-secretase). Conversely, knockdown of endogenous ATBF1 reduced levels of cellular AbetaPP, sAbetaPP, and Abeta in HEK293 cells overexpressing human AbetaPP695. Our findings provide insight into the dynamics of AbetaPP processing and Abeta production, and suggest that ATBF1 is a novel AbetaPP binding protein that may be a suitable therapeutic target for AD.",
