     "AB": "Increasing evidence demonstrates inflammation contributes to neuronal death following cerebral ischemia. Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) has been reported to prevent scopolamine-induced cognitive and memory deficits. We recently indicated that LBP exerts neuroprotective effect against focal cerebral ischemic injury in mice via attenuating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of LBP against the behavioral dysfunction induced by focal cerebral ischemia injury in mice. Following 7 successive days of pretreatment with LBP (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) and nimodipine (4 mg/kg) by intragastric gavage, mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Following reperfusion, cerebral blood flows, the total power of the spontaneous EEG, and morphological changes were estimated. Learning and memory ability, and motor coordination were determined by Morris water maze task, rotarod and grip test. Western blot analysis, Real-Time fluorogenic PCR assays, and immunofluorescence staining were used to examine the expression of proinflammatory mediators and activation of microglia. The present study showed that LBP pretreatment significantly enhanced regional cortical blood flow and the total power of the spontaneous EEG, improved memory and motor coordination impairments, and inhibited over-activation of microglia and astrocytes after MCAO. Further study demonstrated LBP suppressed MCAO-induced activations of P65 NF-kappaB and P38 MAPK, and prevented up-regulations of proinflammatory mediators in hippocampus. Our data suggest that LBP can exert functional recovery of memory and motor coordination deficits and neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemic injury in mice.",
