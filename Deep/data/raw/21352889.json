     "AB": "It is well known that hippocampus plays important roles in learning and memory. Both calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and CGRP receptors are found in hippocampus. In the present study we explored the influence of CGRP on long term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1. Our results demonstrated that CGRP inhibited the LTP induced by high frequency stimulation (HFS) in hippocampal CA1 neurons in rat brain slices. The inhibitory effect was blocked by CGRP receptor-1 antagonist CGRP 8-37. The results indicate that both CGRP and CGRP receptor 1 are involved in the modulation process of LTP in hippocampus of rats.",
