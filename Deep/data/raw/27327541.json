     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Memory loss and increased anxiety are clinical hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Kallikrein-8 is a protease implicated in memory acquisition and anxiety, and its mRNA is known to be up-regulated in AD-affected human hippocampus. Therefore, an involvement of Kallikrein-8 in Alzheimer's pathogenesis is conceivable but remains to be proved. METHODS: We determined the cerebral expression of Kallikrein-8 mRNA and protein during the course of AD in patients and in transgenic mice and tested the impact of Kallikrein-8 inhibition on AD-related pathology in mice and in primary glial cells. RESULTS: Kallikrein-8 mRNA and protein were up-regulated in both species at incipient stages of AD. Kallikrein-8 inhibition impeded amyloidogenic amyloid-precursor-protein processing, facilitated amyloid beta (Abeta) clearance across the blood-brain-barrier, boosted autophagy, reduced Abeta load and tau pathology, enhanced neuroplasticity, reversed molecular signatures of anxiety, and ultimately improved memory and reduced fear. DISCUSSION: Kallikrein-8 is a promising new therapeutic target against AD.",
