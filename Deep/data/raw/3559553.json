     "AB": "Prenatal monosodium glutamate (MSG) given through the mother's diet was found previously to cause behavioral changes in the offspring, including learning disabilities. In the present study, neurochemical parameters were measured in the brains of prenatally exposed rats at various ages throughout development up to adulthood. At 15 days of age, choline uptake and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the frontal cortex were significantly reduced (by 80 and 25%, respectively) in MSG-exposed animals, whereas the same cholinergic parameters in hippocampus were not changed. During later development, choline uptake gradually increased, until in adulthood it became significantly higher in MSG-exposed animals than in the controls. This enhancement was found in both males and females. Our previous study showed that only the male offspring were learning disabled. Choline uptake and ChAT activity were enhanced in the hippocampus of adult male animals. Norepinephrine (NE) uptake was reduced (by 25%) in the frontal cortex of males only. There was no change in NE uptake in the hypothalamus.",
