     "AB": "1. The aim of the present study was to test the protective role of intravenous Zn(2+) against iron-catalysed reperfusion injury in the hippocampus of ischaemic rats. 2. One hundred adult male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into five groups. Rats in the first group were subjected to surgery (sham operation) without induction of cerebral ischaemia and injected with normal saline (i.v.). The second group of sham-operated rats were injected with 6 mg/kg, i.v., ZnCl(2). In the third group, rats were subjected to cerebral ischaemia for 60 min. Animals in the fourth group were subjected to cerebral ischaemia for 60 min followed by 8 h reperfusion. In the fifth group, rats were subjected to cerebral ischaemia for 60 min, followed by 8 h reperfusion with injection of a single dose of ZnCl(2) (6 mg/kg, i.v.) during the first 5 min of the reperfusion period. After reperfusion, animals were killed, their brains were dissected out on ice and the two hippocampi from each animal were isolated and analysed. 3. Cerebral ischaemia induced an increase in the iron content, lipidic peroxidation, apoptosis and metallothionein (MT) in the hippocampus. These effects were significantly increased in the hippocampus of ischaemic rats subjected to 8 h reperfusion compared with ischaemic non-reperfused rats. Intravenous administration of ZnCl(2)decreased the accumulation of iron, lipidic peroxidation and apoptosis produced by reperfusion, but increased the level of MT. 4. Data from the present study suggest that, after 1 h ischaemia, there is an increase in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and this allows penetration of i.v. injected ZnCl(2), which can induce expression of brain MT, increase the anti-oxidant capacity and diminish iron-catalysed lipid peroxidation and apoptosis. This may give new insights as to how to improve the outcome for stroke patients.",
