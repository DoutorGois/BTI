     "AB": "Effects of withdrawal from ethanol drinking in chronic intermittent ethanol vapor (CIE)-exposed dependent rats and air-exposed nondependent rats on proliferation and survival of progenitor cells in the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were investigated. Rats were injected with 5'-Bromo 2-deoxyuridine 72 h post-CIE to measure proliferation (2 h-old cells) and survival (29-day-old cells) of progenitors born during a time-point previously reported to elicit a proliferative burst in the hippocampus. Hippocampal and mPFC brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor (TrkB) expression were measured 3 h or 21d post-CIE to evaluate neurotrophic signaling during a time point preceding the proliferative burst and survival of newly born progenitors. CIE rats demonstrated elevated drinking compared to nondependent rats and CIE rats maintained elevated drinking following protracted abstinence. Withdrawal from CIE increased BDNF levels in the hippocampus and mPFC, and subsequently increased proliferation in the hippocampus and mPFC compared to nondependent rats and controls. Protracted abstinence from CIE reduced BDNF expression to control levels, and subsequently reduced neurogenesis compared to controls and nondependent rats in the hippocampus. In the mPFC, protracted abstinence reduced BDNF expression to control levels, whereas increased oligodendrogenesis in dependent rats compared to nondependent rats and controls. These results suggest a novel relationship between BDNF and progenitors in the hippocampus and mPFC, in which increased ethanol drinking may alter hippocampal and cortical function in alcohol dependent subjects by altering the cellular composition of newly born progenitors in the hippocampus and mPFC.",
