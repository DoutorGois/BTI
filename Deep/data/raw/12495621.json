     "AB": "GABA and glutamate receptors are expressed in immature \"silent\" CA1 pyramidal neurons prior to synapse formation, but their function is unknown. We now report the presence of tonic, spontaneous, and evoked currents in embryonic and neonatal CA1 neurons mediated primarily by the activation of GABA(A) receptors. These currents are mediated by a nonconventional release of transmitters, as they persist in the presence of calcium channel blockers or botulinium toxin and are observed in Munc18-1-deficient mice in which vesicular release is abolished. This paracrine communication is modulated by glutamate but not GABA transporters, which do not operate during this period of life. Thus, a Ca(2+)- and SNARE-independent release of transmitters underlies a paracrine mode of communication before synapse formation.",
