     "AB": "The cellular uptake of L-arginine and other cationic amino acids (such as L-lysine and L-ornithine) is mainly mediated by cationic amino acid transporter (CAT) proteins. Despite the important roles of cationic amino acid transporters for normal brain functioning and various brain diseases there is currently only fragmentary knowledge about their cellular and regional distribution patterns in the human brain. We mapped the immunohistochemical localization of human cationic amino acid transporters 1, 2 and 3 (hCAT1, 2, and 3) throughout five adult human brains and found a wide but uneven distribution of these transporters. All three hCAT1s were mainly localized in neurons, but were also found in numerous astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, plexus choroideus epithelial cells, and small blood vessels. The highest density of hCAT expressing neurons was observed in the hypothalamus, in some areas of the cerebral cortex, the thalamic reticular nucleus and the caudate nucleus, whereas weak to moderate expression was detected in the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex (hCAT1 only), pons, brain stem and cerebellum. In contrast to what has been found in rodent brain, we detected hCAT2 and hCAT3 also in astrocytes. Overall, each hCAT has its characteristic, individual cerebral expression patterns, which, however, overlap with the others.",
