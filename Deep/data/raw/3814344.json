     "AB": "Dopamine and serotonin responses to various periods of alcohol treatment have been followed in striatum and hippocampus of two inbred strains of mice and related to the effect of aging. A striking strain dependency was noted for chronic alcohol effects and also for senescence. For both neurotransmitters studied the C57Bl strain loses tolerance to prolonged alcohol injury earlier than the Balb/c strain. This loss of tolerance accompanying aging may be indicative of more widespread changes in CNS adaptability in this strain. The unequal capacity to adapt also appears to depend on the nervous structure and the neurotransmitter considered. Alcohol and aging induced changes are not identical. In a given mouse strain, significant effects of either drug or aging induced disturbances are noted. A similar molecular process could operate in both aging and alcohol abuse, but the neurochemical effect might depend on the nervous structure or neurotransmitter involved. Such a phenomenon may be the basis of differences in behavioral changes observed in alcoholics.",
