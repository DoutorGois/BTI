     "AB": "Large increases in cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) activate several kinases that are important for neuronal plasticity, including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC). Because it is also known, mainly in non-neuronal systems, that superoxide radicals (O2-) activate these (and other) kinases and because O2- generation by mitochondria is in part [Ca2+]i dependent, we examined in hippocampal neurons the relationship between Ca2+ entry, O2- production, and kinase activity. We found that, after large stimulus-induced [Ca2+]i increases, O2- selectively produced by mitochondria near plasmalemmal sites of Ca2+ entry acts as a modulator to upregulate the two kinases, namely, CaMKII and PKA, whose activities are directly or indirectly phosphorylation dependent. The common mechanism involves O2- inhibition of inactivating protein phosphatases. Conversely, because small [Ca2+]i increases do not promote mitochondrial respiration and O2- generation, weak stimuli favor enhanced phosphatase activity, which therefore leads to suppressed kinase activity. Enhanced O2- production also promoted PKC activity but by a phosphatase-independent pathway. These results suggest that Ca2+-dependent upregulation of mitochondrial O2- production may be a general mechanism for linking Ca2+ entry to enhanced kinase activity and therefore to synaptic plasticity. This mechanism also represents yet another way that mitochondria, acting as calcium sensors, can play a role in neuronal signal transduction.",
