     "AB": "The effect of the selective noradrenaline neurotoxin DSP4 on steady-state operant behaviour was examined using a quantitative behavioural paradigm based on Herrnstein's (1970) equation, which defines a hyperbolic relationship between steady-state response rate and reinforcement frequency in variable-interval schedules. Eleven rats received injections of DSP4 (two doses of 50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and 12 rats received injections of the vehicle alone. The rats were trained to steady state in a series of six variable-interval schedules of sucrose reinforcement, affording scheduled reinforcement frequencies of 4-360 reinforcers per hour. Herrnstein's equation was fitted to the data obtained from each rat and to the averaged data obtained from the two groups. The value of KH (the parameter expressing the reinforcement frequency needed to maintain the half-maximal response rate) was higher in the DSP4-treated rats than in the control rats; the value of Rmax (the parameter expressing the maximum response rate) did not differ significantly between the two groups. At the end of the behavioural experiment the rats were sacrificed for determination of the concentrations of catecholamines in the brain by high-performance liquid chromatography. The levels of noradrenaline in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of the DSP4-treated rats were less than 20% of those of the control rats. The results provide further evidence that central noradrenergic neurones are involved in the maintenance of operant behaviour by positive reinforcement.",
