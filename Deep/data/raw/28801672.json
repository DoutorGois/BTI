     "AB": "Dynamic reconfiguration of the human brain is characterized by the nature of complexity. The purpose of this study was to measure such complexity and also analyze its association with age. We modeled the dynamic reconfiguration process by dynamic functional connectivity, which was established by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and we measured complexity within the dynamic functional connectivity by sample entropy (SampEn). A brainwide map of SampEn in healthy subjects shows larger values in the caudate, the olfactory gyrus, the amygdala, and the hippocampus, and lower values in primary sensorimotor and visual areas. Association analysis in healthy subjects indicated that SampEn of the amygdala-cortical connectivity decreases with advancing age. Such age-related loss of SampEn, however, disappears in patients with schizophrenia. These findings suggest that SampEn of the dynamic functional connectivity is a promising indicator of normal aging.",
