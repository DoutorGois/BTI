     "AB": "Affinity labeling of [125I]NPY to the bovine hippocampal NPY receptor has revealed a 50 kDa specific binding protein, the Y2 receptor. Cysteamine (10 microM - 10 mM) specifically enhanced NPY specific labeling of the Y2 receptor without affecting cross-linking efficiency. Several structurally related agents, including reduced glutathione, cysteine, beta-mercaptoethanol and ethanolamine, were without effect on receptor binding. The enhancement of binding by cysteamine could be reversed by washing the membranes. These studies suggest that cysteamine may change the conformation of the NPY Y2 receptor and increase its binding activity.",
