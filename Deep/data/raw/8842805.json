     "AB": "Molecular cues involved in directional neurite outgrowth and axonal differentiation of embryonic hippocampal neurons were studied on substrates coated in a striped 5 microns pattern with synthetic peptides from a neurite outgrowth (RDIAEIIKDI, P1543) and cell attachment (CDPGYIGSR, P364) domain of the B2- and B1-chains of laminin, respectively. Both peptides supported neuronal attachment, but only the B2-chain-derived P1543 promoted expression of a mature neuronal phenotype. Directional neurite outgrowth and axonal differentiation of embryonic hippocampal neurons were selectively induced by striped substrates of the B2-chain-derived P1543. Axonal differentiation was determined by expression of a phosphorylated epitope of the 200 kDa neurofilament protein in the longer \"axonal\" neurite of the bipolar embryonic hippocampal neurons. Ethanol (100 mM), a neuroactive compound known to delay neuronal development, impaired both directional neurite outgrowth and expression of a phosphorylated epitope of the 200 kDa neurofilament protein on a patterned P1543 substratum. The present results provide direct evidence that a 10 amino acid peptide (P1543), derived from a neurite outgrowth domain of the B2-chain of laminin, may be an axonal guidance and differentiation factor for embryonic hippocampal neurons in vitro.",
