     "AB": "In rats injected with neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) the development of experimental depressive syndrome was accompanied by local epileptiform activity in the caudate-putamen complex and by reorganization of electrical processes in the brain. The spectral power density in the caudate-putamen in the delta range was increased in the formative stage of depressive syndrome (day 3-4 from the beginning of MPTP administration) and in the stage of behaviour recovery (a week after the withdrawal) as compared to control rats. On the contrary, the spectral power in the alpha range was decreased at the peak of depression (day 11-12 from the beginning of neurotoxin administration) and a week after the withdrawal as compared to the initial value. In the formative stage of depressive syndrome the spectral power in the delta range was increased in hippocampus whereas in sensorimotor cortex it was decreased at the frequency 6 Hz compared to control. It is suggested that a new pathodynamical organization is formed in the CNS of animals in response to MPTP administration, which is thought to be a neuropathophysiological basis of depressive syndrome.",
