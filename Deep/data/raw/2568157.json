     "AB": "Changes of intracellular Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) in response to somatostatin were measured in cultured rat hippocampal neurons on a single cell basis by fura-2 fluorometry. Somatostatin increased [Ca2+]i dose-dependently and this effect was completely blocked in either Ca2+-depleted medium or LaCl3-containing medium. In addition, omega-conotoxin GVIA completely inhibited the effect of somatostatin. Our results indicate that somatostatin receptors couple with N-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.",
