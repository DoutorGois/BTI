     "AB": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) is a hypoxia-inducible signal glycoprotein. VEGFA causes vascular endothelial cell growth and proliferation, that leads to the regeneration of vascular network in brain regions damaged by ischemia. However, this protein is involved in processes of inflammation and edema in early stages of ischemia. Synthetic peptide semax shows neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties and is actively used in the treatment of ischemia.We have previously shown that semax reduces vascular injury and activates the mRNA synthesis of neurotrophins and their receptors under global cerebral ischemia in rats. Here we have analyzed the effects of semax and its C-terminal Pro-Gly-Pro tripeptide upon Vegfa mRNA expression in different rat brain regions after common carotid artery occlusion. The animals were decapitated 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 h after the operation. It was shown that ischemia increases levels of Vegfa mRNA in the rat brain of animals (4 h after the occlusion--in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus, 8 h--in the cortex and hippocampus, and 24 h in the cortex). Semax treatment reduces Vegfa mRNA levels in the frontal cortex (4, 8 and 12 h after the occlusion) and hippocampus of ischemic rats (2 and 4 h). Effect of PGP on the Vegfa gene expression was almost negligible. Our results showed that semax prevents activating effect ofhypoxia on the Vegfa gene expression in early stages of global ischemia. Furthermore, increase in the level of mRNA Vegfa in the hippocampus (24 h after occlusion) perhaps reflects neuroprotective properties of this drug.",
