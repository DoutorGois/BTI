     "AB": "The effect of galanin, a peptide present in a subpopulation of histaminergic neurons emanating from the rat posterior hypothalamus, was investigated on K(+)-evoked [3H]histamine release in slices and synaptosomes from rat cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Porcine galanin (0.3 microM) significantly inhibited histamine release induced by 25 mM K+ in slices from hypothalamus and hippocampus, but not from cerebral cortex and striatum, i.e., only in regions in which a colocalization of histamine and galanin has been described. The inhibitory effect of galanin was concentration dependent, with an EC50 value of 5.8 +/- 1.9 nM. The maximal inhibition was of 30-40% in hypothalamic and hippocampal slices depolarized with 25 mM K+. The galanin-induced inhibition observed in hypothalamic slices was not prevented in the presence of 0.6 microM tetrodotoxin and also occurred in hippocampal and hypothalamic synaptosomes, strongly suggesting the activation by galanin of presynaptic receptors located upon histaminergic nerve endings. The maximal inhibitory effect of galanin in slices or synaptosomes was lower than that previously reported for histamine acting at H3-autoreceptors, possibly suggesting that not all histaminergic axon terminals, even in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, are endowed with galanin receptors. It increased progressively in hypothalamic and hippocampal synaptosomes as the strength of the depolarizing stimulus was reduced. It is concluded that galanin modulates histamine release via presynaptic receptors, presumably autoreceptors located upon nerve terminals of a subpopulation of cerebral histaminergic neurons.",
