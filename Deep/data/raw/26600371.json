     "AB": "In a previous study, we reported a persistent reduction of F-actin puncta but a compensating increase in puncta size in the mouse hippocampus at 2 months after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (Epilepsy Res. 108 (2014), 379-389). However, the F-actin changes during the period of epileptogenesis remain unknown. This study was designed to examine the temporal and spatial changes of F-actin during the period of epileptogenesis in a pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model, primarily by the histological and TUNEL evaluation of cell loss, phalloidin detection of F-actin, and immunohistochemical analysis of glial reactions. The results demonstrated that F-actin continued to decrease after pilocarpine treatment, which was consistent in its time course with hippocampal neuronal death. Within different hippocampal subfields, the spatial changes of F-actin exhibited similar features. First, the F-actin puncta decreased in number. Thereafter, F-actin was transiently aggregated in dendritic shafts and neuronal cell bodies and eventually was completely lost in the degenerated neurons. The progressive changes of F-actin in the degenerating neurons reported in this study may help to elucidate a cytoskeletal mechanism that may link to the delayed cell loss that occurs during epileptogenesis.",
