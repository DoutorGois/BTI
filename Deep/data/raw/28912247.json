     "AB": "The mechanisms of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation have been studied persistently but still are not elucidated. Considering the emerging roles of microRNA in stress response, we conducted a microRNA microarray in mice hypothalamus to identify the potential role of microRNAs in regulating the HPA axis. In total, 41 microRNAs changed during heat stress in which we found that miR-212 contains a binding sequence with corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh) 3'UTR according to a sequence analysis. We observed that miR-212 expression in the hypothalamus was escalated by repeated heat and restraint stress. By overexpression or inhibition of miR-212 and the dual-luciferase reporter assay, we proved that miR-212 could bind with Crh 3'UTR to regulate its expression in mice hypothalamus primary cells and in the hippocampus neuron cell line HT-22. In addition, we injected miR-212 agomir or antagomir in mice hypothalamus to overexpress or inhibit miR-212, which leads to alterations of CRH expression and HPA axis activity in vivo Furthermore, miR-212 and CRH were both transcribed by the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Overexpression and inhibition of miR-212 affect CREB-dependent CRH expression. Taken together, our results suggest an inhibitory role of miR-212 on the HPA axis, which acts in a counter-regulatory manner.",
