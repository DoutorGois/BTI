     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvessel density (MVD) in hippocampus of rats with aging. METHODS: Paraffin sections of brain tissue of rats at the age of 3, 18, 24, 30 months were stained by immunohistochemistry, the expression of VEGF and MVD was quantitatively analyzed. RESULTS: Innunohistochemical staining showed that the VEGF-positive cells were mainly pyramidal neuron in hippocampus; the intensity of VEGF-positivity in neuron cells was decreased with the aging (P<0.05). The MVD in hippocampus was also decreased with the aging of rats (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Increasing VEGF contents and improving blood circulation in brain tissue may prevent or treat vascular dementia and cerebrovascular diseases.",
