     "AB": "Due to improved survival rates and outcome of human infants experiencing a hypoxic-ischemic episode, cognitive dysfunctions have become prominent. They might result from abnormal communication within prefrontal-hippocampal networks, as synchrony and directed interactions between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus account for mnemonic and executive performance. Here, we elucidate the structural and functional impact of hypoxic-ischemic events on developing prefrontal-hippocampal networks in an immature rat model of injury. The magnitude of infarction, cell loss and astrogliosis revealed that an early hypoxic-ischemic episode had either a severe or a mild/moderate outcome. Without affecting the gross morphology, hypoxia-ischemia with mild/moderate outcome diminished prefrontal neuronal firing and gamma network entrainment. This dysfunction resulted from decreased coupling synchrony within prefrontal-hippocampal networks and disruption of hippocampal theta drive. Thus, early hypoxia-ischemia may alter the functional maturation of neuronal networks involved in cognitive processing by disturbing the communication between the neonatal prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.",
