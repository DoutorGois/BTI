     "AB": "AIM: The effect of stress hormone corticosterone on hippocampal neurons delayed rectified potassium currents was probed. METHODS: The potassium currents of rat hippocampal neurons in primary culture were measured with patch clamp whole-cell recording. RESULTS: It showed that the amplitudes of the potassium currents in hippocampal neurons decreased. However, the threshold potential of potassium currents increased. CONCLUSION: It is speculated that excessive corticosterone may hurt the hippocampal neurons via its effects on the potassium currents of rat hippocampal cells.",
