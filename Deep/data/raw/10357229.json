     "AB": "Although information may be stored in the brain is changes in the strength of existing synapses, formation of new synapses has long been thought of as an additional substrate for memory storage. The identification of subcellular structural changes following learning in mammals poses a serious 'needle-in-the-haystack' problem. In most attempts to demonstrate structural plasticity during learning, animals have been exposed for prolonged periods to complex environments, where they are confronted with a variety of sensory, motor- and spatial challenges throughout the exposure period. These environments are thought to promote several forms of learning. Repeated exposure to such environments has been shown to increase the density of spines and dendritic complexity in relevant brain structures. The number of neurons has also been reported to increase in some areas. It is not clear, however, whether the new synapses emerging from these forms of plasticity mediate specific information storage, or whether they reflect a more general sophistication of the excited parts of the network.",
