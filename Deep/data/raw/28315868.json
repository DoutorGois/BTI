     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To identify the molecular mechanism of post-stroke depression (PSD), and observe the therapeutic effects of cerebellar fastigial nucleus electrical stimulation (FNS) on the behaviors and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in a PSD rat model. METHODS: Healthy SD rats were randomly divided into four groups (sham, stroke, post-stroke depress and FNS group). Sham group (n = 6) underwent sham operation. The other three groups (n = 6*3) underwent MCAO. Rats were examined twice a week in open filed test. Moreover, neuroprotective effect on cerebellar Purkinje cells and expression of cytokines in hippocampal tissue were examined. RESULTS: The PSD group showed a significant weight loss, decreased consumption of sucrose water, reduced rearing and locomotor activities. The FNS significantly alleviates the body weight loss and sucrose preference, locomotor and rearing activities. The bilateral rCBF was also restored after FNS treatment. Moreover, FNS improved the neuroprotection via suppressing apoptosis of cerebellar Purkinje cells. And the inflammatory cytokines mRNA level in hippocampus was significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: FNS treatment alleviates depressive-like behaviors and rCBF in PSD rats model, which could be attributed to its ability to protect cerebellar Purkinje cells and decrease the mRNA level of inflammatory cytokines.",
