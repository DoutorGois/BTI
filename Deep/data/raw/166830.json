     "AB": "The amount of corticosterone bound to proteins in the adenohypophysis and dorsal hippocampus was studied concurrently with the plasma ACTH concentration in 4-week adrenalectomized male rats under steady-state conditions achieved by infusing the steroid at a constant rate for 45 min. Corticosterone binding was measured by gel chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, using a TE buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl. No saturation was observed in whole homogenates and supernatants with increasing plasma corticosterone concentrations. However, corticosterone binding by the pituitary and by one of two types of hippocampal receptors evidenced saturation within our range of corticosterone infusion rates, indeed. Scatchard plots allowed us to distinguish two types of binding sites in the hippocampus. The first, saturated at a low corticosterone concentration has an association constant of 3.0 times 10-8 M-1 with a number of binding sites estimated at 150 times 10- minus 15 mol/mg protein, whereas the second is associated with non-specific binding. The adenohypophysis shows only one kind of binding site with an association constant of 3.6 times 10-8 m- minus 1 and a number of sites estimated at 989 times 10- minus 15 mol/mg protein. A suggestive relationship was observed between ACTH inhibition by corticosterone and saturation of the pituitary binding sites. Our data are consistent with the possible involvement of corticosterone binding by specific sites in the negative feedback regulation of ACTH release.",
