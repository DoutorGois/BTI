     "AB": "The entorhinal cortex provides the major cortical input to the hippocampus, and both structures have been implicated in memory processes. The dynamics of neuronal circuits in the entorhinal-hippocampal system were studied in slices by optical imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution. Reverberation of neural activity was detected in the entorhinal cortex and was more prominent when the inhibition due to gamma-aminobutyric acid was slightly suppressed. Neural activity was transferred in a frequency-dependent way from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus. The entorhinal neuronal circuit could contribute to memory processes by holding information and selectively gating the entry of information into the hippocampus.",
