     "AB": "Taurine has been thought to protect neural cells against cell-damaging conditions to which the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable. We studied now how the release of preloaded [(3)H]taurine is regulated by glutamate receptors in glucose-free media in slices prepared from the mouse hippocampus from developing (7 days old) and young adult (3 months old) mice, using a superfusion system. The lack of glucose enhanced taurine release more from slices from developing mice than from slices from adults. At both ages ionotropic glutamate agonists significantly increased the release in a receptor-mediated manner. Of the metabotropic glutamate receptors those belonging to the group III were effective. The release was enhanced in adult mice but attenuated in developing mice. Both effects were blocked by the receptor antagonists. The results show that glutamate receptors affect taurine release in the absence of glucose in which condition taurine should be neuroprotective.",
