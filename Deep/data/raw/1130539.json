     "AB": "Cardiovascular responses were elicited from 372 histologically verified sites in the amygdala and closely adjacent structures in 82 rats under urethan or chloralose anesthesia. Arterial hypotension was elicited at low current intensities from the medial, central, lateral, and basal nuclei of rats under either anesthetic; the hypotension was still elicited in artificially respired paralyzed rats. Stimulation of the cortical nucleus produced variable changes in arterial pressure. The hypotension elicited under urethan was not found to be correlated with changes in the frequency of electrical activity of hippocampus, amygdala, or septum or to be associated with electrical seizures. Hypertension was usually elicited from the medial nucleus at high current intensities and was attributed to current spread to the cortex ventral to the medial nucleus from which hypertension was elicited at low current intensities. Stimulation of the central, basal, and lateral nuclei under chloralose elicited bradycardia. Lesions of the stria terminalis had no effect on the hypotension, whereas lesions of the ipsilateral medial forebrain bundle abolished this response.",
