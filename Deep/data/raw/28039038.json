     "AB": "Transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) subfamily of cationic channels have emerged as novel players in neural regulation. Unlike other members of TRPV subfamily, TRPV5 and TRPV6 are highly Ca(2+)-selective. Although TRPV5/TRPV6 transcripts are expressed in mouse brain, understanding the full functional spectrum of these ion channels in the brain is however limited due to the lack of information on their neuroanatomical distribution. We have studied TRPV6 in mouse brain in further detail. In the hypothalamus, while Western blot analysis using TRPV6 specific antiserum showed a distinct approximately 95 kDa band corresponding to the molecular weight of TRPV6, transcripts for TRPV6 were detected with RT-PCR. TRPV6-immunoreactive cells/fibers were observed in vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, olfactory bulb, amygdala, hippocampus, septohypothalamic, supraoptic, arcuate (ARC), dorsomedial, and subincertal nuclei. TRPV6-immunoreactive cells/fibers were also observed in the brainstem and cerebellum. Estrogen has emerged as a potential regulator of TRPV6 in peripheral tissues. TRPV6 gene promoter contains estrogen-response element, estrogen activates TRPV6 via estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), and ERalpha-expressing ARC neurons in mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) serve as primary site for estradiol feedback. Using double immunofluorescence, co-expression of TRPV6 and ERalpha was observed in several ARC neurons. MBH of mice during different phases of estrous cycle were subjected to Western blot analysis of TRPV6. Compared to proestrus, a significant reduction (P<0.01) in intensity of TRPV6-immunoreactive band was observed in MBH during metestrus and diestrus phases. While the wide distribution of TRPV6-expressing elements in the brain suggests its role in a range of CNS functions, the ion channel may serve as novel component of the neural pathway mediating effects of estradiol in MBH.",
