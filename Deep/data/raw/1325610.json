     "AB": "Injection of endothelin-1 (9 pmol) into the lateral cerebral ventricle of rats produced barrel-rotations, convulsions, tonic hindlimb extensions, facial clonus, and kinetic ataxia for up to 45 min. Quantitative metabolic autoradiographs produced from the [14C]deoxyglucose method and analyzed over 60 individual brain structures or subregions revealed intense hypermetabolism in periventricular tissues close to the injection site and in many of their efferent projection sites. Histological examination of these areas proved that this dose of endothelin was without toxic or ischemic effects on neurons or glial cells. Structures metabolically affected ipsilateral to injection were caudate nucleus (+164%), lateral septal nucleus (+270%), and two white matter tracts--corpus callosum (+236%) and hippocampal fimbria (+318%). Distant stimulated structures included cerebellar cortical layers, but not cerebellar nuclei or white matter. Increased rates of glucose metabolism among many other nuclei, particularly distinct subunits of the hippocampal formation and structures in contact with the ventricular system, signify that endothelin induced widespread metabolic stimulation over much of the neuraxis. Furthermore, although the 9 pmol concentration of endothelin produced convulsive movements and diverse metabolic stimulation, it did not evoke detectable electroencephalographic seizure activity assessed by intra- or extracerebral electroencephalography. Both the convulsions and hypermetabolic activation were inhibited by intraventricular pretreatment with the dihydropyridine calcium-channel antagonist, nimodipine. The results identify endothelin-1 as a calcium-mediated 'convulsive' peptide with selective stimulatory effects on cerebral glucose metabolism.",
