     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to investigate the contribution of genotype on structural brain abnormalities in schizophrenia. METHOD: Intracranial volumes and volumes of the cerebrum, white and gray matter, lateral and third ventricles, frontal lobes, caudate nucleus, amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and the cerebellum were measured in 32 same-sex siblings discordant for schizophrenia and 32 matched comparison subjects by means of magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Third ventricle volumes did not differ between the schizophrenic patients and their healthy siblings. However, both had higher third ventricle volumes than did the comparison subjects. The schizophrenic patients had lower cerebrum volumes than did the comparison subjects, whereas the cerebrum volume of the healthy siblings did not significantly differ from the patients or comparison subjects. Additionally, patients with schizophrenia displayed a volume reduction of the frontal lobe gray matter and a volume increase of the caudate nuclei and lateral ventricles compared to both their healthy siblings and comparison subjects. Intracranial volume, CSF volume, or volumes of the cerebellum, amygdala, hippocampus, or the parahippocampal gyrus did not significantly differ among the patients, siblings, and comparison subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy siblings share third ventricle enlargement with their affected relatives and may partially display a reduction in cerebral volume. These findings suggest that third ventricular enlargement, and to some extent cerebral volume decrease, may be related to genetic defects that produce a susceptibility to schizophrenia.",
