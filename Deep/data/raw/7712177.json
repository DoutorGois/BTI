     "AB": "Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) is a key enzyme in signal transduction. We have previously demonstrated that an antibody to the PLC isozyme, PLC-delta, intensely stained neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the brain tissue of AD patients [Am. J. Pathol., 139 (1991) 737-742]. To clarify the crucial involvement of abnormal PLC-delta accumulation contributing to the formation of NFT, we performed light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. To determine PLC-delta's association with NFT, its resistance to solubilization was also studied. Anti-PLC-delta antibody marked the same NFT-bearing neurons containing tau immunoreactivity with tau more clearly on NFT filaments and PLC-delta covering it superficially at the light microscope level. The double stained preparations with anti-PLC-delta antibody and bFGF binding suggested that PLC-delta is an intracellular marker and is not retained after neuronal death. Employing immunoperoxidase and immunogold electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, we found that the antibody to PLC-delta reacts mostly with amorphous granular materials, and occasionally with some abnormal filaments within NFT. Nevertheless, PLC-delta in NFT was resistant to removal by high salt or ionic detergent, indicating it is an integral NFT component. These results indicate that antigenic determinants unique to PLC-delta are mainly present intraneuronally on the amorphous granular components of NFT as well as the abnormal filaments, suggesting PLC-delta's interactions and possible role in the formation of intraneuronal filamentous inclusions in AD.",
