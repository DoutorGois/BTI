     "AB": "The effect of daily intraperitoneal injections of GM1 ganglioside on retrograde degeneration in the basal forebrain has been examined, using a monoclonal antibody directed against choline acetyltransferase to identify the cholinergic neurones. Rats underwent extensive damage of the cerebral cortex and underlying hippocampus. From the day of operation on, they received daily injections of ganglioside. After a survival of 30 days, the animals were killed and the cholinergic cells of the basal forebrain were examined. These were compared with material treated in the same way from animals who had received the injections of ganglioside but no lesion, animals who had been operated upon but without the ganglioside treatment, and normal animals. Intraperitoneal ganglioside administration markedly reduces the retrograde death of the cholinergic neurones of the medial septal nucleus and abolishes the shrinkage of the remaining neurones following hippocampal damage.",
