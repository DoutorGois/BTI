     "AB": "Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) differential display directed to cloning transcripts related to retention performance for the inhibitory avoidance learning task, we have isolated two rat cDNA fragments homologous to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) cDNA. The GFAP upper cDNA represents a new GFAP mRNA isotype which has a 7 bp insertion in the 3'UTR. Further analyses indicated that retention performance in rats containing only the new GFAP mRNA isotype was significantly better than that of rats containing both the new GFAP mRNA isotype and the standard GFAP mRNA simultaneously. These results suggest that expression of the GFAP isotypes may be related to memory retention in rats.",
