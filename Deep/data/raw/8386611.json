     "AB": "The rapid secretion of ACTH in response to nicotine is mediated by a central mechanism involving brainstem catecholaminergic regions. To identify specific brainstem regions involved in activating the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and other areas of the brain by iv nicotine, immunocytochemical detection of cFos protein was used as a marker for neuronal activation. Nicotine (0.05 mg/kg) stimulated cFos expression in the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pcPVN; containing CRH-positive neurons mediating ACTH secretion); this correlated with the expression of cFos in the A2 (norepinephrinergic) and C2 (epinephrinergic) regions of the brainstem nucleus tractus solitarius, which project directly to the pcPVN. The selectivity of this brainstem activation was shown by the absence of responses in the locus coeruleus (LC), A1, and C1 catecholaminergic regions to this low dose of nicotine. In contrast, a high dose of nicotine (0.1 mg/kg), which produced a brief episode of tremor, was required for expression of cFos in the LC. This was associated with a further increase in the number of cFos-positive cells in the PVN, primarily through recruitment in the magnocellular region, a known projection field of LC. The higher dose of nicotine also induced cFos in the vasopressinergic region of the supraoptic nucleus (SON), whereas the lower dose of nicotine exclusively induced cFos in the oxytocinergic region of the SON. Limbic regions that receive catecholaminergic inputs, such as the the central nucleus of the amygdala (involved in PVN regulation) and the cingulate gyrus of the cortex, showed a dose-dependent increase in the number of cFos-positive cells after nicotine, whereas the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus only responded to the high dose. Thus, nicotine is a potent and selective stimulus for neuronal activation in brainstem catecholaminergic regions and their projection fields in the pcPVN and SON, which regulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and vasopressin/oxytocin secretion, respectively.",
