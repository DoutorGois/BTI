     "AB": "To determine whether apoptotic process is involved in the delayed neuronal death in hippocampal CA1 region following forebrain ischemia in gerbils, time dependent activation of caspase and DNA fragmentation were evaluated by immuno-staining and terminal dUTP nick-end-labeling staining, respectively. After transient forebrain ischemia in gerbils, activation of apoptosis related caspase, including caspase-3, was apparent, and it preceded DNA fragmentation in CA1 region. These observations suggest that apoptotic process is involved in hippocampal delayed neuronal death.",
