     "AB": "Cleavage of the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule by proteases is a prerequisite for the pathogenicity and even for the neurovirulence of influenza A viruses. WSN, a neurovirulent virus, adapted to mouse brain, grew in vitro in several types of cells including neuroblastoma cells in the absence of trypsin. When mice were intracerebrally inoculated with WSN, the viral antigen was found in the substantia nigra zona compacta and hippocampus. The mice inoculated with viruses isolated from children with acute encephalopathy associated with an influenza virus infection, on the other hand, showed no neurological symptoms. Furthermore, these viruses did not grow in the human neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cells. Since 1991, most of the human influenza A viruses have not agglutinated chicken erythrocytes. Whether this altered receptor binding specificity is related to the occurrence of influenza encephalitis and encephalopathy is now under investigation.",
