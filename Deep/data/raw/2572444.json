     "AB": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether effects of temporo-entorhinal disconnections on acquisition and retention of a visual discrimination task might be associated with neurochemical dysfunctions. The results revealed that the present lesions impaired both acquisition and retention of the discrimination task. This impairment was accompanied by decreased glutamergic activity in both temporal and entorhinal cortices. No changes were seen in levels of acetylcholine or GABA. Further, the distribution of glutamate/aspartate was related to both regional and hemispheric differences. The results are discussed in terms of a highly integrative role of the lateral entorhinal cortex and in terms of other putative neurotransmitter systems involved in the function of memory.",
