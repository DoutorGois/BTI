The data obtained from stereological studies of brains from schizophrenic patients, including studies of the thalamus, hippocampus, and cortex, are discussed and suggest a central role of the thalamic nuclei in the etiology of the disease. The basic stereological tools are presented and possible biases in quantification studies are discussed.",
