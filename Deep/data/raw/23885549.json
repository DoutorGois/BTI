     "AB": "In patients with epileptic lesions in the hippocampus as well as in the temporal lobe and hippocampus simultaneously, studies were made on the perception of sound signals imitating sound source movement. It was established that hippocampal lesion results in disturbance of estimation of sound spatial characteristics which manifests in a change accuracy of localization and shortening of subjective sound image movement trajectory. Maximum disturbances of localization function are observed during lesions of hippocampus and temporal lobe. Possible neurophysiological mechanism underling observed disturbances are considered.",
