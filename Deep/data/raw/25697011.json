     "AB": "According to the Neurodevelopmental hypothesis, the long-lasting cognitive deficit in schizophrenia and other types of neuropathology may occur by injurious factors, such as hypoxia, traumas, infections that take place during pre- and postnatal development, at least at early stages. These pathological conditions are often associated with the high production of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1B (IL-1B) by the cells of immune and nervous systems. We investigated the expression of genes involved in the neuroplastic regulation (Fgf2 and Timp2) in medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal and ventral regions of hippocampus of adult rats that were treated with IL-1beta between P15 and P21. The learning impairment in IL-1beta-treated rats is accompanied by lower FGF-2 mRNA levels in medial prefrontal cortex and ventral (not dorsal) hippocampus, but TIMP-1 was not affected. No differences in TIMP-1 and FGF-2 mRNA expressions were observed in untrained IL-1beta-treated when compared to control rats.",
