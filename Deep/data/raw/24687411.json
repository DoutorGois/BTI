     "AB": "RATIONALE: We have recently shown that chronic exposure to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"ecstasy\") of adolescent mice exacerbates dopamine neurotoxicity and neuroinflammatory effects elicited by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in the substantia nigra and striatum at adulthood. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated whether the amplification of MPTP effects by previous treatment with MDMA extends to the limbic and cortical regions and consequently affects cognitive performance. METHODS: Mice received MDMA (10 mg/kg, twice a day/twice a week) for 9 weeks, followed by MPTP (20 mg/kg x 4 administrations), starting 2 weeks after MDMA discontinuation. Complement type 3 receptor (CD11b) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in both the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to measure microglia and astroglia activation. These neurochemical evaluations were paired with an assessment of cognitive performance by means of the novel object recognition (NOR) and spontaneous alternation tasks. RESULTS: MPTP administration to MDMA-pretreated mice elicited a stronger activation of CD11b and GFAP in both the hippocampus and the mPFC compared with either substance administered alone. Furthermore, NOR performance was lower in MDMA-pretreated mice administered MPTP compared with mice that received either substance alone. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that MDMA-MPTP negative interactions extend to the limbic and cortical regions and may result in cognitive impairment, providing further evidence that exposure to MDMA may amplify the effects of later neurotoxic insults.",
