     "AB": "Pleckstrin homology and leucine rich repeat protein phosphatases (PHLPPs) are a novel class of potent protein kinase B (AKT) inhibitors that have been intensely investigated in relation to AKT activity in cancer. Currently, our understanding of the role of PHLPP1alpha in the central nervous system is limited. In this study, we characterized PHLPP protein expression and target kinases in the adult hippocampus. We directly verify PHLPP1alpha inhibits AKT in hippocampal neurons and demonstrate a novel role for PHLPP1beta/SCOP, to promote AKT activation. PHLPP1alpha expression changes dramatically in the hippocampus during development, constituting the most abundant PHLPP protein in adult neurons. Further, while all PHLPP proteins could be observed in the cytosolic fraction, only PHLPP1alpha could be localized to the nucleus. The results provide unique evidence for a divergence in the function of PHLPP1alpha and PHLPP1beta/SCOP, and suggest that PHLPP1alpha plays a major role in regulating AKT signaling in neurons.",
