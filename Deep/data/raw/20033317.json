     "AB": "The effects of intracerebroventricular administration of fragment (25-35) of beta-amyloid peptide [Abeta(25-35)] on cell proliferation in the subventricular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in adult rats were analyzed. Animals received doses of 15 nmol of pre-aggregated Abeta(25-35) or the Abeta(35-25) control peptide, or solvent (sterile water) into the lateral ventricles. On post-injection days 1-5, rats received intraperitoneal injections of the thymidine analog 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). BrdU incorporated into DNA was detected immunohistochemically on frontal brain sections six and 12 days after peptide administration. At six days, the numbers of BrdU-containing cells in the subventricular zone showed no differences between the study groups. At 12 days, the total number of BrdU-positive cells decreased significantly in all study groups. At the same time, the number of labeled cells in rats given Abeta(25-35) was significantly greater in this brain zone than in animals given water or the control peptide. Thus, Abeta(25-35) significantly increased cell proliferation in the subventricular zone after intracerebroventricular administration.",
