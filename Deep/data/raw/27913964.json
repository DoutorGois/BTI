     "AB": "Streptozotocin has been widely used to mimic some aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, especially in mice, several characteristics involved in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD pathology are not well known. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate temporally the expression of AD-related proteins, such as amyloid-beta (Abeta), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), synapsin, axonal neurofilaments, and phosphorylated Tau in the hippocampus following intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of STZ in adult mice. We also analyzed the impact of STZ on short- and long-term memory by novel object recognition test. Male mice were injected with STZ or citrate buffer, and AD-related proteins were evaluated by immunoblotting assays in the hippocampus at 7, 14, or 21 days after injection. No differences between the groups were found at 7 days. The majority of AD markers evaluated were found altered at 14 days, i.e., the STZ group showed increased amyloid-beta protein and neurofilament expression, increased phosphorylation of Tau protein, and decreased synapsin expression levels compared to controls. Except for synapsin, all of these neurochemical changes were transient and did not last up to 21 days of STZ injection. Moreover, both short-term and long-term memory deficits were demonstrated after STZ treatment at 14 and 21 days after STZ treatment.",
