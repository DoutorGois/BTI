     "AB": "The synthesis, scavenging activity, and cytoprotective profiles of histidyl-containing carnosine analogues bearing hydrazide or 1,2-diol moieties is reported. Some compounds have demonstrated higher aldehyde-sequestering efficiency than carnosine and were also efficient in protecting SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and rat hippocampal neurons from 4-hydroxy-trans-2,3-nonenal (HNE)-mediated death. The cytoprotective efficacy of these compounds suggests their potential use as therapeutic agents for disorders that involve excessive membrane lipids peroxidation and HNE-mediated neuronal toxicity.",
