Several previously described disorders of the central nervous system were observed in these brains as well as disorders not previously recognised in Britain, including bilateral vacuolation of the substantia nigra, hippocampal sclerosis with brainstem neuronal chromatolysis and necrosis, focal symmetrical encephalomalacia and meningio-angiomatosis. Severe cerebellar dysplasia consistent with pre-natal bovine viral diarrhoea--mucosal disease virus infection or mineralisation of the blood vessels of the basal ganglia were interpreted respectively as congenital changes or changes due to ageing and were considered to be of no clinical significance.",
