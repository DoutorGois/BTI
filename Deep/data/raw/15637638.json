     "AB": "Excitotoxic neonatal ventral hippocampal (NVH) lesion in rats is considered as a putative animal model of schizophrenia as lesioned animals show characteristic post-pubertal emergence of neurochemical and behavioral abnormalities analogous to some of those seen in this disease. Converging evidence points to the involvement of central cholinergic system in this neuropsychiatric disorder, and our previous studies have suggested that cholinergic neurotransmission may be altered in post-pubertal NVH lesioned rats. We investigated here muscarinic receptor reactivity in NVH lesioned animals by measuring the effects of the muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine on physiological responses known to be modulated by these receptors such as body temperature, salivation, tremor, pain, and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle (PPI). Quantitative receptor autoradiography revealed that post-pubertal NVH lesioned animals display increased levels of [3H]pirenzepine/M1-like and [3H]AFDX-384/M2-like receptor binding sites in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, and in subareas of the dorsal hippocampus. Moreover, in response to the systemic administration of oxotremorine (0.25 mg/kg), post-pubertal NVH lesioned rats exhibited increases in salivation and tremor, and a greater reduction in body temperature compared to sham control animals. Increases in the hot-plate latency were also observed suggesting enhanced antinociceptive effects of oxotremorine in post-pubertal NVH lesioned animals. Finally, oxotremorine (0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg) disrupted PPI in post-pubertal sham control rats while the muscarinic receptor antagonist biperiden (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) normalized this behavior in NVH lesioned rats. Taken together, these findings reveal that post-pubertal NVH lesioned rats display enhanced muscarinic receptor responsiveness, which may relate to some behavioral abnormalities reported in this animal model.",
