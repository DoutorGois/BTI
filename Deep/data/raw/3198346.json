     "AB": "Water-soluble nonionic x-ray contrast media have greatly improved the quality and safety of myelography. Toxic side effects are still observed however. The side effects are generally worse with the first nonionic agent, metrizamide, which has a glucoselike side group. Two in vitro models were developed to examine the effects of contrast media on glucose metabolism. Using rat hippocampus slices, the authors observed significant depression of carbon dioxide production by metrizamide and by deoxyglucose, a known metabolic inhibitor. Iohexol and iopamidol did not cause significant depressions. In rat brain synaptosomes the authors did not observe a depression of the uptake of deoxyglucose 14C by any media tested. These studies indicate that metrizamide can create metabolic depression but that it does not compete with glucose for the membrane glucose carrier.",
