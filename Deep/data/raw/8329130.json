     "AB": "Rats with aspiration or excitotoxic (NMDA) lesions of the parahippocampal region were trained on a series of behavioral tasks which consisted of: (1) a test of spatial memory (discrete trial rewarded alternation), (2) a black-white discrimination, and (3) a test of non-spatial memory commonly used in primate models of amnesia (visual concurrent object discrimination). Rats in both lesion groups were severely impaired on the concurrent discrimination, even though they were able to learn the black-white discrimination normally. Animals with aspiration lesions were also impaired on the spatial memory task, whereas those with NMDA lesions did not differ from controls. The results indicate that concurrent object discrimination is a particularly sensitive measure of hippocampal/parahippocampal functions and suggest that these structures in the rat may serve mnemonic functions which are qualitatively similar to those of human and non-human primates.",
