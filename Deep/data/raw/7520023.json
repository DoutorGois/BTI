     "AB": "A panel of four anti-MAP1B antibodies have been used to study the presence and post-translational modification of MAP1B in primary cultures of glial cells. Two antibodies (150 and 125) recognize phosphorylated epitopes whereas the other two (531 and 842) recognize non-phosphorylated phosphorylatable epitopes on the MAP1B molecule. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis with antibodies 531 and 842 revealed the presence of small amounts of MAP1B-like immunoreactivity in type 1 astrocytes and a greater content in more differentiated glial cells found in long-term cultures. By immunofluorescence, these latter cells gave positive immunostaining with antibody 125, which recognizes a phosphorylated epitope phosphorylated by casein kinase II. Antibody 150, which reacts to a phosphorylated epitope on the MAP1B molecule, did not show any detectable immunoreactivity in glial cells cultures, either by immunofluorescence or Western blot. All four antibodies recognized hippocampal neurones in culture, with especially intense immunostaining in cell bodies and axons, and reacted strongly with protein present in hippocampal neurones extracts showing an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of brain MAP1B. In mixed optic nerve glial cell cultures, anti-galactocerebroside (GalC) positive cells gave also positive staining with antibodies 531 and 125. We propose that MAP1B is present in cultures of glial cells in moderate amounts and with a phosphorylation state different than in neurones. Thus, less differentiated glial cells, such as type 1 astrocytes, have a small amount of MAP1B, mainly in a non-phosphorylated form, which is spread diffusely in the cytoplasm and probably does not interact with microtubules. More differentiated glial cells, such as oligodendrocytes, show a greater content in MAP1B which, at least in part, is phosphorylated by a casein kinase II-like activity.",
