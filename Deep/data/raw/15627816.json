     "AB": "The aim of the study was to investigate neurochemical changes in a kainic acid (KA; 10 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced spontaneous recurrent seizure model of epilepsy, 6 months after the initial KA-induced seizures. The neuronal markers of cholinergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic systems, i.e. choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activities, and a marker for neuropeptide, i.e. level of somatostatin, have been investigated. The brain regions investigated were the hippocampus, amygdala/piriform cortex, caudate nucleus, substantia nigra and the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices. Six months after KA injection, reduced ChAT activity was observed in the amygdala/piriform cortex (47% of control; p<0.001), increased ChAT activity in the hippocampus (119% of control; p<0.01) and normal ChAT activity in the other brain regions. The activity of GAD was significantly increased in all analysed cortical regions (between 146 and 171% of control), in the caudate nucleus (144% of control; p<0.01) and in the substantia nigra (126% of control; p<0.01), whereas in the amygdala/piriform cortex, the GAD activity was moderately lowered. The somatostatin level was significantly increased in all cortical regions (between 162 and 221% of control) as well as in the hippocampus (119% of control), but reduced in the amygdala/piriform cortex (45% of control; p<0.01). Six months after KA injection, the somatostatin:GAD ratio was lowered in the amygdala/piriform cortex (49% of control) and in the caudate nucleus (41% of control), whereas it was normal in the hippocampus and moderately increased in the cortical brain regions. A positive correlation was found between seizure severity and the reduction of both ChAT activities and somatostatin levels in the amygdala/piriform cortex. The results show a specific pattern of changes for cholinergic, GABAergic and somatostatinergic activities in the chronic KA model for epilepsy. The revealed data suggest a functional role for them in the new network that follows spontaneous repetitive seizures.",
