     "AB": "Different groups of rats received combined or separate administration of different doses of piracetam (P1:100, P2:200, and P4:400 mg/kg) and choline (C1:100 and C2:200 mg/kg). Compared to control treatment, C1 significantly improved performance in a delayed alternation (DA) task, while P1, P2, P4 or P1C1 had no effect. Moreover, rats receiving P2C1 and P4C1 were significantly inferior in acquiring DA to rats receiving the vehicle or separate administration of P1, P2 or C1. The different treatments with combined or separate administration of P and C had no effect on spontaneous locomotor activity and two-way avoidance conditioning. In a recognition-task only groups C1 and P4 were able to discriminate between familiar and new objects. The combined or separate administration of P1 and C1 on NA, DA, DOPAC, 5-HT, 5-HIAA levels, CAT activity and choline uptake were measured in frontal cortex and hippocampus: the only significant effect was a 5-HT increase in the hippocampus of rats treated with C1.",
