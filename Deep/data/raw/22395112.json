     "AB": "Some typical immune proteins are expressed in the nervous system, among which the paired-immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB) is a receptor for major histocompatibility complex class I antigen (MHC-I), but may play a physiological role in the brain for neuronal circuitry stability by inhibiting synaptic plasticity. Chronic neuroinflammation is common to many neurodegenerative diseases and is often associated with neuronal/synaptic damage and dysfunction. Here we examined the expression of PirB in the rat brain following intracerebral application of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which has been shown to induce proinflammatory changes and cognitive deficits in rodents. One month after unilateral intrahippocampal LPS injection (10 mug in 4 mul phosphate-buffered saline, PBS), increased protein levels and immunoreactivity of PirB were detected in the ipsilateral hippocampal formation and cortex of the experimental group relative to vehicle (PBS) control. The increased PirB labeling was localized to astrocytes and neurons. Reduced synaptophysin protein levels and immunoreactivity were also found in the ipsilateral hippocampal formation and cortex in LPS-treated rats relative to controls. Morris water maze tests indicated that hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were impaired in LPS-treated animals. Our findings add new experimental data for an upregulation of immune proteins in neuronal and glial cells in the brain in a model of endotoxin-induced neuroinflammation, synaptic alteration, and cognitive decline. The results suggest that PirB modulation may be involved in the pathological process under neurodegenerative conditions.",
