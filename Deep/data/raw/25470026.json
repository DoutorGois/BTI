     "AB": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, a cytokine that can be expressed in the brain, is a key regulator of the brain's responses to injury and inflammation. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder, involves inflammatory processes in the brain in addition to the hallmarks, amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Recently, we have shown that T-helper (Th) 17 cells, a subpopulation of CD4+ T-cells with high proinflammation, also participate in the brain inflammatory process of AD. However, it is poorly known whether TGF-beta1 ameliorates the lymphocyte-mediated neuroinflammation and, thereby, alleviates neurodegeneration in AD. Herein, we administered TGF-beta1 via the intracerebroventricle (ICV) in AD model rats, by Abeta1-42 injection in both sides of the hippocampus, to show the neuroprotection of TGF-beta1. The TGF-beta1 administration after the Abeta1-42 injection ameliorated cognitive deficit and neuronal loss and apoptosis, reduced amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, elevated protein phosphatase (PP)2A expression, attenuated glial activation and alleviated the imbalance of the pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory responses of T-lymphocytes, compared to the Abeta1-42 injection alone. These findings demonstrate that TGF-beta1 provides protection against AD neurodegeneration and suggest that the TGF-beta1 neuroprotection is implemented by the alleviation of glial and T-cell-mediated neuroinflammation.",
