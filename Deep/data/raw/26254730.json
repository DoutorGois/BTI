     "AB": "We have explored the potential neuroprotective effect of local lentiviraly-mediated overexpression of nerve growth factor (NGF) on in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat hippocampus under pathological conditions. The suspension of lentiviral particles was prepared using a genetic construct containing the human NGF gene under the control of a neuron-specific CaMKII promoter. Two weeks after the viral injection NGF concentration in the hippocampus doubled. In vivo recordings of total electrical activity in the dentate gyrus were performed. While the increased expression of NGF did not affect the amplitude of evoked postsynaptic potentials recorded after a high-frequency stimulation of the perforant path, it prevented the LTP decline induced by the i.c.v. administration of 50 nM beta-amyloid (25-35) 1h prior to tetanization. Our results demonstrate that increased endogenous NGF concentration can rescue hippocampal neuronal function from beta-amyloid peptide induced impairment.",
