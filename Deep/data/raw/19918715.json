     "AB": "Puerarin, the main isoflavone found in the root of the wild leguminous creeper Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi, is known to protect the brain from ischemia-induced injuries. However, its effect on acidosis, a byproduct of brain ischemia and one factor promoting cell death, remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of puerarin on acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), which are reported to be activated by extracellular acidosis. Using the MTT assay and Hoechst/PI staining, we showed that puerarin could prevent hippocampal cell death during extracellular low pH. Data from whole-cell patch clamp recordings demonstrated that puerarin decreased the amplitude of ASIC currents and accelerated the desensitization of ASICs. Puerarin also reduced the amplitude of homomeric ASIC1a channels in CHO cells expressing pECFP-ASIC1a. Collectively, our study demonstrated that puerarin prevented hippocampal cells from acidosis-induced death via ASIC blockage, providing a mechanical insight into the neuroprotective effects of puerarin during brain ischemia.",
