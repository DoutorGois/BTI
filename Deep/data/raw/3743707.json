     "AB": "Intracerebroventricular kainic acid produces in rats brain lesions similar to Ammon's horn sclerosis in humans. To test the hypothesis that these lesions result indirectly from prolonged seizure activity and not from a direct action of kainic acid on the neurons that are destroyed, the effects of intracerebroventricular kainic acid and bicuculline methiodide were compared. Although bicuculline methiodide seizures differed dramatically from kainic acid seizures, both electrographically and behaviorally, the resulting brain lesions were similar for a given total limbic seizure duration. These results, in combination with other data, support the view that lesions made by intracerebroventricular administration of convulsants are indeed caused by prolonged limbic seizures. The total duration of seizure activity appears to be one important variable.",
