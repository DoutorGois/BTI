     "AB": "The main objective of the present study is to investigate the possible effects of chronic ethanol consumption and ethanol withdrawal on cyclic guanosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cGMP) levels in cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus of rat brain. Ethanol was given to female Wistar rats (225-270g) by a liquid diet for 21 days. cGMP levels were measured in respective brain regions using an EIA kit at 7th, 14th and 21st days of ethanol ingestion and at 6th and 24th h of ethanol withdrawal. cGMP levels in cortex, striatum and hippocampus but not hypothalamus were found significantly increased at 14th and 21st days of ethanol consumption. The most prominent increase was observed in striatal tissues (approximately 350%). cGMP levels of striatum and hippocampus were still remaining significantly high at 6th h of ethanol withdrawal. Blood ethanol levels were found as 115.60, 50.0 and 7.0mg/dl just before and after 6 and 24h of ethanol withdrawal, respectively and audiogenic seizures also occurred at 6th h of ethanol withdrawal with an incidence of 75% in individual parallel groups. Our results suggest that changes of cGMP levels in cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus might participate in the mechanism of ethanol dependence and withdrawal in rats.",
