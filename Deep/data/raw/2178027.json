     "AB": "Intact nerve endings (synaptosomes) have been isolated from spiking and non-spiking temporal cortex and hippocampus samples from 14 patients immediately after temporal lobectomy for intractable epilepsy. Synaptosomes were also prepared from frozen brain samples of humans with no known neurological diseases. Four adenosine triphosphatase (ATP)-metabolizing enzymes (ecto-ATPase, ecto-adenylate kinase, Na+,K(+)-ATPase and Ca2+,Mg2(+)-ATPase) were assayed in the synaptosomal fractions from the most spiking temporal cortex area (including focus) as well as from various regions of the hippocampus, and compared with enzyme activities of the least spiking or non-spiking temporal cortex of the same patient. Enzyme activities of the epileptic brain samples were also compared with values measured in the corresponding regions of normal brains. Ecto-ATPase activities of epileptic temporal cortex were decreased (approximately 30%) in both comparisons. In contrast to these findings, a substantially increased (in some cases 300%) ecto-ATPase activity was observed in the posterior part of epileptic hippocampus. We suggest that the higher than normal ecto-ATPase activity in this particular hippocampal region is related to the presence of granule cells and their efferent (or afferent) synaptic connections. The synaptosomal ecto-adenylate kinase showed alterations opposite to the changes found for the ecto-ATPase. The intrasynaptosomal ATPase (Na+,K(+)- and Ca2+,Mg2(+)-) were decreased in the epileptic hippocampus-, but not in the temporal cortex samples, in relation to the corresponding normal enzyme activity values. These complex alterations in synaptosomal ATP-metabolizing enzyme activities may be important elements of seizure development and maintenance in human temporal lobe epilepsy.",
