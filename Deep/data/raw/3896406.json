     "AB": "Inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons were identified in the dentate gyrus of seizure-sensitive (SS) and seizure-resistant (SR) gerbils by immunocytochemical localization of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the synthesizing enzyme for GABA. Increases in both the number of GAD+ somata and terminals were found in the dentate gyrus of the SS brains compared to the SR. The magnitude of the increase was positively correlated with the recorded seizure intensity. The increased number of GABAergic neurons in the dentate gyrus of SS gerbils could result in disinhibition of the granule cells, thereby allowing propagation of epileptiform activity through the hippocampus.",
