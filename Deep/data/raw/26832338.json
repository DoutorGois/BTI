     "AB": "RATIONALE: Aberrations in cellular acetate-utilization processes leading to global histone hypoacetylation have been implicated in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. OBJECTIVES: Here, we investigated the role of acetate supplementation in the form of glyceryl triacetate (GTA) for the ability to restore the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-induced histone hypoacetylation and to ameliorate associated behavioral phenotypes in mice. RESULTS: Taking cues from the studies in SH-SY5Y cells, we monitored acetylation status of specific lysine residues of histones H3 and H4 (H3K9 and H4K8) to determine the impact of oral GTA supplementation in vivo. Mice treated chronically with MK-801 (10 days; 0.15 mg/kg daily) induced hypoacetylation of H3K9 and H4K8 in the hippocampus. Daily oral supplementation of GTA (2.9 g/kg) was able to prevent this MK801-induced hypoacetylation significantly. Though MK-801-stimulated decreases in acetyl-H3K9 and acetyl-H4K8 were found to be associated with ERK1/2 activation, GTA seemed to act independent of this pathway. Simultaneously, GTA administration was able to attenuate the chronic MK-801-induced cognitive behavior phenotypes in elevated plus maze and novel object recognition tests. Not only MK-801, GTA also demonstrated protective effects against behavioral phenotypes generated by another NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine. Acute (single injection) ketamine-mediated hyperactivity phenotype and chronic (10 days treatment) ketamine-induced phenotype of exaggerated immobility in forced swim test were ameliorated by GTA. CONCLUSION: The signature behavioral phenotypes induced by acute and chronic regimen of NMDA receptor antagonists seemed to be attenuated by GTA. This study thus provides a therapeutic paradigm of using dietary acetate supplement in psychiatric disorders.",
