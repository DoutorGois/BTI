     "AB": "The distribution of melanin-concentrating hormone-like immunoreactivity (MCH-LI) in 41 microdissected brain and spinal cord regions was determined using radioimmunoassay with antibodies to salmon MCH. The highest concentration of MCH-LI was detected just ventral to the zona incerta (subzona incerta) (2923.2 fmol/mg protein). Very high concentrations of MCH-LI (greater than 1000 fmol/mg protein) were detected also in the nucleus of the diagonal band, medial forebrain bundle, posterior hypothalamic nucleus and medial mammillary nucleus. High concentrations of the peptide (between 500-1000 fmol/mg protein) were measured in 11 brain regions, including bed nucleus of stria terminalis, paraventricular nucleus, anterior hypothalamic nucleus, median eminence, parabrachial nucleus. Moderate concentrations of MCH-LI (between 250-500 fmol/mg protein) were measured in 16 brain regions, such as frontal cortex, central amygdaloid nucleus, medial septum, periventricular nucleus (preoptic) and nucleus of the solitary tract. Low concentrations of MCH-LI (less than 250 fmol/mg protein) were measured in 9 brain regions such as cortical areas, hippocampus, caudate nucleus and substantia nigra. Cervical spinal cord and neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland contain low concentrations of the peptide.",
