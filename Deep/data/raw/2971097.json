     "AB": "Rat hippocampal 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) binding sites were solubilized with a yield of 34% using 3-[3-(cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS, 10 mM) as detergent. Kinetic analyses of [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([3H]8-OH-DPAT) binding indicated that the 5-HT1A sites exhibit the same properties in the soluble form as in the membrane-bound form. Furthermore, a positive correlation (r = 0.988) was found between the respective pIC50 values of a series of agonists and antagonists to inhibit [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding to either soluble or membrane-bound 5-HT1A sites. Gel filtration through Sephacryl S-400 as well as chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-agarose did not affect the modulation by guanine nucleotides (5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate) of [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding which suggests that the 5-HT1A binding subunit is a glycoprotein tightly attached to a G protein even in its soluble form. The [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding material eluted from Sephacryl S-400 had an apparent molecular mass of 155 kilodaltons, as expected from a heterodimer with one binding subunit (approximately 60 kilodaltons) and one G protein (approximately 80 kilodaltons). Marked enrichment in 5-HT1A binding sites relative to other soluble proteins was found in the peak fractions eluted from Sephacryl S-400 (by sixfold) and WGA-agarose (by 26-fold) columns, suggesting that these chromatographic steps might be of interest for the purification of central 5-HT1A receptors.",
