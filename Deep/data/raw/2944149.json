     "AB": "Influence of propranolol (5 mg/kg i.p.) on rhythmic metrazol activity (RMA) was studied in 11 male albino rats with chronically implanted cortical as well as subcortical (thalamic ventrobasal complex and dorsal hippocampus) electrodes. Metrazol was injected subcutaneously at a low dose of 30 mg/kg. Another group of five rats was used to study the action of propranolol on spontaneously appearing episodes of rhythmic spikes as well as on vigilance. The incidence of both rhythmic metrazol activity and episodes was significantly increased by propranolol. The latency to the first burst of rhythmic metrazol activity and to the maximum of its incidence was significantly shortened by propranolol. Propranolol also increased the incidence of relaxed wakefulness and delayed the appearance of slow wave sleep. The facilitation of RMA and spontaneous episodes could not be explained only by the increased amount of relaxed wakefulness, i.e. the vigilance level necessary for these two phenomena, because these changes did not coincide in time. In two animals, the combination of propranolol and metrazol led to the appearance of ictal activity which was sometimes accompanied by partial clonic convulsions. This phenomenon was never seen after metrazol alone (30 mg/kg s.c.) in control recordings. Propranolol was found to potentiate the possible models of human absences--spontaneous episodes, RMA and minimal clonic seizures.",
