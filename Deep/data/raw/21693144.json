     "AB": "Impairment in the activity and expression of glutamate transporters has been found in experimental models of epilepsy in adult animals. However, there are few studies investigating alterations on glutamate transporters caused by epilepsy in newborn animals, especially in the early periods after seizures. In this study, alterations in the hippocampal glutamate transporters activity and immunocontent were investigated in neonatal rats (7 days old) submitted to kainate-induced seizures model. Glutamate uptake, glutamate transporters (GLT-1, GLAST, EAAC1) and glutamine synthetase (GS) were assessed in hippocampal slices obtained 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 60 days after seizures. Immunoreactivity for hippocampal GFAP, NeuN and DAPI were assessed 24 h after seizure. Behavioral analysis (elevated-plus maze and inhibitory avoidance task) was also investigated in the adult animals (60 days old). The decrease on glutamate uptake was observed in hippocampal slices obtained 24 h after seizures. The immunocontent of GLT-1 increased at 12 h and decreased at 24 h (+62% and -20%, respectively), while GLAST increased up to 48 h after seizures. No alterations were observed for EAAC1 and GS. It should be mentioned that there were no long-term changes in tested glutamate transporters at 60 days after kainate treatment. GFAP immunoreactivity increased in all hippocampal subfields (CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus) with no alterations in NeuN and DAPI staining. In the adulthood, kainate-treated rats showed anxiety-related behavior and lower performance in the inhibitory avoidance task. Our findings indicate that acute modifications on hippocampal glutamate transporters triggered by a single convulsive event in early life may play a role in the behavioral alterations observed in adulthood.",
