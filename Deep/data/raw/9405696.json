     "AB": "We have isolated a novel cDNA, that appears to represent a new class of ion channels, by using the yeast two-hybrid system and the SH3 domain of the neural form of Src (N-src) as a bait. The encoded polypeptide, BCNG-1, is distantly related to cyclic nucleotide-gated channels and the voltage-gated channels, Eag and H-erg. BCNG-1 is expressed exclusively in the brain, as a glycosylated protein of approximately 132 kDa. Immunohistochemical analysis indicates that BCNG-1 is preferentially expressed in specific subsets of neurons in the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, in particular pyramidal neurons and basket cells. Within individual neurons, the BCNG-1 protein is localized to either the dendrites or the axon terminals depending on the cell type. Southern blot analysis shows that several other BCNG-related sequences are present in the mouse genome, indicating the emergence of an entire subfamily of ion channel coding genes. These findings suggest the existence of a new type of ion channel, which is potentially able to modulate membrane excitability in the brain and could respond to regulation by cyclic nucleotides.",
