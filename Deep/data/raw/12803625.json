     "AB": "The evolutionary history of the endangered Knysna seahorse, Hippocampus capensis, and the extent of gene flow among its three known populations, were investigated using 138 mitochondrial DNA control region sequences. Similarly high levels of genetic diversity were found in two of the populations (Knysna and Keurbooms Estuaries), whereas diversity in the third population (Swartvlei Estuary) was lower. Although most haplotypes are shared between at least two populations, based on the haplotype frequency distributions the three assemblages constitute distinct management units. The extant population structure of H. capensis suggests that the Knysna seahorse originated in the large Knysna Estuary. The presence of seahorses in the two smaller estuaries is either the result of a vicariance event at the beginning of the present interglacial period, colonization of the estuaries via the sea, or a combination of the two.",
