     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between basic expression level of NMDA receptor NR1 subunit protein in hippocampus and learning ability of rats. METHODS: Using a novel-object recognition model and Morris water maze,the novel-object recognition ability and spatial memory of SD rats were ranked, and grouped as the high (top 20 %) and the low (bottom 20%), respectively. NR1 subunit protein levels in hippocampus were measured by quantitative immunoblotting with NR1 subunit specific antibody. RESULT: The level of NR1 subunit protein in hippocampus in the high novel-object recognition ability group was 60% (P<0.01), higher than that in the low one, and in the high spatial memory group it was 45.4 % (P<0.05), higher than that in the low one, respectively. CONCLUSION: The basic expression level of NR1 subunit protein in hippocampus is related to novel-object recognition ability and spatial memory of rats.",
