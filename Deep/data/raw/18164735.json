     "AB": "Stress and depression cause structural changes in the hippocampal formation. Some of these can be reversed by chronic antidepressant treatment. In the present study, we examined the changes in the total number of granule cells and the volume of the granule cell layer after exposing rats to chronic mild stress and chronic escitalopram treatment. Furthermore, we investigated which classes of immature granule cells are affected by stress and targeted by escitalopram. Rats were initially exposed to 2 weeks of CMS and 4 weeks of escitalopram treatment with concurrent exposure to stress. The behavioral changes, indicating a decrease in sensitivity to a reward, were assessed in terms of sucrose consumption. We found a significant 22.4% decrease in the total number of granule cells in the stressed rats. This decrease was reversed in the stressed escitalopram treated rats that responded to the treatment, but not in the rats that did not respond to escitalopram treatment. These changes were not followed by alterations in the volume of the granule cell layer. We also showed a differential regulation of dentate neurons, in different stages of development, by chronic stress and chronic escitalopram treatment. Our study shows that the anhedonia-like state in the CMS rats is associated with a reduced number of granule cells. We conclude that escitalopram acts on specific cellular targets during neuronal differentiation and that recovery from anhedonia-like behavior in rats may be the consequence of an escitalopram mediated increase in specific subtypes of immature dentate neurons.",
