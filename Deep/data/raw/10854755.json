     "AB": "Monkeys, with unilateral immunotoxic lesions of the basal nucleus of Meynert that remove cholinergic innervation of the ipsilesional neocortex, and ablations of the contralateral inferotemporal neocortex, were impaired on retention of visual discriminations learnt before surgery and on acquisition of new discriminations. This demonstrates that the cholinergic projection from the basal nucleus supports the functions of its cortical target area. Our previous studies have shown that the impairment on discrimination performance following bilateral lesions of the basal nucleus is transient and that bilateral lesions of the diagonal band of Broca, that remove cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus, are without effect on these tasks. However, the impairment resulting from bilateral lesions of the basal nucleus plus the diagonal band, or from bilateral inferotemporal cortex ablations, is severe and persistent. Bilateral inferotemporal ablations deprive the hippocampus of much of its visual input by producing a discontinuity in cortico-cortical transmission, whereas basal nucleus lesions may merely prevent the modification of visually-derived information in the inferotemporal cortex without depriving the hippocampus of visual input. In the monkeys with crossed unilateral basal nucleus plus inferotemporal cortex lesions, the addition of a diagonal band lesion to the basal nucleus lesion produced an impairment on retention of visual discriminations and sustained the acquisition impairment. This confirms the previous finding that the basal nucleus and diagonal band act synergistically in producing a severe and permanent impairment. Further addition of an excitotoxic hippocampal lesion to the hemisphere with the inferotemporal cortex ablation did not add to the learning impairment. This supports the suggestion that the inferotemporal cortex ablation has deprived the hippocampus of its visual input.Overall, these experiments demonstrate that the cholinergic projections from the basal nucleus and diagonal band participate in the learning and memory functions of the temporal lobes.",
