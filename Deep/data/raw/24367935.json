     "AB": "In recent years, numerous laboratories and consortia have used neuroimaging to evaluate the risk for and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative is a longitudinal, multicenter study that is evaluating a range of biomarkers for use in diagnosis of AD, prediction of patient outcomes, and clinical trials. These biomarkers include brain metrics derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography scans as well as metrics derived from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. We focus on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative studies published between 2011 and March 2013 for which structural MRI was a major outcome measure. Our main goal was to review key articles offering insights into progression of AD and the relationships of structural MRI measures to cognition and to other biomarkers in AD. In Supplement 1, we also discuss genetic and environmental risk factors for AD and exciting new analysis tools for the efficient evaluation of large-scale structural MRI data sets such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data.",
