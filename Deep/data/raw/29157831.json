     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Grapes are among the most widely consumed plants and are used as a folk medicine. Vitis species have been traditionally used as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and memory-enhancing agents, but, their biological activities of discarded grape leaves are not completely understood. PURPOSE: We investigated the effects of alcoholic aqueous leaf extract of Vitis labruscana (LEVL) in a mouse model of memory impairment and tried to ascertain its mechanism. We also evaluated its effects in SH-SY5Y cells. METHODS: LEVL (50, 100, and 150mg/kg) was administered to ICR mice once daily for 7 days. Memory impairment was induced with intraperitoneal scopolamine injections (1mg/kg) and measured with the Y-maze test and a passive avoidance task. LEVL-induced signaling was evaluated in SH-SY5Y cells and mouse hippocampi. RESULTS: We first identified quercetin-3-O-glucuronide as LEVL's major component. We then showed that LEVL promoted phosphorylation of Akt, extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), and cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells. Oral LEVL administration (100mg/kg) for 7 days significantly reversed scopolamine-induced reductions of spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze test and scopolamine-induced shortening of latency times in the passive avoidance task's retention trial. Consistent with the cell experiment results, LEVL restored scopolamine-decreased phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, and CREB and scopolamine-reduced expression of brain-derived neuroprotective factor expression in mouse hippocampi. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that LEVL promotes phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, and CREB in the hippocampus and ameliorates scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mice.",
