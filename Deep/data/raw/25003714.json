     "AB": "Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) reduces oxidative stress by facilitating the influx of protons into mitochondrial matrix, thus dissociating mitochondrial oxidation from ATP synthesis. UCP2 is expressed abundantly in brain areas and plays a key role in neuroprotection. Here, we sought to determine if UCP2 deficiency produces cognitive impairment and anxiety in young mice, and to determine if hippocampal UCP2 is essential for the beneficial effects of voluntary exercise. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) was used to produce UCP2 knockdown in mice. Our results firstly showed that UCP2-targeted ASO significantly reduced UCP2 mRNA and protein expression in the hippocampus. ASO treatment impaired learning and memory of the mice in Y-maze, T-maze, and object recognition tests (ORT). ASO-treated mice exhibited more anxiously in OPT, light/dark box test, and elevated plus maze (EPM) than the control mice. We also found that wheel running ameliorated cognitive dysfunction and anxiety-like behaviors in ASO-treated mice. Furthermore, voluntary exercise reversed ASO-induced changes in hippocampal levels of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE). However, UCP2 protein in the hippocampus was not correlated with cognitive and anxiolytic benefits of exercise. These findings suggest that hippocampal UCP2 is essential for cognitive function and the resistance to anxiety of mice, but not required for the beneficial effects of exercise.",
