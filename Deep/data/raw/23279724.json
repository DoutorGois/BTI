     "AB": "Endocrine regulation of central and systemic stress response as well as learning and memory are in part controlled by systemic glucocorticoid levels. So far steroids have been thought to act on the brain predominantly through nuclear receptors. However, some brain systems known to respond to glucocorticoids seem to be devoid of the respective receptor proteins (GR). It is likely that known central actions of adrenal steroids may also be mediated by non-genomic actions involving intrinsic binding globulins. In recent studies we described the intrinsic expression of corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) in rat, mouse and human brains. Here we report an immunohistochemical mapping study on the colocalization of CBG and of GR in the rat brain. In the nucleus accumbens, septum, hippocampus, globus pallidus, medial and basolateral amygdale nuclei, magnocellular preoptic nuclei, diagonal band of Broca high intensity of CBG immunoreactivity was accompanied by weak or moderate GR staining, and vice versa. In the caudate putamen, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, septohypothalamic nucleus and parvocellular subdivision of the paraventricular nucleus strong GR immunoreactivity was observed, but CBG was almost undetectable. In contrast, throughout the supraoptic nucleus and magnocellular subdivision of the paraventricular nucleus numerous strongly CBG-positive cells were observed, devoid of specific GR immunoreactivity. It is most likely that CBG in the brain may be involved in the response to changing systemic glucocorticoid levels in addition to known nuclear and membrane corticosteroid receptors, or in glucocorticoid responsive regions devoid of these receptors.",
