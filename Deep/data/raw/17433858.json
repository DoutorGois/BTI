     "AB": "Using in silico approaches, we cloned a novel mouse gene (mbu-1) that was strictly expressed in the central nervous system. mbu-1 was first identified as an EST after carrying out digital differential display for unigene libraries from various mouse tissues. The full-length cDNA sequence was obtained by extending the ends of EST by RACE. The cDNA sequence was 2611 bp long and contained an ORF of 597 AA. A positive cis-acting region was found in the neuroblastomaxglioma hybrid, NG108-15, and in human embryonic kidney HEK293 cell lines. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analysis showed that the mbu-1 gene was only expressed in the brain and spinal cord during the embryonic stages, and throughout all regions of the adult brain, showing higher levels in the hippocampus and hypothalamus.",
