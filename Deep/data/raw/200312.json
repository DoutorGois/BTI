Evidence was provided that the system makes monosynaptic, en passage contact with CA1 pyramidal cells in the region of their basal dendrites. Slices from partially deafferented hippocampai were used in evaluating the possibility that the s. oriens pathway originated in the contralateral hippocampus. This possibility was not confirmed and the results were discussed in terms of an ipsilateral associational system in CA1 s. oriens.",
