     "AB": "We have recently shown that the rat atrium and brain contain specific high affinity receptors for the novel snake vasoconstrictor peptide sarafotoxin-b (SRTXb), and demonstrated toxin-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Here we report on the characteristics of 125I-SRTXb receptors and their regional distribution in rat brain. 125I-SRTX receptors in the rat brain bind the toxin rapidly and with high affinity. The binding was not inhibited by ligands of known neurotransmitter receptor and ion channels. 125I-SRTX receptors have a distinctive regional distribution. The highest densities were observed in the cerebellum, thalamus and hypothalamus (850, 550 and 450 fmol/mg protein, respectively) and the lowest densities in the caudate and cerebral cortex (82 and 62 fmol/mg protein, respectively). Taken together our results suggest that mammalian brains contain a hitherto undetected neuroreceptor that may operate in neurotransmission with a \"SRTX-like\" brain peptide, similar to the SRTX homologous vasoconstrictor peptide of the mammalian endothelium endothelin.",
