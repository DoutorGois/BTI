     "AB": "The present study was designed to examine the role of cue location and number in spatial navigation of the preweanling Fischer-344N rat in the Morris water maze using a protocol consistent with the pups' response repertoire. The proximal (visible platform) versus distal (hidden platform) cue strategy was used, and spatial cues within the extramaze environment were configured such that the arrangement presented either a double cue or null cull condition relative to the platform location. All pups' performance improved with training; however, probe trial performance, defined by quadrant time and platform crossings, revealed distal-double cue pups demonstrated spatial navigational ability superior to the remaining groups. This experimental dissociation suggests that a pup's ability to spatially navigate a hidden platform is dependent on not only its response repertoire and task parameters but also its visual acuity, as determined by the number of extramaze cues and the location of these cues within the testing environment. The hidden versus visible platform dissociation may not be a satisfactory strategy for the control of potential sensorimotor deficits.",
