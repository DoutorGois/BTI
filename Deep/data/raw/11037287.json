     "AB": "The effects of presynaptic guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS) on GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were studied in cultured hippocampal neurons using whole-cell recordings. Inclusion of GTPgammaS (0.5-1 mM) in the presynaptic electrode reduced both the amplitude and paired-pulse depression of IPSCs, indicating that the probability of GABA-release had been reduced. Presynaptic GTPgammaS increased the depression of IPSCs by the GABA(B)-receptor-agonist baclofen (10 microM), and the effect of baclofen was poorly reversible after washing. Stimulation of the GABAergic neuron at 80 Hz for 1 s was accompanied by tetanic depression of the IPSCs by 52+/-6% and was followed by post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), reaching a peak value of 71+/-21% and lasting about 100 s. IPSCs evoked after tetanic stimulation were depressed and PTP was absent when tetanic stimulation was applied within 3 min after starting injection of GTPgammaS into the presynaptic neuron. At longer times, basal release underlying a single IPSC was depressed. This affected the ratios recorded in response to tetanic stimulations such that tetanic depression was abolished, while PTP increased to 117+/-34%. In conclusion, GTPgammaS reduces the probability of GABA-release in both a use- and time-dependent manner, most likely through an inhibitory action on presynaptic Ca2+-influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels or an interaction with small GTP-binding proteins in the nerve terminals.",
