     "AB": "Stem cells have been proposed as a new form of cell-based therapy in a variety of disorders, including acute and degenerative brain diseases. Endogenous neural stem cells (eNSC) reside in the subventricular zone and in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. eNSC are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into functional glia and neurons. Unfortunately, spontaneous brain regeneration is inefficient for clinically significant improvement following brain injury. However, eNSC responses may be augmented considerably by perturbing the pathways governing cell proliferation, migration and differentiation by application of exogenous growth factors. Importantly, current evidence suggests that such perturbations may lead to better functional outcome after stroke. This article summarizes the progress made in this field.",
