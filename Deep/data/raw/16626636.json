     "AB": "Alterations of immunoreactivity and protein contents of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger 1 (NCX1) were observed in the gerbil hippocampus proper after 5 min of transient forebrain ischemia. NCX1 immunoreactivity was significantly changed in the hippocampal CA1 region, but not in the CA2/3 region after ischemia/reperfusion. In the sham-operated group, NCX1 immunoreactivity was mainly detected in CA1 pyramidal cells. However, 30 min after ischemia/reperfusion, NCX1 immunoreactivity was significantly decreased and then increased at 1 day after ischemia. At this time, NCX1 immunoreactivity in CA1 pyramidal cells was similar to that of the sham-operated group. At 3 days after ischemia, NCX1 immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in the CA1 region compared to that of the sham-operated group and NCX1 immunoreactivity was significantly increased again 4 days after ischemia. Thereafter, NCX1 immunoreactivity was decreased time-dependently in ischemia groups. Between 15 min and 6 h post-ischemia, NCX1 immunoreactivity was expressed in astrocytes in the strata oriens and radiatum of the CA1 region. From 3 days post-ischemia, NCX1 immunoreactivity was expressed in astrocytes in the strata oriens and radiatum. Ischemia-induced changes in NCX1 protein contents in the hippocampus proper concurred with immunohistochemical data post-ischemia. Our results suggest that changes in NCX1 in CA1 pyramidal cells and astrocytes after ischemia are associated with intracellular Na(+) concentrations and that NCX1 may induce an intracellular calcium overload, which may be related to neuronal death.",
