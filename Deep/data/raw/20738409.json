     "AB": "Behavioral inhibition (BI) is an adaptive defensive response to threat; however, children who display extreme BI as a stable trait are at risk for development of anxiety disorders and depression. The present study validates a rodent model of BI based on an ethologically relevant predator exposure paradigm. We show that individual differences in rat BI are stable and trait-like from adolescence into adulthood. Using in situ hybridization to quantify expression of the immediate early genes homer1a and fos as measures of neuronal activation, we show that individual differences in BI are correlated with the activation of various stress-responsive brain regions that include the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and CA3 region of the hippocampus. Further supporting the concept that threat-induced BI in rodents reflects levels of anxiety, we also show that BI is decreased by administration of the anxiolytic, diazepam. Finally, we developed criteria for identifying extreme BI animals that are stable in their expression of high levels of BI and also show that high BI (HBI) individuals exhibit maladaptive appetitive responses following stress exposure. These findings support the use of predator threat as a stimulus and HBI rats as a model to study mechanisms underlying extreme and stable BI in humans.",
