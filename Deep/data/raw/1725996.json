     "AB": "The effects of clomipramine (CMP) treatment on the brain concentrations of catecholamines, indoleamines and their metabolites were evaluated in 11 rat brain regions. An acute CMP treatment (15 mg/kg) reduced only the 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5HIAA) concentrations in all regions. A long-term CMP treatment (14 days, 10 mg/kg/day) decreased the concentrations of dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine and 5HIAA in the mesencephalon, and increased the DA concentrations in the hippocampus. In comparison with the values for the long-term treated rats, an acute injection of CMP (15 mg/kg) after a long-term treatment increased the norepinephrine concentrations in the hypothalamus and amygdala, and the concentrations of DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid in the basal ganglia. On the other hand, it failed to decrease the 5HIAA concentrations in the basal ganglia, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum, pons + medulla oblongata, and mesencephalon.",
