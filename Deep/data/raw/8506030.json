     "AB": "The aim of this paper was to evaluate the cholinergic component of the septohippocampal input signals in neuronal activity of the hippocampal fields CA1 and CA3 recorded extracellularly in chronic alert rabbits. Effects of electrical stimulation of the medial septal area were analysed in the control state, on the background of an increased level of endogenous acetylcholine (by physostigmine injection) and during its blockade by antimuscarinic drugs (scopolamine, atropine). Two groups of animals were used in the experiments: intact rabbits and rabbits with complete chronic undercutting of the septum, depriving the septohippocampal system of ascending medial forebrain bundle afferents. Primary inhibitory effects of standard duration (40-140 ms) evoked by medial septal area stimulation dominated in the hippocampus of intact rabbits (54%), though some neurons responded by initial diffuse excitation (37.5%); responses by single-spike on-effects were observed in a minority of neurons (8.5%). The primary suppression of activity prevailed (90%) in animals with basal undercutting of the septum. In intact rabbits under physostigmine action, the effects of medial septal area stimulation were depressed or completely blocked in 78% of hippocampal neurons on the background of increased theta modulation of activity. Neuronal responses to medial septal area stimulation recovered at the background of muscarinic antagonists. These effects of cholinergic drugs were reproduced in animals without medial forebrain bundle. It is concluded that the initial effect of the septal input upon the hippocampal neurons consists of a general suppression of their activity (reset), depending upon a non-cholinergic (presumably GABAergic) component of the septohippocampal connections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
