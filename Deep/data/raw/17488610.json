     "AB": "AIM: To prepare mouse anti-human BART polyclonal antibody (Ab) and characterize its properties. METHODS: BART protein was expressed in E.coli. BL21. Mice were immunized with purified BART protein to prepare anti-BART Ab. The titer and specificity of the prepared antibodies were identified by Western blot and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. RESULTS: Purified mouse anti-human BART Ab with high titer was obtained. The anti-BART Ab showed good specificity and could be used to detect the BART in rat spinal cord tissues. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that BART was expressed widely in hippocampus neurons and astrocytes. BART and calcium ion channel were colocalization in hippocampus neurons. CONCLUSION: Successful preparation of anti-human BART antibody provides a useful tool for identification and further functional study of BART molecule.",
