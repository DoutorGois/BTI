The following study examines the effects of developmental stage and sex on this sprouting phenomenon using both fluorescence histochemistry and high affinity uptake of noradrenaline. We find that (1) the sprouting, which is reduced in adult and juvenile males relative to females, is equivalent in the two sexes after transections at postnatal day 3, and (2) the period of maximum ingrowth is sexually regulated, occurring near postnatal day 3 in the male and postnatal day 13 in the female.",
