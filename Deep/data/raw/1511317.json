     "AB": "This study investigated changes in synaptic responses (population spike and population EPSP) of CA1 pyramidal cells of the rat hippocampus to stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathways 2-3 h after traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI was induced by a fluid percussion pulse delivered to the parietal epidural space resulting in loss of righting responses for 4.90-8.98 min. Prior to tetanic stimulation, changes observed after the injury included: (1) decreases in population spikes threshold but not EPSP thresholds; (2) decreases in maximal amplitude of population spikes as well as EPSPs. TBI also suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP), as evidenced by reductions in post-tetanic increases in population spikes as well as EPSPs. Since LTP may reflect processes involved in memory formation, the observed suppression of LTP may be an electrophysiological correlate of enduring memory deficits previously demonstrated in the same injury model.",
