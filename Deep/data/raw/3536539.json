     "AB": "Insulin was injected directly into the dorsal hippocampus (DHPC) of rabbits, and changes in hepatic acetate metabolism were studied. The injection of 50 microU insulin into the DHPC decreased the rates of 14C transfer from 14C-1-acetate into glucose and ketone bodies, and increased 14C transfer into cholesterol ester, triglyceride, free cholesterol and free fatty acids. But after insulin injection into the DHPC of rabbits with lesions of dorsal fornix (DFX), hepatic acetate metabolism did not differ from that of control rabbits, which received saline injection into the same brain region. From these results it might be suggested that the DHPC are parts of insulin-sensitive brain regulator system in the hepatic acetate metabolism.",
