     "AB": "Norepinephrine has been hypothesized to provide a learning and memory signal. Norepinephrine long-term potentiation of perforant path input to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus provides a model for norepinephrine initiated memory processes. However, in vitro, the pairing of perforant path stimulation and norepinephrine is not required for the occurrence of norepinephrine-dependent long-term potentiation. Since bath application of norepinephrine induces long-term changes in 2nd messenger signalling and differs in a number of ways from physiological norepinephrine release, the present study is an in vivo test of the associative requirement for the pairing of perforant path input with norepinephrine to induce long-term potentiation. Phasic activation of the locus coeruleus is provided by glutamate infusion into the locus coeruleus to initiate transient norepinephrine release in the hippocampus of urethane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Perforant path stimulation (0.067 Hz) was given throughout the experiment in the paired condition. In the unpaired condition perforant path stimulation was interrupted 10 min prior to locus coeruleus activation and resumed 10 min after locus coeruleus activation. Locus coeruleus-induced long-term potentiation of both EPSP slope and population spike only occurred in the pairing condition. This result argues that, in vivo, temporal proximity of locus coeruleus-associated norepinephrine release and perforant path stimulation are required to induce long-term plasticity. The associativity requirement for locus coeruleus activation and perforant path stimulation in vivo is consistent with the hypothesis that norepinephrine can initiate circuit changes supporting learning and memory.",
