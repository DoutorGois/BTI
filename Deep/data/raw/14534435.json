     "AB": "Nociceptive behaviors were examined in the mice lacking alpha1d-adrenergic receptor (alpha1d-AR) and wild type littermates using tail-flick, hot-plate (hindpaw-licking and jumping), tail-pinch and formalin tests. The distribution of alpha1d-AR was studied using in situ hybridization in the wild type mice. Mutant mice showed longer tail-flick and hindpaw-licking latencies while their jumping latency was shorter. Mechanical and chemical nociception was not altered in alpha1d-knockout mice. In situ hybridization study revealed dense alpha1d-AR mRNA expression in the reticular thalamic nucleus, the hippocampus, the cingulate cortex and the spinal cord. These results suggest that alpha1d-AR in the spinal cord contributes to thermal pronociception; and that the jump behavior seen when escaping from heat is inhibited via the supraspinal alpha1d-AR.",
