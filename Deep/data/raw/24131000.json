     "AB": "Human recombinant erythropoietin adsorbed on poly(butyl)cyanoacrylate nanoparticles and administered intraperitoneally in a dose of 0.05 mg/kg exhibited a neuroprotective effect in experimental intracerebral posttraumatic hematomas (hemorrhagic stroke) and reduced animal mortality. Human recombinant erythropoietin, native and adsorbed on lactic and glycolic acid copolymer-based nanoparticles, exhibited no antistroke effect on this model. Analysis of reverse transcription PCR products showed that human recombinant erythropoietin adsorbed on poly(butyl)cyanoacrylate nanoparticles more than 2-fold increased the expression of BDNF and NGF neurotrophins in the rat brain frontal cortex and hippocampus.",
