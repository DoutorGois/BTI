     "AB": "Using the systemically active, non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist dextrorphan, we explored the role of the NMDA receptor-calcium channel complex in the toxic mechanism of action of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Rats were treated with MDMA, dextrorphan, or the combination of MDMA and increasing doses of dextrorphan, and then killed 10 days later for the assay of serotonin and dopamine in the striatum, hippocampus, and cortex. Dextrorphan totally prevented the serotonin-depleting effects of MDMA in the straitum, with a lessened but still significant blockade noted in the hippocampus and cortex. These findings may provide a clue to the molecular events underlying MDMA-induced neurotoxicity.",
