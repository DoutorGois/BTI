     "AB": "We observed neuroprotective effects of five major lipophilic diterpenes derived from Danshen (Radix Salvia miltiorrhiza) extract, such as cryptotanshinone (CTs), dihydrotanshinone I (DTsI), tanshinone I (TsI), tanshinone IIA (TsIIA) and tanshinone IIB (TsIIB), in the hippocampal CA1 region (CA1) against transient ischemic damage in gerbils. These diterpenes were administered 30min before ischemia-reperfusion and the animals were sacrificed 4days after ischemia-reperfusion. In the vehicle-treated-group, cresyl violet positive (CV(+)) cells and neuronal nuclei (NeuN)(+) neurons were significantly decreased in the CA1. However, in the TsI- and CTs-treated-ischemia-groups, CV(+) and NeuN(+) neurons were abundant in the CA1. In the other groups, the number of CV(+) and NeuN(+) neurons was less than the TsI- and CTs-treated-ischemia-groups. In addition, gliosis induced by ischemic damage was apparently blocked in the TsI- and CTs-treated-ischemia-groups. These results suggest that TsI and CTs among five major lipophilic diterpenes have strong potentials for neuroprotection against ischemic damage.",
