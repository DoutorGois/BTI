     "AB": "Activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) system can prevent free radical, nitric oxide (NO)-induced programmed cell death (PCD). To investigate the mechanisms utilized by the mGluR system to regulate the induction of PCD, we examined the course of PCD in real time in individual, living, primary hippocampal neurons. We assessed both phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, an early event in PCD, and DNA fragmentation during NO toxicity and mGluR modulation to determine the individual contributions of PS externalization and genomic DNA fragmentation during neuronal PCD. Exposure to the NO donors (300 microM SNP or 300 microM NOC-9) induced PCD in approximately 75% of neurons over a 24-h period. The externalization of PS in neurons increased to 21 +/- 2% as early as 3 h following NO exposure and then increased to 80 +/- 2% over a 24-h period. The externalization of PS was independent of the loss of membrane integrity. Agonists for individual mGluR subgroups were equally able to prevent NO-induced neuronal death and DNA degradation, yet they possessed differential abilities to regulate PS externalization. The group I agonist DHPG (750 microM) and the group III agonist L-AP4 (750 microM) both prevented and reversed NO-induced PS externalization. In contrast, activation of group II subtypes using L-CCG-I (750 microM) did not prevent PS externalization. Employing an experimental model that independently led to the externalization of PS residues, we demonstrated that PS externalization does not immediately impact on neuronal survival. Yet, subsequent neuronal survival may ultimately depend upon preventing PS externalization to avoid neuronal tagging for phagocytosis. Since group I and III mGluR subtypes possess the unique ability to maintain genomic integrity and membrane PS asymmetry, these agents may provide superior overall protection against NO-induced neuronal injury.",
