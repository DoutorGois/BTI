     "AB": "Point mutations within the beta-amyloid precusor protein (beta-APP) gene known to segregate with Alzheimer's disease in certain families were introduced into human beta-APP cDNAs and expressed under the control of a neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter in mice. The transgenic animals exhibited transgene expression predominantly in neocortex and hippocampus where the levels were maximally 1.3-fold of those of wild-type mouse beta-APP. Quantitative immunoblot analysis in homozygous mice carrying different missense mutations showed slightly increased alpha-secretory processing. In V7171 mice compared to nontransgenic mice there was more alpha-secretory beta-APP (beta-APPsec) in cortex/hippocampus, less in cerebellum, and no difference in midbrain/brain stem. In none of the transgenic animals tested was a 4 kDa amyloid fragment detected by Western blotting of brain extracts, immunohistochemistry, or by 125I-A beta-binding onto brain sections. No glial reaction was observed. Behavioral analysis of mice carrying the V7171 mutation showed no appreciable deficit in comparison to wild-type mice. Together, these data suggest that low levels of expression of mutated beta-APP in 10-12-month-old transgenic mouse brains result in slightly more beta-APPsec, and are insufficient to induce amyloidogenic processing and AD-like pathology.",
