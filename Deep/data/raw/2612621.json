     "AB": "Effects of GABA on the background and electrically stimulated activity of single neurons and population spikes were investigated in isolated hippocampal slices. Application of relatively large GABA concentrations (10(-3) mol/l and more) depressed an antidromic population spike, field EPSP and neuronal background activity. Low concentrations of GABA (less than 10(-3) mol/l) added to the bath increased the population spikes amplitude and the late component of field EPSP, facilitated single neurone responses, their background activity and epileptiform discharges. GABA-evoked depolarization was observed in the majority of the studied neurons. The duality of the GABA action on central neurons are discussed.",
