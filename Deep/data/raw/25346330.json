     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that depressive symptoms correlate with Alzheimer's disease (AD) type changes in CSF and structural and functional imaging including hippocampus volume, cortical thickness, white matter lesions, Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in patient with subjective (SCI) and mild (MCI) cognitive impairment. METHOD: In 60 patients, depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale. The subjects underwent MRI, 18F-FDG PET imaging, and lumbar CSF extraction. RESULTS: Subjects with depressive symptoms (n=24) did not have more pathological AD biomarkers than non-depressed. Uncorrected there were trends towards larger hippocampal volumes (P=0.06), less orbital WM damage measured by DTI (P=0.10), and higher orbital glucose metabolism (P=0.02) in the depressed group. The findings were similar when SCI and MCI were analyzed separately. Similarly, in patients with pathological CSF biomarkers (i.e., predementia AD, n=24), we found that correlations between scores on GDS and CSF Ass42 and P-tau indicated less severe AD-specific CSF changes with increasing depression. CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms are common in SCI/MCI, but are not associated with pathological imaging or CSF biomarkers of AD. Depression can explain cognitive impairment in SCI/MCI or add to cognitive impairment leading to an earlier clinical investigation in predementia AD.",
