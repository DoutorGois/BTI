     "AB": "In this longitudinal study we compared brain volume changes in first- and multiple-episode patients with schizophrenia to normal aging changes observed in healthy control subjects scanned at comparable times. Two to four years after an initial examination including MRI volumetry, we followed up 21 first episode patients, 17 patients after multiple episodes of schizophrenia, and 20 healthy controls. Volumetric measurements of left and right hemispheres, total brain volume, lateral ventricles, hippocampus and amygdala as well as a clinical evaluation were performed. Patients with schizophrenia showed significant ventricular enlargement and volume reduction of the hippocampus-amygdala complex compared with healthy control subjects both at baseline and follow-up. While there were no differences between patients and controls with respect to mean annual volume changes in the measured regions, patients with schizophrenia showed higher between-subject variability in ventricular volume change. These data are consistent with cross-sectional studies demonstrating ventricular enlargement and hippocampal volume deficits in schizophrenia. However, we were not able to demonstrate a difference in the rate of volume changes over time that distinguished patients with schizophrenia from healthy controls for any of the brain structures measured. Drawbacks of the study are that the follow-up was done after a relatively short interval and that there was a difference in time to follow-up and age between patients and controls. Our results do not support the hypothesis that schizophrenia leads to progressive volume reduction in these areas, although there may be a subset of patients with morphologically visible disease progression.",
