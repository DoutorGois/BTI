     "AB": "We report a patient who developed personality change, dementia and parkinsonism. The patient was a Japanese woman who died at age 76. She developed memory problems at age 63. At age 66, she started showing personality changes, and began having short-step gait and mask-like face. On admission to our hospital at age 68, neurological examination showed mild memory deficit and postural instability. Six months after discharge, she developed delusion, rigidity, tremor, and gait disturbance. Her condition relentlessly progressed and she became bedridden at age 71. CT scan revealed marked atrophy of the frontotemporal lobes with enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles. The patient died at the age of 76 years. The patient was discussed in a neurological CPC, and a chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had frontotemporal dementia. Some participants thought that she had Pick disease or diffuse Lewy body disease. Severe atrophy of the frontal lobe and anterior part of the brain was seen at autopsy. Neuropathological examination showed severe neuronal loss with gliosis in the substantia nigra, pallidum, thalamus, and hippocampus. Moderate loss of neurons with gliosis was seen in the frontal and anterior temporal cortex. Argyrophilic and tau-positive neuronal inclusions which showed various shapes including Pick body-like inclusions and globose type of neurofibrillary tangles, were seen in the cerebral cortex and caudate. Argyrophilic and tau-positive astrocytes were also observed in the cerebral cortex. The pathological diagnosis was an unusual form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with various tau-positive inclusions.",
