     "AB": "Native gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors consisting of alpha4, beta1-3, and delta subunits mediate responses to the low, tonic concentration of GABA present in the extracellular milieu. Previous studies on heterologously expressed alpha4betadelta receptors have shown a large degree of variability in functional properties, including sensitivity to the transmitter. We studied properties of alpha4beta2delta receptors employing free subunits and concatemeric constructs, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, HEK 293 cells, and cultured hippocampal neurons. The expression system had a strong effect on the properties of receptors containing free subunits. The midpoint of GABA activation curve was 10 nM for receptors in oocytes versus 2300 nM in HEK cells. Receptors activated by the steroid alfaxalone had an estimated maximal open probability of 0.6 in oocytes and 0.01 in HEK cells. Irrespective of the expression system, receptors resulting from combining the tandem construct beta2-delta and a free alpha4 subunit exhibited large steroid responses. We propose that free alpha4, beta2, and delta subunits assemble in different configurations with distinct properties in oocytes and HEK cells, and that subunit linkage can overcome the expression system-dependent preferential assembly of free subunits. Hippocampal neurons transfected with alpha4 and the picrotoxin-resistant delta(T269Y) subunit showed large responses to alfaxalone in the presence of picrotoxin, suggesting that alpha4betadelta receptors may assemble in a similar configuration in neurons and oocytes.",
