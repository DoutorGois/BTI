     "AB": "The morphogenesis of the dendritic arbor is a critical aspect of neuronal development, ensuring that proper neural networks are formed. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this dendritic remodeling remain obscure. We previously established the activity-regulated GTPase Rem2 as a negative regulator of dendritic complexity. In this study, we identify a signaling pathway whereby Rem2 regulates dendritic arborization through interactions with Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs) in rat hippocampal neurons. Specifically, we demonstrate that Rem2 functions downstream of CaMKII but upstream of CaMKIV in a pathway that restricts dendritic complexity. Furthermore, we show that Rem2 is a novel substrate of CaMKII and that phosphorylation of Rem2 by CaMKII regulates Rem2 function and subcellular localization. Overall, our results describe a unique signal transduction network through which Rem2 and CaMKs function to restrict dendritic complexity.",
