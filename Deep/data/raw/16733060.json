     "PG": "213-28",
     "AB": "LY354740 is a potent and selective mGlu2/3 receptor agonist with activity in models of psychiatric disorders (anxiety, psychosis), and early clinical studies in anxiety patients. However, the specific receptor subtypes and brain regions which mediate mGlu2/3 receptor agonist pharmacology/efficacy are not well understood. Here we investigate the effects of deleting mGlu2 or mGlu3 receptors on basal and LY354740-regulated c-Fos expression in mouse brain using mGlu2 or mGlu3 knockout mice. Consistent with our earlier findings, LY354740 administration (20 mg/kg, i.p.) to wild-type mice increased c-Fos expression in specific limbic (central amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, midline thalamic nuclei) and non-limbic (thalamic dorsolateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus, Edinger-Westphal) structures, while modestly suppressing hippocampal c-Fos expression. The LY354740-induced increases in c-Fos expression in all the above regions were abolished by mGlu2, but not mGlu3, receptor deletion. Interestingly, basal c-Fos expression was significantly increased in the hippocampus of mGlu3, but not mGlu2, receptor knockouts compared to wild-type mice. Moreover, this increase was not suppressed by LY354740, such that in the CA3 region LY354740 now increased c-Fos expression in the mGlu3 knockouts. These results demonstrate that the LY354740-induced increases of c-Fos expression in specific brain regions, including the central and extended amygdala are specifically linked to mGlu2 receptors, and LY354740 suppressions of neuronal activity in the hippocampus are linked to mGlu3 receptors.",
