     "AB": "Correct timing and spatial location of growth factor expression is critical for undisturbed brain development and functioning. In terminally differentiated cells distinct biological responses to growth factors may depend on cell type specific activation of signalling cascades. We show that the hematopoietic growth factors thrombopoietin (TPO) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) exert cell type specific effects on survival, proliferation and the degree of phosphorylation of Akt1, ERK1/2 and STAT3 in rat hippocampal neurons and cortical astrocytes. In neurons, TPO induced cell death and selectively activated ERK1/2. GCSF protected neurons from TPO- and hypoxia-induced cell death via selective activation of Akt1. In astrocytes, neither TPO nor GCSF had any effect on cell viability but inhibited proliferation. This effect was accompanied by activation of ERK1/2 and inhibition of STAT3 activity. A balance between growth factors, their receptors and signalling proteins may play an important role in regulation of neural cell survival.",
