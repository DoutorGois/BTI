     "AB": "The influence of ageing on sulphide-silver positive zinc stores was assessed in the stratum radiatum of the CA1-CA3 sub fields of the rat hippocampus and in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus using a silver amplification histochemical technique associated with microdensitometry. The volume of areas examined for microdensitometry was evaluated as well by quantitative image analysis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 3 months (considered to be young), 12 months (considered to be adult) and 24 months (considered to be old) were used. Microdensitometric analysis of values of sulphide-silver staining corrected for the volume of hippocampal areas investigated revealed no age-dependent changes of staining in the CA1 sub field of the hippocampus. In the CA2 sub field a decrease of sulphide-silver staining was noticeable in aged rats in comparison with younger cohorts. A progressive reduction in the intensity of sulphide-silver staining was observed in the CA3 sub field of the hippocampus. In the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, the intensity of staining was decreased in adult and old rats in comparison with young animals. These findings indicate a different sensitivity to ageing of histochemically detectable zinc stores of rat hippocampus. The possibility of a specific sensitivity to senescence of different zinc-containing pathways of the hippocampus is discussed.",
