     "AB": "Brain Abeta1-42 accumulation is considered an upstream event in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, accumulating evidence indicates that other neurochemical changes potentiate the toxicity of this constitutively generated peptide. Here we report that the interaction of Abeta1-42 with extracellular Zn(2+) is essential for in vivo rapid uptake of Abeta1-42 and Zn(2+) into dentate granule cells in the normal rat hippocampus. The uptake of both Abeta1-42 and Zn(2+) was blocked by CaEDTA, an extracellular Zn(2+) chelator, and by Cd(2+), a metal that displaces Zn(2+) for Abeta1-42 binding. In vivo perforant pathway LTP was unaffected by perfusion with 1000 nm Abeta1-42 in ACSF without Zn(2+) However, LTP was attenuated under preperfusion with 5 nm Abeta1-42 in ACSF containing 10 nm Zn(2+), recapitulating the concentration of extracellular Zn(2+), but not with 5 nm Abeta1-40 in ACSF containing 10 nm Zn(2+) Abeta1-40 and Zn(2+) were not taken up into dentate granule cells under these conditions, consistent with lower affinity of Abeta1-40 for Zn(2+) than Abeta1-42 Abeta1-42-induced attenuation of LTP was rescued by both CaEDTA and CdCl2, and was observed even with 500 pm Abeta1-42 Abeta1-42 injected into the dentate granule cell layer of rats induced a rapid memory disturbance that was also rescued by coinjection of CdCl2 The present study supports blocking the formation of Zn-Abeta1-42 in the extracellular compartment as an effective preventive strategy for Alzheimer's disease.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Short-term memory loss occurs in normal elderly and increases in the predementia stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42), a possible causing peptide in AD, is bound to Zn(2+) in the extracellular compartment in the hippocampus induced short-term memory loss in the normal rat brain, suggesting that extracellular Zn(2+) is essential for Abeta1-42-induced short-term memory loss. The evidence is important to find an effective preventive strategy for AD, which is blocking the formation of Zn-Abeta1-42 in the extracellular compartment.",
