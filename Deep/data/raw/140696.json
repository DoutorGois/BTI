     "AB": "Correlation between the kindled seizure susceptibility and brain monoamine levels was investigated in the hippocampal and amygdaloid kindled cats. Increase of interictal discharge (IID) frequency and morphological change of IID into self-sustained discharge appeared following reserpine administration. alpha-MPT also increased the IID frequency. These changes in reserpine- and alpha-MPT-treated cats were suppressed completely by the administration of L-DOPA, suggesting that depletion of norepinephrine and dopamine exacerbate the kindled seizure susceptibility. In a second experiment, the assay study of brain catecholamine showed significant and parallel depletion of both norepinephrine and dopamine in the hippocampal kindled cat brain. It is concluded that catecholamine may play an inhibitory role in the establishment and neurohumoral control of the kindled seizure susceptibility.",
