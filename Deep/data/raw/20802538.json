     "AB": "We examined the influence of chronic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) treatment on the number of Ki-67-positive cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in rats. ACTH treatment for 14 days decreased the number of such cells. The administration of imipramine or lithium alone for 14 days had no effect in saline-treated rats. The effect of ACTH was blocked by the administration of imipramine. Furthermore, the coadministration of imipramine and lithium for 14 days significantly increased the number of Ki-67-positive cells in both the saline and ACTH-treated rats. The coadministration of imipramine and lithium normalized the cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in rats treated with ACTH.",
