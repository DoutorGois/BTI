     "AB": "Neuronal cultures of the central nervous system are widely used to study the molecular mechanisms that rule the differentiation process. These cultures have also been used to evaluate drugs and to develop new therapies. From this we can infer the relevance of performing an extended characterization that involves the main aspects driving such process. To carry out such characterization in the present study we prepared primary cultures from hippocampal cells to study cell identity, development of neuronal processes (dendrites and axons), density of synaptic vesicles and development of growth cones. Using immunofluorescence techniques, specific antibodies and non-immunological probes, we studied the changes experienced by the structures under study during different temporal stages (1-21 days). We observed a major proportion of neurons over glia, normal development of neuronal networks (formed by dendrites and axons), increase in the length of dendrites and axons and establishment of synaptic connections. Synaptic vesicles also showed an increase in their densities as long as the time of the culture progressed. Finally, we studied the morphological changes of the growth cones and observed that those were mostly closed at the beginning of the culture period. As neurons matured we observed an increase in the proportion of open growth cones. This work represents an advance in the morphometric characterization of neuronal cultures, since it gathers the main aspects that outline the neuronal differentiation process. In this study, measurement of these morphological features made possible to establish quantitative markers that will allow establishing more precisely the different stages of neuronal differentiation.",
