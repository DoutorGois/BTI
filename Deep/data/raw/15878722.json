     "AB": "Interval timing in the range of milliseconds to minutes is affected in a variety of neurological and psychiatric populations involving disruption of the frontal cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Our understanding of these distortions in timing and time perception are aided by the analysis of the sources of variance attributable to clock, memory, decision, and motor-control processes. The conclusion is that the representation of time depends on the integration of multiple neural systems that can be fruitfully studied in selected patient populations.",
