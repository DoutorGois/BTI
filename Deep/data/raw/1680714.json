     "AB": "The tritiated derivative of the potent antihypertensive agent, 5-methyl-urapidil, was used as a radioligand in binding studies with rat brain membranes and tissue sections. Serotonin and prazosin inhibited [3H]5-methyl-urapidil binding to membranes from the rat hippocampus, cerebral cortex and brainstem biphasically, leading to the definition of serotonin high-affinity and prazosin high-affinity [3H]5-methyl-urapidil binding sites. Comparison of these serotonin-sensitive [3H]5-methyl-urapidil binding sites with the 5-HT1A sites labelled by [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([3H]8-OH-DPAT) revealed striking similarities regarding pharmacological properties, respective densities and regional distribution. On the other hand, the prazosin-sensitive [3H]5-methyl-urapidil binding sites should correspond to the alpha 1A-subtype of adrenoceptors which has recently been defined. Detailed autoradiographic investigations allowed the detection of 5-HT1A sites labelled by both [3H]5-methyl-urapidil and [3H]8-OH-DPAT in the posterior raphe nuclei (pallidus and obscurus) which are possibly involved in the hypotensive action of 5-methyl-urapidil. These data demonstrate that [3H]5-methyl-urapidil is a useful radioligand for the visualization and quantification of both 5-HT1A serotonin receptors and alpha 1A-adrenoceptors in the central nervous system.",
