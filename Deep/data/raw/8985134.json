     "AB": "The purpose of this investigation was to identify and localize tissue transglutaminase (TGase) within neurons from the hippocampi of normal aged individuals and of those with confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD). This enzyme may be a factor in the molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration and formation of insoluble macromolecular complexes found in the neurons of normal aged and AD brain tissue. An antibody made to the extracellular TGase, coagulation factor XIIIa, was found to be specific for purified intracellular guinea pig liver tissue TGase. The specificity for liver tissue TGase has enabled us to identify tissue TGase(s) within rat hippocampal neurons and within neurons from normal aged and AD hippocampal tissues. Degenerating neurons from the AD hippocampus, compared to neurons from the normal aged hippocampus, exhibited increased immunoreactivity for TGase and demonstrated co-labeling for PHF1 and anti-TGase. Our results suggest that TGase may be associated with the neurofibrillary degeneration observed in AD, thereby implicating TGase as a potential factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",
