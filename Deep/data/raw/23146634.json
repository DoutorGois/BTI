     "AB": "Two major active species of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta), fibrillar Abeta1-42 (FAbeta) and soluble Abeta1-42 oligomers (AbetaO), are known to play important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, the differences between them are largely unknown. In this study, we explored the effects of FAbeta and AbetaO on cognitive functions and hippocampal inflammatory response through a 30-days infusion of FAbeta or AbetaO (144pmol/d) into the left lateral ventricles of the rat brain. Morris water maze showed that the impairment of learning and memory functions was much more significant in the AbetaO-infused rats, compared to the FAbeta-infused rats. AbetaO-induced neurodegeneration and ultrastructure damage in CA1 neurons were more remarkable than those induced by FAbeta. Compared to FAbeta, AbetaO exerted more potent effects on the expressions of inflammatory factors toll-like receptor 4 and TNF-alpha and activation of NF-kappaB signaling. Taken together, our results from in vivo model demonstrate that AbetaO is more neurotoxic than FAbeta, and this neurotoxicity may be related to NF-kappaB-medicated inflammatory response.",
