     "AB": "Experiments were performed with Mongolian gerbils to study the effect of the specific nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) on ischemic brain damage induced by 5 min bilateral carotid occlusion. A single i.p. injection of L-NNA did not result in any neuronal loss in the central nervous system. In animals undergoing ischemia, a selective destruction of hippocampal CA1 cells was observed whereas pretreatment with 50 mg/kg L-NNA 4 h before administration of ischemia produced significantly more extensive cell damage in the hippocampus and other brain regions. These findings demonstrate that in this model inhibition of nitric oxide generation augments ischemia-induced neuronal cell injury in the brain.",
