     "AB": "In the hippocampus, the neuromodulatory role of adenosine depends on a balance between inhibitory A1 responses and facilitatory A2A responses. Since the presynaptic effects of hippocampal inhibitory A1 adenosine receptors are mostly mediated by inhibition of Ca2+ channels, we now investigated whether presynaptic facilitatory A2A adenosine receptors would modulate calcium influx in the hippocampus. The mixed A1/A2 agonist, 2-chloroadenosine (CADO; 1 microM) inhibited veratridine (20 microM)-evoked 45Ca2+ influx into hippocampal synaptosomes of the CA1 or CA3 areas by 24.2 +/- 4.5% and 17.2 +/- 5.8%, respectively. In the presence of the A, antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX; 100 nM), the inhibitory effect of CADO (1 microM) on 45Ca2+ influx was prevented in CA1 synaptosomes, but was converted into a facilitatory effect (14.2 +/- 6.7%) in CA3 synaptosomes. The A2A agonist, CGS 21680 (3-30 nM) facilitated 45Ca2+ influx in CA3 synaptosomes, with a maximum increase of 22.9 +/- 3.9% at 10 nM, and was virtually devoid of effect in CA1 synaptosomes. This facilitatory effect of CGS 21680 (10 nM) in CA3 synaptosomes was prevented by the A2A antagonist 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine (CSC; 200 nM), but not by the A1 antagonist, DPCPX (20 or 100 nM). The facilitatory effect of CGS 21680 on 45Ca2+ uptake by CA3 synaptosomes was prevented by the class A calcium channel blocker, omega-agatoxin-IVA (200 nM). These results indicate that presynaptic adenosine A2A receptors facilitate calcium influx in the CA3 but not the CA1 area of the rat hippocampus through activation of class A calcium channels.",
