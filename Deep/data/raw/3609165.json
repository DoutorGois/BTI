     "AB": "Amygdala (AMYG) stimulation caused marked increase in the circulating level of glucagon and these stimulatory effects were abolished by lesions of stria terminalis (ST). Stimulation of dorsal hippocampus (DHPC), on the other hand, greatly decreased the glucagon level and lesions of dorsal fornix (DFX) abolished these stimulatory effects. These results suggested that the reciprocal influence of AMYG and DHPC on plasma level of glucagon played some role in the regulation of glucagon release and these limbic structure had hypothalamic-mediated effects on glucagon release.",
