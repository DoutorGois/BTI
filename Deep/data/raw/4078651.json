     "AB": "A classical cross-breeding study involving the inbred mouse strains DBA/2 and C3H/HeJ revealed a rather complex mode of inheritance for the following hippocampal variables: size of stratum pyramidale, number of supra-, intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fiber synapses, and the size of terminal fields receiving entorhinal input. A polygenic mode of inheritance was inferred for these phenotypes. For the size of the regio inferior a model containing additive genetic effects only was sufficient to explain the variation between generations. The strain difference may be caused by one genetic factor only. In agreement with previous experiments a strong negative correlation between the number of intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fiber synapses and shuttle-box avoidance performance was found in the genetically heterogeneous F2 population.",
