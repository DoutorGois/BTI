     "AB": "Serotonin (5-HT) system has a significant role in anxiety- and depression-related states and may be influenced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This study examined extracellular 5-HT levels and expression of BDNF in rats with persistently low or high levels of exploratory activity (LE and HE, respectively). Baseline extracellular levels of 5-HT as assessed by in vivo microdialysis in conscious animals were similar in both groups in medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dentate gyrus (DG). No differences were found in parachloroamphetamine-induced 5-HT release in either region. However, LE animals had significantly higher levels of 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) binding in PFC and a larger increase in extracellular 5-HT levels after administration of citalopram (1 microM) into this area by retrograde dialysis. No difference in 5-HTT levels was found in hippocampus, while perfusion with citalopram was accompanied by a greater increase in extracellular 5-HT in the HE group in this brain region. LE-rats had higher levels of BDNF mRNA in the PFC but not hippocampus. In contrast, levels of nerve growth factor mRNA were similar in these brain regions of LE- and HE-rats. The differential regulation of 5-HT-ergic system in LE- and HE-rats in PFC and hippocampus may form the basis for their distinct anxiety-related behaviours.",
