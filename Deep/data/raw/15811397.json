     "AB": "To examine the effects of arachidonic acid (AA) on age-related cognitive deficits, F-344 rats were administered with an AA-supplemented powder diet from 79 weeks of age (OA group). For comparison, we also used an age-matched control group of animals (OC group) that were fed with a non AA-supplemented powder diet. When the subjects reached 87 weeks old, they were trained for Morris water maze place and cue tasks. Escape latencies of the OA group on the place task were significantly shorter than those of the OC group in the latter half of training. The probe test showed that OA rats remembered the trained platform position significantly better than OC rats. In the cue task training, the OC group was significantly slower than the OA group at the beginning of training, but their performance soon matched with that of the OA group. Fatty acids in the hippocampi were measured after the behavioral testing. There was no difference in AA composition in hippocampal phospholipids between the OA and OC groups. However, regression analysis conducted on AA composition and place task performance showed a significant correlation between these two parameters. The present study suggests that AA administration to aged animals can alleviate age-related deficits in spatial cognition.",
