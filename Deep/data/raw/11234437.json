     "AB": "The hippocampus as a important limbic structure has polyfunction properties among which take place chronotropic activity. It is showed in instability of different biological rhythms that provided for adaptation of organism to changing environment conditions. Chronotropic activity may be depenede from reciprocal connections of the hippocampus with brain rhythmorganizing structures (suprachiasmatic nuclei of hypothalamus and pineal gland). Increase of hippocampal excitability after chronic stress are produce disorganization of some rhythmic processes and followed neurosis or psychical depression. Psychotropic drugs (anxiolytics and antidepressants) by means of intensified of hippocampal inhibitory mechanisms (previously GABA and 5-HT) are stabilized of biorhythms what determined their specific anxiolytic and antidepressant effects.",
