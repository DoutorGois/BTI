     "AB": "The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the direct activation of the Wnt signaling pathway by its endogenous Wnt-3a ligand prevents the toxic effects induced by amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta) in rat hippocampal neurons. We report herein that the Wnt-3a ligand was indeed able to overcome toxic effects induced by Abeta in hippocampal neurons, including a neuronal impairment on cell survival, an increase in glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and tau phosphorylation, a decrease in cytoplasmic beta-catenin and a decrease in the expression of the Wnt target gene engrailed-1. We further demonstrate that Wnt-3a protects hippocampal neurons from apoptosis induced by Abeta. Our results support the hypothesis that a loss of function of Wnt signaling may play a role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.",
