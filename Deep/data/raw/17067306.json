     "AB": "Associations formed between conditioned stimuli and drug reward are major contributors in human drug addiction. To better understand the brain changes that accompany this process, we used immunohistochemistry for c-Fos (a neuronal activity marker), synaptophysin (a marker for synaptogenesis) and tyrosine kinase B receptor (a neurotrophic factor receptor that mediates synaptic plasticity) to investigate the neural substrates of amphetamine-induced conditioned place preference in rats. Conditioned place preference was induced by both 1.0 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg doses of amphetamine. Furthermore, amphetamine conditioning increased the density of c-Fos-immunoreactive cells and these cells were fully colocalized with the tyrosine kinase B receptor in the dentate gyrus, CA1 field and basolateral amygdala. Amphetamine conditioning increased the density of synaptophysin-immunoreactive varicosities in all brain regions studied, except the nucleus accumbens shell and dorsolateral striatum. The degree of conditioned place preference was highly correlated with c-Fos-immunoreactive cell density in the basolateral amygdala and with the density of synaptophysin-immunoreactive varicosities in all mesolimbic regions studied. The latter correlation was particularly impressive for the ventral pallidum and basolateral amygdala. The formation of conditioned stimulus-amphetamine reward associations is accompanied by tyrosine kinase B receptor expression in the basolateral amygdala and dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA3 fields of the hippocampus. These data therefore suggest that the formation of conditioned stimulus-reward associations requires, at least in part, activation of amygdalar-hippocampal circuits.",
