     "AB": "The functional and neuroanatomical protective effects of clomethiazole (CMZ) were examined in an animal model of global forebrain ischemia. Gerbils underwent sham-surgery or were rendered ischemic by the application of aneurysm clips to both carotid arteries for 6 min. Three treatment groups received CMZ (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, or 150 mg/kg) 30 min before ischemia, and one group was given 150 mg/kg of CMZ 30 min after ischemia. Following recovery, the gerbils were tested in a radial-arm maze to assess memory functions. Histological evaluation was assessed blindly using a percentile scoring system. The results indicate that pre-ischemic treatment with 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg of CMZ reduced brain damage and working memory errors significantly. Treatment dosage of 150 mg/kg of CMZ was the most effective in preventing neuronal damage in the hippocampus and eliminating the working memory deficit typically induced by ischemia.",
