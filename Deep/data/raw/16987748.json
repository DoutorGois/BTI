This symptom has been most frequently observed in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and is rarely the principal clinical feature of seizures. No specific etiology of epilepsy associated with pilomotor seizures has been reported. We present the first case of a patient who experienced sudden and transitory epilepsy with pilomotor seizures occurring several times a day for months, and associated with sequential changes of the left hippocampus demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging.
