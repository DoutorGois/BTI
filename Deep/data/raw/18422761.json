     "AB": "Differentiating between injurious and reparative factors facilitates appropriate therapeutic intervention. We evaluated the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in parenchymal brain pathology resolution following virus-induced encephalitis from a picornavirus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). We infected the following animals with TMEV for 7 to 270 days: B6/129 TNF(-/-) mice (without TNFalpha expression), B6/129 TNFR1(-/-) mice (without TNFalpha receptor 1 expression), and B6/129 TNFR2(-/-) mice (without TNFalpha receptor 2 expression). Normal TNFalpha-expressing controls were TMEV-infected B6, 129/J, B6/129F1 and B6/129F2 mice. Whereas all strains developed inflammation and neuronal injury in the hippocampus and striatum 7 to 21 days postinfection (dpi), the control mice resolved the pathology by 45 to 90 dpi. However, parenchymal hippocampal and striatal injury persisted in B6/129 TNF(-/-) mice following infection. Treating virus-infected mice with active recombinant mouse TNFalpha resulted in less hippocampal and striatal pathology, whereas TNFalpha-neutralizing treatment worsened pathology. T1 \"black holes\" appeared on MRI during early infection in the hippocampus and striatum in all mice but persisted only in TNF(-/-) mice. TNFR2 [corrected] mediated hippocampal pathology resolution whereas TNFR1 [corrected] mediated striatal healing. These findings indicate the role of TNFalpha in resolution of sublethal hippocampal and striatal injury.",
