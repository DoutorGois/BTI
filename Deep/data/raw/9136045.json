     "AB": "The septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathway has traditionally been thought of as essential for spatial memory. Recent studies have demonstrated intact spatial learning following removal of this pathway with an immunotoxin selective for cholinergic neurons. In the present experiment, rats with selective removal of hippocampal cholinergic input were tested in a delayed nonmatching-to-position task in a water version of the radial arm maze. This allowed us to increase and parametrically vary the memory load compared with the standard Morris water maze (by varying the delay between the initial four choices and the final four choices) to determine if this would reveal a deficit in rats with lesions of septo-hippocampal cholinergic projections. Male Long-Evans rats were given injections of 192 IgG-saporin, a selective immunotoxin for cholinergic neurons, into the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band (MS/VDB) to remove cholinergic projections to the hippocampus, or a control surgery. The rats were trained on the radial maze task following surgery. An escape platform was located at the end of each arm of the maze and was removed after an arm was utilized for escape. After initial training, a delay was interposed between the first four trials and the second four trials. Errors during the second four-trial component were scored in two categories: retroactive (reentering an arm chosen before the delay) and proactive (reentering an arm chosen after the delay). Retroactive errors increased as delay increased (from 60 s to 6 h) but were equivalent in control and MS/VDB-lesion groups. Proactive errors did not vary with delay and were also unaffected by the lesion. Radioenzymatic assays for choline acetyltransferase activity in the hippocampus of lesioned rats confirmed a significant loss of cholinergic input from the MS/VDB. These results indicate that normal spatial working memory is possible after substantial loss of septo-hippocampal cholinergic projections.",
