     "AB": "CERTAIN DIAGNOSIS: Because the certainty diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is defined after autopsy or brain biopsy by the presence of neurofibrillar degeneration (NFD), extracellular senile plaques and vascular deposits of amyloid in the hippocampus amygdalus and the cerebral cortex, some authors have searched for biological ante-mortem markers of AD, particularly in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which is essentially derived from brain tissue. SEARCH FOR MARKERS: Studies have investigated the CSF level of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, amino acids, trace elements, constituents of NFD and senile plaques in a diagnostic and pathogenic perspective. HOPE FOR DIAGNOSIS: Even though ethical, technical and methodological difficulties met by authors are important and even though many clinical and biological parameters must be taken into account, these studies bring important pathogenic evidence and allow hope that markers of AD which are so necessary for early diagnosis and objective study of therapies will be found.",
