     "AB": "Chronic mild stress (CMS) affects the hippocampal structure and function in the rat. S100B, a calcium-binding protein secreted by astrocytes, has been shown to be increased in serum of patients with depression and associated with good therapeutic response and clinical outcome. This work aimed to study the impact of CMS and fluoxetine on depressive-like behaviors in rats, as well as the concomitant expression of the astroglial protein S100B and of its receptor RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) in the hippocampus and Cerebrospinal fluid of the same group of animals. S100B and sRAGE (circulating soluble form of RAGE) were measured in CSF by ELISA, and S100B and RAGE were measured in hippocampal slices by Western blot. Our study has demonstrated that stress and depression decrease S100B and RAGE/SRAGE expression and antidepressant treatment reverses or blocks these effects. This result suggested that S100B/RAGE interactions may be involved in the development and maintenance of depression and may play an important role in the mechanism of antidepressants' therapeutic action.",
