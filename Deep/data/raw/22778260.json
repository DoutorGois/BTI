     "AB": "Gephyrin is a scaffold protein essential for the postsynaptic clustering of inhibitory glycine and different subtypes of GABA(A) receptors. The cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in gephyrin-mediated receptor clustering are still not well understood. Here we provide evidence that the gephyrin-binding protein collybistin is involved in regulating the phosphorylation of gephyrin. We demonstrate that the widely used monoclonal antibody mAb7a is a phospho-specific antibody that allows the cellular and biochemical analysis of gephyrin phosphorylation at Ser-270. In addition, another neighbored epitope determinant was identified at position Thr-276. Analysis of the double mutant gephyrin(T276A,S277A) revealed significant reduction in gephyrin cluster formation and altered oligomerization behavior of gephyrin. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases in hippocampal neurons reduced postsynaptic gephyrin mAb7a immunoreactivities. In vitro phosphorylation assays and phosphopeptide competition experiments revealed a phosphorylation at Ser-270 depending on enzyme activities of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1, -2, or -5. These data indicate that collybistin and cyclin-dependent kinases are involved in regulating the phosphorylation of gephyrin at postsynaptic membrane specializations.",
