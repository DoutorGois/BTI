     "AB": "We considered the evolution of Ca2+ oscillation dynamics in recurrent seizure-like events. Dynamic system behaviour was characterized in the state space reconstructed from intra- and extracellular [Ca2+] fluctuations simultaneously measured in cultured rat hippocampal slices under low-[Mg2+] conditions. When associated in the seizure-like event, these fluctuations occurred on a restricted set, the attractor, embedded in the full state space with less than five degrees of freedom. Instantaneous relative phase differences indicated field potential-driven phase jumps locked onto seizure-like events. To account for recurrent dynamics, calculations were performed on different extensions of a model for Ca2+ oscillation. These identified bidirectional, asymmetrical coupling of extracellular with intracellular (cytosolic, Ca2+ store, mitochondrial) Ca2+ dynamics as critical in its development.",
