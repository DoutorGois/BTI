     "AB": "V-1 protein is a novel member of the cdc10/SWI6 motif-containing protein superfamily several members of which have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in the regulation of intracellular signaling. In the present study we examined the distribution of V-1 mRNA in the murine central nervous system (CNS). Northern analysis revealed the expression of V-1 mRNA in various regions of the brain with the following rank order: hippocampus, cerebellum > cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata, pons > thalamus. In situ hybridization also showed that V-1 mRNA is widely distributed in various regions of the brain, with parallel expression levels to those revealed by Northern analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the V-1 protein exists in various types of neurons, mainly in cell bodies but also in dendrites, axons and possibly in synaptic areas. These expression patterns of the V-1 gene in the murine CNS suggest that the V-1 protein performs some common function in different classes of neurons. We found no significant difference in the expression level of V-1 mRNA in cerebellar granule cells between the control and mutant mice of Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd). In comparison with our previous data obtained in another mutant, staggerer, we discussed the effects of target deprivation on the expression of V-1 mRNA in cerebellar granule cells.",
