     "AB": "Altered calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis is thought to play a key role in aging and neuropathology resulting in memory deficits. Several forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity are dependent on Ca2+, providing a potential link between altered Ca2+ homeostasis and memory deficits associated with aging. The current study reviews evidence for Ca2+ dysregulation during aging which could interact with Ca(2+)-dependent synaptic plasticity. The authors suggest that changes in Ca2+ regulation could adjust the thresholds for synaptic modification, favoring processes for depression of synaptic strength during aging.",
