     "AB": "Bath application of therapeutic concentrations of the anticonvulsant carbamazepine suppressed penicillin-induced synchronized afterdischarging in immature rat CA3 hippocampal pyramidal cells. Afterdischarging was completely abolished in all preparations at a concentration of 30 microM (IC50 = 8.5 +/- 1.4 microM; mean +/- S.E.M.). The duration of the preceding epileptiform burst was not altered at this concentration and was diminished by only 24.4 +/- 1.2% at a supratherapeutic concentration of 100 microM. These results suggest that a carbamazepine-sensitive neurophysiological mechanism distinct from those responsible for epileptiform burst generation plays a key role in the generation of afterdischarges in developing hippocampus.",
