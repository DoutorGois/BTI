     "AB": "Chronic lead exposure during development is known to produce learning deficits. In the present study, we investigated the effects of developmental exposure to lead on spatial memory, as shown in the Morris water maze, and on expression of inducible cyclooxygenase-2 protein in the hippocampi of male rats. Rats were separated into four groups according to which concentration of lead acetate at which developmental stage they were exposed. One group was exposed maternally to lead acetate at a concentration of 250 parts per million (ppm), one group was exposed continuously to 250 ppm lead, one group was exposed maternally to 750 ppm lead, and one group was exposed continuously to 750 ppm lead. Increases were observed in both average escape latency and traveled distance of the rats in the maternally and continuously 750 ppm lead-exposed groups, indicating significant impairment of spatial memory. Quantitative immunostaining analysis by optical density measurement of brain sections from rats in all lead-exposed groups revealed a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the intensity of cyclooxygenase-2 immunoreactivity in the Ammon's horn region 1 (CA1) and the dentate gyrus areas of the hippocampus. This reduction was concentration-dependent, with the maximum reduction observed in rats exposed to 750 ppm lead. Taken together, these findings suggest that exposure to lead causes spatial memory deficits in male rats and a significant reduction in cyclooxygenase-2 immunoreactivity in the CA1 and dentate gyrus areas.",
