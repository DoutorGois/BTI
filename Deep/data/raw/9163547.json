     "AB": "A recent postmortem study has reported that there is a widespread upregulation of GABA(A) receptor binding activity throughout most subregions of the hippocampal formation of schizophrenic brain. The current study has been undertaken to determine whether the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor, which is a component of the GABA(A) receptor complex, may also be upregulated in schizophrenics. Using a low-resolution film autoradiographic technique to localize [3H]flunitrazepam binding, the subregional and laminar distribution of specific BZ receptor binding was found to parallel that of the GABA(A) site, except in the area dentata where BZ binding was approximately 73% higher in the outer molecular layer. When BZ receptor binding was compared in the same normal control (n = 15) and schizophrenic (n = 8) cases in which the GABA(A) receptor was analyzed, there were very few differences noted between the two groups, except for small, though significant, increases in the stratum oriens of CA3 (30%), the subiculum (20-30%) and the presubiculum (15-20%) of the patient group. These latter increases overlapped with the subregions and laminae in schizophrenics showing the most marked increases of GABA(A) receptor binding. Using a high-resolution technique to evaluate specific BZ receptor binding on different neuronal subtypes, no difference was observed on either pyramidal or nonpyramidal neurons of sector CA3 where GABA(A) receptor activity had been found to be significantly increased on the latter neuronal subtype. The potential confounding effects of age, postmortem interval and exposure to either benzodiazepine or neuroleptic drugs do not account for the lack of marked differences in BZ receptor binding in the schizophrenic group. Taken together, the results of this study are consistent with the possibility that defective GABAergic integration in schizophrenia may be associated with an uncoupling in the regulation of the GABA(A) and BZ receptors.",
