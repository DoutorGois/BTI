     "AB": "Electroconvulsive shock (ECS) has been reported to induce the phosphorylation and activation of 42-kDa, but not 44-kDa, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in rat hippocampus. We studied the activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPKs in rat brain after ECS. We observed the increase of the activities of both 42- and 44-kDa MAPKs in rat hippocampus after ECS. The activities reached peak at 2 min and returned to basal levels by 15 min after ECS. We also observed the increased phosphorylation on the tyrosine residue of 42-kDa MAPK in rat hippocampus after ECS, but not on that of 44-kDa MAPK. However, when we examined the immunoprecipitated 44-kDa MAPK, we could demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphorylation of 44-kDa MAPK at 2 min after ECS was markedly increased, in accordance with the increase of kinase activity. These results indicate that ECS induces the transient activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of 44-kDa MAPK, as well as 42-kDa MAPK, in rat hippocampus, although the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation is far less and the kinase activity is lower in 44-kDa MAPK than in 42-kDa MAPK.",
