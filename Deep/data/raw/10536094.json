     "AB": "Latent inhibition (LI) is the deficit of conditioning resulting from repeated nonreinforced preexposure to a conditioned stimulus before its pairing with an unconditioned stimulus. There are cumulative data showing that large lesions of the hippocampal formation disrupt LI. However, the effects of selective lesions of the different components of the hippocampal formation have never been directly addressed in the same study and conditioning paradigm. The first experiment of the present study aimed at investigating the effects of excitotoxic lesions of the hippocampus, subiculum, or entorhinal cortex on LI in an \"off-baseline\"-conditioned emotional response procedure. Hippocampus or subiculum lesions had no effect on either LI or conditioning. In contrast, entorhinal cortex lesions disrupted LI without modifying conditioning. In Experiment 2, locomotor activity in a novel environment was assessed in the same rats. Whereas lesions of hippocampus increased locomotor activity, lesions of the subiculum or the entorhinal cortex were devoid of effect. Although both LI and habituation to novel environmental cues are thought to involve interactions between the hippocampal formation and the mesolimbic pathway, these results indicate a functional dissociation between the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex.",
