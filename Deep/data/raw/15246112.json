     "AB": "RATIONALE: Altered expression of glutamate transporter EAAT2 protein has been reported in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Two alternative EAAT2 mRNA splice forms, one resulting from a partial retention of intron 7 (I7R), the other from a deletion of exon 9 (E9S), were previously implicated in the loss of EAAT2 protein in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. METHODS: By RT-PCR we studied the occurrence of I7R and E9S in neocortical and hippocampal specimens from TLE patients and non-neurological controls. RESULTS: Both splice forms were found in all neocortical specimens from TLE patients (100% I7R, 100% E9S). This was significantly more than in controls (67% I7R, 60% E9S; P < 0.05). We also detected I7R and E9S in all seven motor cortex post-mortem samples from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Within the TLE patient group, both splice variants appeared significantly more in non-sclerotic (100%), than in sclerotic hippocampi (69%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the epileptic brain, especially that of TLE patients without hippocampal sclerosis, is highly prone to alternative EAAT2 mRNA splicing. Our data confirm that the presence of alternative EAAT2 splice forms is not disease specific.",
