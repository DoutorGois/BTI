PAS positive foci, containing particles 1-2 mu in diameter, were observed in the hippocampal region of 8 and 16 month old mice. These particles were diastase sensitive. Electron microscopically, in similar mice, a vacuolating change was observed in the cytoplasm of perithelial cells (pericytes) in the same area.",
