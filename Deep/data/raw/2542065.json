     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to obtain more insight into the role of GABAB receptors in the rat hippocampus using the selective GABAB blocker phaclofen. In the CA1 region in normal slices, phaclofen (1 mM) had no effect on population spike amplitude. Moreover, phaclofen did not affect paired-pulse inhibition when the paired-pulses were delivered at short interpulse intervals (20-30 ms). At longer interpulse intervals (50-150 ms) phaclofen moderately reduced paired-pulse inhibition. In slices treated with submaximal concentrations of bicuculline methiodide or penicillin, the frequency and amplitude of electrically induced multiple population spikes were not affected by phaclofen. The GABAB agonist baclofen, however, attenuated paired-pulse inhibition and this effect was antagonized by phaclofen. In the CA3 region, phaclofen reduced the inhibitory effect of baclofen on penicillin-induced burst discharges. In conclusion, although phaclofen antagonized the effects of baclofen it did not show proconvulsant activity. Furthermore, phaclofen did not induce any pronounced signs of disinhibition of hippocampal pyramidal cells as is usually seen with the GABAA receptor-blocker bicuculline methiodide.",
