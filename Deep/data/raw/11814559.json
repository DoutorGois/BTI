     "AB": "Recent therapeutic investigations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been guided by two seemingly opposed hypotheses: the amyloid cascade theory, which favors the amyloid plaques as the cause of AD; and the cholinergic theory, which favors cholinergic neuron loss as the cause. New investigations indicate that the synthesis and processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is linked to the trophic actions of nerve growth factor. A pathological cascade in both AD- and Down's syndrome-related memory loss could be triggered by alterations in APP processing or ACh-mediated neuronal function, or both, which in turn trigger the overexpression of amyloid beta, synaptic malfunction and trophic factor loss in target regions. This eventually leads to synaptic and dendritic loss with age.",
