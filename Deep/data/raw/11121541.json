     "AB": "A role for p53-mediated modulation of neuronal viability has been suggested by the finding that p53 expression is increased in damaged neurons in models of ischemia and epilepsy. P53 gene upregulation precedes apoptosis in many cell types, and a potential role for this molecule in apoptosis of neurons has already been demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies suggest that p53-associated apoptosis may be a common mechanism of cell loss in several important neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we examined changes in p53-immunoreactive (IR) neurons in the brains of aged rats for the first time employing immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization methods. P53-IR neurons were found in the CA1 region of hippocampus, septal region and cerebellum in the aged rats, but there was no p53-IR cell in the brains of adult rats. In the hippocampus of the aged rat, p53-IR cells predominated in the stratum oriens and pyramidal layers, while the molecular layer contained relatively few p53-IR cells. The most prominent population of immunoreactive labeling in cerebellar cortex was localised within the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and dendrites in molecular layers. Upregulation of p53 in the Purkinje cells observed in this study suggests that significant loss of Purkinje cells with aging may be regulated with several apoptosis-controlling factors including p53 and oxidative stress mechanism. Further investigations are required to establish whether direct functional relations exist between p53 and the apoptotic neuronal death in normal aging or Alzheimer brains.",
