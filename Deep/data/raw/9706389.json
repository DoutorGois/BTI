Sci. U.S.A., 81 (1984) 3143-3147.]. We examined effects of gestational exposure to the neurotoxicant, methylmercury (CH3Hg), on the developmental profile of immunoreactivity (IR) for alpha, beta, gamma and epsilon PKC isoforms and cytosolic PKC activity. Long-Evans dams were dosed on gestational days (GD)6-15 (p.o.) with 0, 1, or 2 mg kg-1 day-1 CH3Hg dissolved in saline. Pups were sacrificed and perfused with buffered paraformaldehyde on post-natal days (PND) 1, 4, 10, 21, 45 and 85. The brains were sectioned sagittally, stained immunohistochemically, and examined throughout the medial to lateral extent. IR in neuronal cell bodies for PKC isoforms alpha, beta, gamma, and epsilon was densest in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, shell of the inferior colliculus, pons, cerebral, piriform, and cerebellar cortex, whereas axonal staining was prominent in the brainstem, internal capsule, corpus callosum, anterior commissure, fornix and olfactory tract. In controls, the PKC alpha and epsilon IR was highest on PND1-4, decreased dramatically by PND10, and decreased further by PND21. In the neonate, the regional and cellular distributions of alpha and epsilon IR were similar. The PKC gamma IR was greater at post-weaning ages (PND21-85) with the greatest regional density apparent in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum. Only the highest dose of CH3Hg (2 mg kg-1 day-1; GD6-15) produced a persistent decrease in regional alpha and epsilon, but not beta or gamma IR during the post-natal period. These regional and time-dependent changes in PKC isoforms were complemented by the examination of PKC activity in cortex, olfactory bulb, cerebellum and brainstem. Cytosolic PKC activity increased from PND1 to 10 in cortex, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. On PND21, PKC activity decreased in the cortex and olfactory bulb, but remained high in the cerebellum. By contrast, PKC activity in the brainstem was highest on PND1 and 4 and decreased dramatically by PND21. CH3Hg (2 mg kg-1 day-1) significantly decreased PKC activity on PND1 and 4 in the cortex. The present results characterize the cellular and regional ontogeny of PKC isoenzymes alpha, beta, gamma and epsilon, and indicate that developmental exposure to CH3Hg can alter the ontogeny of specific isoforms and regional PKC activity.",
