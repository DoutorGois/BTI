Because activation of the calpain system might contribute to the impairment of synaptic transmission in Alzheimer's disease, we are currently testing the hypotheses that a treatment with calpain inhibitors might restore normal cognition and synaptic transmission in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease, the APP (K670N:M671L)/PS1(M146L) mouse. Findings derived from these studies will provide a novel approach to cognitive enhancement in Alzheimer's disease.",
