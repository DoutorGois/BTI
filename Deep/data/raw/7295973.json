     "AB": "Experiments on unrestrained rabbits were carried out to study the role of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and midbrain reticular formation (MRF) in escape reaction elicited by electrical stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). DH stimulation made ipsi- or contralaterally to the stimulated hypothalamic center of \"affective reactions\" increased while MRF stimulation reduced the latency of escape. Coagulation of the structures inhibited escape reaction in rabbits. The inhibition of the latter reaction in hippocampectomized animals was characterized by the increased general motor activities, whereas rabbits with lesions in the MRF were adynamic. That the DH and MRF play a different role in the mechanisms by which excitations spread from the VMH to the neocortical areas was revealed after computer analysis of the power of the main EEG rhythms.",
