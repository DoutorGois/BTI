     "AB": "An immunoglobulin (IgG) fraction from serum of a rabbit immunized with a highly purified preparation of glucocorticoid receptor from rat liver cytosol contained specific antibodies to glucocorticoid receptor. This was shown following incubation of the [3H]triamcinolone acetonide-glucocorticoid receptor (TA-GR) complex with the IgG fraction by (I) adsorption of the [3H]triamcinolone acetonide-glucocorticoid receptor (TA-GR) complex with the IgG fraction by (I) adsorption of the [3H]TA-GR-antibody complex to protein A linked to Sepharose, (II) an increased sedimentation rate of the [3H]TA-GR-antibody complex compared to that of the [3H]TA-GR complex, and (III) an increased molecular size of the [3H]TA-GR-antibody complex when compared to that of the [3H]TA-GR complex as judged from gel filtration. The antibody fraction was characterized with regard to titer, cross-reactivity and specificity. The antibodies cross-reacted with the glucocorticoid receptor from various rat tissues (liver, thymus and hippocampus), as well as with the glucocorticoid receptor from human normal lymphocytes, chronic lymphatic leukemia cells and human hippocampus. In the rat liver, the antibody bound to both the nuclear and the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor (stokes radius 6.1 nm). It did not cross-react with the proteolytic fragments of the glucocorticoid receptors, the 3.6 nm complex or the 1.9 nm complex. Binding of the antibodies was not seen to the androgen, estrogen or progestin receptors in rat or to rat serum transcortin. With an indirect competitive ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) combined with various separation techniques, based on different physicochemical principles, it was shown that the glucocorticoid receptor was the only detectable antibody binding protein from rat liver cytosol using this assay system. These findings also indicate an immunochemical similarity between glucocorticoid receptors in different tissues as well as in different species, but not between glucocorticoid receptors and other steroid hormone receptor proteins. The cytosolic and nuclear glucocorticoid receptors in rat liver were shown to be immunochemically similar.",
