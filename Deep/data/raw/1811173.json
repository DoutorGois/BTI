     "AB": "Tianeptine is a tricyclic antidepressant which enhances serotonin uptake in certain brain areas. Tianeptine has been reported to improve both working and reference memories in rodents. The effects of tianeptine on the spontaneous activity of medial septal neurons were studied in rats anesthetized with urethane. Systemic administrations (0.2-1 mg/kg i.v.) of tianeptine decreased the spontaneous activity and disorganized or suppressed the rhythmically bursting activity of medial septal neurons, in a dose related manner. Iontophoretic administrations of tianeptine did not modify the spontaneous activity of medial septal neurons. Changes of the bursting activity were inconsistent. However, tianeptine blocked partially or completely the inhibition induced by the serotonin in 68% of the cases. In contrast, other antidepressants (amitriptyline, clomipramine and fluoxetine) potentiated the inhibitory effect of serotonin in 50%-60% of the cases. Our results show that tianeptine, applied by iontophoresis, has an effect on the medial septal neurons which was opposite to that of other antidepressants. On the basis of our findings, it can be tentatively proposed that tianeptine may have a beneficial effect on memory by counteracting the serotonin-induced inhibition of medial septal neurons.",
