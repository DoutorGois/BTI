     "AB": "The anatomy of pathways containing the calcium binding protein calretinin was investigated in the forebrain of the rat, using a combination of immunohistochemical and retrograde tract tracing techniques. Numerous well identified pathways do contain calretinin, whereas others do not. Pathways arising from the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area, the dorsal raphe, the lateral mammillary nucleus, the supramammillary nucleus, the triangular septal and septo-fimbrial nuclei, several thalamic nuclei, the parabrachial nucleus, the peripeduncular nucleus, the medial amygdala contain at least some calretinin. The proportion of projection neurons containing calretinin ranged from 2% (dorsal raphe to caudate) to about 75% (triangular septal nucleus to habenula, medial amygdala to the ventromedial hypothalamus). More than 50% of the nigro-striatal neurons contain calretinin immunoreactivity. In contrast, other pathways do not contain any calretinin immunoreactivity (for instance the pathways arising from cerebral cortex, locus coeruleus, cholinergic forebrain nuclei), although calretinin may be present in local neurons in these structures. The present study demonstrates that calretinin is not associated specifically with projection neurons or local neurons, identified transmitter systems or functionally related pathways in the forebrain of the rat.",
