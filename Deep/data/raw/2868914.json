     "PG": "157-8",
     "AB": "Two components of the venom of the predatory wasp Philanthus triangulum F. significantly reduce--to a greater or less extent--the high affinity uptake of glutamate in rat hippocampus. A concentration of 10 microM delta-PTX caused a reduction of 74%, while the other component, beta-PTX, at the same concentration, caused a reduction of 18%. Hence the effect of delta-PTX on high affinity glutamate uptake in the hippocampus is comparable with its effect on high affinity glutamate uptake in insect neuromuscular junctions. Contrary to our previous findings that beta-PTX has no effect on high affinity glutamate uptake in insect glutamatergic terminal axons, however, beta-PTX significantly reduces high affinity glutamate uptake in the hippocampus, albeit less effectively than delta-PTX.",
