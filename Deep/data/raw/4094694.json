     "AB": "The cholinergic projection from the nucleus basalis magnocellularis to the neocortex has been implicated in normal memory function and in the dementia of Alzheimer's disease. In order to investigate functions of this cholinergic system of the forebrain, rats with unilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis have been compared with normal animals and with rats given cortically-placed transplants, either of cholinergic-rich embryonic ventral forebrain cells or of control noncholinergic cells taken from embryonic hippocampus. In the first experiment, lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis led to impairments in step-through passive avoidance and Morris' water-maze tasks, and to locomotor hyperactivity attributable to a reduction in within-trial habituation. The ventral forebrain grafts, but not the noncholinergic hippocampal grafts, significantly ameliorated the deficits of passive avoidance retention, and of water-maze spatial accuracy, but had no effect on the acquisition impairments in either task, nor on the habituation deficit in locomotor activity of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis lesioned rats. In the second experiment, the lesions induced contralateral sensory neglect and ipsilateral turning biases, which were also partially ameliorated by the ventral forebrain grafts. The results support the hypothesis that the basal forebrain-neocortical cholinergic system contributes to certain memory processes, but suggest a more general role for this system in other cortical functions also.",
