     "AB": "While it is well documented that the overactivation of ionotropic glutamate receptors leads to seizures and excitotoxic injury, little is known about the role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in epileptogenesis and neuronal injury. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of the group I mGluR specific agonist (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (3,5-DHPG) (1.5 micromol) to conscious rats produced severe and delayed seizures (onset at 4 hr) in 70% of the animals. The i.c.v. infusion of the group I mGluR non-selective agonist 1S,3R-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD) (2 micromol) produced a similar rate of severe seizures, but with an early onset (0.6 hr). The analysis of motor activity showed that 3,5-DHPG elicited higher central stimulatory action than did 1S,3R-ACPD. Histopathological analysis of the hippocampus showed that 3,5-DHPG produced severe neuronal damage mainly in the CA1 pyramidal neurons and, to a lesser extent, in the CA3. Although 1S,3R-ACPD infusion also induced a slight injury of the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, damage was greater in the CA4 and dentate gyrus cells. In conclusion, the in vivo activation of group I mGluRs with the selective agonist 3,5-DHPG produces hyperexcitatory effects that lead to seizures and neuronal damage, these effects being more severe than those observed after infusion of the non-selective agonist 1S,3R-ACPD.",
