     "AB": "MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) is a cytoskeletal phosphoprotein that regulates the dynamic assembly characteristics of microtubules and appears to provide scaffolding for organelle distribution into the dendrites and for the localization of signal transduction apparatus in dendrites, particularly near spines. MAP2 is degraded after ischemia and other metabolic insults, but the time course and initial triggers of that breakdown are not fully understood. This study determined that MAP2 resides in a complex with the NMDA receptor, suggesting that spatially localized changes may be important in the mechanism of MAP2 redistribution and breakdown after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Using OGD in the adult rat hippocampal slice as a model system, this study demonstrated that MAP2 breakdown occurs very early after OGD, with the first statistical decrease in MAP2 levels within the first 30 min after the insult. There is a dramatic redistribution of MAP2 to the somata of pyramidal neurons, particularly neurons at the CA1-subiculum border. Free radicals and nitric oxide are not involved in the damage to MAP2. NMDA-receptor activation plays a prominent role in the MAP2 breakdown. In direct response to NMDA receptor activation, calcium influx, likely through the receptor ion channel complex, as well as release of calcium from the mitochondria through activation of the 2Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger of mitochondria, triggers MAP2 degradation. The proteolysis of MAP2 is limited by endogenous calpain activity, likely via the spatial access of calpain to MAP2.",
