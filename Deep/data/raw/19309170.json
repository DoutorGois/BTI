     "AB": "The ability to monitor living cell behavior in real time and with high spatial resolution is vital for advancing our knowledge of cellular machinery and evaluating cellular response to various drugs. Here, we report the development and utilization of carbon-based nanoelectrodes for cell electrophysiology. We employ carbon nanopipettes (CNPs), novel carbon-based nanoprobes which integrate carbon nanopipes into the tips of pulled glass capillaries, to measure electrical signals in the mouse hippocampal cell line HT-22. Using a standard electrophysiology amplifier in current-clamp mode, we measured the resting membrane potential of cells and their transient membrane response to extracellular pharmacological agents. In addition to their superior injection capabilities reported previously, CNPs are capable of multifunctionality, enabling, for example, concurrent intracellular injection and electrical measurements without damaging cells.",
