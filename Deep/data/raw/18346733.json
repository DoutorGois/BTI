     "AB": "Accumulating evidence indicates that stem cells have the ability to improve neurological deficits seen after cerebral ischemia. However, the effects of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) on cerebral ischemia-induced learning and memory dysfunction remain to be clarified. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the injection of exogenous NPCs could prevent learning and memory dysfunction after cerebral ischemia. Sustained cerebral ischemia was produced by the injection of 700 microspheres into the right hemisphere of each rat. We demonstrated that injection of NPCs into the hippocampus at 10 min after the induction of cerebral ischemia reduced prolongation of the escape latency seen in acquisition and retention tests of the water maze task on Days 12-28 after cerebral ischemia. Injection of NPCs partially attenuated the decrease in viable areas of the ipsilateral hemisphere on Day 28 after the cerebral ischemia. We also demonstrated that injection of NPCs prevented the decrease in the level of BDNF seen at the early period after cerebral ischemia. These results suggest that the injection of exogenous NPCs into the hippocampus can prevent cerebral ischemia-induced learning and memory dysfunction, possibly through maintenance of the BDNF level.",
