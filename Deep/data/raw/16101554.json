Since it is not yet clear whether the neuron-glia response obtained in this pathology is a secondary effect of an aggressive inflammation or if it is somehow related to the cause of the epileptic condition, with the present review we guide the readers through the complex and ambiguous crosstalk between neuroimmunology and epilepsy.",
