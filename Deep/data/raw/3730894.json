     "AB": "Binding sites for [3H]vasopressin were identified in brains of neonatal (days 0-23) and adult (90 day) Long-Evans and Brattleboro rats, using a technique of in vitro receptor autoradiography. Results indicate that the regional distribution of binding sites for [3H]vasopressin in the brain changes markedly during postnatal development. Binding sites in the septum proliferated slowly to attain adult distribution in the dorsal and lateral septum, while in other regions, such as the caudate, hippocampus and cingulate gyrus, intense labeling appeared early in development but disappeared by adulthood. In the amygdala, binding did not change during postnatal development. Binding sites in the septum appeared before vasopressinergic fibers are present. Also, binding was present for vasopressin in regions which have not yet been reported to receive vasopressinergic innervation. Therefore, it is proposed that the presence of binding sites for vasopressin is independent of the presence of vasopressin itself. This hypothesis is supported by labeling in the Brattleboro rat which was comparable to that in the Long-Evans.",
