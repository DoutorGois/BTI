     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: We introduce a technique for performing a selective amygdalohippocampectomy (AH) through a minisupraorbital approach. METHODS: A minisupraorbital craniotomy and an anterior selective AH were performed in 8 cadaver heads (16 sides). The anatomic specimens were analyzed, and the extent of resection of the hippocampus and amygdala was evaluated. Surgically relevant measurements were performed using anatomic specimens. An image-guided system was used to document the extent of the anterior AH. Laboratory data were used to support the clinical application of the technique. RESULTS: The anterior route allowed removal of the amygdala and hippocampus, as confirmed by anatomic assessment. The image-guided system and anatomic evaluation confirmed that the amygdala and hippocampus can be accessed and removed through this route. The mean distance between the anterior aspect of the uncus and the tip of the temporal horn was 17.0 +/- 4.6 mm; the mean distance from the head of the hippocampus to the posterior border of the cerebral peduncles was 26.0 +/- 3.2 mm. Clinical application resulted in satisfactory removal of the amygdala and hippocampus. CONCLUSION: The anterior route for selective AH is a logical and straightforward approach to the mesial temporal lobe. Compared with other variations, it is less invasive and destructive, especially in terms of the fibers of the optic pathway, temporal stem, and lateral temporal neocortex.",
