     "AB": "Glutamate measurement in microdialysis samples has primarily been determined using HPLC methods, and several attempts have been made to establish a relationship between this neurotransmitter and EEG activity during altered brain function, such as epilepsy. However, classic microdialysis methods lack high temporal resolution. In this study, a new alternative is proposed to improve the time resolution and thus obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of Glu and its relationship with epileptiform activity. A new setup was designed to measure Glu online in microdialysates using enzymatic reactors and fluorescence detection. In this study, we performed EEG recordings and Glu measurements simultaneously in the hippocampus to establish their relationship with the epileptiform events that are induced by pentylenetetrazole in intact and epileptic rats. Basal Glu levels in intact and animals with spontaneous seizures were not significantly different. However, a significant increase in Glu levels was detected during the first pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure in both groups. EEG analysis showed that the amplitude of epileptiform activity was higher in rats with spontaneous seizures and that the frequency of this activity did not change. The results showed that this method can be used to determine Glu changes at high temporal resolution and that these changes can be related to seizure activity. In addition, this method can also be used to measure other neurotransmitters that generate fluorescent derivatives. Moreover, this new technique has the following advantages compared with classical neurochemical methods: easy setup, low training requirements, no need for separation, rapidity, and the experimental data can be obtained and analysis performed in a single session.",
