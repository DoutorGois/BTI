     "AB": "Electrophysiological characteristics of the hippocampal slices of juvenile (14-27 days) or young (36-40 days) Wistar rats have been compared. In the juvenile rats measurements were taken daily, from postnatal day (PN) 14 to PN27. Input-output curves were used to quantify the ontogeny of excitatory processes. The dynamic of population spike (PS) maturation was not even during the investigated postnatal period. After day 19 transient decrease of PS amplitude was observed until day 22. There were also some differences between the shape of input-output curves from the slices of rats of different ages. In general, PS was saturated at lower intensities in younger animals. The slices from 19-day-old rats did not display saturated input-output curve with 2-20 V stimuli intensities. But input-output curves on PN20-22 were rather similar to that obtained before PN19. The periods of gradual increase and subsequent decrease of PS amplitudes during early ontogeny correlate with the appearance of certain forms of behaviour. This fact suggests that hippocampal PS amplitude depression may be relevant functionally.",
