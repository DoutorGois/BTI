     "AB": "The effects of brief anoxic episodes on rat CA3 hippocampal neurons were studied with intracellular and extracellular techniques in the in vitro slice preparation. After repeated (3-7 times), brief (2-6 min duration each) applications of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) saturated with 95% N2 and 5% CO2, electrical stimulation of various inputs to CA3 neurons, evoked an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) followed by an all-or-none burst. This response which persisted for several hours after the last anoxic episode, is reminiscent of the bursts induced by various convulsive agents. Post anoxic bursts are generated by a polysynaptic network which converge on the apical distal segment of CA3 neurons. It is concluded that a repetitive impairement of metabolism produces long lasting changes in the synaptic properties of CA3 neurons.",
