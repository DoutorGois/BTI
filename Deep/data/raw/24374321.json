     "AB": "Cotinine, a major metabolite of nicotine, has produced improved learning and memory in rodents and non-human primates and corrects apomorphine-induced loss of pre-pulse startle inhibition in rats. The present study assessed cotinine, both acute and chronic (7-day), in the sensory inhibition paradigm in DBA/2 mice. These mice spontaneously show a deficit in hippocampal sensory inhibition, as assessed by the P20-N40 EEG paradigm, which models the deficit observed in schizophrenia patients. Anesthetized DBA/2 mice were recorded in the CA3 region of hippocampus for inhibition of paired, identical auditory stimuli, then administered cotinine (0.33, 0.1, 0.33, 1.0 or 3.3 mg/kg SQ) and recorded for 90 min. At doses of 0.1, 0.33 and 1.0 mg/kg, there were significant increases in conditioning amplitude, with no changes in test amplitude or TC ratio. Blockade of alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptors with central administration of DHBetaE blocked the increase in the conditioning amplitude induced by the 1.0 mg/kg dose of cotinine, as did blockade of alpha7 nicotinic receptors with alpha-bungarotoxin. Daily injections of 0.33, 1.0 or 3.3 mg/kg for 7 days produced similar increases in the conditioning amplitude on the 7th day, but only at the 0.33 and 3.3 mg/kg doses. Determination of the \"carry over\" effect of the previous 6 daily doses of cotinine, prior to the 7th dose, showed that there was a significant increase in the conditioning amplitude as compared to the baseline data for mice receiving the equivalent acute dose. There were no significant effects on test amplitude or TC ratio for any of the chronic doses. These data suggest that cotinine modulates the conditioning amplitude in the sensory inhibition paradigm through the alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor and possibly also through the alpha7 nicotinic receptor, as well. However the data do not suggest that cotinine is a potential therapeutic for the treatment of sensory inhibition deficits in schizophrenia.",
