     "AB": "Inflammation may play a role in postoperative cognitive dysfunction. 5' Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-kappa B, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha are involved in inflammation. Therefore, these inflammatory mediators may be involved in postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Western immunoblot analysis revealed 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B in the hippocampus of aged rats were increased 1-7 days after splenectomy. Moreover, interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were upregulated and gradually decreased. Therefore, these inflammatory mediators may participate in the splenectomy model of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in aged rats.",
