The most marked inhibition of the enzymes studied following tacrine administration was demonstrated in the frontal cortex, diaphragm, liver and blood. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in the frontal cortex and blood only was observed following administration of tacrine derivatives. The results indicate that inhibition of cholinesterases could be important but not unique part explaining the action of these drugs in general.",
