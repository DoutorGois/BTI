     "AB": "Glutamatergic mechanisms are thought to be involved in stress-induced changes of brain function, especially in the hippocampus. We hypothesized that alterations caused by the hormonal changes associated with chronic and acute stress may affect glutamate uptake and release from hippocampal synaptosomes in Wistar rats. It was found that [3H]glutamate uptake and release by hippocampal nerve endings, when measured 24 h after 1 h of acute restraint, presented no significant difference. The exposure to repeated restraint stress for 40 days increased neuronal presynaptic [3H]glutamate uptake as well as basal and K+-stimulated glutamate release when measured 24 h after the last stress session. Chronic treatment also caused a significant decrease in [3H]glutamate binding to hippocampal membranes. We suggest that changes in the glutamatergic system are likely to take part in the mechanisms involved in nervous system plasticity following repeated stress exposure.",
