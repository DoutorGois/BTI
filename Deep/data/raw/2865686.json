     "AB": "Male Wistar rats were fed a diet of 24% protein either ad lib (AL) or every other day (EOD) beginning shortly after weaning. Rats were killed at 6 or 24-months of age. The corpus striatum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum were assayed for muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding and the activities of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), L-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Sensecent rats maintained on EOD feeding schedules from weaning showed a markedly higher density of striatal muscarinic binding sites and higher activities of cerebellar, hippocampal, and striatal ChAT, as compared with values in AL-fed rats. Regional GAD and TH activities were relatively unaffected by EOD feeding; however, at 6 months, EOD-fed rats had higher cortical GAD and lower cortical TH activities than corresponding AL-fed rats. EOD feeding for only 2 weeks produced no significant effects on neurochemical parameters examined in 24-month-old rats. We conclude that EOD feeding from weaning can alter neurochemical markers of senescence in rat brain; that cholinergic systems are affected in particular; and that the observed alterations produced by EOD feeding represent chronic rather than acute effects.",
