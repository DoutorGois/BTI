     "AB": "To clarify experimentally which of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor or regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) imaging is more sensitive in the detection of epileptic foci, we simultaneously examined the BZ receptor and rCBF distribution changes in hippocampal kindled rabbits with in vivo double tracer autoradiography using 125I-labeled Ro 16-0154 (125I-Iomazenil) and 99mTc-labeled hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO). In visual analysis of brain slices extracted after the intravenous injection of the double tracer following the kindling completion, 125I-Iomazenil accumulation was more markedly and extensively decreased in the kindled right CA1 region mimicking a primary epileptic focus than 99mTc-HMPAO accumulation. Further, this decrease in 125I-Iomazenil accumulation was not due to neuropathological abnormalities which consisted only of tissue damage corresponding to electrode track in the right CA1. These results suggest that BZ receptor imaging is more sensitive in the detection of epileptic foci than rCBF imaging and, therefore, that BZ receptor imaging is useful in clinical epilepsy.",
