     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of 1-bromopropane (1-BP) on the functions of learning-memory and the central cholinergic system in rats. METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: low 1-BP group (200 mg/kg), middle 1-BP group (400 mg/kg), high 1-BP group (800 mg/kg) and control group, and the exposure time was 7 days. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was applied to evaluate the learning-memory function in rats. After the MWM test, the rats were sacrificed, the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were quickly dissected and homogenized in ice bath. The activity of acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in supernatant of homogenate were detected. RESULTS: The latency and swim path-length of rats in middle and high 1-BP groups prolonged significantly in place navigation test and the efficiency of searching strategy obviously decreased, as compared with control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). In spatial probe test, the number of crossing platform in three 1-BP groups decreased significantly, as compared with control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The cortical AChE activity of rats in middle and high 1-BP groups was significantly higher than that of control and low 1-BP group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The AChE activity in rat hippocampus of high 1-BP group obviously increased, as compared with control group as compared with control group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference of cortical ChAT activity between three 1-BP groups and control group (P > 0.05). In the hippocampus, there was no difference of ChAT activity among the groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: 1-BP exposure could significantly influence the learning-memory function in rats due to the increase of AChE activity.",
