     "AB": "Inhibitory transmission in the hippocampus is predominantly GABAergic, but electrophysiological data evidenced strychnine-sensitive glycine-induced currents. However, synaptic currents have not been reported. Here, we describe, for the first time, the presence of GlyR clusters in several areas of the hippocampus as well as in cultured hippocampal neurons. In contrast with spinal cord, hippocampal GlyRs contain alpha2 but no alpha1 subunit. Optical and electron microscopy indicates that GlyRs can be synaptic as well as extrasynaptic. Synaptic GlyRs were apposed to glycinergic boutons characterized by the expression of the vesicular and the plasma membrane transporters of glycine (VIAAT and GlyT2, respectively). Double labeling with calcium-binding proteins showed that GlyT2 could be detected in boutons innervating both excitatory cells (soma and dendrites) and interneurons. Finally, GlyR clusters could be detected at synaptic sites with the GABAA receptor gamma2 subunit and gephyrin, suggesting that mixed GABA/glycine synapses might exist in the hippocampus.",
