     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Giving glucose before hypoxic ischemia worsens brain injury in piglets. Does giving glucose after hypoxic ischemia affect severity of injury? METHODS: Forty-three 0- to 3-day-old pigs were used. All piglets received 2 U/kg insulin before injury to prevent stress-induced hyperglycemia. Hypoxic ischemic brain damage was induced by clamping both carotid arteries and reducing arterial blood pressure to two thirds of normal by hemorrhage at time 0. At 15 minutes the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) was reduced to 6%. At 30 minutes FIO2 was increased to 100%, the carotids were released, and the withdrawn blood was reinfused. The piglets were then randomized to receive either 2 mL/kg of 50% dextrose followed by 2 mL/kg per hour for 2 hours or an equal volume of saline. RESULTS: Neurological examination scores (20 is normal, 5 is brain dead, by blinded observer) at 1 day postinjury were similar in the two groups: glucose, median 15.5 (25th percentile, 12.2; 75th percentile, 18); controls, 15.6 (9.3, 18). Piglets were killed at 3 days with brain preservation at death. Pathological examination scores (sum of scores from cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia: 30 is normal, 3 is total necrosis) by blinded observer were similar in the two groups: glucose, 26 (18, 28); controls, 25 (16.5, 28); NS. CONCLUSIONS: Although elevated glucose levels during hypoxic ischemic injury worsen brain injury in the piglet, elevated glucose levels after injury do not affect the severity of the injury.",
