     "AB": "Previously, we have identified 200 cDNA fragments as antidepressant related genes/ESTs. In this study, using these cDNAs, we developed our original cDNA microarray for rapid secondary screening of candidate genes as the novel therapeutic targets. With this microarray, we found that the expression of a novel gene, ADRG34, was significantly increased in rat hippocampus which had been chronically treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, sertraline. RT-PCR analysis also demonstrated the induction of ADRG34 at mRNA levels in rat hippocampus and the frontal cortex. This cDNA encoded 685 amino acid residues containing a RING-H2 finger motif at the carboxy-terminal. Sequence analysis of ADRG34 with the EMBL/GenBank database showed significant homology to mouse and human kf-1 gene. Our data suggest that ADRG34, a possible rat homologue of kf-1, may be one of the common functional molecules induced after chronic antidepressant treatment.",
