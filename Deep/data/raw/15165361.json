     "AB": "The behavioral and histological effects of the lateral fluid percussion (LFP) brain injury model were compared with the weight drop impact-acceleration model with 10 min of secondary hypoxia (WDIA + H). LFP injury resulted in significant motor deficits on the beam walk and inclined plane, and memory deficits on the radial arm maze and Morris water maze. Motor deficits following LFP remained throughout 6 weeks of behavioral testing. WDIA + H injury produced significant motor deficits on the beam walk and inclined plane immediately following injury, but these effects were transient and recovered by 14 days post-injury. In contrast to the LFP injury, the WDIA + H injured animals showed no memory deficits on the radial arm maze and Morris water maze. In order to determine if the differences in behavioral outcome between models were due to differences in injury mechanism or injury severity, 10 LFP-injured animals were matched with 10 WDIA-injured animals based on injury severity (i.e., time to regain righting reflex after brain injury). The LFP-matched injury group showed greater impairment than the WDIA + H matched injury group on the radial arm maze and Morris water maze. Histological examination of LFP-injured brains with Fluoro-Jade staining 24 h, 48 h, and 7 days post-injury revealed degenerating neurons in the cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, caudate-putamen, brainstem, and cerebellum, with degenerating fibers tracts in the corpus callosum and other major tracts throughout the brain. Fluoro-Jade staining following WDIA+H injury revealed damage to fibers in the optic tract, lateral olfactory tract, corpus callosum, anterior commissure, caudate-putamen, brain stem, and cerebellum. While both models produce reliable and characteristic behavioral and neuronal pathologies, their differences are important to consider when choosing a brain injury model.",
