     "AB": "Our previous studies have shown evidence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis in the hippocampus and mPFC in an animal model of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IRE1alpha) and its downstream molecule X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) play key roles in the ER-related apoptosis pathway. Dysregulation of the locus coeruleus (LC) has been reported to contribute to cognitive and/or arousal impairments associated with PTSD. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of IRE1alpha pathway in neuronal apoptosis in the LC of rat models of PTSD. We used an acute exposure to prolonged stress (single prolonged stress, SPS) to model PTSD in rats and examined the effects related to the IRE1alpha pathway. Neuronal apoptosis in LC was detected by transmission electron microscopy and TUNEL staining. The results showed that the level of LC neuronal apoptosis was markedly increased after SPS. SPS exposure triggered IRE1alpha pathway, as evidenced by the increased activity of IRE1alpha, specific splicing of XBP1, and up-regulated expression of binding immunoglobulin protein/78kDa glucose-regulated protein (BiP/GRP78), and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP). Treatment with STF-083010, an IRE1alpha RNase-specific inhibitor, successfully attenuated the above changes. These results indicate that excessive activation of the ER stress-associated IRE1alpha pathway is involved in LC neuronal apoptosis induced by SPS exposure; this may be a crucial mechanism of the pathogenesis of PTSD.",
