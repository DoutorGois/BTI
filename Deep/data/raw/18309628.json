     "AB": "It was shown in experiments on rabbit and mice that acute stress induced increase in glycemia and zinc content of blood granulocytes, hippocampus, beta-insulocytes, the cells of intestinal krypts basal departments and prostate terminal departments. Such changes also occurred under adrenaline and prednisolone injections. On the contrary, the decrease in glycemia and cell zinc content is induced by pilocarpine injections. The data obtained indicate the role of sympato-adrenale system in regulation of cell zinc metabolism. The increase in cell zinc content under acute stress is accompanied by decrease of given metal concentration in blood plasma. This situation is evidently connected with zinc dislocation from the plasma into the cells. Zinc content changes in the cells of experimental animals were in conformity with their secretory material quantity changes, indicating possible functional connections of both components in the cells.",
