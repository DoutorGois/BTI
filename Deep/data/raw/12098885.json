     "AB": "In the dentate gyrus of the mammalian hippocampus, neurogenesis carries on throughout postnatal life. The aim of this work was to identify an exogenous control factor of adult neurogenesis. Neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus was previously found to be enhanced in vitamin E-deficient rats. The effects of alpha- or beta-tocopherol supplementation on neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus were investigated by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling. Tocopherol was found to increase the survival of newborn cells and the total number of granule cells in the adult rat dentate gyrus. Newborn cells were phenotypically characterized by expression of the immature neuron marker TOAD-64 (turned on after division-64). Therefore tocopherol in high doses possibly increases the number of granule cells in the dentate gyrus by saving newborn cells from death.",
