     "AB": "The mechanism of disinhibition produced by (+/-)-baclofen was studied using intracellular recording in area CA1 of rat hippocampal slices. Baclofen reversibly depressed monosynaptic IPSPs evoked by direct activation of interneurons in the presence of the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX) and D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV). Ba2+ prevented baclofen-induced hyperpolarization of pyramidal neurons but not depression of monosynaptic IPSPs by baclofen. Baclofen reversibly depressed monosynaptic IPSPs when applied close to the recording site, but was ineffective when applied close to the stimulating site in stratum radiatum. These results suggest that baclofen disinhibits pyramidal neurons in area CA1 of the rat hippocampus by activating receptors on the terminals of inhibitory neurons that are coupled to a Ba(2+)-insensitive effector mechanism.",
