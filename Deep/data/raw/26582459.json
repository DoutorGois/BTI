     "AB": "The 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), a serine/threonine kinase that modulates the phosphorylation of the 40S ribosomal protein S6, regulates cell cycle progression and is known as a tau kinase in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD brains, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) have been shown to be positively stained with antibodies against S6K proteins phosphorylated at T389 (pT389-S6K) or T421/S424 (pT421/S424-S6K) by the mammalian target of rapamycin and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, respectively. However, there is little information available about S6K proteins directly phosphorylated at T229 (pT229-S6K) by the PI3K-PDK1 pathway. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of pT229-S6K in post mortem human brain tissues from elderly (control) and patients with AD using immnunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. pT229-S6K immunoreactivity was localized to small granular structures in neurons and endothelial cells in control and AD brains. In AD brains, intense pT229-S6K immunoreactivity was detected in 16.3% of AT8-positive NFTs, neuropil threads, and dystrophic neurites in the hippocampus and other vulnerable brain areas. In addition, Hirano bodies were also positive for pT229-S6K but were negative for pT389-S6K or pT421/S424-S6K. The present results indicate that S6K phosphorylation via the PI3K-PD1 pathway is involved in tau pathology in NFTs and abnormal neurites as well as actin pathology in Hirano bodies.",
