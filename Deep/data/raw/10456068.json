     "AB": "Expression of the activity-dependent gene c-fos was used to assess relative levels of neuronal activation in the amygdala and related structures of rats at different stages of odor discrimination learning. In situ hybridization was used to evaluate c-fos mRNA content within the amygdalar subdivisions, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the hippocampus. After initial exploration of the test apparatus, c-fos mRNA levels were increased in the medial and, to lesser extent, basolateral subdivisions and remained low in the central division. The balance of amygdala to hippocampal labeling favored hippocampus. Rats engaged in familiar nose-poke responses had comparably elevated labeling in the medial and basolateral divisions and low labeling densities in the central division. The ratio of hippocampal to amygdala labeling was at control levels. Rats required to switch from ad libitum responding to cued responding to odors had high basolateral to medial labeling ratios. This was in marked contrast to the medial dominance found in control and exploration rats. Hybridization was substantially more dense in basolateral amygdala than in hippocampal CA1; this imbalance was unique to the group required to form first associations between odors and rewards. Rats performing an overtrained odor discrimination had the least differentiation between amygdalar subdivisions of any behavioral group. The hippocampus-to-amygdala labeling ratio favored hippocampus and was nearly identical to the ratio in exploration rats. These results demonstrate that the balance of activity within the between limbic structures shifts according to behavioral demands. It is suggested that the balances reflect the availability of pertinent afferent cues, interactions between hippocampus and the extended amygdala, and relative levels of activity in the diffuse projections to the limbic system.",
