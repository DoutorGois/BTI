     "AB": "Although NCX-3 is highly expressed in the brain, the distribution of NCX-3 in the epileptic hippocampus is still controversial. Therefore, to assess the distribution and pattern of NCX-3 expression in epileptic hippocampus, we performed a comparative analysis of NCX-3 immunoreactivities in the hippocampus of seizure-resistant (SR) and seizure-sensitive (SS) gerbils. In SR gerbils, NCX-3 immunoreactivity was higher than pre-seizure SS gerbils, particularly in the pavalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons. Three h post-ictal, NCX-3 immunoreactivity in the SS gerbil hippocampus was markedly elevated to the level of SR gerbils. Six h post-ictal, the expression of NCX-3 was reduced to the level of pre-seizure SS gerbils. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that down-regulation of NCX-3 expression in the SS gerbil hippocampus may be involved in the hyperexcitability of SS gerbils due to an imbalance of intracellular Na(+)/Ca(2+) homeostasis and Ca(2+) concentration.",
