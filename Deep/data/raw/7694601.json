     "AB": "At room temperature (23 degrees C-25 degrees C), the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1 of slices from young male Sprague-Dawley rats was depressed by preincubation with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 100 microM) and NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 microM). The D isomers were ineffective under the same conditions. Hemoglobin (20 microM) reduced but did not completely block LTP. Neither L-NA (at concentrations up to 1 mM) nor hemoglobin (20 microM) had any significant effect on LTP in slices from adult rats at room temperature, or in young rats at 29 degrees C-30 degrees C. These results suggest that nitric oxide is unlikely to play a role in the induction of LTP under physiological conditions.",
