     "AB": "The mechanical strain of the neural tissue induced by the implant of neuronal electrode is one of the important factors responsible for the quality and performance of extracellular recording of neuronal activities in the brain because the mechanical strain could kill or inactivate the neurons. In order to evaluate the effect of the implant of neural electrode, we propose a method to estimate the three-dimensional distribution of electrophysiologically active neurons near the electrode based on the multi-site multi-unit recording data. The spatial distribution of the active neurons emerges the region in the neural tissue that could be killed or inactivated by the implant of the electrode. The proposed method will be useful for the in situ assessment of the neural electrode implanted in the brain.",
