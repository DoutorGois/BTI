     "AB": "We previously showed that a low frequency (1 Hz) train of perforant path stimulation evokes burst discharges in the dentate gyrus of hippocampal slices obtained from patients surgically treated for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. We report here that multiple population spikes that characterize the burst discharge are blocked reversibly by the specific NMDA receptor antagonist, D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV). The epileptiform discharge evoked in human dentate gyrus by stimulation trains of 1 Hz could be reproduced in the rat dentate gyrus in vitro by the same stimulation protocol but required the presence of low concentrations (0.2-0.6 mM) of extracellular magnesium. We suggest that low frequency orthodromic stimulation of dentate granule cells through the perforant path progressively evokes an increase in the activation of NMDA receptors resulting in burst discharges in tissue from epileptic patients.",
