     "AB": "Soluble amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) oligomers are primary mediators of synaptic dysfunction associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Such Abeta oligomers exist dependent on their rates of aggregation and metabolism. Use of selective somatostatin receptor-subtype agonists have been identified as a potential means to mitigate Abeta accumulation in the brain, via regulation of the enzyme neprilysin. Herein, we first evaluated the impact of the somatostatin receptor subtype-4 agonist 1-[3-[N-(5-Bromopyridin-2-yl)-N-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)amino]propyl]-3-[3-(1H-imidaz ol-4-yl)propyl]thiourea (NNC 26-9100) on learning and memory in 12-month SAMP8 mice (i.c.v. injection). NNC 26-9100 (0.2 mug-dose) was shown to enhance both learning (T-maze) and memory (object recognition) compared to vehicle controls. Cortical and hippocampal tissues were evaluated subsequent to NNC 26-9100 (0.2 mug) or vehicle administration for changes in neprilysin activity, along with protein expression of amyloid-precursor protein (APP), neprilysin, and Abeta(1)(-)(4)(2) oligomers within respective cellular fractions (extracellular, intracellular and membrane). NNC 26-9100 increased neprilysin activity in cortical tissue, with an associated protein expression increase in the extracellular fraction and decreased in the intracellular fraction. A decrease in intracellular APP expression was found with treatment in both cortical and hippocampal tissues. NNC 26-9100 also significantly decreased expression of Abeta(1)(-)(4)(2) trimers within both the extracellular and intracellular cortical fractions. No expression changes were found in membrane fractions for any protein. These finding suggest the potential use of selective SSTR4 agonists to mitigate toxic oligomeric forms of Abeta(1)(-)(4)(2) in critical regions of the brain identified with learning and memory decline.",
