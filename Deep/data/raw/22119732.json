     "AB": "The 5-HT2A receptor subtype (5-HT2Ar) plays an important role in the modulation of the hippocampal region activity and it has been associated with learning and memory processes. In the present study, the 5-HT2Ar was immunohistochemically localized in the rat hippocampal region, which includes the hippocampal formation and the parahippocampal region. In the hippocampal formation (dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper and subiculum) and entorhinal cortex, the colocalization of the 5-HT2Ar with the inhibitory transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was studied using double immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. The patterns of immunostaining were very different in non-injected and colchicine-injected rats. In untreated rats, the immunoreactivity could be attributed especially to neuropil. Interestingly, in non-injected rats, the 5-HT2Ar immunoreactivity was located in the mossy fibers, suggesting that serotonin acts presynaptically via this receptor subtype directly on glutamate axons. Pretreatment with colchicine increased the number of 5-HT2Ar-immunoreactive somata. Morphological and double immunofluorescence analyses indicated that the 5-HT2Ar was located on both the excitatory and the inhibitory neurons of the rat hippocampal region. The results of the present study suggest that the 5-HT2Ar could participate in the hippocampal neurotransmission by acting on different neuronal populations.",
