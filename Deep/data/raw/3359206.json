     "AB": "An in vitro study was conducted to investigate whether the sensitivity to low glucose (0.5 mM) of dentate granule cell evoked activity was increased in more excitable tissue preparations. Four different measures of granule cell excitability were made under control conditions in the presence of 10 mM glucose. Three showed a positive correlation between excitability of populations of cells and the sensitivity of their population spikes to low glucose. There was a particularly strong correlation between the latency of the population spike and the period of superfusion in low glucose medium required to depress the amplitude of the spike by 25%. The data suggest that increased excitability of dentate granule cells is associated with an increased vulnerability to low glucose.",
