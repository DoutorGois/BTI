     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether the nitric oxide (NO) precursor, L-arginine, can prevent the antidepressant-like action of the fast-acting antidepressant, ketamine, in a genetic rat model of depression, and/or induce changes in the glutamate (Glu)/N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)/NO/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signalling pathway. Hereby it was evaluated whether the NO signalling system is involved in the antidepressant mechanism of ketamine. METHODS: Flinders sensitive line (FSL) rats received single i.p. injections of ketamine (15 mg/kg) with/without pre-treatment (30 min prior) with L-arginine (500 mg/kg). Depression-like behaviour was assessed in the forced swim test (FST) in terms of immobility, and the activation state of the Glu/NMDAR/NO/cGMP pathway was evaluated ex vivo in the frontal cortex and hippocampus regions in terms of total constitutive NOS (cNOS) activity and cGMP concentration. RESULTS: L-Arginine pre-treatment prevented the antidepressant-like effect of ketamine in the FST, as well as a ketamine-induced increase in cGMP levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of FSL rats. Ketamine reduced cNOS activity only in the hippocampus, and this effect was not reversed by L-arginine. CONCLUSION: Both the behavioural and molecular results from this study indicate an involvement for the NO signalling pathway in the antidepressant action of ketamine. Although not easily interpretable, these findings broaden our knowledge of effects of ketamine on the NO system.",
