     "AB": "Morphological alterations compromising inter-neuronal connectivity may be directly linked to learning-memory deficits in Central Nervous System neurodegenerative processes. Cu(II)-mediated oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in regulating redox reactions generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), known contributors to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The antioxidant properties of flavonoid catechin have been well-documented in neurodegenerative processes. However, the impact that catechin encapsulation in nanoparticles may have on neuronal survival and morphological lesions has been poorly demonstrated. To investigate potential effects of nano-encapsulated catechin on neuronal survival and morphological aberrations in primary rat hippocampal neurons, poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-modified silica nanoparticles were synthesized. Catechin was loaded on silica nanoparticles in a concentration-dependent fashion, and release studies were carried out. Further physicochemical characterization of the new nano-materials included elemental analysis, particle size, z-potential, FT-IR, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), thermogravimetric (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis in order to optimize material composition linked to the delivery of loaded catechin in the hippocampal cellular milieu. The findings reveal that, under Cu(II)-induced oxidative stress, the loading ability of the PEGylated/CTAB silica nanoparticles was concentration-dependent, based on their catechin release profile. The overall bio-activity profile of the new hybrid nanoparticles a) denoted their enhanced protective activity against oxidative stress and hippocampal cell survival compared to previously reported quercetin, b) revealed that morphological lesions affecting neuronal integrity can be counterbalanced at high copper concentrations, and c) warrants in-depth perusal of molecular events underlying neuronal function and degeneration, collectively linked to preventive nanotechnology in neurodegeneration.",
