     "AB": "In this work we investigated the effect of nanomolar concentrations of nitric oxide on the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from rat brain nerve terminals using a radioisotope method with [3H]GABA and a spectrofluorimetric method with Ca2+-sensitive probe Fluo-4 AM. It was shown that in the presen-ce of dithiothreitol (DTT), nitric oxide donor SNAP at concentration, in which it produces NO in the nanomolar range, caused Ca2+-independent [3H]GABA release from nerve terminals. The applications of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and nipecotic acid (NA), as the inducers of GABA release from vesicular and cytoplasmic pools, showed that the maximum of SNAP/+DTT-induced [3H]GABA release was registered at 10th min of incubation and coincided in time with significant increase (almost double) in NA-induced [3H]GABA release. At this time point, 4-AP-induced release of [3H]GABA was drastically reduced. At the 15th min of incubation of nerve terminals with SNAP/+DTT, the opposite picture was observed: the decrease in NA- and increase in 4-AP-induced [3H]GABA release. Thus, nitric oxide in the form of S-nitrosothiols at nanomolar concentrations causes Ca2+-independent GABA leakage from synaptic vesicles into cytosol with subsequent release from nerve terminals. The reuptake of the neurotransmitter and its re-accumulation in synaptic vesicles occur later.",
