     "AB": "Congenitally helpless rats, selectively bred to model features of endogenous depression, appear to have a paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH) that is markedly hyperactive. This study investigated septal and hippocampal regions purported to regulate the PVH. We found that cytochrome oxidase, an index of oxidative metabolism and neural activity, was significantly elevated in the hippocampus and subiculum of congenitally helpless rats. However, reduced activity was observed in the lateral and medial septal nuclei, the nucleus of the diagonal band, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. This dissociation between hippocampal and septal activity may be a predisposing factor for the development of helpless behavior.",
