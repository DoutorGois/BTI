     "AB": "Acute administration of the selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), citalopram (1-10 mg/kg, i.p. 1 h before an elevated plus-maze test), to Spontaneously Hypertensive rats (SHRs), Lewis (LEW) rats, and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, i.e., rat strains differing for their emotionality, promoted anxiety, and/or hypoactivity, except in WKY rats. In the three strains, such a pretreatment increased central 5-HT levels and/or decreased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels. Hippocampal, but not midbrain or striatal, [3H]citalopram binding at 5-HT transporters was lower in WKY rats than in SHRs. However, neither [3H]5-HT reuptake kinetics nor the potencies of citalopram (1-1000 nM) to inhibit [3H]5-HT reuptake into hippocampal and striatal synaptosomes differed between strains. This was confirmed in vivo by means of microdialysis in the hippocampus of freely moving rats. Thus, although LEW rats displayed a 3-4 fold higher baseline level of extracellular 5-HT in the hippocampus, compared with SHRs and WKY rats, local perfusion with 1 microM citalopram promoted relative increases in extracellular 5-HT levels over baseline that were similar in all strains. Lastly, acute i.p. administration of 3.3 mg/kg citalopram (1 h beforehand) decreased to similar extents [3H]5-HT reuptake into hippocampal synaptosomes from SHRs and WKY rats. This study indicates that genetic differences in the behavioural responses to SSRIs may involve 5-HT transporter-independent mechanisms.",
