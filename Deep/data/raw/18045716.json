     "AB": "Alterations in the morphology and movement of mitochondria influence neuronal viability. However, the precise mechanisms of such alterations are unclear. In this study, we showed calcineurin was involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Glutamate stimulation inhibited mitochondrial movement and decreased mitochondrial length in neurons. FK506 and cyclosporine A, calcineurin inhibitors, attenuated the effects of glutamate on mitochondrial dynamics. It was also found that glutamate treatment dephosphorylated, a proapoptotic protein, Bad and promoted its translocation to mitochondria in neurons via calcineurin. These results provide important new insights into intracellular signaling pathways that regulate mitochondrial dynamics and neuronal cell death.",
