     "AB": "IMPACT is an inhibitor of GCN2, a kinase that phosphorylates the alpha subunit of the translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2 alpha). GCN2 has been implicated in regulating feeding behavior and learning and memory in mice. IMPACT is highly abundant in the brain, suggesting its relevance in the control of GCN2 activation in the central nervous system. We describe here the distribution of IMPACT in the brain of rodents (mice and rats) and of a primate (marmoset) using highly specific antibodies raised against the mouse IMPACT protein. Neurons expressing high levels of IMPACT were found in most areas of the brain. In the hippocampal formation the lack of IMPACT in the dentate gyrus granule cells was striking. The hypothalamus is exceptionally rich in neurons expressing high levels of IMPACT, particularly in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The only exception to this pattern was the ventromedial nucleus. The thalamic neurons are mostly devoid of IMPACT, with the exception of the paraventricular, reuniens and reticular nuclei, and intergeniculate leaf. The brainstem displayed high levels of IMPACT. For the marmoset, IMPACT expression in the brain is not as prominent when compared to other organs. In the marmoset brain the pattern of IMPACT expression was similar to rodents in most areas, except for the very strong labeling of the Purkinje cells, the lack of IMPACT-positive neurons in the nucleus reuniens, and weak labeling of interneurons in the hippocampus. GCN1, the activator of GCN2 to which IMPACT binds, is widely distributed in all neuronal populations, and all IMPACT-positive cells were also GCN1-positive. The data presented herein suggest that IMPACT may be involved in biochemical homeostatic mechanisms that would prevent GCN2 activation and therefore ATF4 (CREB-2) synthesis in neurons.",
