     "AB": "In our previous studies (J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2000;19:233-241), kappa opioid receptors were immunocytochemically identified in inhibitory interneurons of the dentate hilus and CA1 area of the rat hippocampus. From among the known interneuron subtypes, somatostatin- (SOM) and neuropeptide Y- (NPY) immunoreactive (IR) hippocampal interneurons show morphology and distribution similar to the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) immunopositive cells. In the present study, with the help of double immunocytochemical labelling, we provide direct evidence that the majority of the interneurons immunoreactive for SOM and/or NPY also express the kappa opioid receptor. The receptor was localized on the perikaryal and proximal dendritic region of the SOM- and NPY-immunopositive neurons in the dentate hilus and the CA1 region. From among the SOM-immunoreactive cells, 77% in the dentate hilus and 51% in the CA1 stratum oriens was double labelled. In the case of NPY-immunoreactive neurons this proportion was 56 and 65%, respectively. The co-expression of KOR and SOM/NPY suggests that hippocampal interneurons can selectively be activated by the different opioids under different physiological circumstances.",
