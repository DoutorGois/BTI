     "AB": "Since the metabolic activity of neural cells is accompanied by heat release, brain temperature monitoring provides insight into behavior-associated changes in neural activity. In the present study, local temperatures were continuously recorded in several brain structures (nucleus accumbens, medial-preoptic hypothalamus and hippocampus) and a non-locomotor head muscle (musculus temporalis) in a receptive female rat during sexually arousing stimulation and subsequent copulatory behavior with an experienced male. Placement of the male into a neighboring compartment increased the female's temperature (approximately 0.8 degrees C) and additional, transient increases (approximately 0.2 degrees C) occurred when the rats were allowed to see and smell each other through a transparent barrier. Temperatures gradually increased further as the male repeatedly mounted and achieved intromissions, peaked 2-3 min after male's ejaculation (0.2-0.4 degrees C), and abruptly dropped until the male initiated a new copulatory cycle. Similar biphasic fluctuations accompanied subsequent copulatory cycles. Although both arousal-related temperature increases and biphasic fluctuations associated with copulatory cycles were evident in each recording location, brain sites showed consistently faster and stronger increases than the muscle, suggesting metabolic brain activation as the primary source of brain temperature fluctuations and a force behind associated changes in brain temperature. Robust brain hyperthermia and the generally similar pattern of phasic temperature fluctuations associated with individual events of sexual interaction found in males and females suggest widespread neural activation (motivational arousal) as a driving force underlying this cooperative motivated behavior in animals of both sexes. Females, however, showed different temperature changes in association with the initial (first mount or intromission) and final (ejaculation) events of each copulatory cycle, suggesting sex-specific differences in neural activity associated with the initiation and regulation of sexual behavior.",
