     "AB": "Identification of compounds preventing the biochemical changes that underlie the epileptogenesis process is of great importance. We have previously shown that myo-Inositol (MI) daily treatment prevents certain biochemical changes that are triggered by kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE). The aim of the current work was to study the further influence of MI treatment on the biochemical changes of epileptogenesis and focus on changes in the hippocampus and neocortex of rats for the following GABA-A receptor subunits: alpha1, alpha4, gamma2, and delta. After SE, one group of rats was treated with saline, while the second group was treated with MI. Control groups that were not treated by the convulsant received either saline or MI administration. 28-30 h after the experiment, a decrease in the amount of the alpha1 subunit was revealed in the hippocampus and MI had no significant influence on it. On the 28th day of the experiment, the amount of alpha1 was increased in both the KA- and KA + MI-treated groups. The alpha4 and gamma2 subunits were strongly reduced in the hippocampus of KA-treated animals, but MI significantly halted this reduction. The effects of MI on alpha4 and gamma2 subunit changes were significantly different between hippocampus and neocortex. On the twenty-eighth day after SE, a decrease in the amount of alpha1 was found in the neocortex, but MI treatment had no effect on it. The obtained results indicate that MI treatment interferes with some of the biochemical processes of epileptogenesis.",
