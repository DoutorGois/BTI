     "AB": "Long term potentiation (LTP) was induced in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices by tetanization of the Schaffer collaterals. Local pretreatment of CA1 with serum of rabbits immunized against S-100 prevented the potentiation. However, treatment of the slices with a membrane permeant cAMP analogue, such as 8-Br-cAMP, could protect against the blocking effect of anti S-100 serum. We suggest that in the rat endogenous S-100b is involved in transduction mechanisms during LTP induction, via its ability to stimulate adenylate cyclase. Possible mechanisms of this action are discussed.",
