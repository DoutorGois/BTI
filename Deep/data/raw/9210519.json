     "AB": "Alpha-dendrotoxin (alpha-DTx), a snake venom toxin which blocks several types of fast-activating voltage-dependent potassium channels, induces limbic seizures and neuronal damage when injected into the brain. The mechanisms underlying these convulsant and neuropathological actions are not fully understood. We have studied the effects of alpha-DTx on neurotransmitter release and electrical activity in rat hippocampal brain slices and the role of excitatory amino acid receptors in mediating these actions of the toxin. alpha-DTx increased the basal release of acetylcholine, glutamate, aspartate, and GABA in a concentration-dependent manner and induced epileptiform bursting in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the slice. The increase in neurotransmitter release was evident during the first 4 min after toxin addition, whereas the bursting appeared after a concentration-dependent delay (20-40 min with 250 nM toxin). The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists AP5 and MK-801 had no effect on the frequency or amplitude of dendrotoxin-induced epileptiform bursts, but the non-NMDA antagonists CNQX and DNQX abolished bursting in both CA1 and CA3 within 4-6 min. In contrast, the toxin-induced increases in neurotransmitter release were not blocked by DNQX. This study has demonstrated that, following exposure to alpha-DTx, there is a rapid increase in the release of neurotransmitters which precedes the onset of epileptiform bursting in the hippocampus. Since DNQX abolished the bursting but had no effect on the increase in neurotransmitter release, these results suggest that DNQX blocks alpha-DTx-induced epileptiform activity by antagonism of postsynaptic non-NMDA receptors.",
