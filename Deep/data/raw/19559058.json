     "AB": "In this study, we performed tests to determine whether tooth pulp stimulation (TPS) increases hippocampal blood flow (HBF), and if so, to investigate whether the increase in HBF is mediated via the activation of adenosine receptors. We measured HBF in urethane-anesthetized rats using laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and examined the effect of theophylline, a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist, on TPS-induced HBF responses. TPS increased HBF, and its response was significantly attenuated by the intraperitoneal administration of theophylline (20 mg/kg). These results suggest that the HBF response induced by TPS may be, at least in part, produced through adenosine receptors.",
