     "AB": "We investigated the effect of in utero and lactational exposures to dioxin on adult offspring with contextual fear conditioning, a sex- and hippocampus-dependent learning paradigm; and we measured the conditioning-accompanied activation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampal CA1 region. Pregnant rats were treated with a low dose of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on gestation day 15. TCDD treatment decreased freezing time in conditioning tests of adult male offspring but not of female offspring. A similar, male-specific decrease was observed in the percentage of phosphorylated CREB-immunoreactive neurons in the CA1 region following conditioning in TCDD-treated rats. These results suggest that perinatal TCDD exposure impairs hippocampus-dependent learning in male offspring by suppressing CREB activation.",
