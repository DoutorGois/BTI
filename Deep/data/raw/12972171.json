     "AB": "Postictal cognitive impairment following seizures can last from minutes to days and be disabling to the patient. The purpose of this study was to compare the behavioral features of seizures with postictal memory impairment in young seizure-naive rats and rats with a prior history of status epilepticus (SE) and examine the relationship between postictal EEG changes and cognitive recovery. Following training in the water maze to asymptote levels of learning, rats with a prior history of SE and seizure-naive rats had flurothyl-induced generalized seizures and time to recovery to baseline was then measured. Following generalized seizures rats had impaired performance in the water maze with the duration of the cognitive deficits exceeding the length of the seizure. There was not a close relationship between duration of cognitive impairment and either latency to onset of seizure or duration. The animal's neurological status was a factor in the duration of cognitive impairment following seizures; while there were no differences between SE and seizure-naive rats in latency to seizure onset or duration of the seizures, animals with a prior history of SE had a longer period of impairment following a seizure than animals without such a history. Postictal cognitive impairment was associated with changes in theta activity in animals with a prior history of SEs but not in seizure-naive animals. Caffeine, when administered following the seizure, reduced postictal cognitive impairment in a dose-dependent manner. This study demonstrates that duration of postictal cognitive impairment is not directly related to duration of the seizure. The neurological status of the animal is a determining factor in duration of postictal impairment.",
