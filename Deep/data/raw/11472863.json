     "AB": "Single photon emission computed tomography was used to study 14 female patients with anorexia nervosa and 8 female normal comparison subjects. Automatic voxel-based analysis of the images was carried out using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) software. Statistics across the entire brain were displayed as Z scores (threshold: P<0.05). Compared with the normal comparison subjects, the anorectic patients were characterized by hypoperfusion in the medial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus, and hyperperfusion in the thalamus and the amygdala-hippocampus complex. These results suggest that a dysfunction in neuronal circuitry may be related to anorexia nervosa.",
