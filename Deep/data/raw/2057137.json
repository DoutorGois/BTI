     "AB": "The localization of zif/268 gene expression in adult rat and mouse brain was studied with in the situ hybridization, using 32P-labeled 30 mer oligonucleotide probes. Basal expression without intentional neuronal stimulation was examined. Distribution of zif/268 mRNA was highly differential. In the neocortex a layer specific expression was seen with high levels in layers IV and VI, most prominent in the visual and somatosensory cortices. In the hippocampus labeling was strongest in CA1 but very low in the dentate gyrus. Strong expression was also seen in the primary olfactory cortex, the corpus striatum, the nuclei amygdaloidei, the nucleus accumbens and the cerebellar cortex.",
