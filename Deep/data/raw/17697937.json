     "AB": "Monosialoganglioside (GM1) is a glycosphingolipid present in most cell membranes that displays antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. GM1 increases catalase activity in cerebral cortices in vivo, but the mechanisms underlying this effect of GM1 are not known. In the current study we investigated the effect of GM1 (50 mg/kg, ip) on the content of hemoglobin and catalase activity of hippocampus, cortex, and striatum of rats. GM1 administration increased catalase activity and hemoglobin content in brain samples after 30 min, but had no effect on blood catalase activity. GM1-induced increase in catalase activity was abolished by brain perfusion with heparinized saline. Brain catalase activity in the absence of blood, estimated by regression analysis of data from perfused and nonperfused animals, was not altered by the systemic injection of GM1. Moreover, the addition of GM1 (30 or 100 microM) did not increase catalase activity in slices of cerebral cortex in situ, further suggesting that blood circulation is required for this effect. The GM1-induced vasodilation was confirmed in vivo, because the systemic injection of GM1 (50 mg/kg, ip) increased (1.2-1.6 times) the width of pial vessels.",
