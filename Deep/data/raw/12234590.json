     "AB": "We prepared 5-HT(1A) receptor ligands (S)-N-[[1-(2-phenylethyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl]methyl]-3-[11C]methylthiobenzamide ([11C](S)-PPMMB) (Ki = 4.3 nM) and the less active [(11)C](R)-PPMMB (Ki = 160 nM) by reduction of the disulfide dimer and subsequent [(11)C]methylation of demethyl (S)- and (R)-PPMMB, respectively. Both radioligands showed similar brain distribution in mice with relatively higher affinity for the hippocampus being rich in 5-HT(1A) receptors than for other brain regions. Uptake of [(11)C](S)-PPMMB was not reduced by carrier-loading nor by pretreatment with 5-HT(1A) receptor ligands. [(11)C](S)-PPMMB is therefore not a suitable radioligand for mapping 5-HT(1A) receptors using positron emission tomography.",
