     "AB": "The distributions of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-immunoreactive (IR) varicosities and 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptor (5-HT2A)-IR neuronal structures in the rat brain have previously been described individually. Using double labeling immunocytochemistry, the relationships between 5-HT2A-IR and 5-HT-IR elements in the forebrain of male rats has been studied at the light microscopic level. In neocortical regions (frontal, parietal and retrosplenial cortex), the strongest 5-HT2A-IR was found in the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in layers III-V, while 5-HT-IR terminal-like varicosities were present in all layers but most prominently in the outer layers. In other forebrain regions, the olfactory bulb, the hippocampal formation, and the islands of Calleja and Calleja magna, localized discrepancies were present between the 5-HT2A-IR neuronal profiles and the 5-HT-IR terminal-like varicosities. Hardly any additional juxtapositions between the 5-HT2A-IR neuronal profiles and 5-HT-IR terminal-like varicosities were revealed when the intraneuronal level of 5-HT was increased by monoamine oxidase inhibitor pretreatment (nialamide, 250 mg/kg, 3 h). Thus, in most forebrain regions, there were overall few juxtapositions between 5-HT terminal-like varicosities and 5-HT2A-IR neuronal structures. This observation suggests that 5-HT2A receptor mediated 5-HT transmission in the rat forebrain is mainly a volume transmission process mediated via short distance diffusion in the extra-cellular space.",
