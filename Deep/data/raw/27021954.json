     "AB": "Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have circadian rhythm disorders, which are mimicked in 3xTg-AD and 5xFAD mouse models. The deposition of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) is an important pathological characteristic of AD, however, its role in inducing alterations in biological rhythms and in the expression of circadian clock-related genes remains elusive. The Per1 and Per2 play complex regulatory roles in biological clocks and are diffusely expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), hippocampus and heart. In the present study, wheel-running behavioral experiments showed that Abeta31-35, which was administered into the hippocampus, resulted in the disruption of the circadian rhythm of C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, real-time PCR and western blot analysis showed that Abeta31-35 altered the expression of the Per1 and Per2 in the SCN, hippocampus and heart. These findings provide experimental evidence for circadian rhythm disturbances in patients with AD.",
