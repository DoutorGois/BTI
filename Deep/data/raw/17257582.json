     "AB": "The presynaptic active zone (AZ) is a specialized site where neurotransmitter release occurs in a precisely regulated manner. The cytomatrix at the AZ (CAZ)-associated protein CAST and its family member ELKS form a large molecular complex at the AZ and regulate neurotransmitter release by binding other AZ proteins including Bassoon, Piccolo, Munc13-1, and RIM1. Here, yeast two-hybrid screening was used to identify Ligand-of-Numb Protein X (LNX) as a potential binding partner for CAST. LNX is an interactor of Numb and has four PDZ domains. CAST bound LNX both in vivo and in vitro. This binding required the COOH-terminus of CAST and the second PDZ domain of LNX. CAST and LNX were further colocalized with each other in a heterologous expression system, in which LNX was recruited to a Triton X-insoluble structure. Moreover, exogenously expressed LNX was partially colocalized with endogenous CAST in the axonal varicosities of cultured rat hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that CAST and LNX might form a protein complex in neurons.",
