     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate effect of the four kinds of active fractions extracted from Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD) on caspase expression in rats after focal cerebral ischemic reperfusion. METHODS: The focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model rats were established by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 hrs followed with reperfusion for 46 hrs. Before and at 12th, 24th and 36th hour after cerebral ischemia, the rats were administered with alkaloid, glycoside, polysaccharide and aglycone from BYHWD respectively, and nimodipine was given as control medicine to observe the effect of them on protein expression of caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-8 using immunohistochemical method. RESULTS: Protein expression of caspase-1 and caspase-3 increased in the injured lateral brain tissue after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Caspase-1 expression were observed mainly in choroids, while caspase-3 expression in hippocampus, cortex and medulla. All the four kinds of active fractions from BYHWD could inhibit caspase-1 expression, while nimodipine couldn't. Caspase-3 expression in hippocampus and medulla could be inhibited by alkaloid, that in hippocampus, cortex and medulla could be inhibited by glycoside and aglycone, and that in hippocampus and medulla by nimodipine, however, polysaccharide showd no effect on it. As for caspase-8 expression, no effect on it was shown in all groups. CONCLUSION: Alkaloid, glycoside, polysaccharide and aglycone from BYHWD could relieve the inflammatory reaction occurred after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion by inhibiting caspase-1 expression to decrease production of inflammatory cytokine. Alkaloid, glycoside and aglycone could reduce neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-3 expression to antagonize the delayed neuronal death after cerebral ischemia. The 4 kinds of active fractions may be the main material basis for BYHWD in preventing ischemia/reperfusion cerebral injury.",
