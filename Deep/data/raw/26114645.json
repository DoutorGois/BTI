     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Recent studies show that sublingual microcirculation is altered in patients resuscitated from CA. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the cerebral microcirculation is disturbed in the early post-resuscitation period. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to either 10 minutes of CA or uninterrupted circulation, and observed to 120 or 360 minutes after ROSC. At 120 and 360 minutes, cerebral microcirculation was evaluated by SDF microscopy through a craniectomy. Plasma samples were analyzed for endothelial adhesion molecules and inflammatory markers, and brains were fixated for histological analysis. RESULTS: Cerebral microcirculation, evaluated by TVD, PVD, PPV, and MFI did not differ between groups (p > 0.16). Plasma samples drawn 360 minutes after ROSC displayed a significant increase in sE-selectin, sL-selectin, sI-CAM1, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, and elastase compared to controls. In the CA animals, sE-selectin and elastase increased between 120 and 360 minutes after resuscitation (p < 0.007). Histological analysis revealed neuronal death in hippocampus layer CA1 360 min after resuscitation. CONCLUSION: When evaluated by SDF, the cerebral microcirculation appears unaffected in the early post-CA period despite hypotension, systemic inflammation, endothelial activation, and neuronal injury.",
