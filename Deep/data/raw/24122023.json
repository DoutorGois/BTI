     "AB": "Inflammation is one of the mechanisms involved in seizure induction. In this study, the effect of minocycline, an anti-inflammatory drug, was investigated on kindling acquisition. Chemical kindling was induced by injection of a subthreshold dose of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; 37.5 mg/kg) in mice on every other day. Two groups of animals received minocycline (25 mg/kg) at 1 h before or 1 h after PTZ injection. Following the last PTZ injection, the changes in gene expression of TNF-alpha receptor, gamma2 subunit of GABAA receptor and NR2A subunit of NMDA receptor were assessed in the hippocampus and piriform cortex. Injection of minocycline before PTZ increased the latency to stage 4 seizure, and decreased the duration of stages 4 and 5 seizure. It also prevented the increase in the mRNA of NR2A subunit of NMDA receptor in the hippocampus and removed the PTZ-induced increase in mRNA of gamma2 subunit of GABAA receptor in piriform cortex of PTZ kindled mice. Minocycline also prevented the increase in TNF-alpha receptor gene expression in both hippocampus and piriform cortex. Injection of minocycline after PTZ had no significant effect on measured parameters. Therefore, it can be concluded that minocycline may exert an anticonvulsant effect through preventing the increase in GABAA and NMDA receptor subunits. These effects are accompanied by a reduction in an important inflammation index, TNF-alpha receptor.",
