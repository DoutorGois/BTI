     "AB": "Lead poisoning is a geochemical disease. On the other hand, lead is highly carcinogenic and exhibits liver and kidney toxicity. This element can also cross the blood-brain barrier, reduce learning and memory ability and damage the structure of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. To further investigate the mechanism of lead neurotoxicity, 4-week-old Kunming mice were used to explore the effects of different concentrations of Pb(2+) (0, 2.4, 4.8 and 9.6 mM) for 9 days. In this study, pathological and ultrastructural changes in brain cells of the treated group were related to damages to mitochondria, chromatin and the nucleus. Lead content in blood was tested by atomic absorption spectroscopy, which showed high lead concentrations in the blood with increasing doses of lead. Distribution of lead in nerve cells was analysed by transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. Data showed the presence of lead in nucleopores, chromatin and nuclear membrane of nerve cells in the treatment groups, whereas lead content increased with increasing doses of lead acetate. Finally, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) mRNA and protein expression levels were detected by real-time PCR and Western blotting, which showed a reduction in MAP2 expression with increasing lead doses in the mouse brain. These findings suggest that acute lead poisoning can cause significant dose-dependent toxic effects on mouse brain function and can contribute to better understanding of lead-induced toxicity.",
