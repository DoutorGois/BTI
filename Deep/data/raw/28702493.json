     "AB": "The data presented here detail the changes in size, cellular content, and neuronal density of the developing brain over time with respect to sex in C57Bl/6 mice following neonatal exposure to isoflurane, carbon monoxide, or their combination. Specifically, brain weight- and brain volume-to-body weight ratios are presented, representative immunoblots of whole brain cell-specific protein content are depicted, and quantification of the number of neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex and CA3 region of the hippocampus are shown. Three discrete postnatal time points are represented: P7 (prior to exposure), P14 (one-week post exposure), and P42-56 (5-7 weeks post exposure). Major findings from the data presented here are reported in the manuscript \"Carbon Monoxide Incompletely Prevents Isoflurane-induced Defects in Murine Neurodevelopment\" (Wang et al., in press) [1].",
