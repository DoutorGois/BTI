     "AB": "Carboxypeptidase E, an exoprotease involved in the processing of bioactive peptides released by a regulated secretory pathway, was identified in a subtractive complementary DNA library derived from an ischemic rat brain by differential screening. In situ hybridization and immunocytochemical analysis showed the presence of carboxypeptidase E messenger RNA and protein in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, striatum, and hippocampus of a healthy rat brain. After 15 minutes of transient global ischemia followed by 8 hours of reperfusion, increased levels of carboxypeptidase E messenger RNA and protein were observed in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions and in the cortex, as detected by Northern and Western blot analyses and in situ hybridization. After extended reperfusion (24 to 72 hours), both carboxypeptidase E messenger RNA and protein levels were decreased. The ischemia-induced changes in carboxypeptidase E expression suggest that this enzyme may play a role in modulating the brain's response to ischemia.",
