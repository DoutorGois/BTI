     "AB": "With advancing age clusters of abnormal granules positive for periodic acid-Schiff appear in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 (B6) mice and the senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM) P8. The granules can also be visualized with a polyclonal antibody to a 110,000 mol. wt laminin-binding protein and stain specifically with a monoclonal antibody to heparan sulfate proteoglycan. The present study used light and electron-microscopic analysis to compare the staining and morphological properties of these granules in SAM P8 hippocampus with those in B6 hippocampus at different ages. The results of the light-microscopic analysis revealed that granules in SAM P8 and B6 had similar morphology, staining characteristics and distribution patterns, and appeared to have a close association with astrocytic process. The onset of granules in SAM P8 mice (at two to three months of age) was earlier than that observed in B6 mice (at four to six months of age), but the maximum incidence was similar in both strains. Electron-microscopic analysis revealed that the granules in SAM P8 and B6 mice also had a very similar ultrastructure. Granules in both strains were surrounded by a discontinuous membrane and contained mostly crystalline-like, degenerated material. The successive ultrastructural changes from the exterior to interior of the granules suggest that the degenerative process was initiated outside the granules and that degenerative structures migrate inward. Astrocytes and heparan sulfate proteoglycan are closely associated with beta-amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease. The presence of astrocyte-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycan-positive material in aged SAM P8 and B6 mice might model age-related alterations in glia function possibly involved in human cerebral amyloidogenesis.",
