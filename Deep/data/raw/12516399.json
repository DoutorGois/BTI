     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the neuronal protective effects of a traditional Chinese medicine complex Nao-Yi-An granule(NYA) on experimental intracerebral hemorrhage(ICH) in rats. METHODS: Eighty collagenase-induced ICH rats were used. At 12 h, 24 h, 2 d, 4 d, 7 d, cytochrome c oxidase(CO) activity was measured with histochemistry combined with gray scale scanning. Pyramidal cell(PC) counting was also employed following Nissl's staining. RESULTS: The CO activities in NYA-treated group were less than those in model control group, and the neuronal loss was less in NYA-treated group than that in model control group. CONCLUSIONS: The neuronal protective mechanism of NYA following ICH may be related with its maintaining activity of cytochrome c oxidase, which contributes to improving cellular aerobic metabolism and increasing energy supply for cells.",
