     "AB": "OBJECT: Recurrence of seizures immediately following epilepsy surgery can be emotionally devastating, and raises concerns about the chances of successfully attaining long-term seizure control. The goals of this study were to investigate the frequency of acute postoperative seizures (APOS) occurring in the 1st postoperative week following anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) to identify potential risk factors and to determine their prognostic significance. METHODS: One hundred sixty consecutive patients who underwent an ATL for intractable nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy were retrospectively studied. Acute postoperative seizures occurred in 32 patients (20%). None of the following factors were shown to be significantly associated with the occurrence of APOS: age at surgery, duration of epilepsy, side of surgery, extent of neocortical resection, electrocorticography findings, presence of mesial temporal sclerosis, and hippocampal volume measurements (p > 0.05). Patients who suffered from APOS overall had a lower rate of favorable outcome with respect to seizure control at the last follow-up examination than patients without APOS (62.5% compared with 83.6%, p < 0.05). The type of APOS was of prognostic importance, with patients whose APOS were similar to their preoperative habitual seizures having a significantly worse outcome than those whose APOS were auras or were focal motor and/or generalized tonic-clonic seizures (excellent outcome: 14.3%, 77.8%, and 75%, respectively, p < 0.05). Only patients who had APOS similar to preoperative habitual seizures were less likely to have an excellent outcome than patients without APOS (14.3% compared with 75%, p < 0.05). Timing of the APOS and identification of a precipitating factor were of no prognostic importance. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study may be useful in counseling patients who suffer from APOS following ATL for temporal lobe epilepsy.",
