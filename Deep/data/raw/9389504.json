     "AB": "Because interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) is present in the central nervous system during neurologic diseases associated with inflammation, its effect on endotoxin-induced cytokines was studied. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), their messenger RNA expression in brain areas (hypothalamus, hippocampus, and striatum) and in spleen were evaluated 2 and 8 h after endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 25 microg/rat i.c.v.], IFN gamma (2.5 microg/rat i.c.v.) or after their coadministration in rats. CSF and serum IL-1beta levels were increased by LPS alone and IFN gamma coadministration did not furtherly increase them. IFN gamma potentiated LPS effect on IL-6 and TNF alpha levels in both CSF and serum. LPS and IFN-gamma coadministration did not alter IL-1beta messenger RNA expression induced by LPS in brain areas and in spleen, but it potentiated that of IL-6 and TNF alpha. The present in vivo data show that i.c.v. coadministration of LPS and IFN gamma results in a potentiation of cytokine production (IL-6 and TNF alpha) which may trigger a cascade of events relevant to neurodegenerative processes. This action is independent of IL-1beta because the production of this cytokine is not altered by IFN gamma treatment.",
