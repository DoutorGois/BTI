     "AB": "The purpose of our experiment was to examine whether the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin ameliorates neuronal injury in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 sector following 5 minutes of forebrain ischemia. Thirty minutes before bilateral carotid artery occlusion, Mongolian gerbils were injected intraperitoneally with 1 (n = 10), 2 (n = 10), 5 (n = 12), or 10 (n = 7) mg/kg of indomethacin. Seven days after occlusion, the gerbils were perfusion-fixed and neuronal density in the hippocampal CA1 sector was assessed. The mean +/- SEM neuronal density in nine unoperated normal gerbils was 307 +/- 9/mm, in 10 untreated ischemic gerbils 55 +/- 21/mm, and in seven vehicle-treated ischemic gerbils 15 +/- 9/mm. The mean +/- SEM neuronal density in ischemic gerbils treated with 1, 2, 5, or 10 mg/kg indomethacin was 132 +/- 28/mm, 154 +/- 29/mm, 176 +/- 30/mm, and 136 +/- 39/mm, respectively. Indomethacin at any dose significantly ameliorated ischemic neuronal damage in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 sector.",
