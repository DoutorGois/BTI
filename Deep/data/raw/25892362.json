     "AB": "The object-in-context recognition (OiC) task [19] is a spontaneous exploration task that serves as an index of incidental contextual learning and memory. During the test phase, rats prefer to explore the object mismatched to the testing context based on previous object-context pairings experienced during training. The mechanisms of OiC memory have been explored in adult rats [12,35]; however, little is known about its determinants during development. Thus, the present study examined the ontogeny of the OiC task in preweanling through adolescent rats. We demonstrate that postnatal day (PD) 17, 21, 26, and 31 rats can perform the OiC task (Experiment 1) and that preference for the novel target is eliminated when rats are tested in an alternate context not encountered during training (Experiment 2). Lastly, we show that PD26 but not PD17 rats can perform the OiC task when the training contexts only differed by distal spatial cues (Experiment 3). These data demonstrate for the first time that PD17 rats can acquire and retain short-term OiC memory, which involves associative learning of object and context information. However, we also provide evidence that preweanling rats' ability to utilize certain aspects of a context (i.e., distal spatial cues) in the OiC task is not equivalent to that of their older counterparts. Implications for the development of contextual memory and its related neural substrates are discussed.",
