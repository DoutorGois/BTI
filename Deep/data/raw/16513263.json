Mutations in KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels can cause benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC). We describe the immunohistochemical staining of adult and developing mouse brain using an antibody directed against the N-terminus of KCNQ3 channels (KCNQ3N). A widespread KCNQ3N immunoreactivity predominantly of neuropil but also of somata was detected in different regions of the adult mouse brain, in particular in the hippocampus, cortex, thalamus and cerebellum. This staining pattern appeared gradually and became more intense during development. In the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, the immunoreactivity changed from a more somatic to a neuropil staining during development. These changes during maturation might be related to the age-dependent phenotype of BFNC.",
