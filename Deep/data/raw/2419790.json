     "AB": "Foetal mouse hippocampal primordia from mice homozygous for the Thy-1.1 allele were transplanted into the hippocampal region of adult histocompatible mice, homozygous for the Thy-1.2 allele. After survival periods of two months to one year the transplants consisted of a discrete tissue mass, well fused with the host, and distinguished from it by an intense Thy-1.1 immunoreactivity of the neuropil. The host hippocampus was entirely negative for Thy-1.1 immunoreactivity except for well defined projections arising from the transplant. These projections had three different patterns of distribution in the host: (1) a mossy-fibre-like distribution (to the stratum lucidum of field CA3); (2) a fimbria-like distribution (to the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum of fields CA1 and CA3), and (3) a commissural/association-like distribution (to the inner stratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus). Analysis of the position of the transplants and their component cell types indicated that, for each of the three distribution patterns, three conditions had to be fulfilled: (1) the transplant had to contain the appropriate type of cell (granule cells for mossy fibre projections, and larger pyramid-like cells for the other two); (2) the transplant neurons giving rise to the projection had to lie in direct contact with the host field to be innervated, and (3) the terminal field had to be specifically denervated. Thus, for three fibre systems the patterns of transplant-to-host projections observe rules of organization comparable to those of the normal hippocampal circuitry. This implies that in the adult host brain there remain (or there can be elicited) the molecular cues capable of establishing patterns of neuronal connectivity comparable to those formed during normal development.",
