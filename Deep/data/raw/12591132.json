     "AB": "The effects of a new O-superfamily conotoxin SO3 on sodium and potassium currents were examined in cultured rat hippocampal neurons using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. SO3 caused a concentration-dependent, rapidly developing and reversible inhibition of sodium currents (I(Na)). The IC(50) value for the blockage of I(Na) was calculated to be 0.49 and the Hill coefficient was 1.7. Using electrophysiological and pharmacological protocols, transient A-type potassium currents (I(A)) and delayed rectifiers potassium currents (I(K)) were isolated. SO3 caused a concentration-dependent, and reversible inhibition of I(K). The IC(50) value for the blockage of I(K) was calculated to be 1.6 and the Hill coefficient was 0.6, with no significant effect on I(A). These results indicate that SO3 can selectively inhibit neuronal sodium and potassium currents.",
