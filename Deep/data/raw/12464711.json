     "AB": "The aim of our study was to determine when foramen ovale recordings add useful information to scalp EEG recordings and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with hippocampal measurements. We evaluated the outcome of 79 patients with non-lesional partial epilepsy with presumed temporal seizure onset. Ictal foramen ovale recordings were performed in 16 patients with normal MRI ('MRI-negative group') and 41 patients with lateralizing MRI but non-lateralizing scalp EEG ('discordant group'). 22 patients with concordant MRI and scalp EEG were not investigated with foramen ovale recordings ('concordant group'). The seizure-free rate was higher in concordant than discordant patients despite additional investigation with foramen ovale electrodes (71 and 55% seizure free, respectively). No useful localizing information was added with foramen ovale recordings in MRI-negative patients.",
