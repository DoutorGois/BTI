     "AB": "Sleep has important functions for every organ in the body and sleep deprivation (SD) leads to disorders that cause irreparable damage. The aim of this study was to investigate behavioral and brain structural alterations in mice deprived of paradoxical sleep for 48 and 72 h. Working memory, aversive memory as well as levels of nitric oxide (NO) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the hippocampus, body striatum, and prefrontal cortex were evaluated. Working memory was affected in the 48- and 72-h SD groups while aversive memory was altered only in the 48-h SD group (p </= 0.05). Our findings showed that SD reduces NO levels in most brain areas (p < 0.05): NO levels were unaltered in the striatum of animals sleep-deprived for 48 h. Higher levels of TBARS were observed in all areas of the SD groups (p </= 0.05). Thus, we confirmed that SD has duration-dependent effects on behavior as well as on NO and TBARS levels in the brain. Preserved striatum NO levels suggest that this structure is less vulnerable to oxidative stress and is only affected by SD of longer duration. Increased TBARS and reduced NO levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex confirm a central role for both these structures in working memory and aversive memory. Contextual fear conditioning was not affected by longer periods of SD. Thus, our findings suggest that shorter SD time may be more beneficial to avoid aversive memory where this may have implications for the management of posttraumatic stress.",
