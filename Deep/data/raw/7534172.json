     "AB": "The goal of the present study was to identify and characterize, at the electron microscopic level, the synapses formed by entorhinal cortical (EC) axons in the hippocampal CA1 stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the adult rat. Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin was ionotophoresed at various loci throughout the mediolateral and dorsoventral extent of the EC to label EC-CA1 synapses. Virtually all labeled synapses were asymmetric and axospinous. EC axons did not preferentially synapse with any particular type of dendritic spine; rather, EC axons formed synapses with the range of dendritic spine morphologies observed in CA1 s. lacunosum-moleculare. Spines with either perforated or nonperforated postsynaptic densities were contacted by EC axons. Occasionally both a labeled and an unlabeled axon synapsed on a single dendritic spine head. The data are discussed in relation to the morphology of other afferent systems synapsing in s. lacunosum-moleculare and to the physiology of the EC-CA1 system.",
