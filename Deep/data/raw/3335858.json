The regions were the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain. The level of 2-hydroxyputrescine was very high in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, high in the medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, and hippocampus, and low in the striatum and midbrain. The level of 2-hydroxyputrescine in the cerebellum was significantly higher than in the striatum and midbrain.",
