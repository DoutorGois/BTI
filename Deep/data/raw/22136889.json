     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: beta-Amyloid (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the main characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Positron emission tomography (PET), a high-resolution, sensitive, and noninvasive imaging technique, has been widely utilized in visualizing the localization of plaques and tangles and thereby distinguishing between AD and healthy controls. A small 12-mer D-enantiomeric peptide (amino acid sequence=QSHYRHISPAQV), denoted as D1, has high binding affinity to Abeta in vitro in the sub-micromolar range, and consequently, its radiolabeled analogues have a potential as radioligands for visualizing amyloid plaques in vivo by PET. AIM: The aims of the present work were to develop three different potent D1 derivative peptides labeled with fluorine-18 and to examine them in the AD and control postmortem human brain by autoradiography (ARG). METHODS: Three different D1 derivative peptides were radiolabeled with fluorine-18 ([(18)F]ACI-87, [(18)F]ACI-88, [(18)F]ACI-89) using the prosthetic group N-succinimidyl-4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Preliminary ARG measurements were performed in AD and control brains. RESULTS: The three fluorine-18-labeled d-peptides were obtained in a total synthesis time of 140 min with radiochemical purity higher than 98%. The specific radioactivities of the three different D1 derivative peptides were between 9 and 113 GBq/mumol. ARG demonstrated a higher radioligand uptake in the cortical gray matter and the hippocampus in the AD brain as compared to age-matched control brain. CONCLUSIONS: Fluorine-18 labeling of the three novel D1 derivative peptides using [(18)F]SFB was successfully accomplished. Higher contrast between AD and control brain slices demonstrates their potential applicability for further use in vivo by PET.",
