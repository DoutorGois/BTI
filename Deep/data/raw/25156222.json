     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Cognitive dysfunction is common in both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS). Antibodies against the NR2 subtype of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NR2 antibodies) cause hippocampal atrophy and cognitive impairment in mice and have been associated with memory impairment in both patients with SLE and patients with primary SS. In addition, a reduced volume of hippocampal gray matter has been demonstrated in both SLE and primary SS. This study was undertaken to investigate whether there is a connection between the presence of anti-NR2 antibodies and hippocampal atrophy in human diseases. METHODS: Fifty patients with SLE and 50 patients with primary SS underwent clinical examination and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. Anti-NR2 antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured, and hippocampal gray matter volumes were compared between patients who were positive for and those who were negative for anti-NR2 antibodies. RESULTS: Patients with anti-NR2 antibodies in CSF had less hippocampal gray matter than patients without these antibodies. No other differences regarding gray matter volumes in other parts of the brain were identified. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that anti-NR2 antibodies in patients with SLE and primary SS cause neuronal death manifested as reduced hippocampal gray matter, as has been previously demonstrated in mice with autoimmune disease.",
