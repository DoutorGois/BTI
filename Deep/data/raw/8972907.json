     "AB": "A variant form of 14-3-3 zeta was isolated from the rat hippocampal cDNA library. The cloned cDNA is 1687 bp in length and it contains an entire ORF (nt = 63-797) with 245 amino acids that is characteristic to 14-3-3 zeta subtype. By comparing with reported sequences of 14-3-3 zeta, we found three nucleotide substitutions within the coding sequence in our clone; C<-->T transition at nt = 325 and G<-->C transversions at nt = 387 and 388. Both are missense mutations, leading ACG (Thr) to ATG (Met) and CGT (Arg) to GCT (Ala) conversions at residue 88 and 109, respectively. Our results show that at least three different genetic variants of 14-3-3 zeta are present in rat species which results in protein variations. Such mutation in the amino acid sequence is an important indication of the diverse functions of this protein and may also contribute to the recent contradictory observations regarding the role of the 14-3-3 zeta subtype.",
