     "AB": "Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-like 1 (IGFBPL-1) has a domain structure that resembles one in the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs), which is a domain known to be bound by insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) with high affinity and to thereby affect cell growth and metabolism. However, the distribution and functions of IGFBPL-1 in the brain are not known. Thus, to clarify IGFBPL-1 expression profiles during development, we have investigated the expression patterns of IGFBPL-1 mRNA in developing mouse brains using in situ hybridization, focusing especially on the forebrain. On embryonic day (E)12, IGFBPL-1mRNA expressions were localized in the preplate of the neopallium, dorsal thalamus, the differentiating field of the epithalamus, and the hippocampus. On E14, strong expression was recognized in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and intermediate zone (IMZ) in the neopallium, hippocampus, the differentiating field of the epithalamus, and the dorsal thalamus. E14 expressions were generally the strongest among all the stages examined and signals decreased thereafter. At E16 and E18, IGFBPL-1mRNA was strongly detected in the hippocampus and the SVZ of the neopallium. In postnatal stages, mRNA was found only in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG). Notably, at P20, expression was restricted to the deep fraction of the granule cell layer, the location of late-born DG neurons.",
