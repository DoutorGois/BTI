     "AB": "Experimental animal and peripheral blood cell studies point to guanine nucleotide regulatory (G) protein disturbances in bipolar affective disorder. We have previously reported elevated prefrontal cortex Gs alpha protein in bipolar affective disorder and have now extended these preliminary observations in a larger number of subjects, assessing the brain regional specificity of these changes in greater detail, determining the functional biochemical correlates of such changes, and evaluating their diagnostic specificity. Membrane G protein (Gs alpha, Gi alpha, Go alpha, and G beta) immunoreactivities were estimated by western blotting in postmortem brain regions obtained from 10 patients with a DSMIII-R diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder and 10 nonpsychiatric controls matched on the basis of age, postmortem delay, and brain pH. To examine whether there were functional correlates to the observed elevated Gs alpha levels, basal and GTP gamma S- and forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production was determined in the same brain regions. Compared with controls, Gs alpha (52-kDa species) immunoreactivity was significantly (p < 0.05) elevated in prefrontal (+36%), temporal (+65%), and occipital (+96%) cortex but not in hippocampus (+28%), thalamus (-23%), or cerebellum (+21%). In contrast, no significant differences were found in the other G protein subunits (Gi alpha, Go alpha, G beta) measured in these regions. Forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production was significantly increased in temporal (+31%) and occipital (+96%) cortex but not in other regions. No significant differences were apparent in basal or GTP gamma S-stimulated cyclic AMP production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
