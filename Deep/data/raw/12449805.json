     "AB": "A current status of knowledge about high-frequency (140-200 Hz) ripple oscillations in the CA1 hippocampal subfield is summarized and considered in the context of two-stage model of the hippocampal memory processing. A large body of evidence suggests highly-selective recruitment of pyramidal cells and interneurons in the generation of the oscillatory pattern after co-operative sharp-wave-related discharge of CA3 pyramidal neurons. We also discuss a role of transmission via gap junctions in the mechanisms of ripple oscillations as well as their adaptive aminergic (histaminergic) modulation. Patterns of neuronal firing in the hippocampus observed during ripple oscillations reproduce space-dependant neuronal activity from the previous waking period. Together with a data about efficacy of high-frequency stimulation for induction of synaptic modification it points out a role for ripples in the formation of long-term memory. Focal ultra fast ripples (up to 500 Hz) have been shown to participate in the development of temporal lobe epilepsy.",
