     "AB": "Middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in halothane-anesthetized rats induced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the receptor, trk B mRNA, in brain. In situ hybridization studies showed that BDNF and trk B mRNAs were induced in a widespread region of the ipsilateral cortex outside the infarct at 4 h following MCA occlusion. They were also induced in the bilateral hippocampi which are remote from the ischemic MCA region. These data show that changes in neurotrophic factor and receptor gene expressions can occur in the areas outside the infarct which could survive.",
