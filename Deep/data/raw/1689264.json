     "AB": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is synthesized in the hippocampus and neocortex and provides trophic support for afferent cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. To determine the capacity of the developing hippocampus to express NGF in the absence of NGF-responsive afferents, embryonic hippocampal cells isolated prior to septal innervation were studied in reaggregating cell culture. The expression of NGF protein in vitro was qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that observed in situ. The expression of NGF mRNA exhibited an initial increase in vitro but then plateaued and was maintained at a steady level. This latter finding was in contrast to the steady rise in NGF mRNA levels observed in situ. These data suggest that (i) intrinsic hippocampal interactions regulate the onset of NGF expression, but that (ii) additional extrinsic developmental signals may be required for proper regulation of hippocampal NGF expression during ontogeny.",
