     "AB": "We present two siblings (a boy and a girl) with a submicroscopic 4 Mb duplication at 22q13.1q13.2. Both children manifested infantile hypotonia and delayed motor milestones, congenital heart defect, growth deficiency, and strikingly similar and distinctive craniofacial dysmorphism including brachycephaly, blepharophimosis, short broad-based nose and wide mouth with thin upper lip. The boy had also a submucous cleft palate. Both had fair skin and hair compared with their parents. Both had moderate mental retardation associated with a short attention span. A 4-Mb interstitial duplication at 22q13.1q13.2 was detected by whole genome microarray comparative genomic hybridisation (array CGH) in both children. The duplication was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis. Their parents had normal array CGH results. FISH analysis revealed that the father was a carrier of a balanced interchromosomal submicroscopic insertion of 22q13 into chromosome 11q23, explaining the unbalanced aberration detected in both children. This report narrows down the critical region at 22q13.1q13.2, which is associated with mental retardation, pre- and post-natal growth retardation, hippocampal malformation, psychiatric symptoms such as short attention span and facial dysmorphism including hypertelorism, epicanthal folds and low set/abnormal ears.",
