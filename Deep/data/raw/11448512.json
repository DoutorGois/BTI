     "AB": "The effect of toosendanin, a presynaptic blocker, on the inward rectifier potassium channel (K(Kir)) of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of rats was studied by the single-channel patch-clamp technique. The results showed that toosendanin had an inhibitory effect on K(Kir) in an excised inside-out patch of the neuron under a symmetrical 150 mM K(+) condition. By decreasing the slower open time constant and increasing the slower close time constant, toosendanin (1x10(-6)-1x10(-4) g/ml) significantly reduced the open probability of the channel in a concentration-dependent manner. Meanwhile, a dose-dependent reduction in unitary conductance of the channel was also detected after toosendanin application. These data offer an explanation for toosendanin-induced facilitation of neurotransmitter release and antibotulismic effect of the drug.",
