     "AB": "Abnormal hippocampal neurogenesis after acute seizures has been well addressed. However, whether newly generated cells continued to be disturbed even they were born in the chronic stage after pilocarpine-induce status epilepticus has remained elusive. Labeling dividing progenitors and their progeny with retroviral vector expressing green fluorescent protein or proliferation marker 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine at 3 months post pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in mice, a spot of newly born neurons exhibiting hilar ectopic location (4.57+/-2.3%), aberrant basal dendrites (8.09+/-1.5%) and abnormal axon sprouting into inner molecular layer of dentate gyrus was identified when examined 6 weeks later. No significant difference on the amount of mossy fiber sprouting was found when cohorts of newborn cells were eliminated by methylazoxymethanol acetate injection initiated at 3 months after SE, suggesting that adult generated neurons in the chronically epileptic hippocampus don't contribute a lot to the mossy fiber sprouting. These results indicated that the aberrant neurogenesis in the chronically epileptic hippocampus occurs only in a small population of newly generated granule cells.",
