     "AB": "The hippocampus is a brain region of primary importance for neurogenesis, which occurs during early developmental states as well as during adulthood. Increases in neuronal proliferation and in neuronal death with age have been associated with drastic changes in memory and learning. Numerous neurotransmitters are involved in these processes, and some neuropeptides that mediate neurogenesis also modulate feeding behavior. Concomitantly, feeding peptides, which act primarily in the hypothalamus, are also present in the hippocampus. This review aims to ascertain the role of several important feeding peptides in cognitive functions, either through their local synthesis in the hippocampus or through their actions via specific receptors in the hippocampus. A link between neurogenesis and the orexigenic or anorexigenic properties of feeding peptides is discussed.",
