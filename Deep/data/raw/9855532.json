     "AB": "The association between gray matter heterotopias and seizures is well established; whether seizures originate from these lesions is not known. We evaluated three patients with intractable complex partial seizures and periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNHs) with video-EEG monitoring with multiple depth electrodes, including placement in the PNH, to determine whether seizures originate from the PNH. In two of the three patients, all seizures arose from the PNH as low-voltage beta activity. In the third patient, 80% arose from the hippocampi and 20% from the heterotopia. PNHs may serve as an epileptogenic focus in patients with intractable epilepsy.",
