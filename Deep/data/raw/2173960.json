     "AB": "The effects of recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) on the potentiation of the synaptic transmission were studied in rat hippocampal slices by using extracellular field potential recordings. The application of rIL-2 inhibited the induction of both short-term (STP) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, rIL-2 (1000 U/ml) reduced both post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) and LTP maintenance phase. The possible involvement of rIL-2 action on the synaptic potentiation with the enzymatic activity of protein kinase systems is discussed.",
