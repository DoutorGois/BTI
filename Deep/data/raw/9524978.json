     "AB": "Patients with depression frequently have symptom clusters which point strongly to involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system as a relay station between neurocircuitries in the brain and peripheral hormone and autonomic nervous function. It has been proposed that this increased, state-dependent hyperactivity of the HPA-system in depression is probably initiated and/or maintained by the combination of enhanced central production of CRH and desensitization of the binary, glucocorticoid receptor binding system in the hippocampus, which is the central regulator of HPA system activity. In a first series of studies a refined neuroendocrine test to probe the integrity of HPA system status--the combined dexamethasone suppression/CRH challenge (DEX/CRH) test--was developed and the differential effects of aging and depressed psychopathology on DEX/CRH test outcome were described. In a second set of studies, the chronological relationship between improvement of psychopathology in depressed patients treated with antidepressants and normalization of the disturbed HPA system function in these patients was further elucidated. Given the evidence from animal studies, we conclude that antidepressants induce an up-regulation of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor mRNA concentration, thus amplifying the negative feedback effect of glucocorticoids. This then results in the normalization of DEX/CRH test results observed in the depressed patients in our study. We further conclude that dampening of HPA system hyperactivity in depression by means of antidepressants is a conditio sine qua non for successful improvement of psychopathology.",
