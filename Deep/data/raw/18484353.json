     "AB": "Surrogate and peripheral (bio)markers of neuronal injury may be of value in assessing effects of seizures on the brain or epilepsy development following trauma. The presence of 14-3-3 isoforms in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a diagnostic indicator of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease but these proteins may also be present following acute neurological insults. Here, we examined neuronal and 14-3-3 proteins in CSF from rats after seizures. Seizures induced by intra-amygdala microinjection of 0.1 microg kainic acid (KA) caused damage which was mainly restricted to the ipsilateral CA3 subfield of the hippocampus. 14-3-3zeta was detected at significant levels in CSF sampled 4 h after seizures compared with near absence in control CSF. Neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) was also elevated in CSF in seizure rats. CSF 14-3-3zeta levels were significantly lower in rats treated with 0.01 microg KA. These data suggest the presence of 14-3-3zeta within CSF may be a biomarker of acute seizure damage.",
