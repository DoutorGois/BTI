This paper focuses on the underlying assumptions and statistics of the method most frequently used: ordinary linear regression, principal axis and standard major axis. It is shown how the choice of method should depend on: the purpose of the analysis and the a priori assumptions regarding the residual variance. It appears that none of the methods has a universal application. Differences among the models discussed are illustrated by a bivariate morphometric analysis of cerebrocortical regions in primates.",
