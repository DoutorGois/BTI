     "AB": "Since the late 1950s, appreciation of dopamine receptor blockade has played a primary role in understanding the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenic patients in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g., delusions and hallucinations). Development of the second generation of antipsychotic drugs, otherwise known as atypical antipsychotic drugs, has resulted in treatments with improved subjective tolerability but relatively modest improvements in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as avolition, flat affect, and anhedonia. The major current challenge is to develop medications which can further improve negative symptoms treatment and also tackle the intractable clinical problems of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. Further advances along these lines with respect to the dopaminergic and serotonergic neurostransmitter systems will be aided by an appreciation of the interaction between dopamine and serotonin receptor subtypes in a range of key brain structures, such as the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, striatum, amygdala, hippocampus, and the brain stem nuclei, from which the cell bodies of monoaminergic-containing neurons originate. Increasing emphasis on the use of animal models which are homologous to critical aspects of the pathophysiology in the brains of schizophrenic patients will also be required, especially as negative symptoms and cognitive impairment become an important focus for generating novel therapeutics.",
