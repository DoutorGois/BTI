     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF) on apoptosis and BCL-2, NF-kappaB gene expression of rat hippocampal neurons injured by hydroperoxide (H2O2). METHODS: Hippocampal neurons of newly born rat were cultured in vivo and injured by H2O2. Effect of different concentration of 5-HMF on cell viability was measured by MTT. Flow cytometer (FCM) was used to measure the apoptosis of rat hippocampal neurons pre-cultured with different concentration of 5-HMF,Western blotting was used to measure the expression of BCL-2 and NF-kappaB gene. RESULTS: It revealed that the high and medium dosage of 5-HMF could increase the activity of rat hippocampal. The high, medium and low dosage of 5-HMF also increased the expression of BCL-2 gene and decreased the expression of NF-kappaB gene. CONCLUSION: 5-HMF could restrain the apoptosis of cultured hippocampal neurons injured by H2O2. The mechanism may be related to increasing in BCL-2 level and decreasing in NF-kappaB level.",
