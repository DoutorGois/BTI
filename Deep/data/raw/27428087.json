     "AB": "We investigated the interactive effects of BclI C/G (rs41423247) allelic variants and the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) on hippocampal shape and integrity of the left parahippocampal subdivision of the cingulum. Fifty-two patients with MDD and 52 healthy controls (HCs) underwent T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging and BclI C/G (rs41423247) genotyping. We analyzed hippocampal shape using the FIRST module of FSL and analyzed white matter (WM) integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Significant alterations in left hippocampal shape and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the left parahippocampal cingulum were observed in MDD patients, compared to HCs. In addition, MDD patients of the BclI minor (G-) allele carrier group showed significant alterations in left hippocampal shape and decreased FA values of the left parahippocampal cingulum compared to BclI minor (G-) allele carrier HCs. No significant differences between diagnostic subgroups of the C/C homozygotes were observed. Our study provides evidence for alterations in hippocampal shape and decreased integrity of the WM region associated with the hippocampus in MDD, and for the possible influence of BclI C/G polymorphism (rs41423247) on hippocampal shape and integrity of the parahippocampal subdivision of the cingulum in depression.",
