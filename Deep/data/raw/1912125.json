     "AB": "Involvement of histamine H1 receptor in the brains of schizophrenic patients was investigated using 3H-mepyramine as a ligand. The specific 3H-mepyramine binding in the frontal cortex was saturable with the dissociation constant (Kd) of about 0.6 nM and the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of 64 fmol/mg protein. Specific H1 antagonists, mepyramine (Ki = 1.4 nM), promethazine (Ki = 1.4 nM), diphenylpyraline (Ki = 4.1 nM), triprolidine (Ki = 5.3 nM), diphenylhydramine (Ki = 35 nM), but not the specific H2 antagonist, cimetidine (Ki greater than 10(5) nM), strongly inhibited the 3H-mepyramine binding. Regional distribution of the specific 3H-mepyramine binding was in the order of: frontal cortex greater than hippocampus greater than cerebellum greater than hypothalamus greater than thalamus, putamen, and pallidum. The specific 3H-mepyramine binding in schizophrenic brains was reduced by 56% in the frontal cortex. Representative Scatchard analyses of the specific 3H-mepyramine binding revealed changes resulting from a decrease in receptor density but not in receptor affinity. Down-regulation of the histamine H1 receptor in the frontal cortex may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",
