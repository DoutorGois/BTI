     "AB": "In this study, we observed the chronological alterations of neurofilament 150 (NF-150) immunoreactivity in the gerbil hippocampus and dentate gyrus after 5 min transient forebrain ischemia. NF-150 immunoreactivity in the sham-operated group was mainly detected in mossy fibers and in the hilar region of the dentate gyrus. NF-150 immunoreactivity and protein contents of NF-150 and RT 97 (polyphosphorylation epitopes of neurofilament) were significantly decreased at 15 min after ischemic insult. Between 30 min and 12 h after ischemic insult, NF-150 immunoreactivity and protein content were significantly increased as compared with the sham-operated group. Thereafter, NF-150 immunoreactivity and protein content started to decrease. At 12 h after ischemic insult, unlike dentate gyrus, NF-150 immunoreactivity increased in pyramidal cells of the CA1 region. Thereafter, NF-150 immunoreactivity in the CA1 region started to decrease, and 4 days after ischemic insult, NF-150 immunoreactivity nearly was similar to that of the sham-operated group. These biphasic patterns of NF-150 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus are reverse correlated with that of the intracellular calcium influx. For calcium detection in the CA1 region, we also conducted alizarin red staining. Alizarin red positive neurons were detected in some neurons at 15-30 min after ischemic insult. At 12 h after ischemia, alizarin red positive neurons were decreased. Thereafter, alizarin red positive neurons started to decrease, but alizarin positive neurons were significantly increased in dying neurons 4 days after ischemia. These results suggest that ischemia-related changes of NF-150 expression may be caused by the calcium following transient forebrain ischemia.",
