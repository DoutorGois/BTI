     "AB": "The content of endogenous vasopressin (AVP1-9) and its metabolites in rat's various brain areas and pituitary gland was investigated by the combination techniques of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). In addition to the AVP1-9, several compounds with C-terminal AVP immunoreactivity were detected in hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, medulla oblongata and septum. The C-terminal AVP1-9 metabolites were virtually absent in the pituitary gland. In view of the highly potent and selective effects on memory processes of AVP metabolites, some endogenous AVP metabolites in the brain may play an important role in the central nervous system (CNS) function.",
