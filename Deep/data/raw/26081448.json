     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study age-related metabolic changes in different brain regions. METHODS: Point-resolved spectroscopy (repetition time/echo time = 2000 ms/30 ms) was performed in the left and right hippocampus, the left thalamus and the left centrum semiovale of 80 healthy subjects (37 females and 43 males aged 7-64 years). Analysis of covariance and linear regression were used for statistical analysis. Both metabolite concentration ratios with respect to total creatine (tCr) and absolute metabolite concentrations were included for analysis. RESULTS: Ins (myo-inositol)/tCr (p < 0.001) and absolute Ins concentration (p = 0.031) were significantly increased with age after adolescence. NAA (N-acetylaspartic acid)/tCr (p < 0.001) and absolute NAA concentration (p = 0.010) significantly declined with age after adolescence. CONCLUSION: Age-related increase of Ins and decline of NAA are found in all three regions, especially at the hippocampus, indicating possible gliosis in the ageing brain. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: We could use NAA/tCr and Ins/tCr as an indicator to estimate the neurons-to-glial cells ratio at the thalamus. This may be an index to distinguish normal tissues from gliosis.",
