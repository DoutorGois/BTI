     "AB": "Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is synthesized in the brain, and a single type of cloned receptor for the N-terminal portion of PTHrP and PTH is present in the central nervous system. Nothing is known about the physiological actions or signaling pathways used by PTHrP in the brain. Using cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we demonstrate that N-terminal PTHrP[1-34] and PTH[1-34] signal via cAMP and cytosolic calcium transients. The cAMP response showed strong acute (< or = 6 h) homologous and heterologous desensitization after preincubation with PTHrP or PTH. In contrast, the acute calcium response did not desensitize after preincubation with PTHrP; in fact, preincubation dramatically recruited additional responsive neurons. Unexpectedly, C-terminal PTHrP[107-139], which does not bind or activate the cloned PTH/PTHrP receptor, signaled in neurons via cytosolic calcium but not cAMP. Although some neurons responded to both PTHrP[1-34] and PTHrP[107-139], others responded only to PTHrP[1-34]. We conclude that certain hippocampal neurons exhibit dual signaling in response to PTHrP[1-34] and that some neurons have a receptor for C-terminal PTHrP that signals only via cytosolic calcium.",
