     "AB": "The present study was conducted to evaluate the neuropharmacological effect of Mangiferin on brain cholinesterase and brain biogenic amines along with its antioxidant status. Scopolamine and natural aging were employed as an experimental amnesia inducing agents. The tested dose of Mangiferin (40, 20 and 10 mg/kg) significantly improved the learning ability and retention of learned memory in Elevated plus Maze and Passive Shock Avoidance exteroceptive behavioural models. Pre-treatment with Mangiferin restored increased whole brain acetylcholinestrease, lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione due to scopolamine and natural aging. Whole brain increased dopamine and nor-adrenaline content in brain in the inducing groups were reversed by tested doses of Mangiferin insignificantly. Moreover the cerebroprotective effect of Mangiferin was well supported by photomicrographs of Hippocampus of brain, where as severity of cell damage, number of pyknotic black neurons, formation of karyorrhexis, karyolysis and number of neuronal cell death were less comparative to scopolamine group. The observed effects of Mangiferin claim that it would be worthwhile to utilize in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",
