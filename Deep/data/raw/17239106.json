     "AB": "PURPOSE: To assess the quality and frequency of emotions induced by intracerebral electrical stimulation of the temporal lobe. METHODS: Behavioral responses were obtained by electrical stimulation in 74 patients undergoing presurgical video-stereo-EEG monitoring for drug-resistant epilepsy. Intracerebral electrical stimulation was performed by delivering trains of electrical stimuli of alternating polarity; the intensity could vary from 0.2 to 3 mA. Stimulation frequency was 1 Hz or 50 Hz. Nine hundred thirty-eight stimulation procedures were performed. RESULTS: Seventy-nine emotional responses (ERs) were obtained (8.4%). Of these, 67 were \"fear responses.\" Sad feelings were evoked 3 times, happy-pleasant feelings 9 times. Anger and disgust were never observed. The following variables affected the incidence of ER: (a) Anatomical site of stimulation. ERs (always fear) were maximal at the amygdala (12%) and minimal for lateral neocortical stimulation (3%, p < 0.01). (b) Pathology. Stimulation of a temporal lobe with hippocampal sclerosis was associated with a lower frequency of ERs compared with stimulation of a temporal lobe with no evidence of atrophy in the medial temporal structures. (c) Stimulation frequency. ERs were 12% at 50 Hz versus 6.0% at 1 Hz (p < 0.01). (d) Gender. In women fear responses were 16% compared with 3% in men (p < 0.01). There were no gender differences when analyzing nonemotional responses. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the role of the medial temporal lobe region in the expression of emotions, especially fear-related behaviors. Fear was observed more frequently in the absence of medial temporal sclerosis, supporting the hypothesis that emotional behaviors induced by stimulation are positive phenomena, strictly related to the physiological function of these regions. Further investigations should address why women express fear behaviors more frequently than men.",
