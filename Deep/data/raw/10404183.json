     "AB": "A screen for proteins that interact with beta 2-syntrophin led to the isolation of MAST205 (microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase-205 kD) and a newly identified homologue, SAST (syntrophin-associated serine/threonine kinase). Binding studies showed that beta 2-syntrophin and MAST205/SAST associated via a PDZ-PDZ domain interaction. MAST205 colocalized with beta 2-syntrophin and utrophin at neuromuscular junctions. SAST colocalized with syntrophin in cerebral vasculature, spermatic acrosomes and neuronal processes. SAST and syntrophin were highly associated with purified microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins, whereas utrophin and dystrophin were only partially associated with microtubules. Our data suggest that MAST205 and SAST link the dystrophin/utrophin network with microtubule filaments via the syntrophins.",
