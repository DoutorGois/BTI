     "AB": "The cellular localization of rat brain sodium channel alpha-subunit mRNAs I, II and III in the central nervous system (CNS) was examined by non-isotope in situ hybridization cytochemistry utilizing two independent sets of isoform-specific RNA probes, one set recognizing sodium channel isoforms in the coding region and the other in the non-coding region of the sodium channel messages. The independent sets of probes demonstrated qualitatively similar patterns of sodium channel mRNA expression. In the hippocampus, sodium channel mRNA I was very weakly expressed in the pyramidal layer and in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus; in contrast, sodium channel mRNA II was strongly expressed by neurons in these regions. Sodium channel mRNA III exhibited low-to-moderate expression in some neurons of the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus and granular layer of the dentate gyrus, and was not detectable in others. In the cerebellum, sodium channel mRNA I was moderately expressed in some Purkinje cells, weakly expressed in scattered cells in the molecular layer and negligibly expressed in the granular layer. Sodium channel mRNA II was strongly expressed in Purkinje and granule cells, and was moderately expressed in some cells in the molecular layer. Sodium channel mRNA III was generally not detectable in the cerebellum. In the spinal cord, motor neurons and scattered neurons throughout the gray matter exhibited moderate-to-strong expression of both sodium channel mRNA I and II. A population of cells in the spinal zone of Lissauer showed heavy expression of mRNA II, but not mRNA I. Sodium channel mRNA III was not detectable in spinal cord neurons. These observations are consistent with a general regional distribution of sodium channel message isoforms, with mRNA II being preferentially expressed in rostral regions of the CNS and mRNA I in caudal regions. However, the results also indicate that different cell types, within a given region, display different patterns of sodium channel mRNA expression. Moreover, these data suggest that individual neurons may express multiple forms of sodium channel mRNA.",
