     "AB": "The effect of monosialoganglioside GM1 of different doses on the long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission has been studied in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices, and the possible role that calcium ion and NMDA receptor play has also been investigated. The results reveal that larger magnitude of LTP is induced in hippocampal slices pre-incubated with GM1. The dose-response curve appears in diphase, and the largest magnitude of LTP has been obtained at the GM1 concentration of 50 mg/L in incubation ACSF. Moreover, the magnitude of LTP induced from the slices pre-incubated with GM1 at lower calcium ion concentration is similar to that obtained from the control slices at normal calcium ion concentration. Under higher calcium ion concentration, the enhancing effect of GM1 on LTP seems relatively feeble. After NMDA receptors were blocked, no enhancing effect of GM1 was observed. The mechanism of GM1 action on LTP is discussed.",
