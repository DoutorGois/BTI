     "AB": "The bite raised condition decreases the number of neurons and increases the amount of glial fibrillary acidic protein in the hippocampus of aged SAMP8 mice. In the present study, we examined whether these effects differ between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. In bite-raised SAMP8 mice, the number of neurons was significantly lower in the hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) subfields compared to control mice. In the bite raised condition, the number of neurons was significantly lower in both the dorsal and ventral CA3 subfields, and the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein-labeled astrocytes was increased in the CA1, CA3, and DG subfields, compared to control mice. These data suggest that in aged SAMP8 mice, the bite-raised condition enhanced aging processes in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus.",
