     "AB": "The hippocampus or a homologous region plays a role in spatial tasks in a large number of vertebrate species. This result, in combination with recent findings of adaptive specializations of the hippocampus for spatial demands, has led to the conclusion that the prominent selective force behind hippocampal evolution was a need for spatial abilities. However, a review of non-spatial hippocampus-dependent tasks shows that many vertebrate species also share non-spatial functions of the hippocampus. Placed in the appropriate phylogenetic context, it becomes clear that non-spatial facets of hippocampal function were just as likely to be present in our vertebrate ancestors as spatial ones. In addition, the absence of spatial strategy use in three lineages suggests divergence of this feature. Divergence in this character and other characteristics of hippocampal function are meaningful indicators of lineage specific functions. Studies of the evolution of the hippocampus must include examination of spatial and non-spatial functions of the hippocampus and consider both conserved, as well as derived, features.",
