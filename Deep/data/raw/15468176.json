     "AB": "The impact of severe hypoxia and preconditioning on the expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant thioredoxin-2 (Trx-2) in rat hippocampus (CA1, CA2, CA3 fields, and dentate gyrus) and neocortex was studied by immunocytochemistry. The preconditioning consisted of three trials of mild hypobaric hypoxia (360 Torr, 2 hr) spaced at 24 hr. The last trial was followed by severe hypobaric hypoxia (180 Torr, 3 hr) 24 hr later. Both in hippocampus and in neocortex, severe hypobaric hypoxia resulted in enhanced Trx-2 expression at 3 hr, followed by a slight decline in Trx-2 levels, which nevertheless remained increased at 24 hr elsewhere except for the CA1 region. The preconditioning considerably augmented severe hypoxia-induced Trx-2 immunoreactivity, affecting both the number of immunoreactive cells and the intensity of immunostaining. The findings suggest a role for Trx-2 in the formation of brain hypoxic/ischemic tolerance accomplished by the preconditioning.",
