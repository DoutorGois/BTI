     "AB": "We performed experiments in vitro to observe electrophysiological events that may relate to the protective effect of decreased temperature during cerebral ischemia in vivo. Extracellular field potentials were recorded from area CA1 of rat hippocampal slices with reduced oxygen and 2.0 mM D-glucose, producing irreversible changes within c. 10 min (more slowly than with complete deprivation of oxygen and glucose but more rapidly than with hypoxia alone). At 36 degrees C, synaptic potentials rapidly disappeared, followed by a d.c. negative shift similar to spreading depression. Elevated oxygen and glucose were reapplied within 5 min of each negative shift (duration of hypoxia ranged from 15 to 21 min). Application of normal medium for up to 45 min after negative shifts did not allow synaptic potentials to recover. At 33 degrees C negative shifts from reduced oxygen were delayed and excitatory postsynaptic potentials recovered in one experiment. At 31 degrees C negative shifts were usually absent and synaptic potentials always recovered, even with > 50 min of reduced oxygen and glucose. At both 33 degrees C and 31 degrees C, excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude oscillated one or more times, whether or not a negative shift occurred. Our results show that negative shifts and irreversible loss of synaptic activity from hypoxia in vitro are delayed or prevented by decreased temperature.",
