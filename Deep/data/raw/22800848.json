     "AB": "Several molecules were recently found to be important for the memory retrieval process in the hippocampus; however, the mechanisms underlying the memory retrieval remain poorly understood. GSK-3beta has been implicated in the control of synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Here, we investigated the relationship between hippocampal GSK-3beta activity and memory retrieval using behavioral and Western blotting methods. We found that GSK-3beta was activated in the hippocampus after a retention session in the passive avoidance task. An intrahippocampal injection of the GSK-3beta inhibitor, SB 216763, before the retention session blocked memory retrieval (but not reconsolidation) without affecting locomotor activity. These results suggest that GSK-3beta activation would be essential for memory retrieval in the hippocampus.",
