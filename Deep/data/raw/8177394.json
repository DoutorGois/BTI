     "AB": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may play a role in the pathophysiology of neuronal cell death after cerebral ischemia. We investigated alterations in BDNF gene expression and the effect of BDNF on neuronal death after transient forebrain ischemia in the rat brain. Transient forebrain ischemia was induced by occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries and by producing systemic hypotension for 8 minutes. The alterations in the BDNF messenger ribonucleic acid content in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex were examined by Northern blot analysis, using a phosphorus-32-labeled mouse BDNF complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probe. Recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells with BDNF-secreting capacity were established by expression vector transfection with BDNF complementary deoxyribonucleic acid. The effect of BDNF on neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region after ischemia was then examined by using a continuous intraventricular infusion of 200 microliters of normal (Group II, n = 6) or 30-times concentrated recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cell culture medium containing BDNF (Group IV, n = 6). Normal (Group I, n = 6) or 30-times concentrated (Group III, n = 6) Chinese hamster ovary cell culture medium, not including BDNF complementary deoxyribonucleic acid, was infused into the same ischemic brains, which served as controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
