     "AB": "The studies of neuronal cell-glycosaminoglycan interactions indicate an increasing interest in the question of how heparin can mediate adhesion properties of the cell. We have found that high levels of both N-CAM concentration and heparin-binding activity were noticed in the early stages of brain formation. According to electron microscopy data, an elevation of free heparin in the substratum leads to a decrease of the N-CAM content and changing of its distribution on the membrane of cultured hippocampal neurons. Spatial arrangement of immunogold labelled N-CAM molecules in plasma membrane profiles of cultured neurones was quantified with image analysis software using an interlabel distance estimate. To convert these estimates into two dimensional (2D) quantities, namely the 2D pattern and density of labelling, a computer simulation technique was used. Heparin added to the substratum in a concentration of 40 microg/ml decreased the 2D N-CAM labelling density by 50% - 39.8 labels/microm(2) compared with the control values of 88.9 labels/microm(2).",
