     "AB": "AIMS: Oxidative stress is frequently implicated in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. This study aimed to investigate the effects and their underlying mechanism(s) of edaravone upon hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in HT22 cells, a murine hippocampal neuronal model. METHODS: HT22 cells were treated with H2O2 in the presence of various concentrations of edaravone or in its absence. A CCK-8 assay, Hoechst 33342 staining, and flow cytometry were used to detect cytotoxicity and apoptosis. In addition, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, p-ERK 1/2, p-JNK, and p-P38 proteins in HT22 cells were examined. RESULTS: Exogenous H2O2 decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner and was associated with increased apoptosis and ROS production. Moreover, H2O2 significantly activated and upregulated the expression of p-ERK 1/2, p-JNK, and p-P38, while edaravon protected HT22 cells against H2O2-induced injury by inhibiting the production of ROS and activating the MAPK signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first evidence that edaravone can protect H2O2-induced cell injury in HT22 neurons via its antioxidant action. These findings suggest that edaravone may be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in which oxidative stress has been principally implicated.",
