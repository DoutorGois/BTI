     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the levels of 5 pyrethroid pesticide residues in two kinds of Chinese traditional medicines, i.e. Hirudo, Hippocampus. METHODS: 11 samples of Hirudo and 5 samples of Hippocampus were collected and identified. The 5 pyrethroid pesticide residues in samples were extracted by solid-phase extraction to remove the interferences of co-extractives, and then were analyzed by gas chromatorgraph (GC) equipped with an electron capture detector, qualified by the chromatographic peak's retention time and quantified by the external standard method. RESULTS: The 5 pyrethroid pesticied residues were not detected in 5 samples of Hippocampus. Among 11 samples of Hirudo, the Cypermethrin were detected in all samples, and Fenvalerate were detected in 4 samples without exceeding the limit. CONCLUSION: The result suggest that the Hippocampus are not contaminated by the residues of 5 pyrethroid pesticides. The precaution procedure should be taken to control pyrethroid pesticide residues in Hirudo.",
