     "AB": "The effects of large bilateral retrohippocampal lesions on long-term performance of conditional spatial alternation, incorporating a strong working memory component, were examined using a T-maze task motivated by swim-escape. The lesions, which included entorhinal cortex, subiculum, pre- and parasubiculum and invaded the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, completely eliminated the previously acquired conditional alternation learning, and performance failed to recover with 40 days of testing. These findings support the contention that retrohippocampal structures are an important and necessary component of the neural circuitry mediating working memory.",
