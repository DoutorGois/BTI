     "AB": "While neural correlates of path integration on a yaw plane have been studied extensively, much less is known about path integration in three-dimensions (3D). Here we used fMRI during virtual navigation within tunnels in pseudo-3D. We found that the same visual motion stimuli are encoded differently in the brain depending on whether they represent displacements within the yaw plane or within the pitch plane. The yaw plane is more represented in the hippocampus while the pitch plane is more represented in the angular gyrus (AG) and in the posterior inferior temporal gyrus (pITG), known to be involved in 3D space encoding. In addition, a region in pITG, located just above the previous one, showed two different patterns with multi-voxel analysis, separately coding for the pitch and yaw planes. These results suggest that information encoded within pITG about the yaw plane may be exchanged with the hippocampus, while information about the pitch plane may be exchanged with the AG.",
