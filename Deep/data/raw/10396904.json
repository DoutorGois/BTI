     "AB": "Multiple window (MW) time-frequency analysis (TFA) is a newly developed technique to estimate a time-varying spectrum for random nonstationary signals with low bias and variance. In this paper, we describe the application of MW-TFA techniques to electroencephalogram (EEG) and compare the results with those of the conventional spectrogram. We find that the MW-TFA provide us with not only low bias and variance time-frequency (TF) distribution for EEG but also TF coherence estimation between a single realization of EEG recorded from two sites. We also compare the performance of the MW-TFA using two sets of windows, Slepian sequences, and Hermite functions. If care is taken in matching the two windows, we find no noticeable difference in the resulting TF representations.",
