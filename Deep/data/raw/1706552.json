     "AB": "Although biochemical and behavioural studies have shown right-left differences in several areas of the rat limbic system, some anatomical studies reported no significant right-left differences in several morphological parameters of the hippocampus. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether there are asymmetries in the micro-anatomy of the rat hippocampus by examining the intensity of Timm staining in various hippocampal fields and the area occupied by mossy fibres by the use of combined microdensitometric and quantitative image analysis techniques. Timm staining demonstrates the distribution of intrahippocampal association pathways because it is a histochemical marker of zinc and other heavy transition metals. There were no right-left differences in the density of Timm staining at the level of the dentate gyrus, in the dendritic layer of CA1 and CA2 fields, in the mossy fibre area or in the subiculum. These findings provide further evidence of a lack of morphological asymmetry in the rat hippocampus.",
