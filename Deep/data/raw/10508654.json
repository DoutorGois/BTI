     "AB": "Studies in the past few years suggest that cell adhesion molecules may play signaling as well as structural roles at adult synapses during plasticity. The observation that many adhesion molecules are expressed both pre-synaptically and post-synaptically raises the possibility that information about synaptic activity might simultaneously be communicated to both sides of the synapse, circumventing the need for distinct anterograde and retrograde messengers.",
