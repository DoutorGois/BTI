     "AB": "Effects of vestibular stimulation on the in vivo release of hypothalamic histamine and hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) were investigated in urethan-anesthetized rats, using a brain microdialysis method. Changes in glutamate concentration in the medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) were also monitored by a microbiosensor technique using a glutamate oxidase-embodied platinum electrode. Caloric stimulation with hot water increased the glutamate release in the MVN, while that with ice water decreased it. It is evidenced that glutamate is a neurotransmitter between afferent vestibular nerve and the MVN. Electrical stimulation of the round window evoked the release of hypothalamic histamine and hippocampal ACh and these effects were inhibited by the blockade of second-order vestibular neurons by the pre-injection of 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), an antagonist of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) glutamate receptors, into the ipsilateral vestibular nucleus. Caloric stimulation with both hot and ice water increased the release of hypothalamic histamine and hippocampal ACh. It is suggested that both the histaminergic and cholinergic systems were activated by the imbalance of intervestibular activities. Depletion of neuronal histamine by alpha-fluorometylhistidine (FMH), an irreversible inhibitor of histamine synthesis, did not suppress the vestibular evoked release of hippocampal ACh. In contrast, caloric stimulation did not evoke hypothalamic histamine release in rats treated with ethylcholine aziridiniun ion (AF64A), a putative cholinotoxin. All these findings suggest that the vestibular information activated the histaminergic neurons via the activation of the cholinergic neurons and this neuronal circuit was involved in the vestibulo-autonomic response.",
