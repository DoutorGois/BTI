     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Ketamine is commonly used in pediatric anesthesia but recent studies have shown that it could induce neurotoxicity in the developing brain. The inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is involved in the pathogenesis of various types of neurodegenerations. In the present study, we examined whether TNF-alpha may regulate ketamine-induced neurotoxicity in the hippocampus of neonatal mouse. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The in vitro organotypic culture of hippocampal slices was used to investigate the gain-of-function and loss-of-function effect of TNF-alpha modulation on ketamine-induced hippocampal neurotoxicity. Also, western blotting analysis was used to examine the relative pathways associated with TNF-alpha modulation. In the in vivo Morris water maze test, TNF-alpha was genetically silenced to see if memory function was improved after anesthesia-induced memory impairment. RESULTS: In in vitro experiments, adding TNF-alpha enhanced (112.99 +/-5.4%, p = 0.015), whereas knocking down TNF-alpha ameliorated (46.8 +/-11.6%, p = 0.003) ketamine-induced apoptosis in hippocampal CA1 neurons in the organotypic culture. Western blotting showed that addition of TNF-alpha reduced (67.1 +/-3.7%, p = 0.022), whereas downregulation of TNF-alpha increased (126.87 +/-8.5%, p = 0.004) the phosphorylation of PKC-ERK pathway in ketamine-treated hippocampus. In in vivo experiments, genetically silencing TNF-alpha markedly improved the ketamine-induced memory impairment through Morris water maze test. CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly demonstrated a protective mechanism of down-regulating TNF in ketamine-induced hippocampal neurotoxicity. This study may present a new target for pharmacological intervention to prevent anesthesia-related neurodegeneration in brain.",
