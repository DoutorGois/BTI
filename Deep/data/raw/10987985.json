     "AB": "Oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage are involved in Parkinson's disease (PD). Several drugs used for PD treatment have demonstrated antioxidant properties. To evaluate the antioxidant efficacy of cabergoline, an ergot derivative with a long plasma half-life, male Wistar rats were treated with vehicle or with 2.5 mg kg(-1)and 10 mg kg(-1)of the drug three, six, or 10 times at 48-h intervals. Cabergoline decreased basal lipid peroxide levels (LPO) in the hippocampus of rats given 10 mg kg(-1)10 times, and in the striatum of rats given the same dose six or 10 times. Spontaneous LPO was inhibited in the hippocampus of rats given 10 mg kg(-1)10 times. Stimulated LPO was decreased in the striatum of rats given 10 mg kg(-1)six times and in rats given 2.5 and 10 mg kg(-1)10 times. The ability of cabergoline to reduce LPO suggests its anti-lipoperoxidative properties.",
