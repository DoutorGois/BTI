     "AB": "We examined the hypotheses that aging alters the capacity of brain tissue to regulate extracellular K+ activity (K+o), and that age-related decreases in glucose metabolism may underlie these alterations. Hippocampal slices from young adult (6-9 months old), middle-aged (16-19 months old), and aged (26-29 months old) Fischer 344 rats were exposed to physiological solutions containing 5-20 mM glucose maintained at 36-37 degrees C. Schaffer collaterals in each slice were stimulated at 40 Hz for 2 s, and the resulting changes in K+o were recorded with K+o-sensitive microelectrodes placed in stratum pyramidale of hippocampal subfield CA1. We found that K+ clearance from the extracellular space of hippocampal slices was significantly slowed in the middle-aged group compared with the young adult group in physiological solutions containing 5 and 10 mM glucose. Age-related differences in K+o clearance disappeared in 20 mM glucose. Also, the rate of K+o clearance was modified by glucose concentration. These results suggest that K+ transport rates are modified by age, and that age-related alterations in glucose metabolism may be involved.",
