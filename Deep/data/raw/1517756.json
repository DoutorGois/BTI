     "AB": "A semi-quantitative estimation has been made of the effect of anaesthetics, anticonvulsants and glutamate antagonists on the extent of neuronal loss in the hippocampus caused by the local injection of the excitotoxin kainic acid, and on the vulnerability of neurons in various extrahippocampal regions due to the resulting seizure activity. Following the intrahippocampal injection of 0.47 nmol kainic acid (a submaximal dose), the amount of neuronal loss in the dorsal hippocampus was greater when given under the short-acting anaesthetics halothane and ketamine (a non-competitive glutamate antagonist), than when given under pentobarbital anaesthesia (with or without co-administration of ketamine (30 mg/kg)). When kainic acid was injected under halothane or ketamine anaesthesia a greater number of extrahippocampal limbic regions (distal toxicity) were also affected, usually on the ipsilateral side, and the extent of damage in each of these regions was generally more extensive. The anticonvulsants MK 801 and diazepam, or multiple injections of ketamine over a period of 5 h, decreased both the local and distal toxicity of kainic acid injected under short duration anaesthesia, to levels similar to those found under pentobarbital anaesthesia. However, these compounds, even at high doses, could not reliably prevent all seizure-related damage in extrahippocampal areas.",
