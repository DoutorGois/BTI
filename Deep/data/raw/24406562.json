     "AB": "The aim of this study was to provide healthy Chinese adult hippocampal formation volume data for the clinic and diagnoses of the related diseases. Three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging sequence scanning was used in 68 cases of healthy adult brain to gain the image between lateral border of bilateral fourth ventricle and vitreous body. The image then was divided into 10 equal parts in the sagittal plane. We draw the outline and then obtain the area and volume of the hippocampal formation in each part, and the data were analyzed by SPSS 17.0 software. Results of the research showed that the volume of the hippocampal in healthy Chinese adult left side is approximately 2319.87 to 2602.47 mm3, right side is approximately 2443.96 to 2755.89 mm3; male left side is approximately 2135.00 to 2494.29 mm3, right side is approximately 2350.21 to 2745.61 mm3; female left side is approximately 2328.13 to 2748.41 mm3, right side is approximately 2398.41 to 2909.48 mm3. The volume of hippocampal absence correlated with age (P > 0.05), youth group. The volume of hippocampal has significant sexual difference (t = 2.500, P < 0.05). The volumes of the left and right sides have significant difference (t = 2.571, P < 0.05). The female group (middle-age and youth) which the volumes of right-side hippocampal have significant difference (P < 0.05).",
