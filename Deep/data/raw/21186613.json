     "AB": "AIM: To study the effect of chronic intermittent hypoxia on p38MAPK in partial cerebral tissues of weanling rats. METHODS: Randomly, fifty male SD rats (3-week-old-4-week-old) were divided into five groups: 2-week-CIH group (2IH), 4-week-CIH group (4IH), 4-week-recovery group (4F), 2-week-control group (2C) and 4-week-control group (4C). Intermittent hypoxia model was induced by an intermittent hypoxia cabin. The expression of p38MAPK mRNA and the phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK (p-p38 protein) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were measured by RT-PCR or Western blot respectively. RESULTS: No matter in the hippocampus, or in the prefrontal cortex, the expression of p38MAPK mRNA and p-p38 protein in 2IH, 4IH and 4F groups were respectively higher than 2C and 4C groups (P < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Chronic intermittent hypoxia can activate the p38MAPK in partial cerebral tissues of weanling rats.",
