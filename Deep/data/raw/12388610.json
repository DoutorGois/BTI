     "AB": "This study examined the performance of spatial problems by rats when purely behavioral manipulations disturb the relationship between the place cell representation and the cues used to solve the problems. Place cells were recorded while rats performed a task in which they had to locate a goal in a gray cylinder. In the \"far\" task, the unmarked goal was displaced by a large fixed distance from a white card on the cylinder wall. In the \"near\" task, the unmarked goal was directly in front of the card. Finally, in the \"cue\" task the goal was marked by a black disk on the cylinder floor. Relationships between visible stimuli and place cell activity were manipulated by conducting either \"hidden\" (with the rat in its home cage) or \"visible\" (with the rat in the recording apparatus) rotations of the wall card and, when present, independent rotations of the black disk. Hidden card rotations generally caused equal firing field rotations, whereas visible card rotations often did not cause fields to move. In the far task, visible card rotations were associated with a strong decrease of correct responses in the card-referred goal area. Most rats tended to search the goal in the field-referred area. In the near task, visible card rotations were associated with a moderate decrease of performance, with rats searching the goal at the wall card. Finally, field placements had no effect on performance in the cue task. Thus, visible rotations tended to disrupt the relationship between firing fields and cues in all tasks but impaired performance only in the task that required map-based navigation. These results provide strong new evidence in favor of the spatial mapping theory of hippocampal function.",
