     "AB": "There is growing concern by the public regarding the potential human health hazard due to exposure to microwave frequencies. 2.45 GHz radiation widespread use in industry, research, and medicine, and leakage into the environment is possible. In order to quantitate this, experiments were performed on developing rat brain. Male Wistar 35-day-old rats (n = 6) were used for this study. Animals were exposed to 2.45 GHz radiation for 2 h/day for a period of 35 days at a power density of 0.344 mW/cm(2) (SAR 0.11 W/kg). The control group was sham irradiated. After 35 days these rats were sacrificed and whole brain tissue was isolated for protein kinase C (PKC) assay. For morphological study the forebrain was isolated from the whole brain and PKC activity was measured using P(32) labeled ATP. Our study reveals a statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease in PKC activity in hippocampus as compared to the remaining portion of the whole brain and the control group. A similar experiment conducted on hippocampus and the whole brain gave a similar result. Electron microscopic study shows an increase in the glial cell population in the exposed group as compared to the control group. This present study is indicative of a significant change after exposure to the above-mentioned field intensity. This suggests that chronic exposures may affect brain growth and development.",
