     "AB": "Rise in Ca(2+) concentration in the nucleus affects gene transcription and has been implicated in neuroprotection, transcription-dependent neuronal plasticity, and pain modulation, but the mechanism of regulation of nuclear Ca(2+) remains poorly understood. The nuclear envelope is a part of the endoplasmic reticulum and may be one of the sources of nuclear Ca(2+) . Here, we studied ion channels in the nuclear membrane of hippocampal neurons using the patch-clamp technique. We have found that the nuclear membrane of CA1 pyramidal and dentate gyrus granule (DG), but not CA3 pyramidal neurons, was enriched in functional inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors/Ca(2+) -release channels (IP3 Rs) localized mainly in the inner nuclear membrane. A single nuclear ryanodine receptor (RyR) has been detected only in DG granule neurons. Nuclei of the hippocampal neurons also expressed a variety of spontaneously active cation and anion channels specific for each type of neuron. In particular, large-conductance ion channels selective for monovalent cations (LCC) were coexpressed with IP3 Rs. These data suggest that: (1) the nuclear membranes of hippocampal neurons contain distinct sets of ion channels, which are specific for each type of neuron; (2) IP3 Rs, but not RyRs are targeted to the inner nuclear membrane of CA1 pyramidal and DG granule, but they were not found in the nuclear membranes of CA3 pyramidal neurons; (3) the nuclear envelope of these neurons is specialized to release Ca(2+) into the nucleoplasm which may amplify Ca(2+) signals entering the nucleus from the cytoplasm or generate Ca(2+) transients on its own; (4) LCC channels are an integral part the of Ca(2+) -releasing machinery providing a route for counterflow of capital KA, Cyrillic(+) and thereby facilitating Ca(2+) movement in and out of the Ca(2+) store.",
