     "AB": "Several cytokines have short-term effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity that are thought to be mediated by the activation of intracellular protein kinases. We have studied the effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) on the expression of paired pulse facilitation (PPF), posttetanic potentiation (PTP), and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus as well as on the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK (MAPK/ERK), and the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK). IL-6 induced a marked and dose-dependent decrease in the expression of PTP and LTP that could be counteracted by the simultaneous treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lavendustin A (LavA) but did not significantly affect PPF. The IL-6-induced inhibition of PTP and LTP was accompanied by a simulation of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and an inhibition of MAPK/ERK dual phosphorylation, in the absence of changes in the state of activation of SAPK/JNK. Both effects of IL-6 on STAT3 and MAPK/ERK activation were effectively counteracted by LavA treatment. The results indicate the tyrosine kinases and MAPK/ERK are involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and may represent preferential intracellular targets for the actions of IL-6 in the adult nervous system.",
