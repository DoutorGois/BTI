     "AB": "In rats kainic acid-induced seizures were accompanied by time-dependent cerebral cysteinyl-leukotriene (LT) and prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha formation. Cysteinyl-LT were identified in the rat brain tissue extracts by their immunoreactive properties and their retention times upon reversed phase HPLC profiling. In perfused blood-free brain tissue contents of LTC4-like material were significantly elevated in cortex, hippocampus, midbrain and hypothalamus at 3 h after kainic acid injection. PGF2 alpha tissue contents were significantly elevated in all brain areas studied with very large amounts in the hippocampus and smaller amounts in the cortex. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin significantly inhibited formation of PGF2 alpha in whole brain tissue while leaving unaffected the production of cysteinyl-LT. A dose of indomethacin which nearly completely inhibited cyclooxygenase activity as monitored by cerebral PGF2 alpha contents also tended to aggravate behavioral changes and significantly increased the mortality. Phenidone, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, significantly and dose-dependently inhibited formation of cysteinyl-LT but did not significantly affect PGF2 alpha formation. Seizure activity tended to be attenuated by a higher dose of this compound. Dexamethasone which supposedly inhibits phospholipase A2 activity by induction of lipocortins, did not significantly reduce either cysteinyl-LT or PGF2 alpha biosynthesis. Flunarizine, trifluoperazine and diazepines protected a certain percentage of animals from kainic acid-induced seizures. In rats in which seizures occurred in spite of pretreatment with these compounds, the eicosanoid formation was not inhibited but in the case of flunarizine was even found to be somewhat enhanced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
