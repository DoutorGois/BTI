     "AB": "To improve carbodiimide-based immunohistochemistry, carbodiimide-mediated coupling of radiolabeled N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) to bovine serum albumin was assayed in vitro. Various perfusion protocols, based on assay results, were tested for their ability to improve the immunohistochemical localization of two nervous system-specific molecules, NAAG and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the spinal cord, medulla, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex of the rat. Coupling of [3H]-NAAG to BSA in vitro was optimal with 100 mM carbodiimide and 1 mM N-hydroxysuccinimide in water at 37 degrees C. Optimal fixation of tissue was defined as permitting the identification of the NAAG and NAA in neuronal somata, dendritic arborizations, fine axons, and synaptic terminals with minimal diffuse background immunoreactivity. These conditions were obtained at 37 degrees C with 6% carbodiimide, 1 mM N-hydroxysuccinimide, and 5% dimethylsulfoxide perfused transcardially. Strong NAAG and NAA immunoreactivities were co-distributed in the majority of neurons in the spinal cord. Large-diameter spinal sensory afferents were stained for NAAG in the dorsal horn. The dorsal column nuclei were immunoreactive for NAAG and NAA, but only NAA staining was observed in the nucleus of the solitary tract. In cerebral cortex and hippocampus, NAAG and NAA immunoreactivities appeared to be exclusive, with NAAG staining observed in interneurons throughout all cortical layers, and NAA immunoreactivity present in most pyramidal neurons.",
