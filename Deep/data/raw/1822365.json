     "AB": "It is generally accepted that thyroid hormones act at the genomic level through an interaction with specific nuclear receptors. Using a monoclonal antibody raised against the rat liver nuclear L-T3 receptor (NTR), we report here the immunocytochemical localization of T3 receptors in the adult rat brain. The strongest NTR immunoreactivity was found in the olfactory bulb, the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, the amygdala areas, and the neocortex (layers III-VI). An intermediate NTR immunoreactivity was found in the hypothalamus, whereas the thalamus, the caudate-putamen, and the pallidum were weakly NTR-immunoreactive. In the cerebellum, a strong NTR immunoreactivity was found in the nuclei of Purkinje cells, in the internal granular layer, and in some nuclei of cells located in the molecular layer. In the brainstem, a strong NTR immunoreactivity was found in the lateral mamillary nucleus and the interstitial nucleus. A weak to moderate NTR immunoreactivity was observed in the central gray matter, while the substantia nigra and the interpeduncular nucleus were weakly stained. Furthermore, we also found NTR immunoreactivity in the nuclei of ependymocytes, epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, and cells located in the white matter. At the electron microscope level, we confirm that the immunoreactivity was not only localized in the nuclei of neurons but also in the nuclei of astrocytes and medium oligodendrocytes. This study provides new information concerning the distribution of NTR in the rat brain: (1) NTR are present not only in neurons but also in glial and ependymal cells, and (2) there is a regional and cellular heterogeneity in the distribution of NTR in the central nervous system.",
