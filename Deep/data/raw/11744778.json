     "AB": "This article reviews 147 cases of amnesia following damage including the hippocampus or fornix as reported in 179 publications. The aetiology, mnestic abilities and reference(s) are tabulated for each case. Consistent findings across cases include the association of bilateral hippocampal damage with a deficit in anterograde episodic memory combined with spared procedural and working memory. The limited nature of retrograde amnesia following lesions to the fornix is also noted. Less consistent and thus more controversial findings, include effects of lesion size or laterality, deficits in semantic memory or familiarity-based recognition and the extent of retrograde amnesia. The evidence concerning these issues is reviewed across cases.",
