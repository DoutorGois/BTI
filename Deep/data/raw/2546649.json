     "AB": "The effects of scorpion toxin on the voltage-dependent sodium current (INa) of CA1 pyramidal neurons isolated from rat hippocampus were studied under the single-electrode voltage-clamp condition using a 'concentration-clamp' technique. The toxin increased the peak amplitude of INa and prolonged its inactivation phase in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Inactivation phase of INa proceeded with two exponential components in the absence (control) and presence of the toxin. In the toxin-treated neurons, both the time constant of slow component and its fractional contribution to the total current increased dose-dependently while the fractional contribution of the fast one decreased in a dose-dependent fashion without changing its time constant. Actions of scorpion toxin on the sodium channels of hippocampal pyramidal neurons were essentially similar to those of peripheral preparations. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sodium channels of mammalian brain neurons have structures and functions similar to peripheral channels.",
