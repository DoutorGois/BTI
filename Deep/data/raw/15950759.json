     "AB": "Amphetamine abuse may be associated with adaptive changes in gene expression. In the present study, we used a newly developed cDNA array system comprising mouse KIAA (mKIAA) cDNA clones to examine changes in gene expression after chronic methamphetamine (MAP) treatment. Mice were daily treated with saline or MAP (2 mg/kg, ip) for 2 weeks. Approximately 800 mKIAA clones were blotted onto a nylon membrane and hybridized with 33P-labeled DNA derived from mRNAs from mouse whole brain. MAP-induced changes were found in several clones by using whole brain mRNA. Since gene expression of Per2, one of the period protein-related proteins, was the most affected by MAP treatment, its expression was further analyzed in pooled hippocampi from 20 mice that had been treated with saline or MAP (2 mg/kg, ip) for 2 weeks. The gene expression and protein expression of Per2 in the hippocampus were increased by MAP treatment. In the hippocampus, Per2 gene expression was under the regulation of circadian rhythm and increases in Per2 expression were due to the phase shift induced by chronic MAP treatment. These findings suggest that unique expression changes of period protein-related proteins in the hippocampus occur in MAP abuse.",
