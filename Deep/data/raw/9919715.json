     "AB": "Effects of local administration of atropine into the medial septal nucleus (MSN) and dorsal septal nucleus (DSN) were tested in laboratory rats. Atropine administration led to the development of a spike/wave activity in the hippocampus as well as amygdala within 10 minutes. The frequency of spikes ranged in the absolute values from 20 to 25 spikes per minute in the case of atropine administration to MSN, while in the case of DSN it reached only about 16 spikes per minute. Spike/wave activity outlasted in the EEG record within 2 hours. The average incidence of spikes was somewhat lower in females than in males. A possible relation of the atropine-induced spike/wave activity to another kinds of limbic convulsions is discussed.",
