     "AB": "A system of equations governing the activity of hippocampal neuron populations is proposed. This continual firing-rate model is aimed to simulate evoked potentials and synchronous wave activity of the neural tissue. The populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and the types of synaptic receptors are distinguished. The model is based on the idea of control and averaging of Hodgkin-Huxley equations, a simple model of a threshold elicitation of population action potential bursts, approximations of synaptic currents by the second-order differential equations, and hyperbolic partial derivative equation of axonal excitation propagation. The model was fitted to intracellular cordings of postsynaptic potentials and postsynaptic currents in CA1 of rat hippocampal slices.",
