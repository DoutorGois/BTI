     "AB": "Protein kinase C(beta) immunoreactivity was determined in the membrane and cytosol fractions of the hippocampus, frontal cortex and cerebellum after repetitive, intraperitoneal administration of reserpine. A marked decrease in the immunoreactivity was observed in the membrane of the hippocampus, while no significant change was found in any other subfractions of the frontal cortex or cerebellum. These findings suggest a novel mechanism regulating the distribution of protein kinase C. The topographical selectivity in the present study may indicate the importance of the alteration of protein kinase C in the pathophysiological mechanism in Alzheimer's disease.",
