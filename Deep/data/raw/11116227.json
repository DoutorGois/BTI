     "AB": "Kalirin is a multifunctional protein identified by its interaction with peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, an enzyme essential for neuropeptide biosynthesis. Several forms of Kalirin exist, all containing spectrin-like repeats, a Dbl homology (DH) domain, and an adjacent pleckstrin homology (PH) domain; several different COOH-termini provide additional DH/PH domains and a putative protein kinase. Kalirin binds Rac1 and affects cytoskeletal organization, neuropeptide secretion, and iNOS activity. By in situ hybridization, the highest levels of Kalirin mRNA were found in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, and Purkinje cells, with high levels also in thalamus, caudate putamen, septal nucleus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and anterior olfactory nucleus. Low levels of Kalirin mRNA were detected in the paraventricular, supraoptic, and reticular thalamic nuclei and in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Brain areas with high levels of Kalirin mRNA showed strong Kalirin-like immunoreactivity. Pyramidal neurons with strongly staining soma and long dendrites were observed primarily in layer 5 of the cerebral cortex. In the hippocampus, a uniform distribution of neurons with fine dendritic staining was observed in the pyramidal cell layer, in the granule cell layer, and in the hilar cells of the dentate gyrus as well as in isolated interneurons. Cerebellar Purkinje neurons exhibited intense staining in the soma and in extensive dendritic arbors extending to the surface of the molecular layer. During embryonic development, Trio, the Drosophila orthologue of Kalirin, plays an essential role in axon guidance; localization of Kalirin to the somatodendritic region of adult neurons provides the basis for future studies of regulation and function.",
