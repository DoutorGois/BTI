     "AB": "Retrogradely labeled cells in superficial and deep layers of the entorhinal cortex (EC) were analyzed following application of the fluorescent tracer rhodamine-dextran-amine in different sites of the hippocampal formation in a slice preparation. The results demonstrate a strong projection from layer IV/V to the dentate gyrus, that is in slices significantly stronger than that from layer II. In deep layers a large number of multipolar cells were found which were only labeled by dye application to the subiculum. Patch-clamp recordings from these cells revealed intrinsic low threshold membrane potential oscillations, suggesting their possible contribution to oscillatory network activity of the EC and subiculum.",
