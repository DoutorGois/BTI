     "AB": "In an effort to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the cognition-enhancer linopirdine (DuP 996), a number of core structure analogues were prepared in which the 4-pyridyl pendant group was systematically replaced with 2-fluoro-4-pyridyl. This strategy resulted in the discovery of several compounds with improved activity in acetylcholine (ACh) release-enhancing assays, in vitro and in vivo. The most effective compound resulting from these studies, 10, 10-bis[(2-fluoro-4-pyridinyl)methyl]-9(10H)-anthracenone (9), is between 10 and 20 times more potent than linopirdine in increasing extracellular hippocampal ACh levels in the rat with a minimum effective dose of 1 mg/kg. In addition to superior potency, 9 possesses an improved pharmacokinetic profile compared to that of linopirdine. The half-life of 9 (2 h) in rats is 4-fold greater than that of linopirdine (0.5 h), and it showed a 6-fold improvement in brain-plasma distribution over linopirdine. On the basis of its pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, absorption, and distribution properties, 9 (DMP543) has been advanced for clinical evaluation as a potential palliative therapeutic for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",
