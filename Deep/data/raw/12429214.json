     "AB": "Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation may play an important part in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation itself, however, is insufficient to produce acute neurodegeneration in vivo. In this report, we determined whether inflammation increases excitotoxicity in hippocampal neurons. A proinflammagen, bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, was coinjected with ibotenate, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist, into rat hippocampus. One week after coinjection, significant neuronal degeneration and severe tissue collapse were observed in the hippocampus. Astroglial and microglial infiltration were also detected. The neurodegeneration was suppressed by dizocilpine maleate, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist. We then examined whether microglial activation takes part in synergistic neuronal loss. One day after the lipopolysaccharide injection into the rat hippocampus, substantial microglial activation and induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase were observed, while neither neuronal nor astrocytic changes were detected. On the other hand, ibotenate injection at the same place 1 day after lipopolysaccharide injection in the hippocampus produced significant neuronal degeneration and gross microglial activation. These results suggest that inflammation by lipopolysaccharide might play an important role in ibotenate/lipopolysaccharide neurotoxicity.",
