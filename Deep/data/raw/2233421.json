     "AB": "It is proposed that the higher incidence of chronic stress-adaptation failure in patients with Alzheimer's disease is of specific etiopathological significance. Such chronic stress-adaptation failure leads to a vicious circular reaction, namely: intense, stressful stimuli----neocortico-limbic excitation----hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activation----excessive secretion of neurohormones including cortisol----stimulation of inhibitory glucocorticoid sensitive hippocampal neurons----failure to terminate the HPA axis response----chronic excessive secretion of neurohormones including cortisol----overstimulation degeneration of glucocorticoid sensitive hippocampal inhibitory neurons----progressive cognitive-affective behavioral disorganizational failure which is typical of dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Possibilities of neuropharmacological corrections and neurobehavioral re-education are suggested.",
