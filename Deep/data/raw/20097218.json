     "AB": "Increasing evidence suggests that GABA neuropathies play a major role in a variety of neuronal disorders. In addition, the role of non-coding RNAs in regulating a wide range of cellular processes is an intense area of investigation. This commentary discusses the intersection of these two fields, a corollary to the finding that adult hippocampal GABAergic interneuron development is controlled by an embryonic non-coding RNA during development.",
