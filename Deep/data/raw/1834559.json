     "AB": "The present study was performed in order to follow the response of astroglial cells in the rat hippocampus to chronic low-level lead exposure. The experiments combined immunohistochemistry using anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody and conventional transmission electron microscopy (EM). Chronic administration with drinking water [1 g% w/v (subclinical dose) of lead acetate dissolved in distilled water] was started through the mother's milk when pups were 7 days old. Following weaning, experimental offspring were treated for 3 months with the same concentration of adulterated water. The group of intoxicated animals and their controls were sacrificed by perfusion-fixation at 30, 60, and 90 days of exposure. After 60 days of lead treatment, staining of GFAP-positive cells demonstrated an astroglial transformation from the quiescent to the reactive state, characterized by an increase in GFAP. In control rats no changes in GFAP immunostaining were observed. The intensity of the astroglial response was enhanced after 90 days of lead intoxication, showing an increment of GFAP immunoreactivity. Quantification of these changes was made by computerized image analysis, confirming that the sectional areas of the astroglia in lead-exposed animals were larger than those in controls. These results are consistent with the ultrastructural alterations. Simultaneously with the increment in gliofilaments, intranuclear inclusions were seen in some astrocytes. The mechanisms by which lead affects astrocytes are unknown. Probably the astroglial changes induced by lead intoxication produce microenvironmental modifications that may disturb the neuronal function.",
