     "AB": "The binding of D-[3H]aspartic acid to the high-affinity glutamate uptake system was studied in membrane preparations of postmortem brains from controls and Huntington's disease (HD) subjects. The groups were matched for age and postmortem delay. A large (60-72%) and significant reduction in D-[3H]aspartate binding was observed in both the caudate nucleus and putamen, but not in the frontal cortex of the HD brains. The loss of striatal D-[3H]aspartate binding may reflect a loss of the high-affinity glutamate uptake system contained on the terminals of corticostriatal afferents. In contrast, the binding of [3H]paroxetine to the serotonin uptake system was marginally increased in the caudate nucleus and unchanged in the putamen. It is suggested that the reduction of high-affinity glutamate uptake sites may contribute to the production of the striatal lesion in HD.",
