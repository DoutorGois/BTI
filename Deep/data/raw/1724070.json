     "AB": "The effects of acute treatment with 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-aminoacridine (THA), a 4-aminopyridine derivative clinically effective in Alzheimer's disease, on beta-adrenoceptor-linked cyclic AMP accumulation have been investigated in cortical and hippocampal structures of young and middle-aged rats. In a first series of experiments, pretreatment with 2.5 mg/kg THA decreased basal cyclic AMP accumulation. When a phosphodiesterase inhibitor was added to the preparation, THA again decreased cyclic AMP levels in young rats, but failed to significantly modify cyclic AMP accumulation in middle-aged animals. Finally, in isoprenaline-stimulated conditions, acute treatment with tacrine was able to diminish cyclic AMP accumulation in every group of rats. It is suggested that the neurochemical action of THA in mammalian brain is more complex than earlier has been anticipated and may involve an action on beta-adrenoceptors.",
