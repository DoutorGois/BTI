     "AB": "We investigated the effect of exposure to nanoparticle-rich diesel exhaust (NRDE) on hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory function-related gene expressions in female mice. Female BALB/c mice were exposed to clean air, middle-dose NRDE (M-NRDE), high-dose NRDE (H-NRDE) or filtered diesel exhaust (F-DE) for three months. A Morris water maze apparatus was used to examine spatial learning. The expression levels of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit, proinflammatory cytokines and neurotrophin mRNAs in the hippocampus were then investigated using real-time RT-PCR. Mice exposed to H-NRDE required a longer time to reach the hidden platform and showed higher mRNA expression levels of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2A, the proinflammatory cytokine CCL3, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, compared with the findings in the control group. These results indicate that three months of exposure to NRDE affected spatial learning and memory function-related gene expressions in the female mouse hippocampus.",
