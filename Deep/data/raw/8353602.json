     "AB": "There is some controversy about the role of long-term potentiation (LTP) in spatial learning. The authors have found that triggering generalized kindled seizures with stimulation of the perforant path disrupts spatial learning in the Morris water maze but that kindling per se does not affect spatial learning. It is suggested that abnormal electrical activity induced by high-frequency stimulation of the perforant path may have been responsible for the disruption of spatial learning previously attributed to LTP saturation.",
