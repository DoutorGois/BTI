     "AB": "The disabling seizures associated with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) are often resistant to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The biological basis of this refractoriness is unknown but may include alterations in AED targets in the epileptogenic brain tissue, reduced AED penetration to the seizure focus, and neuropathological brain alterations such as hippocampal sclerosis typically found in patients with refractory TLE. In the present study, we used a rat model of TLE to examine whether AED responders differ from non-responders in their structural alterations and GABA(A) receptor characteristics in the hippocampal formation. In this model, spontaneous recurrent seizures develop after a status epilepticus induced by prolonged electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala. The frequency of these seizures was recorded by continuous video/EEG monitoring before, during, and after daily treatment with phenobarbital, which was given at maximum tolerated doses for 2 weeks. Based on their individual response to phenobarbital, rats were grouped into responders and non-responders. The severity or duration of the initial brain insult (the status epilepticus) did not differ between responders and non-responders, indicating that the difference between the two subgroups is genetically determined. Subsequent histological examination showed a significant loss of neurons in the CA1, CA3c/CA4, and dentate hilus of non-responders, whereas responders did not differ in this respect from non-epileptic controls. The morphological alterations in the non-responders were associated with striking alterations in autoradiographic imaging of diazepam-sensitive and diazepam-insensitive GABA(A) receptor binding in the dentate gyrus with a significant shift to enhanced diazepam-insensitive binding. The present data indicate that neurodegeneration and associated GABA(A) receptor changes in the dentate gyrus are critically involved in the mechanisms underlying refractoriness of seizures in TLE.",
