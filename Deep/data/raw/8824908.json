     "AB": "Tissues from male Wistar rats, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin, were studied with immunoperoxidase techniques using polyclonal antibodies raised against aldehyde oxidase or xanthine oxidase purified from rat liver. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that aldehyde oxidase-bearing cells were strongly stained in renal tubules, esophageal, gastric, intestinal and bronchial epithelium as well as liver cytoplasm. Weak but positive immunoreactivity was observed on the pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells, gastric glands and intestinal goblet cells. In contrast, it was demonstrated that cells with xanthine oxidase were strongly stained in renal tubules, esophageal, gastric, and small and large intestinal and bronchial epithelia etc. Positive immunostaining was also found in adrenal gland, skeletal muscle, spleen and cerebral hippocampus. Immunoreactivity againt aldehyde oxidase was not found in adrenal gland, spleen, mesentery or aorta, while immunoreactivity against xanthine oxidase was not found in mesentery or aorta. Although the significance of this ubiquitous and similar localization of aldehyde and xanthine oxidase seems unclear at present, these results may provide a clue as to the full understanding of the pathophysiological role of these oxidases in tissues.",
