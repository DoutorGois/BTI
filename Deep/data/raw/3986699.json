     "AB": "Hippocampal calcium and zinc content was determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry in control and commissural-kindled rats. In animals exhibiting 5-10 consecutive motor seizures hippocampal calcium was slightly elevated (356.7 parts per million (ppm), dry weight) but not significantly different from controls (329.8 ppm), whereas the amount of zinc was significantly higher (101.6 ppm) than in nonstimulated animals (88.3 ppm). These results are indicative of certain pathophysiological changes in kindled hippocampi, most likely localized to the granule cells of the dentate gyrus where the bulk of hippocampal zinc is confined.",
