Immunoreactivity is restricted to astrocytes and has a layer-specific distribution: The highest levels are observed in the outer molecular layer of the fascia dentata, in the pyramidal cell layer and in the upper stratum oriens. The stratum radiatum displays particularly low immunoreaction. A conspicuous drop in immunoreactivity from the heavily stained outer molecular layer to its inner portion is marked by a clear-cut dividing line. The layer-specific staining pattern found corresponds to the laminated distribution of glutamate binding sites described by others.",
