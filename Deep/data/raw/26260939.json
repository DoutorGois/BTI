     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The substantive basis of the Reasoning Test Battery (BPR) is the theory of the hierarchical organization of cognitive abilities and therefore, it combines a general cognitive factor and specific factors associated with abstract, numerical, verbal, practical, spatial and mechanical reasoning. The battery has three forms, covering an age range from 9 to 22 years. METHOD: The present study analyzes the internal structure of the Basque version of the battery using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Factorial invariance studies across gender were performed and partial differences observed were analyzed in a sample of 1,923 students. RESULT: The results concluded: (a) the presence of one general reasoning factor in each of the forms, (b) partial scalar invariance across gender affecting mechanical reasoning and numerical reasoning, (c) no differences in the general reasoning factor, and (d) negligible observed differences in partial scales. CONCLUSIONS: Tests for measurement invariance indicate differences in factor intercepts, cautioning that comparisons of observed g scores across gender are not appropriate.",
