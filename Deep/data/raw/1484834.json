     "AB": "Transient (5-min) global forebrain ischemia, induced by four- vessel occlusion, was assessed using a multiple fixed-ratio, fixed-interval schedule of food presentation in five rats. Under control conditions, the schedule produced distinctive response rates in each schedule component. Initially, ischemia disrupted responding under both schedule components, and to approximately the same degree. In general, total session responses returned to pre-occlusion levels during the course of 45 post-occlusion days, however, response rates under the fixed-interval component showed slightly less recovery than those under the fixed-ratio component. Histological assessment revealed considerable variability in hippocampal damage between rats. Severe damage in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 formations was observed in a single rat, and that rat also showed the greatest degree of response disruption. These results suggest that schedule-controlled responding may be a valuable method for assessing the effects of ischemic injury, and thus, putative neuroprotective compounds, on complex behavior.",
