     "AB": "Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was suggested as a potential neuroprotective treatment for traumatic brain injury (TBI) induced damage (cognitive as well as cellular). The main goal of the present study was to evaluate the role of the IGF-1R activation in spatial memory outcome following mild traumatic brain injury. mTBI-induced phosphorylation of IGF-1R, AKT and ERK1/2, in mice hippocampus, which was inhibited when mice were pretreated with the selective IGF-1R inhibitor AG1024. IGF-1 administration prevented spatial memory deficits following mTBI. Surprisingly, blocking the IGF-1R signaling in mTBI mice did not augment the spatial memory deficit. In addition, this data imply an intriguing and complex role of the IGF-1 signaling axis in the cellular and behavioral events following mTBI.",
