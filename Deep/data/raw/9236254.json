     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) is considered to be a model for learning processes; however, standard HFS protocols consisting of long trains of HFS are very different from the patterns of spike firing in freely behaving animals. We have investigated the ability of brief bursts of HFS triggered at different phases of background theta rhythm to mimic more natural activity patterns. We show that a single burst of five pulses at 200 Hz given on the positive phase of tail pinch-triggered theta rhythm reliably induced LTP in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampus of urethane-anesthetized rats. Three of these bursts saturated LTP, and 10 bursts occluded the induction of LTP by long trains of HFS. Burst stimulation on the negative phase or at zero phase of theta did not induce LTP or long-term depression. In addition, stimulation with 10 bursts on the negative phase of theta reversed previously established LTP. The results show that the phase of sensory-evoked theta rhythm powerfully regulates the ability of brief HFS bursts to elicit either LTP or depotentiation of synaptic transmission. Furthermore, because complex spike activity of approximately five pulses on the positive phase of theta rhythm can be observed in freely moving rats, LTP induced by the present theta-triggered stimulation protocol might model putative synaptic plastic changes during learning more closely than standard HFS-induced LTP.",
