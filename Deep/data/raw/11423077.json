     "AB": "In both nuclear and cytosolic fractions of murine hippocampus, constitutive expression was seen with Fra-2 protein, but not with other Fos family members tested including c-Fos, Fos-B and Fra-1 proteins. Fos-B protein was only detected in nuclear fractions. The systemic administration of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) induced marked and transient expression of c-Fos protein, but not other family members, in both hippocampal fractions 2 h later. In vitro incubation at 30 degrees C led to more rapid degradation of inducible c-Fos protein than constitutive Fra-2 protein in nuclear fractions obtained 2 h after the administration of NMDA, without significantly affecting that of both member proteins in cytosolic fractions. The addition of phosphatase inhibitors significantly delayed the initial degradation rate of inducible c-Fos protein, with concomitant facilitation of that of constitutive Fra-2 protein, in nuclear fractions. The addition of protease inhibitors also delayed the initial degradation of constitutive Fra-2 protein, without markedly altering that of inducible c-Fos protein, in nuclear fractions. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that NMDA induced phosphorylation of c-Fos protein on tyrosine residues in nuclear fractions to a lesser extent than that on serine residues 2 h after administration. These results suggest that NMDA signals may be propagated to the nucleus to induce both expression and degradation of c-Fos protein through a molecular mechanism associated with phosphorylation on serine and/or tyrosine residues in murine hippocampus.",
