     "AB": "Intracranial pressure (ICP) is a major neurological parameter in animals and humans. ICP is a function of the relationship between the contents of the cranium (brain parenchyma, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood) and the volume of the skull. Increased ICP can cause serious physiological effects or even death in patients who do not quickly receive proper care, which includes ICP monitoring. Epilepsies are a set of central nervous system disorders resulting from abnormal and excessive neuronal discharges, usually associated with hypersynchronism and/or hyperexcitability. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of epilepsy and is also refractory to medication. ICP characteristics of subjects with epilepsy have not been elucidated because there are few studies associating these two important neurological factors. In this work, an invasive (ICPi) and the new minimally invasive (ICPmi) methods were used to evaluate ICP features in rats with chronic epilepsy, induced by the experimental model of pilocarpine, capable of generating the main features of human TLE in these animals.",
