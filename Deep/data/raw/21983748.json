     "AB": "The recently described therapeutic benefits of the hemodialysate actovegin on neuropathic symptoms in diabetic patients with symptomatic polyneuropathy suggest a neuroprotective activity of the drug. To elucidate the possible cellular mechanism of the pharmacological effects of actovegin, we investigated its effects on cultured primary rat neurons in vitro. Primary neurons were cultured for up to 10 days in the presence of increasing doses of actovegin (0.3-1,000 mg/l). Total cell number, dendrite length and the number of excitatory synapses, i.e., the amount of the synaptic V-Glut1 protein, were measured by immunocytochemistry followed by fluorescence microscopy. The apoptotic level in neurons after induction of apoptosis by amyloid peptide Abeta(25-35) was assessed by the level of activated caspase-3. In addition, the capability of the neurons to diminish oxidative stress was assessed by measuring the cellular level of reactive oxygen species ROS in the presence of actovegin. Actovegin treatment yielded an increased maintenance of neuronal cells and total number of synapses and could lower the level of activated caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner. Dendrite lengths were not significantly affected. In addition, actovegin reduced the cellular level of ROS in cultured neurons. The cellular effects observed suggest neuroprotective and anti-oxidative effects of the drug Actovegin((R)), which could at least partially explain its therapeutic benefits.",
