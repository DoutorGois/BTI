     "AB": "Middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in halothane-anesthetized rats induced c-fos, junB, and c-jun immediate early gene mRNAs and hsp70 heat shock gene mRNA in brain. In situ hybridization studies showed that c-fos and junB were induced throughout all of the cortex at 1 and 4 h following MCA occlusion. hsp70 was induced in the core and margins of the MCA ischemia. By 24 h, there was little expression of c-fos, junB, c-jun, and hsp70 in the core of the MCA infarct; there was modest induction of hsp70 at the margins of the infarct; and there was diffuse induction of c-fos, junB, and c-jun in all of the cortex outside the infarct. MCA occlusion also induced these genes in subcortical structures. c-fos, junB, and hsp70 were induced in ipsilateral medial striatum, most of thalamus including medial and lateral geniculate nuclei, substantia nigra, and hippocampus. Most of these structures, except for the striatum, are not supplied by the MCA. These data show that changes in gene expression can occur in regions remote from an infarction.",
