     "PG": "27971-80",
     "AB": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a major constituent of the neuritic plaque found in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients, and a great deal of evidence suggests that the neuronal loss that is associated with the disease is a consequence of the actions of Abeta. In the past few years, it has become apparent that activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mediates some of the effects of Abeta on cultured cells; in particular, the evidence suggests that Abeta-triggered JNK activation leads to cell death. In this study, we investigated the effect of intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta(1-40) on signaling events in the hippocampus and on long term potentiation in Schaffer collateral CA1 pyramidal cell synapses in vivo. We report that Abeta(1-40) induced activation of JNK in CA1 and that this was coupled with expression of the proapoptotic protein, Bax, cytosolic cytochrome c, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and Fas ligand expression in the hippocampus. These data indicate that Abeta(1-40) inhibited expression of long term potentiation, and this effect was abrogated by administration of the JNK inhibitor peptide, D-JNKI1. In parallel with these findings, we observed that Abeta-induced changes in caspase-3 activation and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining in neuronal cultured cells were inhibited by D-JNKI1. We present evidence suggesting that interleukin (IL)-1beta plays a significant role in mediating the effects of Abeta(1-40) because Abeta(1-40) increased hippocampal IL-1beta and because several effects of Abeta(1-40) were inhibited by the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CMK. On the basis of our findings, we propose that Abeta-induced changes in hippocampal plasticity are likely to be dependent upon IL-1beta-triggered activation of JNK.",
