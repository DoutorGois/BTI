     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Conflicting information exists concerning the actions of ethanol on vesicular release at excitatory synapses. Because long-term alterations in synaptic transmission are thought to underlie neuroadaptive responses to ethanol, we have directly measured the actions of ethanol on release dynamics at an intact central synapse. METHODS: Here we investigated the effects of ethanol on release dynamics in hippocampal slices using confocal microscopy with the lipophilic dye, FM1-43, complemented by a patch clamp analysis of AMPA miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). After a pretreatment/loading paradigm with sulforhodamine (S-Rhd) and FM1-43, stable, dense punctate FM1-43 staining in the CA1 stratum radiatum was evident. RESULTS: FM1-43 fluorescence destaining was dose-dependently induced by perfusion with elevated K+ (20-60 mM). Cadmium inhibited K+-induced destaining, whereas nifedipine had no significant effect. Ethanol (25-75 mM) inhibited K+-induced destaining with high efficacy and had no effect on basal destaining. Both omega-Conotoxin GVIA and omega-Agatoxin IVA inhibited K+-induced destaining with high efficacy. The combination of omega-Conotoxin GVIA and omega-Agatoxin IVA occluded the inhibitory effect of ethanol, indicating that ethanol inhibition of release was dependent on inhibition of N/P/Q-voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Patch clamp studies of AMPA mEPSCs revealed similar findings in that vesicular release was enhanced with K+ depolarization in an ethanol-sensitive manner. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the FM1-43/S-Rhd method is a stable and powerful approach for direct real-time measurement of vesicular release kinetics in intact brain slice preparations and that ethanol inhibits vesicular release induced by depolarization via inhibition of N/P/Q-VGCCs.",
