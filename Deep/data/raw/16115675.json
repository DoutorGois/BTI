     "AB": "After injury, regenerating axons must navigate complex, three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments. Topographic guidance of neurite outgrowth has been demonstrated in vitro with culture substrates that contain micropatterned features on the nanometer-micron scale. In this study we report the ability of microfabricated biomaterials to support neurite extension across micropatterned grooves with feature sizes on the order of tens of microns, sizes relevant to the design of biomaterials and tissue engineering scaffolds. Neonatal rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were cultured on grooved substrates of poly(dimethyl siloxane) coated with poly-L-lysine and laminin. Here we describe an unusual capability of a subpopulation of DRG neurons to extend neurites that spanned across the grooves, with no underlying solid support. Multiple parameters influenced the formation of bridging neurites, with the highest numbers of bridges observed under the following experimental conditions: cell density of 125,000 cells per sample, groove depth of 50 microm, groove width of 30 microm, and plateau width of 200 microm. Bridges were formed as neurites extended from a neuron in a groove, contacted adjacent plateaus, pulled the neuron up to become suspended over the groove, and the soma translocated to the plateau. These studies are of interest to understanding cytoskeletal dynamics and designing biomaterials for 3D axon guidance.",
