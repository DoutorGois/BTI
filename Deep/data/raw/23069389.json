     "AB": "Overactivation of glutamate receptors contributes to neuronal damage (excitotoxicity) in ischemic stroke but the detailed mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Brain ischemia is also characterized by an impairment of the activity of the proteasome, one of the major proteolytic systems in neurons. We found that excitotoxic stimulation with glutamate rapidly decreases ATP levels and the proteasome activity, and induces the disassembly of the 26S proteasome in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Downregulation of the proteasome activity, leading to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, was mediated by calcium entry through NMDA receptors and was only observed in the nuclear fraction. Furthermore, excitotoxicity-induced proteasome inhibition was partially sensitive to cathepsin-L inhibition and was specifically induced by activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. Oxygen and glucose deprivation induced neuronal death and downregulated the activity of the proteasome by a mechanism dependent on the activation of NMDA receptors. Since deubiquitinating enzymes may regulate proteins half-life by counteracting ubiquitination, we also analyzed how their activity is regulated under excitotoxic conditions. Glutamate stimulation decreased the total deubiquitinase activity in hippocampal neurons, but was without effect on the activity of Uch-L1, showing that not all deubiquitinases are affected. These results indicate that excitotoxic stimulation with glutamate has multiple effects on the ubiquitin-proteasome system which may contribute to the demise process in brain ischemia and in other neurological disorders.",
