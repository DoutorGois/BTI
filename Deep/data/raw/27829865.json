     "AB": "Objectives. To explore the alterations of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) in APP/PS1 mice after electroacupuncture (EA) treatment and further to explore the mechanism. Methods. Forty 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into a model group and an EA group, with twenty wild-type mice used as a normal control group. Mice in the EA group were treated with EA at GV 20 (bai hui) and bilateral KI 1 (yong quan) acupoints for 6 weeks. The Morris water maze was applied to assess the spatial memory in behavior. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), ELISA, Western blotting, and so forth were used to observe the expression of LRP1 and Abeta. Results. The Morris water maze test showed that, compared with the normal control group, the model group's learning and memory capabilities were significantly decreased (P < 0.05; P < 0.01). The EA group was reversed (P < 0.05; P < 0.01). The hippocampal expression of Abeta in the EA group was significantly decreased compared to the model group (P < 0.01). The expression of LRP1 in the model group was significantly lower than that in the normal control group (P < 0.01); the expression in the EA group was significantly higher than that in the model group (P < 0.01). Conclusions. EA therapy can improve the learning and memory capabilities of APP/PS1 mice. The underlying mechanism may lie in the upregulation of an Abeta transport receptor and LRP1.",
