     "AB": "As evidenced by their ability to reduce cerebral edema, exogenous ganglioside administration exerts acute effects on CNS injury processes. We report here that ganglioside (GM1 or AGF2) treatment results in a 52% decrease in mortality 48 hours after the induction of ischemia in gerbils by permanent unilateral ligation of the common carotid artery. By comparing the occluded vs. nonoccluded sides of the brain (cortex and hippocampus) we found a significant loss of membrane Na, K-ATPase activity due to ischemia in control animals, but no such differences were found between the hemispheres of ganglioside-treated gerbils. We hypothesize that gangliosides may be \"protecting\" membrane function as indicated by these ATPase analyses, reducing local CNS damage at the time of injury (i.e., reduced cell loss, fiber degeneration, membrane failure). By acutely limiting the extent of CNS tissue damage, conditions may be optimized for any subsequent CNS regrowth and functional recovery.",
