     "AB": "3H-Dihydromorphine (DHM) binding sites were measured in the brain of non-epileptic control and GEPR rats using in vitro autoradiographic techniques. The number of naloxone-sensitive 3H-DHM binding sites was increased 38-57% in the pyramidal cell layer of ventral hippocampal CA3 and Ca1 of GEPR-3 and GEPR-9 rats compared to non-epileptic controls. No significant differences in 3H-DHM binding were observed in dorsal hippocampal formation, lateral entorhinal cortex, lateral geniculate or cerebellum. The results suggest that an increase in the number of opioid receptors in ventral hippocampus of GEPR rats may be one factor contributing to the enhanced sensitivity of GEPR-9 rats to the proconvulsant effects of morphine.",
