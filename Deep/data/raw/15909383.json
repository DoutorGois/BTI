     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the degree of injury and phase of push-pull effect induced by different degrees of push-pull maneuver on hippocampus neurons in rats. METHOD: Injury of push-pull maneuver on hippocampus neurons in rats after different degrees of push-pull maneuver were determined by general evaluation of animal model, pathologic examination and electronic microscopy. RESULT: 1) General evaluation of animal model: the apoplexy index and the pathological grading increased with the increase of intensity of the push-pull maneuver. 2) Routine HE: No abnormity was found in appearance and distribution of hippocampus neurons in the control rats and various groups of +/-2 Gz exposures, and 30 min groups of +/-6 Gz, +/-8 Gz exposures, but denatured necrosis of neurons were found in 6 h and 24 h groups of +/-6 Gz, +/-8 Gz exposures. 3) Examination of ultrastructure under electronic microscope: No significant change were found in hippocampus neurons of CA1 area in 30 min and 24 h after +/-2 Gz exposures as compared with the normal control group. But various degrees of denatured necrosis of neurons were found in some of the hippocampus neurons of CA1 area in 6 h after +/-2 Gz exposures, 6 h and 24 h after +/-6 Gz and +/-8 Gz exposures. CONCLUSION: +/-6 Gz and +/-8 Gz exposures may cause injury of hippocampus tissues and it is most severe at 6 h after the +/-8 Gz exposures.",
