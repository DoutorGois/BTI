     "AB": "The influence of hippocampal target cells on the septohippocampal cholinergic system was studied using immunocytochemical and autoradiographic procedures. The destruction of dentate granular cells by colchicine injection promotes a significant increase in the density of acetylcholinesterase staining and cholinergic-muscarinic receptors in the zone denervated by the terminal axons of granular cells, which supports the hypothesis of a proliferation of cholinergic fibers in CA3. In the septal region the number of choline acetyl transferase positive cells was significantly lower (by 23%) ipsilaterally to the colchicine injection as compared to the contralateral side; when the hippocampus is almost completely destroyed by colchicine treatment this cell loss is more important (by over 50%). The present results agree with those of earlier studies and suggest that target-derived trophic factors are important for the maintenance of the basal forebrain cholinergic system and that the fascia dentata provides a significant source of such factors.",
