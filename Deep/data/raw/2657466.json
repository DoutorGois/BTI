     "AB": "The performances of aged (24-26 months) rats in two behavioral tasks (passive avoidance and spontaneous alternation) have been studied. Subpopulations of old animals were found to be impaired in these tasks. Most of the impaired animals, however, were not impaired in both tasks. The properties of the septo-hippocampal neurons (SHNs) were subsequently studied in the same group of experimental animals, anesthetized with urethane, using electrophysiological techniques. The spontaneous activity of SHNs displaying a rhythmically bursting activity (RBA) was significantly higher in animals impaired in the spontaneous alternation task. The proportion of SHNs with RBA was significantly lower and the frequency of the RBA was higher in animals impaired in the passive avoidance task. The pharmacological properties of the SHNs were not significantly different in the various groups. The significance of these complex correlations with regard to the age-related alterations of SHNs properties is discussed.",
