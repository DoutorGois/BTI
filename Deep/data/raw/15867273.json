     "AB": "We demonstrated previously that a dietary-induced depletion of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in cerebral phospholipids increases the spontaneous release of acetylcholine (Ach) in the rat hippocampus and reduces its potassium chloride evoked-release. In the present study, we investigated the effects in rats of DHA-enriched diets supplied by egg phospholipids (E-PL) or tuna oil (TO) on the PUFA in hippocampus membranes and on the synaptic release of Ach. Control rats were fed 3 g/kg of the DHA precursor, alpha-linolenic acid (LNA). Chronically (n-3) PUFA-deficient females were fed, starting 2 wk before mating, the deficient diet, a control diet, or a purified diet supplying 1, 2, or 3 g DHA/kg diet as E-PL or TO. Experiments were performed on the adult male progeny fed the same diet as their dams throughout life. The form of dietary DHA (TO or E-PL) did not influence its incorporation into the hippocampus. The 1 g DHA/kg diets allowed maximal incorporation into phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), but 2 g DHA/kg diet was needed for phosphatidylcholine (PC). A minimum of 2 g DHA/kg was needed to decrease the basal Ach release and to enhance the stimulated release to that of the control; the Ach release of the 1 g/kg DHA-groups did not differ from that of the deficient group. This suggests that >1 g DHA/kg diet is needed to ensure PUFA incorporation into PE and PC, and basal and stimulated Ach release in the rat hippocampus equivalent to the control group fed only LNA. PUFA incorporation into the hippocampus depends mainly on the PUFA concentration of the diet, not on the form of dietary DHA.",
