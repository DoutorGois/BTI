     "AB": "beta-Adrenoceptor binding sites were characterised and quantitated in post-mortem human brain with [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) and [3H]CGP 12177. In cerebral cortex, isoprenaline and propranolol displaced both radioligands with uniform affinity. Practolol and CGP 20712A (selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists) displaced with high affinity from a greater proportion of sites than ICI 118,551 and IPS 339 (selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists). In cerebellum, propranolol displaced both radioligands with uniform affinity. ICI 118,551 displaced with high affinity from a greater proportion of sites than CGP 20712A. The density of total beta-adrenoceptors (defined with isoprenaline) and of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors (defined with CGP 20712A and ICI 118,551 respectively) was studied by saturation binding of both radioligands in 13 brain areas. beta-Adrenoceptor density was higher in caudate, putamen and nucleus accumbens (100-120 fmol/mg protein) than cortex (50-70 fmol/mg protein) and densities were lowest in hypothalamus and cerebellum (27-38 fmol/mg protein). The proportion of beta 1-adrenoceptors (as a % of total beta-adrenoceptors) was high in caudate (80%), putamen (80%) and cortex (60-70%) and lower in hippocampus (40%) and cerebellum (30%). Both radioligands labelled a very similar number of beta-adrenoceptors in all brain regions studied.",
