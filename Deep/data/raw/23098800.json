     "AB": "Interactions between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are of major interest in the neurobiology of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and are central to many experimental rodent models. Non-invasive imaging techniques offer a translatable approach to probing this system if homologous features can be identified across species. The objective of the present study was to systematically characterize the rat brain connectivity signature derived from low-frequency resting blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) oscillations associated with and within the hippocampal-prefrontal network, using an array of small seed locations within the relatively large anatomical structures comprising this system. A heterogeneous structure of functional connectivity, both between and within the hippocampal-prefrontal brain structures, was observed. In the hippocampal formation, the posterior (subiculum) region correlated more strongly than the anterior dorsal hippocampus with the PFC. A homologous relationship was found in the human hippocampus, with differential functional connectivity between hippocampal locations proximal to the fornix body relative to locations more distal being localized to the medial prefrontal regions in both species. The orbitofrontal cortex correlated more strongly with sensory cortices and a heterogeneous dependence of functional coupling on seed location was observed along the midline cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. These findings are all convergent with known anatomical connectivity, with stronger BOLD correlations corresponding to known monosynaptic connections. These functional connectivity relationships may provide a useful translatable probe of the hippocampal-prefrontal system for the further study of rodent models of disease and potential treatments, and inform electrode placement in electrophysiology to yield more precise descriptors of the circuits at risk in psychiatric disease.",
