     "AB": "Maximal individual [3H]corticosterone binding capacity in the hippocampus was lower in C57BL/6 mice than in BALB/c mice, and positively correlated with active avoidance learning in the two strains. Moreover, a parallel difference in the activity of hypothalamo-pituitary adrenocortical axis (HPAA) was found, consisting in a level of plasma corticosterone in C57BL/6 higher than in BALB/c mice. These results confirm the genetically determined differences in behavior of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, and demonstrate their association with differences in hippocampal corticosterone binding capacity, pointing to a functional relationship between the behavioral and neuroendocrine parameters.",
