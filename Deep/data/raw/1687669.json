     "AB": "Previous studies have demonstrated that microdialysis is capable of detecting an abrupt and massive increase in extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]e) and a concomitant increase in extracellular concentration of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) during cerebral ischemia in the rat hippocampus in vivo. Following in situ administration of kynurenic acid (KYN), a broad-spectrum antagonist of EAAs, through the dialysis probe (5-10 mM), a delay in reaching the maximum level of increased [K+]e was observed in a dose-dependent manner. The initial component of the rapid increase in [K+]e appears to be mediated by EAAs released from nerve terminals.",
