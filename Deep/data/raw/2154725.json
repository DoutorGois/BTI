     "AB": "The effects of 7-chlorokynurenate (7-C1KY) were examined on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated synaptic mechanisms in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. 7-C1KY depressed both the NMDA receptor-mediated component of synaptic transmission recorded in Mg2(+)-free medium and the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in Mg2(+)-containing medium. Both of these effects were reversed by D-serine, suggesting that the action of 7-C1KY was at the allosteric glycine site on the NMDA receptor.",
