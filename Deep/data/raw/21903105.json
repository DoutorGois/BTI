     "AB": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting about 1% of the population older than 60 years. Classically, PD is considered as a movement disorder, and its diagnosis is based on the presence of a set of cardinal motor signs that are the consequence of a pronounced death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. There is now considerable evidence showing that the neurodegenerative processes leading to sporadic PD begin many years before the appearance of the characteristic motor symptoms, and that additional neuronal fields and neurotransmitter systems are also involved in PD, including olfactory structures, amygdala, caudal raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus, and hippocampus. Accordingly, adrenergic and serotonergic neurons are also lost, which seems to contribute to the anxiety in PD. Non-motor features of PD usually do not respond to dopaminergic medication and probably form the major current challenge in the clinical management of PD. Additionally, most studies performed with animal models of PD have investigated their ability to induce motor alterations associated with advanced phases of PD, and some studies begin to assess non-motor behavioral features of the disease. The present review attempts to examine results obtained from clinical and experimental studies to provide a comprehensive picture of the neurobiology and current and potential treatments for anxiety in PD. The data reviewed here indicate that, despite their high prevalence and impact on the quality of life, anxiety disorders are often under-diagnosed and under-treated in PD patients. Moreover, there are currently few clinical and pre-clinical studies underway to investigate new pharmacological agents for relieving these symptoms, and we hope that this article may inspire clinicians and researchers devote to the studies on anxiety in PD to change this scenario. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Anxiety and Depression'.",
