     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, increasing evidence suggests that intracellular beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) alone plays a pivotal role in the progression of AD. Therefore, understanding the signaling pathway and proteins that control Abeta internalization may provide new insight for regulating Abeta levels. In the present study, the regulation of Abeta internalization by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) through low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) was analyzed in vivo. The data derived from this investigation revealed that Abeta1-42 were internalized by neurons and astrocytes in mouse brain, and were largely deposited in mitochondria and lysosomes, with some also being found in the endoplasmic reticulum. Abeta1-42-LRP1 complex was formed during Abeta1-42 internalization, and the p38 MAPK signaling pathway was activated by Abeta1-42 via LRP1. Abeta1-42 and LRP1 were co- localized in the cells of parietal cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, the level of LRP1-mRNA and LRP1 protein involved in Abeta1-42 internalization in mouse brain. The results of this investigation demonstrated that Abeta1-42 induced an LRP1-dependent pathway that related to the activation of p38 MAPK resulting in internalization of Abeta1-42. These results provide evidence supporting a key role for the p38 MAPK signaling pathway which is involved in the regulation of Abeta1-42 internalization in the parietal cortex and hippocampus of mouse through LRP1 in vivo.",
