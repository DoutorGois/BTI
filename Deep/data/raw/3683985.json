     "AB": "The effect of hippocampal kindling on the levels of prodynorphin mRNA in rat hippocampus was examined by in situ hybridization using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe. Cryostat tissue sections were hybridised with a 32P-labelled 100 mer DNA probe complementary to the coding region of rat prodynorphin mRNA, and exposed to X-ray film. In rats exhibiting stage 4 seizures, the levels of prodynorphin mRNA in the dentate gyrus were dramatically reduced compared to control animals. This suggests that the development of kindling is accompanied by a reduction in the rate of synthesis of peptides derived from prodynorphin.",
