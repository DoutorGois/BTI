     "AB": "Background: Recent emergence of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating gene expression and thereby modulating physiological functions in brain has manifested their possible role in psychiatric disorders. In this study, the roles of lncRNAs in susceptibility and resiliency to develop stress-induced depression and their response to antidepressant treatment were examined. Methods: Microarray based transcriptome-wide changes in lncRNAs was determined in hippocampus of male Holtzman rats who showed susceptibility (learned helpless; LH) or resiliency (non-learned helpless; NLH) to develop depression. Changes in lncRNA expression were also ascertained after sub-chronic administration of fluoxetine to LH rats. Bioinformatic and target prediction analyses (cis- and trans-acting) and qPCR based assays were performed to decipher the functional role of altered lncRNAs. Results: Groups-wise comparison showed an overrepresented class of lncRNAs that were uniquely associated with NLH or LH behavior. Chromosomal mapping within the 5kbp flank region of the top 20 dysregulated lncRNAs in the LH group showed several target genes that were regulated through cis- or trans-actions, including Zbtb20 and Zfp385b from zinc finger binding protein family. Genomic context of differentially expressed lncRNAs showed an overall blunted response in LH group regardless of the lncRNA classes analyzed. Gene ontology exhibited the functional clustering for anatomical structure development, cellular architecture modulation, protein metabolism, and cellular communications. Fluoxetine treatment reversed LH-induced changes in a large number of lncRNAs and target genes. Conclusions: The involvement of specific classes of lncRNAs with distinctive roles in modulating target gene expression could confer the role of lncRNAs in resiliency or susceptibility to develop depression with a reciprocal response to antidepressant treatment.",
