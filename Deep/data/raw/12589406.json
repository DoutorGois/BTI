     "AB": "Using in situ hybridization and immuno-fluorescent double labeling method, we investigated the function of orphanin FQ on interlenkin-lbeta (IL-lbeta) transcripts in hippocampus. Intracerebroventricularly (icv) administrated IL-lbeta antibody reduced IL-l and TNF-alpha secreted from peritoneal macrophage. The high level of IL-lbeta transcript in hippocampus elicited by traumatic stress was blocked by icv injection of orphanin FQ (0.55 nmol), which was reversed by orphanin FQ receptor antagonist ([phe(1)Psi(CH(2)-NH)Gly(2)] nociceptin-(1-l3)-NH(2)). Opioid receptor-like receptor transcripts were found in neuron, astrocyte and microglia. Based on the results, we conclude that orphanin FQ functions as a neuroimmune modulator, and provokes immune response via mediation of IL-lbeta derived from neuron, astrocyte and microglia in hippocampus.",
