     "AB": "In the patch-clamp perforated whole-cell recording mode, tetrahydroberberine (THB), a novel dopamine (DA) receptor antagonist, inhibits not only DA-induced outward K+ currents, but also acetylcholine-, caffeine- or strychnine-induced outward current. However, THB does not affect either GABA- or glycine-induced Cl- currents, or non-NMDA receptor agonist-induced cation currents. As expected for a K+ channel blocker, THB evokes a downward current deflection accompanied by a decrease of conductance. It is concluded that the direct blockade of membrane K+ channels by THB underlies its inhibition of intracellular message-mediated outward currents.",
