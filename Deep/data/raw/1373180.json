     "AB": "Differential screening of a cDNA library prepared from mRNA of the hippocampus of estrogen-stimulated ovariectomized female rats led to the identification of a single estrogen-induced clone. Analysis of the sequence identified this cDNA as the gene coding for subunit III of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit III mRNA levels significantly increased as early as 3 h following the administration of a single dose of hormone. This effect was visible in the hippocampus and in the hypothalamus, but not in the other brain areas examined. Because subunit III of the cytochrome c oxidase is of mitochondrial origin, the mechanism involved in the estrogenic effect is still unknown. The observation that the activity of cytochrome c oxidase can also be induced by estrogens in the hippocampus indicates that this induction may be secondary to the increased expression of the other subunits of cytochrome c oxidase or to the general increase of neuronal activity.",
