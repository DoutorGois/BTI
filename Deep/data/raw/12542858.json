Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated significant and widespread deficits in alpha7* nicotinic cholinergic receptor (alpha7* nAChr) expression 2 days following cortical contusion brain injury. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in alpha7* nAChr expression over a wider range of post-TBI recovery intervals. Animals were anesthetized and subjected to a moderate cortical contusion brain injury (2 mm cortical compression). Animals were euthanatized at various post-TBI time intervals, ranging from 1 h to 21 days, and quantitative autoradiography was used to evaluate cholinergic receptor subtype expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. As previously reported, the alpha7* nAChr was the most sensitive target of TBI-induced plasticity. Significant decreases in alpha-[(125)I]-bungarotoxin (BTX) binding occurred as early as 1 h post-TBI, and persisted in some brain regions for up to 21 days. A kinetic analysis of changes in BTX binding, performed 2 days following brain injury, indicated that the binding deficits are not due to significant changes in receptor affinity. TBI-induced changes in alpha3*/alpha4* nACh receptors, muscarinic cholinergic receptors, and NMDA-type glutamate receptor expression were lower in magnitude, restricted to fewer brain regions and more transient in nature. Persistent deficits in alpha7* nAChr expression following TBI may contribute to impaired functional outcome following brain injury.",
