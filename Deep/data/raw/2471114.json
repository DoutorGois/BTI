     "AB": "Pressure ejection of serotonin (2 x 10(-4) M) onto dentate granule neurons in vitro produced a short-lasting membrane hyperpolarization associated with a 10-30% decrease in the input resistance. The hyperpolarization magnitude depended on the extracellular K+ concentration but not on the extra or intracellular Ca2+ concentration. It was followed by a depolarization, especially when serotonin was applied onto the perisomatic area of the neuron. The post-spike-train afterhyperpolarization, which represents a Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance, was decreased by serotonin by 10-100% and remained reduced for 2-10 min following the serotonin-induced hyperpolarization. Decreased adaptation of cell firing was also observed following serotonin application. Ca2+ action potentials evoked by intracellular depolarizing current pulses in the presence of the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin and the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium were followed by a large afterhyperpolarization, which was markedly reduced for several minutes following serotonin application. The preceding Ca2+ action potential was either unaffected or prolonged. The hyperpolarization occurring in response to localized application of serotonin, and the reduction of the afterhyperpolarization, may represent two different mechanisms of serotonin action, probably mediated by different mechanisms. The slow time course of the late depolarization and the afterhyperpolarization depression represent modulatory effects of serotonin on dentate granule neurons.",
