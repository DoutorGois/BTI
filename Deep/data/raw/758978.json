     "AB": "The selective neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine was used to deplete forebrain noradrenaline to less than 5% of control values and the learning capabilities of the depleted animals examined on a two-way active avoidance task. Noradrenaline depleted animals learned the two-way active avoidance task more quickly than controls and required fewer training trials to reach acquisition criterion. Twenty-four hour retention was not altered by the lesion, but significant resistance to extinction was seen when electric footshock was no longer presented. More detailed analysis of the improved acquisition shown by the lesioned animals revealed that the major effect lay in a reduced freezing response to footshock. This freezing tended to slow down learning in the control animals, since it was incompatible with the required two-way active avoidance response. No alteration was seen in sensory detection thresholds for electric footshock or in spontaneous locomotor activity in the absence of shock. These results are discussed in relation to theories of noradrenaline function in learning and memory and, more recently, in fear and anxiety.",
