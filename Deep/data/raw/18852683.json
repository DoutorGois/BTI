     "AB": "Pharmacological antagonism of the ionotropic purinergic P2X7R has been studied for effects on inflammatory reactivity and neuronal viability in amyloid-beta1-42-injected rat hippocampus. Amyloid-beta1-42-injected brains (7-day postinjection) demonstrated marked increases in P2X7R expression, gliosis, leakiness of blood-brain barrier and loss of hippocampal neurons. The P2X7R antagonist, brilliant blue G reduced levels of purinergic receptor expression, attenuated gliosis, diminished leakiness of blood-brain barrier and was neuroprotective in peptide-injected brain. Brilliant blue G also demonstrated neuroprotection and antagonism against inflammatory responses induced by the P2X7R agonist, 2',3'-(benzoyl-4-benzoyl)-ATP. The findings constitute the first report that pharmacological inhibition of P2X7R, possibly by acting to inhibit inflammatory reactivity, confers neuroprotection in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease brain.",
