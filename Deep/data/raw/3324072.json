     "AB": "The distribution of cholecystokinin immunoreactive (CCK-IR) nerve cell bodies and processes is reported in the human hippocampus by using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique of Sternberger. The CCK-immunoreactivity occurs in three major classes of interneurons: small (10-20 microns) horizontal multipolar neurons of the alveus and stratum oriens; small vertically oriented bipolar or multi-polar neurons in the stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale of Ammon's horn, layers II and III of the subicular system and the entorhinal area; large (20-35 microns) bipolar neurons in the hilus. Each region of the hippocampus is distinct in its CCK-IR nerve fibers content. Those fibers are particularly abundant around pyramidal cells of the CA2 and CA3 subfields of the Ammon's horn and around granular cells suggesting synaptic interaction between the CCK nerve terminals and glutamate neurons of these two regions. No CCK-IR fiber is detected in the fimbria and only a few number of CCK-IR beaded fibers are seen in the angular bundle. These anatomical data suggest that CCK interacts in the functional circuitry of the human hippocampus.",
