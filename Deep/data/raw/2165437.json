     "AB": "Microfluorometry with fura-2 was applied to study the action of the anticonvulsant (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. MK-801 caused a potent and long-lasting blockade of the NMDA-activated [Ca2+]i elevation in a selective manner, not affecting the [Ca2+]i rise induced by quisqualate or kainate. Blockade and recovery from the blockade by MK-801 showed use dependency; the degree of blockade was dependent on the presence of NMDA. The use-dependent onset of antagonism was, however, highly sensitive to the bath temperature. MK-801 applied in the absence of NMDA had no effect on the response to subsequent application of NMDA at 22 degrees C, whereas it reduced the subsequent response to NMDA significantly at 37 degrees C. MK-801 interacted with the receptor-ion channel complex even when Mg2+, which is considered to block the open channel, had already blocked the NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i. The recovery from blockade by MK-801 was not accelerated by the application of 10 mM Mg2+ for 5 min. These results suggest that MK-801 can gain access to its binding site in the absence of NMDA at physiological temperature, and that this binding site is distinct from that for Mg2+.",
