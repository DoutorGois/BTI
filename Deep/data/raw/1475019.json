     "AB": "The Fawn-Hooded strain of rats exhibits a hemorrhagic disorder, known as platelet storage pool deficiency. In addition to the platelet dysfunction, there is an altered response to certain serotonin drugs. To assess the characteristics of the binding to 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors in this strain, regions of the brain from Fawn-Hooded, Sprague-Dawley and Wistar male rats were examined. The drug [3H]8-OH-DPAT was used to label 5-HT1A receptors and the Kd values for frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem were similar in all three strains of rat. As with the 5-HT1A receptors, no differences were observed in the Kd values for 5-HT2 receptors, in any of the regions examined, among the three strains. However, the Bmax for the binding of [3H]8-OH-DPAT in the striatum and brainstem of Fawn-Hooded rats was less than in the Sprague-Dawley and Wistar animals. Furthermore, 5-HT2 receptors displayed a greater Bmax value in the striatum and in the frontal cortex of Fawn-Hooded animals, compared to Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats. These differences in receptors are consistent with previous studies in which Fawn-Hooded rats were found to have altered serotonergic function, relative to Wistar and Sprague-Dawley animals.",
