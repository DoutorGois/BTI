     "AB": "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has been used to study brain biochemistry in superfused brain slice preparations for over a decade. However, unlike techniques that monitor electrical activity, ion fluxes, or the release of radio-labeled compounds in single brain slices, MRS studies have required samples composed of several slices and inherently poor anatomical specificity in order to achieve adequate signal-to-noise levels, spectral resolution, or, in the case of 1H MRS, a high degree of artifact-free water signal suppression. We report that gradient-enhanced 1H MRS techniques combined with a simple slice positioning and perfusion technique yield high-quality spectra from single 400 microns rat forebrain or neocortical-hippocampal slices within 15 min of data acquisition time. Spectra of comparable quality were obtained from samples with three neocortical or three hippocampal slices within the same time frame. The assessment of anaerobic energy metabolism in single slices by 1H MRS is also demonstrated. In addition to greater anatomical resolution in studies on brain slice biochemistry, single slice MRS also presents the possibility of correlating, within the same slice, 1H MRS-detectable metabolite levels with other physiological measurements commonly performed on single brain slices.",
