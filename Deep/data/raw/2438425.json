     "AB": "Recent evidence has demonstrated the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF) in areas of the central nervous system characterized by cholinergic innervation. We report that a unique population of rat basal forebrain magnocellular neurons that project to the cortex and hippocampus are immunoreactive to a monoclonal antibody to the NGF receptor. Removal of target contact results in a time-dependent loss or shrinkage of cells in the basal forebrain that stain for NGF receptor and acetylcholinesterase, suggesting that under normal conditions, basal forebrain cholinergic neurons utilize NGF for trophic support.",
