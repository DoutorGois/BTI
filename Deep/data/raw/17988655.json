     "AB": "Neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia conferred by ischemic preconditioning (IPC) requires translocation of epsilon protein kinase C (epsilonPKC). A major goal in our laboratory is to define the cellular targets by which epsilonPKC confers protection. We tested the hypothesis that epsilonPKC targets the mitochondrial K(+)(ATP) channel (mtK(+)(ATP)) after IPC. Our results demonstrated a rapid translocation of epsilonPKC to rat hippocampal mitochondria after IPC. Because in other tissues epsilonPKC targets mtK(+)(ATP) channels, but its presence in brain mitochondria is controversial, we determined the presence of the K(+)(ATP) channel-specific subunits (Kir6.1 and Kir6.2) in mitochondria isolated from rat hippocampus. Next, we determined whether mtK(+)(ATP) channels play a role in the IPC induction. In hippocampal organotypic slice cultures, IPC and lethal ischemia were induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation. Subsequent cell death in the CA1 region was quantified using propidium iodide staining. Treatment with the K(+)(ATP) channel openers diazoxide or pinacidil 48 h prior to lethal ischemia protected hippocampal CA1 neurons, mimicking the induction of neuroprotection conferred by either IPC or epsilonPKC agonist-induced preconditioning. Blockade of mtK(+)(ATP) channels using 5-hydroxydecanoic acid abolished the neuroprotection due to either IPC or epsilonPKC preconditioning. Both ischemic and epsilonPKC agonist-mediated preconditioning resulted in phosphorylation of the mtK(+)(ATP) channel subunit Kir6.2. After IPC, selective inhibition of epsilonPKC activation prevented Kir6.2 phosphorylation, consistent with Kir6.2 as a phosphorylation target of epsilonPKC or its downstream effectors. Our results support the hypothesis that the brain mtK(+)(ATP) channel is an important target of IPC and the signal transduction pathways initiated by epsilonPKC.",
