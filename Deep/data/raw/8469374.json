     "AB": "The distribution of furin mRNA was examined in the rat central nervous system. Northern blot analysis reveals the presence of a 4.4 kb band in all brain tissues examined. In situ hybridization analysis of frozen rat brain sections using a radioactively labeled antisense cRNA probe to rat furin demonstrated moderate to low levels of expression in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissue in all areas examined. Interestingly, higher levels of furin were expressed in selective regions which include the ventricles (the choroid plexus and ependymal cells), the islands of Calleja, the hippocampus and the pineal gland. the ubiquitous localization of furin in the brain is consistent with its postulated role as a vital convertase important in the processing of proproteins negotiating the constitutive pathway of secretion. However, the higher expression of furin mRNA in distinct brain areas suggests a more active role in the processing of proproteins synthesized in these tissues.",
