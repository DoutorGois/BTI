     "AB": "Low-frequency synaptic stimulation evokes long-term depression of synaptic strength. One hypothesis is that modification of AMPA receptors by phospholipase A2 causes long-term depression. A previous study reported bromophenacylbromide, a completely nonselective phospholipase A2 inhibitor, blocked long-term depression at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in hippocampus. In contrast, I show here that 3-(4-octadecyl)-benzoylacrylic acid (OBAA), a much more potent and selective inhibitor of low and high molecular weight phospholipase A2, does not block long-term depression at these same synapses, indicating that phospholipase A2 is not necessary for modifications causing long-term depression.",
