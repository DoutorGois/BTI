     "AB": "PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between frequency of complex partial (CPS) and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (sGTCS) on hippocampal volume (HV) and temporal lobe metabolism. METHODS: We performed volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography with 18fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG-PET) in 32 patients with epilepsy. Temporal lobe foci were localized by ictal video-EEG. RESULTS: We did not find any association between CPS frequency or lifetime number of sGTCS and HV or metabolism ipsilateral to electroencephalographic focus. CONCLUSION: The progress of metabolic or pathologic abnormalities of temporal lobe epilepsy may not be altered by adequate seizure control. The presence of an epileptic focus might be associated with progressive neuronal injury even in clinically well-controlled patients.",
