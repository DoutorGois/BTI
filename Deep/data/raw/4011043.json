     "AB": "[3H]dexoxadrol, a dissociative anesthetic, binds with high affinity to specific sites in rat brain (membrane binding and light microscopic autoradiography). Various phencyclidine (PCP) analogues compete for [3H]dexoxadrol sites in a slightly different manner than against [3H]PCP binding sites. As for [3H]PCP binding, [3H]dexoxadrol binding sites are highly concentrated in brain regions such as the cortex and the hippocampus. However, other areas such as the hypothalamus are enriched only in [3H]dexoxadrol binding sites. This suggests that [3H]dexoxadrol binds to PCP-related sites in certain brain regions but not in others. In the human forebrain, [3H]dexoxadrol binding sites are distributed as in the rat brain and mainly found in the caudate, putamen and cortex.",
