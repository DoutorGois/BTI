     "AB": "Lead (Pb(2+)) is one of the most common neurotoxic metals present in our environment. Chronic or acute exposure to Pb(2+) causes impairment to the central nervous system (CNS). As one potent useful tool in the attempt to protect against impairment and promote functional recovery of the CNS, gangliosides are hopeful for recovering Pb(2+) neurotoxicity. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of monosialoganglioside (GM1) on the Pb(2+)-induced impairments of synaptic plasticity, antioxidant system function, and intracellular calcium levels in the hippocampus of acute Pb(2+)-exposed rats. Our study showed that: (1) Acute Pb(2+) exposure impaired synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus and GM1 preconditioning rescued to some extent this impairment in urethane-anesthetized rats. (2) Superoxide dismutase activities and malondialdehyde levels were significantly increased in the acute Pb(2+)-exposed hippocampus which could be reduced by GM1 preconditioning. (3) Further, acute Pb(2+) exposure caused the internal free Ca(2+) fluctuation in the cultured hippocampal neurons and GM1 preconditioning could abate this fluctuation. Taken together, our results illustrated the possible mechanisms underlying the protective effects of GM1 against Pb(2+) neurotoxicity and might shed light on protection against Pb(2+) toxicity and its treatment.",
