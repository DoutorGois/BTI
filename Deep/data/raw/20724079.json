     "AB": "Contrary to the reduction of depressive-like behavior observed in several strains of cytokine receptor knockout mice, mice lacking the specific receptor for interleukin (IL)-15 showed increased immobility in tail suspension and modified forced swimming tests. There was also a reduction in social interactions. The hippocampus of the IL15Ralpha knockout mice had decreased mRNA for 5-HT(1A), increased mRNA for 5-HT(2C), and region-specific changes of serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) immunoreactivity. Fluoxetine (the classic antidepressant Prozac, which inhibits 5-HT(2C) and SERT) reduced the immobility of the IL15Ralpha knockout mice in comparison with their pretreatment baseline. Together with the unchanged performance of the IL15Ralpha knockout mice on the rotarod, this response to fluoxetine indicates that the immobility reflects depression. Wildtype mice responded to IL15 treatment with improvement of immobility induced by forced swimming, whereas the knockout mice failed to respond. Thus, the cognate IL15 receptor is necessary for the antidepressive activity of IL15. In ex vivo studies, IL15 decreased synaptosomal uptake of 5-HT, and modulated the expression of 5-HT(2C) and SERT in cultured neurons in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Thus, the effect of IL15 on serotonin transmission may underlie the depressive-like behavior of IL15Ralpha knockout mice. We speculate that IL15 is essential to maintain neurochemical homeostasis and thereby plays a role in preventing neuropsychiatric symptoms.",
