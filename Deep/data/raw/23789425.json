     "AB": "A bilateral cytotoxic lesion of the caudal hippocampus (about 1/3 of the whole hippocampus, which is insufficiently studied) influences learning of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) in the Morris water maze. This effect has been estimated in this paper. A version of the test intended to measure long-term spatial memory was used. The lesion was shown to exert an influence on the learning dynamics by slowing it down, as well as to reduce the accuracy of platform location memorizing at early stages of training. The data obtained indicate the involvement of this area in control of spatial learning in rodents.",
