     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to examine whether topiramate would reduce neuronal damage after transient global ischemia in the gerbils because topiramate blocks voltage sensitive sodium channels and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and enhances gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibitory transmission. Both common carotid arteries were occluded for 3 min with microaneurysmal clips. The gerbils were treated with topiramate (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg, i.p.) immediately after ischemia. Neuronal cell damage in the hippocampal CA1 region was evaluated quantitatively 7 days after ischemia. Topiramate at the dose of 50 mg/kg failed to reduce hippocampal neuronal damage. However, topiramate when administered at the dose of 100 or 200 mg/kg significantly reduced hippocampal neuronal damage in dose-dependent manner (P<0.001 and P<0.0005, respectively). These results suggest that topiramate has a neuroprotective effect against neuronal damage following global ischemia in the gerbils.",
