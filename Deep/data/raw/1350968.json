     "AB": "1. Philanthotoxins decrease the amplitude of the population spike (PS), the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (f-EPSP), and the presynaptic volley (PV), as evoked by Shaffer-collateral-commisural inputs to the CA1 pyramidal cells in the rat hippocampus slice. 2. The effects are slow and often not completely reversible. 3. Dideaza-philanthotoxin-12 is, in all experiments, the most active antagonist showing a very poor recovery. 4. Using a twin pulse the percentual decreases of f-EPSP and PV amplitudes are almost identical for the first and second response. However, the first PS is much more affected than the second one, indicating a possible effect on the inhibiting circuit. 5. Philanthotoxins cause a non-competitive inhibition. 6. Besides a possible postsynaptic block and a distinct presynaptic effect (preceding paper) a non-postsynaptic effect (on the PV) is described.",
