     "AB": "Specific accumulation of 3H aldosterone by corticosteroid receptors of the brain structures was determined in in vitro and in vivo experiments on rats of different behavioral types under the normal conditions and within two weeks after stress. In both variants, stress decreased binding of 3H aldosterone to corticosteroid receptors of the rat brain. Differences were found in binding of 3H aldosterone to corticosteroid receptors of the hippocampus, rather than the whole brain, in animals with different behavioral types both under normal conditions and after stress. The experimental results agree with the published data about involvement of the corticosteroid receptor system of the brain limbic structures in the formation of emotional reactivity in animals.",
