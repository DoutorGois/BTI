     "AB": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the branched spines of the mossy fiber-CA3 hippocampal synapse contain a particularly large number of polyribosomes (Chicurel and Harris, 1989, 1992). We analyzed a preparation of synaptosomes isolated from this region and have found it to contain a restricted RNA population: certain mRNAs, presumably derived from the dendritic spines and the fine astrocytic processes surrounding the pre- and postsynaptic elements of the synapse, are enriched in the synaptosome preparation as compared to the total hippocampus; other mRNAs are less prevalent or altogether absent. In addition, neural BC1, a small noncoding RNA thought to be involved in pre- or posttranslational regulatory processes in dendrites, is a major RNA component of the dendritic spine. These results support the hypothesis that local translational regulation of gene expression may be important in establishing and modulating synaptic function.",
