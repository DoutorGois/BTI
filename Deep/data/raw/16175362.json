The aim of this study was to establish an organotypic in vitro model for investigating effects of the amyloid beta (Abeta)-peptide on pyramidal neuron degeneration, glial cell activation and tau phosphorylation. Tissue cultures in a quasi-monolayer were obtained using roller-drum incubation of hippocampal slices from neonatal Sprague Dawley rats. Neuronal populations identified included N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA-R1) receptor immunoreactive pyramidal neurons, and neurons immunopositive for glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (GAD65) or gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). Many neurons expressed phosphorylated tau as shown by pS(396), AD2 and PHF-tau immunostaining. Astrocytes, microglial cells and macrophages were also identified. The Abeta(25-35) peptide formed fibrillar networks within 2 days as demonstrated by electron microscopy. In the presence of the neurotoxic Abeta(25-35) peptide, but not Abeta(35-25), deposits developed in the tissue that were stainable with Thioflavine T and Congo red and showed the characteristic birefringence of Abeta plaques. Following Abeta(25-35) exposure, neurodegenerative cells were observed with Fluoro-Jade B staining. Further characterization of pyramidal neurons immunopositive for NMDA-R1 showed a decrease of cell number in the immediate surrounding of Abeta(25-35) deposits in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. Similar effects on pyramidal neurons were obtained following exposure to the full-length, Abeta(1-40) peptide. Also, a loss of neuronal processes was seen with GAD65, but not GABA, immunohistochemistry after exposure to Abeta(25-35). Abeta(25-35)-exposed neurons immunopositive for phospho-tau showed degenerating, bent and often fragmented processes. Astrocytes showed increased GFAP-positive reactivity after Abeta(25-35) exposure and formation of large networks of processes. No obvious effect on microglial cells and macrophages could be seen after the Abeta(25-35) exposure. The developed in vitro system may constitute a useful tool for screening novel drugs against Abeta-induced alterations of tau and degeneration of hippocampal neurons.",
