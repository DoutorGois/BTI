     "AB": "Lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) cause depletion of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the cerebral cortex and behavioral changes consisting of impaired ability to learn avoidance tasks. Since hippocampal mossy fibers (MF) are involved in the elaboration of passive avoidance responses, we analyzed MF by means of Timm's histochemical technique and electron microscopy, to find out whether monolateral lesions of NBM had any effect on MF system. NBM-lesioned rats, 3 weeks after lesioning, showed a significant and progressive decrease in the density of Timm staining as well as significant changes of the morphology of synapic boutons of the MF. These results suggest that, although NBM does not send direct projections to the hippocampus, lesions of this nucleus may have a neurodegenerative effect on the intrahippocampal pathway involved in avoidance responses.",
