     "AB": "Evidence has accumulated for the involvement of Ca(2+) in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Elevations in both resting and stimulated intracellular Ca(2+) levels in patients with affective disorders have been reported. The role of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs), which allow mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) stores, was, then, investigated in the mouse forced swimming test. InsP3R antagonists (heparin, xestospongin C) as well as an inositol monophosphatase inhibitor (LiCl) showed an antidepressant activity of intensity comparable to clinically used antidepressants. InsP3Rl, InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 knockdown mice were obtained to investigate the role of InsP3R isoforms. We generated mice carrying a cerebral knockdown of InsP3Rl, InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 proteins by administering antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the sequence of InsP3Rl, InsP3R2 and InsP3R3. These antisense-treated mice showed a specific InsP3R protein level reduction in the mouse cerebral cortex and hippocampus, demonstrated by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry experiments. Knockdown mice for each InsP3R isoforms showed an antidepressant behaviour and the induced phenotype was reversible disappearing 7 days after the end of the treatment. The absence of impairment of locomotor activity and spontaneous mobility in InsP3R knockdown mice was revealed. These results indicate the involvement of the InsP3R-mediated pathway in the modulation of depressive conditions and may be useful for the development of new therapeutical strategies for the treatment of mood disorders.",
