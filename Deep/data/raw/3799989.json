     "AB": "The distribution of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactive neurons, fibres and punctae in sector CA 1 of the adult human Ammon's horn was studied in Vibratome sections (40 micron thick) of tissue obtained at surgery and autopsy. On light microscopical examination, the material did not show pathological changes. The antibody was visualized by the unlabelled antibody enzyme method. GAD-immunoreactive neurons, fibres and punctae were present in all layers. Most immunoreactive neurons were located in the stratum pyramidale and stratum lacunosum. Their size ranged from 8 microns in the stratum lacunosum to about 50 microns in the stratum oriens. The somata offered a wide range of shapes, multiform to fusiform with the long axis aligned parallel or vertically to the alveus. All somata belonged to the heterogeneous group of non-pyramidal neurons. The dendrites either radiated in all directions or tended to run in two opposite directions. After bleaching the chromogen and staining for lipofuscin pigment granules and basophilic material, it turned out that within the stratum pyramidale all formerly GAD-immunoreactive neurons belonged to the group of lipofuscin-laden non-pyramidal neurons. Within the other layers, a few formerly GAD-immunoreactive neurons were devoid of lipofuscin pigment. The highest density of GAD-immunoreactive punctae was found in the stratum lacunosum. In addition to numerous GAD-immunoreactive punctae in the pyramidal layer and in the stratum radiatum there were thin GAD-immunoreactive fibres of varying length extending into various directions.",
