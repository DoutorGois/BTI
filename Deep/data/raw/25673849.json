     "AB": "Thyroid receptor-interacting protein 6 (Trip6), a multifunctional protein belonging to the zyxin family of LIM proteins, is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including cell migration and tumorigenesis. However, the role of Trip6 in neurons remains unknown. Here, we show that Trip6 is expressed in mouse hippocampal neurons and promotes dendritic morphogenesis. Through interaction with the glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) and myosin VI, Trip6 is crucial for the total dendritic length and the number of primary dendrites in cultured hippocampal neurons. Trip6 depletion reduces F-actin content and impairs dendritic morphology, and this phenocopies GRIP1 or myosin VI knockdown. Furthermore, phosphorylation of GRIP1(956T) by AKT1 inhibits the interaction between GRIP1 and myosin VI, but facilitates GRIP1 binding to 14-3-3 protein, which is required for regulating F-actin organization and dendritic morphogenesis. Thus, the Trip6-GRIP1-myosin VI interaction and its regulation on F-actin network play a significant role in dendritic morphogenesis.",
