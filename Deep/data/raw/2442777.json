     "AB": "Cats subjected to daily (25-30 days) electroconvulsive shock (ECS) demonstrated an elevation of their electroconvulsive threshold or tolerance to ECS. [3H] Nitrendipine binding was measured to brain regions from non-tolerant (sham shocked) and ECS tolerant cats 24 hr following the last shock. ECS produced a significant increase (45%) in the density of [3H] nitrendipine binding sites in the cerebral cortex and a significant decrease (33%) in the apparent affinity of [3H] nitrendipine in the cerebellum. No changes in binding were observed in the hippocampus. The effects of ECS were also investigated in the rat, an animal not displaying tolerance to repeated ECS. [3H] Nitrendipine binding to rat brain was measured 10 min and 24 hr following one shock (acute) or ten shocks delivered transauricularly once daily (chronic). Twenty-four hours following chronic ECS, there was a significant increase (19%) and decrease (11%) in the density, but no change in the apparent affinity of [3H] nitrendipine binding sites in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus respectively. No significant change in [3H] nitrendipine binding was observed in rat cerebellum 24 hr following chronic ECS. There were no changes in [3H] nitrendipine binding in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus 10 min and 24 hr following acute ECS. These results indicate that ECS can alter [3H] nitrendipine binding to calcium channel linked dihydropyridine binding sites in the central nervous system. It is suggested that changes in [3H] nitrendipine binding in the cat cerebellum may be involved in the development of tolerance to ECS.",
