     "AB": "Systemic or intracerebral administration of glucocorticoids enhances memory consolidation in several tasks. Previously, we reported that these effects depend on an intact basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) and efferents from the BLA that run through the stria terminalis (ST). The BLA projects directly to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) via this ST pathway. The NAc also receives direct projections from the hippocampus and, therefore, may be a site of convergence of BLA and hippocampal influences in modulating memory consolidation. In support of this view, we found previously that lesions of either the NAc or the ST also block the memory-modulatory effect of systemically administered glucocorticoids. The present experiments examined the effects of lesions of the NAc or the ST on the memory-modulatory effects of intracerebral glucocorticoids on inhibitory avoidance training. Microinfusions of the specific glucocorticoid receptor agonist 11beta,17beta-dihydroxy-6,21-dimethyl-17alpha-pregna-4,6-trien-20yn-3-one (RU 28362; 1.0 or 3.0 ng) into either the BLA or the hippocampus of male Sprague Dawley rats administered immediately after training enhanced the 48 hr retention performance in a dose-dependent manner. Bilateral lesions of the NAc or the ST alone did not affect retention performance but blocked the memory enhancement induced by intra-BLA or intrahippocampal glucocorticoid receptor agonist administration. These findings indicate that the BLA-NAc pathway plays an essential role in mediating glucocorticoid effects on memory consolidation and suggest that the BLA interacts with hippocampal effects on memory consolidation via this pathway.",
