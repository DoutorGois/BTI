     "AB": "Phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG), which catalyses conversion of glutamine to glutamate, is a potential marker for glutamatergic, and possibly GABA, neurons in the central nervous system. A polyclonal antibody, raised in rabbits against rat brain PAG, was applied to postmortem human brain tissue to reveal the distribution of PAG in the cerebral cortex. PAG immunoreactivity was observed in pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons but not in glial cells. In the neocortex, large to medium-sized pyramidal neurons in layers III and V were stained most intensely, while the majority of smaller pyramidal cells were labeled either lightly or moderately. Such modified pyramids as the giant Betz cells, the large pyramidal cells of Meynert, and the solitary cells of Ramon y Cajal were also stained intensely. Fusiform cells in layer VI showed moderate to intense labeling. A number of cortical non-pyramidal neurons of various sizes stained moderately to intensely. These included large basket cells which were identified by their characteristic morphology and size in primary cortical areas. Pyramidal cells in the hippocampal formation as well as basket cells of the stratum oriens stained moderately to intensely. Since pyramidal cells are believed to be glutamatergic and large basket cells GABAergic, these results suggest that PAG plays a role in generating not only transmitter glutamate, but also GABA precursor glutamate.",
