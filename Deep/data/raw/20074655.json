     "AB": "The prefrontal cortex is thought to be critical for goal-directed action and the hippocampus is known to be importantly involved in spatial memory. Several studies have been suggestive of a role for the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in spatial navigation. However, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) receives projections directly from the intermediate CA1 (iCA1) region of hippocampus and this link may be critical for spatial navigation. The purpose of the present investigation was to test the performance of rats receiving bilateral or disconnection infusions of lidocaine into OFC, mPFC, or iCA1 to determine the contribution of these structures to encoding and retrieval of spatial memory using the Hebb-Williams maze. A total of 92 male Long-Evans rats received chronic bilateral, contralateral, or ipsilateral implantation of cannulas into OFC, mPFC, or iCA1. Prior to testing on day 1 or day 2, subjects received central infusions of saline or lidocaine. The number of errors committed on the first five trials compared to the second five trials of day 1 was used to determine encoding, whereas retrieval was determined by comparing the second five trials of day 1 with the first five trials of day 2. The present findings suggest that mPFC and iCA1 are necessary and interact during encoding and retrieval; however, the OFC does not appear to be essential for either process. While the nature of the interaction between mPFC and iCA1 during encoding and retrieval is unclear, it may be supported by the integration of goals and spatial cues or strategy switching.",
