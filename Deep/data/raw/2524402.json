     "AB": "Measurements were made of the effects of intracerebroventricular treatment with beta-endorphin (BE; 100 ng) on the arginine-8-vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin contents of rat hypothalamic and limbic brain areas (hippocampus, amygdala and septum). The hormone concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. The administration of BE resulted in a significant reduction of the AVP level in the amygdala in a naloxone-reversible manner. Naloxone (Nal) administered subcutaneously significantly increased the AVP content in the septum. The results revealed that BE and Nal had regionally specific effects on the activity of the vasopressinergic system but not on that of the oxytocinergic system in the brain.",
