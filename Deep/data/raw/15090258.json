     "AB": "While the development and plasticity of excitatory synaptic connections have been studied into detail, little is known about the development of inhibitory synapses. As proposed for excitatory synapses, recent studies have indicated that activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression, may play a role in the establishment of functional inhibitory synaptic connections. Here, I review these different forms of plasticity and focus on their possible role in the developing neuronal network.",
