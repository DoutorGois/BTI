     "AB": "The release of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in the dorsal hippocampus was measured using an in vivo microdialysis method in rats subjected to the Vogel type conflict test. The conflict situation significantly increased 5-HT release in the dorsal hippocampus. Midazolam (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg i.p.) suppressed the dosage-dependently this increased 5-HT release, an inhibition closely associated with the attenuation of conflict behavior. These findings suggest that the activation of serotonergic neuronal activity in the dorsal hippocampus is linked to mediation of anxiety-related behavior.",
