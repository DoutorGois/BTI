     "AB": "The study focused on a possibility of preventing brain neurodegeneration by adaptation to intermittent hypoxia (AH) in rats with experimental Alzheimer's disease (AD) modeled by injection of a neurotoxic bert-amyloid peptide fragment (Ab) into n. basalis magnocellularis. AH was produ- ced in an altitude chamber (4.000 m; 4 hours daily; 14 days). The following results were obtained after fifteen days of the Ab injection: (1) AH substantially prevented the memory impairment induced by Ab, which was determined using the conditioned avoidance reflex test; (2) the AH significantly restricted the enhanced oxidative stress, which was determined spectrophotometrically by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance level in the hippocampus; (3) the AH completely prevented Ab-induced nitric oxide (NO) overproduction in brain, which was measured by tissue level of nitrite and nitrate; (4) pathologically changed and dead neurons (Niessle staining) were absent in the brain cortex of rats exposed to AH before the Ab injection. Therefore AH seems to effectively prevent oxidative and nitrosative stress thereby providing protection of brain against neurodegeneration and preservation of cognitive function in experimental AD.",
