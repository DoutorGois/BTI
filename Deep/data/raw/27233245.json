     "AB": "The guinea pig is a frequently used animal model for human pregnancy complications, such as oxygen deprivation or hypoxia, which result in altered brain development. To investigate the impact of in utero chronic hypoxia on brain development, pregnant guinea pigs underwent either normoxic or hypoxic conditions at about 70 % of 65-day term gestation. After delivery, neurochemical profiles consisting of 19 metabolites and macromolecules were obtained from the neonatal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum from birth to 12 weeks postpartum using in vivo (1)H MR spectroscopy at 9.4 T. The effects of chronic fetal hypoxia on the neurochemical profiles were particularly significant at birth. However, the overall developmental trends of neurochemical concentration changes were similar between normoxic and hypoxic animals. Alterations of neurochemicals including N-acetylaspartate (NAA), phosphorylethanolamine, creatine, phosphocreatine, and myo-inositol indicate neuronal loss, delayed myelination, and altered brain energetics due to chronic fetal hypoxia. These observed neurochemical alterations in the developing brain may provide insights into hypoxia-induced brain pathology, neurodevelopmental compromise, and potential neuroprotective measures.",
