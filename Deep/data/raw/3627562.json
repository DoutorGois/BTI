     "AB": "Electrotonic coupling was examined between hippocampal neurons in dissociated cell cultures. Injections of Lucifer yellow indicated that approximately 20% of the neurons were dye-coupled. Propionate, which causes cytoplasmic acidification, significantly decreased dye coupling. Simultaneous intracellular recordings from pairs of cultured neurons directly demonstrated electrotonic coupling. Therefore dissociated cell cultures can be used as a model system for the analysis of hippocampal electrotonic coupling.",
