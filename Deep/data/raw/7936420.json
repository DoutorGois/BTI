     "AB": "The strength of feedforward inhibition was assessed in the CA1 region of in vitro hippocampus of benzodiazepine tolerant rats 2 and 7 days after 1 week oral flurazepam (FZP) administration. Feedforward inhibition was activated with a Schaffer collateral stimulation just-subthreshold for a population spike followed at intervals of 10-100 ms by test population spikes elicited from the subicular side of the recording electrode. The amplitude of test spike was reduced to a lesser degree 2 days, but not 7 days, after FZP treatment, suggesting a decrease feedforward inhibition in treated rats coinciding with the time course for reversal of anticonvulsant tolerance in vivo.",
