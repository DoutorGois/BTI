     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Manipulating thyroid hormones has been shown to influence learning and memory. Although a large body of literature is available on the effects of thyroid hormone deficiency on learning and memory functions during developmental or adult-onset hypothyroidism, electrophysiological findings are limited. This limitation is especially notable with respect to thyroxine administration in adult, normothyroid animals. METHODS: Experiments were carried out on 12 adult male Wistar rats, each 9-10 months of age. Rats were randomly divided into hyperthyroid (0.2 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal thyroxine injection, for 21 days) and control groups (n = 6 animals in each group). Following spatial learning performance tests on hyperthyroid and control groups, rats were anesthetized with urethane and placed in a stereotaxic frame. A bipolar, tungsten electrode was used to stimulate the medial perforant path. A glass micropipette was inserted within the granule cell layer of the ipsilateral dentate gyrus to record field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP). Following a 15-min baseline recording of fEPSPs, long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by four sets of tetanic pulse trains. RESULTS: Thyroxine-treated rats showed significantly worse performance in the spatial memory task and attenuated input-output relationships in the electrophysiological analyses. Treated rats also showed a lower efficacy of LTP induction when compared with controls. CONCLUSION: The present study provides clear in vivo evidence for the action of L-thyroxine in the impairment of synaptic plasticity and in inducing spatial memory task deficits in adult rats. These findings may explain the complaints of cognitive function reductions in hyperthyroid patients.",
