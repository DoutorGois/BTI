Modifications were observed in hippocampus and cortex (Kd increased) and in cerebellum (Bmax decreased) and when brain sections of control rats were incubated in the bath fluid that had served to incubate sections from isolated rats, a flattening of the saturation curve was observed. Results are discussed in terms of possible modulators of benzodiazepine binding sites, mainly tissue GABA concentrations.",
