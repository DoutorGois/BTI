     "AB": "Phosphorylation of glutamate receptors is probably an important mechanism for modulating excitatory transmission. However, there is little direct evidence to indicate which protein phosphatases can dephosphorylate glutamate or other ligand-gated channels, although it is known that protein phosphatases 1 and 2A play a major part in modulating voltage and second-messenger-gated channels. Here we report that in cultured hippocampal neurons, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor can be regulated by endogenous and exogenous serine/threonine protein phosphatases. Phosphatase inhibitors enhanced NMDA currents recorded using the perforated patch technique or in cell-attached patches, whereas protein phosphatases 1 or 2A decreased the open probability of these channels in inside-out patches.",
