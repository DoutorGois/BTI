     "AB": "Stroke is considered an underlying etiology of the development of seizures. Stroke leads to glucose and oxygen deficiency in neurons, resulting in brain dysfunction and injury. Mild hypothermia is a therapeutic strategy to inhibit strokeinduced seizures, which may be associated with the regulation of energy metabolism of the brain. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member (GLUT)1 are critical for energy metabolism. Furthermore, mTOR overactivation and GLUT1 deficiency are associated with genetically acquired seizures. It has been hypothesized that mTOR and GLUT1 may additionally be involved in seizures elicited by stroke. The present study established global cerebral ischemia (GCI) models of rats. Convulsive seizure behaviors frequently occurred during the first and the second days following GCI, which were accompanied with seizure discharge reflected in the EEG monitor. Expression of phosphor (p)mTOR and GLUT1 were upregulated in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, as evidenced by immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. Mild hypothermia and/or rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) treatments reduced the number of epileptic attacks, seizure severity scores and seizure discharges, thereby alleviating seizures induced by GCI. Mild hypothermia and/or rapamycin treatments reduced phosphorylation levels of mTOR and the downstream effecter p70S6 in neurons, and the amount of GLUT1 in the cytomembrane of neurons. The present study revealed that mTOR is involved in strokeinduced seizures and the antiseizure effect of mild hypothermia. The role of GLUT1 in strokeelicited seizures appears to be different from the role in seizures induced by other reasons. Further studies are necessary in order to elucidate the exact function of GLUT-1 in strokeelicited seizures.",
