     "AB": "The temporal increase of plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels at 3 or 4 days after a single oral administration of trimethyltin (TMT) was suppressed by intracerebroventricular administration of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). On the other hand, glutamate receptor antagonist (MK801) did not affect the TMT-induced CORT level increase. These results indicate that this transient activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in TMT-treated rats may be in part attributable to the neuroendocrine effects of IL-1 produced by microglia.",
