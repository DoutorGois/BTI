     "AB": "Early in postnatal development, glutamatergic synapses transmit primarily through NMDA receptors. As development progresses, synapses acquire AMPA receptor function. The molecular basis of these physiological observations is not known. Here we examined single excitatory synapses with immunogold electron-microscopic analysis of AMPA and NMDA receptors along with electrophysiological measurements. Early in postnatal development, a significant fraction of excitatory synapses had NMDA receptors and lacked AMPA receptors. As development progressed, synapses acquired AMPA receptors with little change in NMDA receptor number. Thus, synapses with NMDA receptors but no AMPA receptors can account for the electrophysiologically observed 'silent synapse'.",
