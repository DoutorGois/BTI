     "AB": "While the toxicity in insects of formamidines such as chlordimeform (CDM), its demethylated metabolite DCDM, and amitraz (AMZ) appears to involve activation of an octopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase, their mechanism of action in mammals remains elusive. There is increasing evidence, however, that alpha 2-adrenoceptors might mediate certain effects of CDM, DCDM, and AMZ. In the present study, we investigated whether formamidines can interact directly with adrenoceptors in mouse forebrain both in vitro and after in vivo administration. Formamidines were potent inhibitors of the binding of [3H]clonidine to alpha 2-adrenoceptors with IC50's of 13 microM, 29 nM, and 130 nM for CDM, DCDM, and AMZ, respectively. Binding of [3H]yohimbine was inhibited with similar potencies. All compounds also inhibited with equal (CDM) or lower potency the binding of [3H]spiperone to dopamine D2 receptors and were weak inhibitors or inactive toward alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors, cholinergic muscarinic, GABAA, opiate mu, benzodiazepine, and histamine 1 receptors. Administration of formamidines to mice caused a dose-dependent decrease of [3H]clonidine binding. [3H]Clonidine binding returned to control values within 5 hr following administration of CDM and DCDM, but was still significantly decreased up to 48 hr after AMZ. Among different brain regions, [3H]clonidine binding was decreased to a larger extent in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and midbrain. In vitro and ex vivo kinetic binding studies indicated that the effect of formamidines on alpha 2-adrenoceptors was due to a decrease in affinity and not to an alteration of the density of [3H]clonidine binding sites. The results of these biochemical studies support the hypothesis that alpha 2-adrenoceptors represent an important target for formamidine neurotoxicity in mammals.",
