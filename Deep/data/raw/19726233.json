     "AB": "The primary aim of this study was to determine whether hippocampal asymmetries in fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on preoperative PET scans would predict post-temporal lobectomy verbal memory (VM) decline in patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy. A quantitative asymmetry index (AI) of uptake values within a hippocampal region of interest (ROI) was defined by an automated technique. No statistically significant effect of the hippocampal AI on the outcome measure, the pre- to postsurgical change in Logical Memory Percent Retention, was evident. Post hoc analyses revealed that AIs of the superior and inferior temporal gyri approached significance, however, with relatively greater left-sided preoperative metabolism predicting better VM outcomes. This finding suggests reorganization of function and/or retained function of remaining tissue. Although hippocampal FDG-PET asymmetries did not significantly predict changes in VM, the predictive value of neocortical AIs should be further explored. Automated ROI parcellation provides a feasible tool for use in such investigations.",
