     "AB": "In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation is associated with hippocampal network dysfunction. Intrahippocampal injections of Abeta induce aberrant inhibitory septohippocampal (SH) network activity in vivo and impairment of memory processing. In the present study, we observed, after hippocampal Abeta treatment, a selective loss of neurons projecting to the medial septum (MS) and containing calbindin (CB) and/or somatostatin (SOM). Other GABAergic neuronal subpopulations were not altered. Thus, the present study identifies hippocamposeptal neuron populations as specific targets for Abeta deposits. We observed that in Abeta-treated rats but not in controls, glutamate agonist application induced rhythmic bursting in 55% of the slow-firing neurons in the medial septum. This suggests that hippocampal Abeta can trigger modifications of the septohippocampal pathway via the alteration of a specific neuronal population. Long-range hippocamposeptal GABA/calbindin neurons, targets of hippocampal amyloid deposits, are implicated in supporting network synchronization. By identifying this target, we contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying deleterious effects of Abeta, one of the main agents of dementia in Alzheimer's disease.",
