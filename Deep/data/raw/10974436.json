     "AB": "We studied N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced cell death in organotypic hippocampal slices from seven-day-old Wistar rat pups cultured for 12-14 days in a medium containing no added glutamate. Propidium iodide fluorescence intensity was used as an indicator of cell death measured with the help of confocal microscopy. Exposure of slices for 2h to L-glutamate (1-500 microM) prior to the N-methyl-D-aspartate challenge significantly reduced N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced cell death. Glutamate at 10 and 500 microM concentrations was highly protective against N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced cell death, but was less protective at the 1 microM concentration. The protection was not blocked by the Na(+) channel blocker tetrodotoxin (1 microM), the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (20 microM) or the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (20 microM). 1S, 3R-1-Aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, an agonist at metabotropic glutamate receptor types 1, 2/3 and 5, was protective at 100 microM but not at 50 microM. In contrast, the ionotropic glutamate receptor agonist aspartate (250 microM) facilitated N-methyl-D-aspartate toxicity. Treatment of slices with the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (0.2 microM) or antisense oligonucleotide (10nM, 72 h) that selectively inhibits metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 synthesis significantly reduced glutamate protection. These results suggest that ambient glutamate may reduce nerve cell susceptibility to injury caused by excessive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation by acting at metabotropic glutamate receptors linked to protein kinase C.",
