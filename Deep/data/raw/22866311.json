     "AB": "Long-term effects of chronic emotional and pain stress on histone H3 phosphorylation by serine 10 in hippocampal CA3 neurons were examined 24 h, 2 weeks, and 2 months after termination of the stress procedure in 2 rat strains differing by excitability of the nervous system. The low excitable rats with high threshold (HT) of excitability were characterized by a high baseline level of histone H3 phosphorylation in comparison with the high excitable rats with low threshold (LT) of excitability. The long-term emotional and pain stress significantly changed the number of positive immune cells in highly excitable rats: this parameter increased in 24 h and 2 weeks after the stress, but returned to the control level in 2 months. In contrast, stress did not affect histone H3 phosphorylation in low excitable rats. Thus, long-term (up to 2 weeks) changes in histone H3 phosphorylation were reveled in rat hippocampal CA3 neurons, which depended on genetically determined functional status of the nervous system.",
