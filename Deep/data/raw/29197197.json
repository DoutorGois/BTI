     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests a pathophysiological role of cytokines in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a key cytokine. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to examine the findings regarding TNF-alpha derived from both animal and human studies of PTSD. METHODS: Using PRISMA guidelines, we reviewed relevant articles in PubMed from inception until 11(th) April 2017. Human studies that reported group comparisons and/or longitudinal investigations of TNF-alpha production/concentration were included. Research reporting on TNF-alpha levels in animal models of PTSD were also included. RESULTS: Twenty-seven articles were identified. Data from human cross-sectional studies suggests that plasma/serum levels of TNF-alpha are elevated in those with PTSD, as compared to healthy controls. Longitudinal assessments of TNF-alpha are limited and data are mixed. Limited data from animal studies suggest an increased TNF-alpha production in the hippocampus of rats following stress, which can be reversed by immunomodulatory drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest TNF-alpha may be a potential biomarker and treatment target for PTSD. Findings need to be considered in light of heterogeneous methods for measurement and analysis of TNF-alpha concentration. Longitudinal research is needed to understand the role of TNF-alpha in the development and/or maintenance of PTSD.",
