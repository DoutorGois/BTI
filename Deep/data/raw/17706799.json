     "AB": "The molecular hypothesis of learning and memory processes is based on changes in synaptic weights in neural networks. Aim of this study was to map neural traces of exposure to a spatial novelty were mapped by (i) the transcription factors (TFs) c-fos, c-jun and jun-B using Northern blot and immunocytochemistry (ICC), (ii) RNA synthesis by (3)H-uridine autoradiography and RNA level, (iii) NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) expression by histochemistry. Thus, adult male albino rats were exposed to a Lat-maze and sacrificed at different times. Non-exposed rats served as controls. The latter showed a low constitutive expression of TF, RNA synthesis and NADPH-d across the brain. Northern blots showed a three-fold increase in TFs in exposed versus non-exposed rats in the cerebral cortex. ICC showed in exposed rats several TFs positive cells in the granular and pyramidal layers of the hippocampus and later in all layers of the somatosensory cortex, in the granular layer of the cerebellar cortex. The TF-positivity was stronger in rats exposed for the first time, and was time and NMDA-dependent. Autoradiography for RNA synthesis showed positive cells in the ependyma, hippocampus and cerebellum 6h after testing, and in the somatosensory cortex 24h later. In addition, exposure to novelty induced NADPH-d in the dorsal hippocampus, the caudate-putamen, all the layers of the somatosensory cortex. and the cerebellum. The positivity was absent immediately after exposure, appeared within 2h and disappeared 24h later. A strong neuronal discharge by the convulsant pentylenetetrazol, strongly induced TFs but not din not affect NADPH-d 2h later. Thus, data suggest that the processing of spatial and emotional components of experience activates neural networks across different organization levels of the CNS.",
