     "AB": "The effects of adrenomedullin (ADM) on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) were investigated in cultured hippocampal neurons. Changes in [Ca(2+)](i) were detected by laser scanning confocal microscopy using Fluo 3-AM as the calcium fluorescent probe. [Ca(2+)](i) was represented by relative fluorescent intensity. The results showed that: (1) ADM (0.01-1.0 micromol/L) decreased the resting [Ca(2+)](i) in a concentration-dependent manner. (2) Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist CGRP(8-37) significantly inhibited the effects of ADM. (3) ADM significantly reduced the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) induced by high K(+). (4) ADM markedly inhibited the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))-induced increase in [Ca(2+)](i), while did not influence ryanodine-evoked increase in [Ca(2+)](i). These results suggest that ADM reduces [Ca(2+)](i) in cultured hippocampal neurons through suppressing Ca(2+) release from IP(3)-sensitive stores. Although ADM does not alter resting Ca(2+) influx, it significantly suppresses Ca(2+) influx activated by high K(+). These effects may be partly mediated by CGRP receptors. ADM in the CNS may act as a cytoprotective factor in ischemic/hypoxic conditions.",
