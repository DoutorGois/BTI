     "AB": "The present study has demonstrated the distribution of [3H]granisetron-labelled 5-HT3 receptors in the human forebrain with relatively high levels of this receptor in homogenates of hippocampus, caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Lower levels of 5-HT3 receptors were found in other brain regions and the cervical vagus nerve. Pharmacological characterization of the labelled 5-HT3 receptor in human putamen homogenates identified a relatively low affinity for d-tubocurarine compared to the 5-HT3 receptor in NG108-15 neuroblastoma-glioma cell homogenates. In contrast, the affinities of 19 other 5-HT3 receptor ligands were not significantly different for the [3H]granisetron-labelled receptor in these two preparations. Such findings indicate that the human putamen 5-HT3 receptor displays a unique pharmacology which may have significance given the reported clinical potential of compounds active at this receptor when assessed in animal models of disease.",
