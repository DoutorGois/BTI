     "AB": "Objective. We studied the effect of glutamate antibodies by intranasal administration on the development of stress reactions and aspartate, glycine and taurine content in the brain structures of rats with different initial behavioral activity (active and passive). Methods. Stress caused by placing the animals in the living cell with water (21 degrees capital ES, Cyrillic) covered with a grid for 30 min. Glutamate antibodies in a dose of 250 mg/kg in a volume of 10 mkl were administered intranasally to the experimental group of rats immediately after the stress. After 1 h after stress exposure and antibodies administration in all rats was investigated motor activity in the test of the <<open field>>. Amino acids aspartate, glycine and taurine in the brain structures (hippocampus and hypothalamus) were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Results. Combined water-immersion stress caused significant changes in the behavioral activity of rats in the <<open field>>, but a more pronounced decline in the total index were observed in the behaviorally passive group of rats. The stress was accompanied by a change in the content of neurotransmitter amino acids (glycine and taurine) in the hippocampus. The most significant changes in the levels of glycine (decrease) and taurine (an increase) was observed in the hippocampus behaviorally active rats. Glutamate antibodies at a dose of 250 mg/kg administered intranasally immediately after stress exposure prevents the development of behavioral stress reactions and contributed to an increase in the hippocampus the content of glycine and taurine, related to stress-limiting systems. Conclusions. The glutamate antibodies under stress act as endogenous bioregulators and prevent the development of stress reactions.",
