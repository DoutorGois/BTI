     "AB": "The autoradiographic distribution of [125I]Bolton-Hunter neuropeptide Y receptor binding sites was quantified in rat brain. The highest level of [125I]Bolton-Hunter neuropeptide Y binding sites was seen in the hippocampus (ventral stratum radiatum, CA3 subfield: 6029 +/- 250 fmol/g tissue). The distribution of these sites was clearly laminated, being particularly concentrated in the oriens layer (dorsal CA3 subfield: 2562 +/- 147 fmol/g tissue) and stratum radiatum (dorsal CA3 subfield: 2577 +/- 95 fmol/g tissue). Lower levels of sites were seen in the pyramidal cell layer (1708 +/- 105 fmol/g tissue) and the molecular layer (1155 +/- 116 fmol/g tissue). The cortical distribution of [125I]Bolton-Hunter neuropeptide Y receptor sites was also laminated, being particularly enriched in superficial laminae (occipital cortex, layers I-II, 4038 +/- 148 fmol/g tissue; layers III-IV, 1392 +/- 97 fmol/g tissue and layers V-VI, 1522 +/- 138 fmol/g tissue). Other areas containing high amounts of sites included the anterior olfactory nuclei (ventral part, 4935 +/- 119 fmol/g tissue; lateral part, 4530 +/- 149 fmol/g tissue; dorsal part, 3378 +/- 140 fmol/g tissue and medial part, 2601 +/- 150 fmol/g tissue); anteromedial (5168 +/- 211 fmol/g tissue), medial (4611 +/- 107 fmol/g tissue) and lateral posterior thalamic nuclei (4465 +/- 189 fmol/g tissue); medial mammillary nucleus (5555 +/- 241 fmol/g tissue); medial geniculate nucleus (4747 +/- 56 fmol/g tissue); claustrum (4123 +/- 235 fmol/g tissue); posteromedial cortical amygdaloid nucleus (3524 +/- 138 fmol/g tissue), tenia tecta (2540 +/- 195 fmol/g tissue); lateral septum (1785 +/- 90 fmol/g tissue); suprachiasmatic hypothalamic nucleus (1604 +/- 115 fmol/g tissue), and substantia nigra, pars compacta (1846 +/- 142 fmol/g tissue) and pars lateralis (1750 +/- 165 fmol/g tissue). Areas moderately enriched with [125I]Bolton-Hunter neuropeptide Y binding sites included the zonal layer of the superior colliculus (1347 +/- 71 fmol/g tissue); anterior pretectal nucleus (1172 +/- 113 fmol/g tissue); ventral tegmental area (1090 +/- 97 fmol/g tissue); periventricular fibre system (1026 +/- 48 fmol/g tissue); core of nucleus accumbens (948 +/- 29 fmol/g tissue) and area postrema (799 +/- 87 fmol/g tissue). These results are discussed with regard to some of the suggested biological effects of neuropeptide Y in the central nervous system such as effects on learning, locomotion and circadian rhythms. Moreover, we also compared the distribution of [125I]Bolton-Hunter neuropeptide Y receptor sites with that of [125I]peptide YY sites in rat brain. The resolution of the autoradiographic image is better with [125I]peptide YY most likely because of higher affinity and percentage of specific labelling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
