     "AB": "Regulation of postsynaptic glutamate receptors is one of the main mechanisms for altering synaptic efficacy in the central nervous system. Recent studies have given insight into the upregulation of the NMDA receptor by Src family tyrosine kinases, which bind to scaffolding proteins in the NMDA receptor complex. Src acts as a common step in signalling cascades that link G-protein-coupled receptors with protein kinase C via the intermediary cell-adhesion kinase beta. This signalling to NMDA receptors is required for long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.",
