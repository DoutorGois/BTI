     "AB": "1. In this study, we investigated the effects of different drugs (a kappa-opioid receptor agonist U-50,488, a vasopressin receptor antagonist dPTyr(Me)AVP or an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801) on the development of morphine tolerance in rat hippocampal slices. 2. Hippocampal slices (450 microm) of Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were used. Slices were continuously superfused with artificial CSF or drugs at 1 ml min(-1). Nichrome wire electrodes were placed in the Schaffer-collateral pathway and used to deliver biphasic 0.2 ms pulses of 5-30 V (0.033 Hz). A glass microelectrode was placed in the CA1 area to record population spikes. 3. When the slices were superfused with 10 microM morphine, the amplitude of population spikes increased 2-3 fold in 30-40 min. However, this effect of morphine decreased, i.e. tolerance developed after continuous superfusion of morphine for 2-6 h. 4. When either U-50,488 (200 nM) or dPTyr(Me) AVP (500 pM) or MK-801 (500 pM) was co-superfused with morphine (10 microM), it significantly blocked the development of morphine tolerance. Nor-BNI (a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, 200 nM) significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of U-50,488 but not those of dPTyr(Me)AVP or MK-801 on the development of morphine tolerance. 5. These data indicate that kappa-opioid receptors, AVP receptors and NMDA receptors are all involved in the development of morphine tolerance. The suppression of kappa-opioid receptor activity after chronic morphine may occur before the activation of AVP receptors or NMDA receptors during the development of morphine tolerance.",
