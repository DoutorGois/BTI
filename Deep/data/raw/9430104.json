     "AB": "Stereological methods (neuron and glial cell numbers) and histochemical methods (cytochrome c oxidase) were used to study postnatal development and aging of the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas in male rats. No changes were observed in 10 microns sections in the neuronal population of areas CA1 and CA3 in any of the groups (14 days, 21 days, adult-90 days and elderly-22 months). Statistical differences were found in the number of glial cells in both the CA1 and CA3 areas. An increase was observed in cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity in the CA1 area in the 14 day old rats compared to the other groups while in area CA3 this parameter increased in the 14 and 21 day old groups and the group of adult rats. No significant changes in CO activity were found in the elderly rats in both areas. These results are discussed in the light of those recorded in other areas of the limbic system.",
