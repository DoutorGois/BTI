     "AB": "We have analyzed the expression of the Ca2+ channels in hippocampal cell suspensions from the 18- to 20-day-old rat embryo using dual-fluorescence flow cytometry. A high concentration of K+ induced elevation of the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) as well as membrane depolarization. The high K+-evoked [Ca2+]i increase was inhibited by phenytoin, but not by either nifedipine or nicardipine. These agents had no effect on the high K+-induced membrane depolarization. These findings suggest that a subtype corresponding to the low voltage-activated Ca2+ channel is expressed in the embryonic rat hippocampal cells.",
