     "AB": "Previous studies have reported that calbindin D-28k (CB), a calcium-binding protein, containing neurons in the hippocampus play an important role in hippocampal excitability in epilepsy, because CB modulates the free calcium ion during seizure. Hence, in the present study, we investigated changes of CB expression in the hippocampus and its association in the Mongolian gerbil to identify roles of CB in epileptogenesis. CB immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was significantly lower in the pre-seizure group of seizure sensitive (SS) gerbils as compared with those seen in the seizure resistant (SR) gerbils. The distribution of CB immunoreactivity in the hippocampus showed significant difference after seizure on-set in SS gerbils. CB immunoreactivity in the hippocampal CA1, CA2 areas, and subiculum was lowest at 3h after seizure on-set; thereafter, the immunoreactivity became to increase to 12h after seizure on-set. Mossy fibers, Schaffer collaterals and dentate granule cells showed the highest CB immunoreactivity at 3h after seizure on-set; thereafter, the immunoreactivity became to decrease. In the case of the intrinsic and output connections of the hippocampus, a rapid decrease of CB serves an inhibitory function, which regulates the seizure activity and output signals from the hippocampus.",
