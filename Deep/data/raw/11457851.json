     "AB": "Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are cationic channels activated by extracellular protons. They are expressed in sensory neurons, where they are thought to be involved in pain perception associated with tissue acidosis. They are also expressed in brain. A number of brain regions, like the hippocampus, contain large amounts of chelatable vesicular Zn(2+). This paper shows that Zn(2+) potentiates the acid activation of homomeric and heteromeric ASIC2a-containing channels (i.e. ASIC2a, ASIC1a+2a, ASIC2a+3), but not of homomeric ASIC1a and ASIC3. The EC(50) for Zn(2+) potentiation is 120 and 111 microm for the ASIC2a and ASIC1a+2a current, respectively. Zn(2+) shifts the pH dependence of activation of the ASIC1a+2a current from a pH(0.5) of 5.5 to 6.0. Systematic mutagenesis of the 10 extracellular histidines of ASIC2a leads to the identification of two residues (His-162 and His-339) that are essential for the Zn(2+) potentiating effect. Mutation of another histidine residue, His-72, abolishes the pH sensitivity of ASIC2a. This residue, which is located just after the first transmembrane domain, seems to be an essential component of the extracellular pH sensor of ASIC2a.",
