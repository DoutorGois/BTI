     "AB": "1. Negative schizophrenic and unipolar depressive patients were clinically assessed. In addition to this SANS and HRSD tests were administered. 2. SPECT and AEP measurements were provided. SPECT resulted in quantified brain blood perfusion, by means of average \"count/pixel\" values in the brain regions of interest. AEPs resulted in stored multichannel signal waveforms. 3. Statistical analyses of blood perfusion measurement data revealed an overall similarity between these two disorders in the majority of brain regions. An exception to this are the regions: inferior temporalis, inferior occipitalis, hippocampus and the anterior basal ganglia. Both diagnostic groups manifested hypofrontality. In general, hypoperfusion of the left hemisphere was found, albeit displaying different patterns in the two groups investigated. 4. AEP latencies were prolonged and found to be similar in both diagnostic groups, whilst AEP amplitudes were smaller in schizophrenics compared to depressives.",
