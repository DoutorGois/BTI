     "AB": "The microvasculature in selected brain regions in rats was examined on postnatal day 10 following exposure to alcohol on postnatal days 4 to 10. The alcohol-exposed rats were artificially reared and given 6.6 g/kg of ethanol condensed into 8 hr of each 24-hr period. A gastrostomy-control group was reared in the same manner but maltose-dextrin was substituted for ethanol in the formula. A suckle-control group was reared normally by dams. Measurements were taken from midsagittal sections of the cerebellum and sections of the hippocampal formation at a midtemporal level. Although the overall area of the vermal cerebellum was decreased as a consequence of the alcohol exposure, the capillary density was unchanged. However, cerebellar capillary diameters were increased in some lobules in the alcohol-exposed rats. In the dentate gyrus, there was a trend toward a decrease in capillary numerical density but no change in regional area or capillary diameter in the alcohol-exposed rats. In the hippocampus proper, there was a decrease in regional area, no change in capillary density, and an increase in capillary diameter due to alcohol. These results indicate that alcohol exposure during the early postnatal period affects the microvasculature differentially in the cerebellum, hippocampus proper and dentate gyrus.",
