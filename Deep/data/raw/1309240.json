     "AB": "Antibodies raised against the synthetic peptide NH2-QKSDDDYEDYASNKTC-COOH (gamma 2 1-15 Cys), which corresponds to the N-terminal amino acid sequence with a C-terminal cysteine of the human gamma 2 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor, were used to study the quantitative immunoprecipitation of agonist benzodiazepine binding sites from bovine brain. Anti-gamma 2 1-15 Cys antibodies were found to immunoprecipitate specifically in parallel [3H]flunitrazepam- and [3H]muscimol-reversible binding sites in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum percentages of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of bovine cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus were 68, 77, and 83%, respectively. Immunoprecipitation studies with anti-alpha 1 324-341 antibodies carried out in parallel with anti-gamma 2 1-15 Cys antibodies provided evidence for the promiscuity of the gamma 2 subunit within native GABAA receptors. These results substantiate the association of the gamma 2 polypeptide with native GABAA receptors.",
