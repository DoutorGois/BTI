     "AB": "Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is present in the developing rat brain and has been shown to provide critical trophic support for hippocampal neurons in culture. The influence of bFGF on the expression of mRNAs encoding the transcription factors zif/268 and c-fos was studied in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons (derived from rat embryos) using reverse transcription-coupled PCR. In these cultures grown for 3 days in the absence of serum, bFGF causes a dramatic and transient increase in the levels of zif/268 and c-fos, within 15 and 30 min, respectively. A similar induction of these two early genes occurs following activation of protein kinase C (PKC). The bFGF-induced activation persists after PKC desensitization but is inhibited by chelation of intracellular Ca2+. These results suggest that in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, bFGF induces the expression of immediate early genes through a pathway that requires Ca2+ mobilization.",
