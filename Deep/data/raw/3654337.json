     "AB": "This study has examined the karyometric changes within pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, motor area 6 and visual area 17 in a hypothyroid group of male mice treated with propylthiouracil, with or without interruption of treatment at the 35th postnatal day. Hypothyroidism resulted in decrease of nuclear size in the three areas before puberty and even after puberty in the hippocampus. Where the treatment was continued throughout the experimental period there was a progressive increase of nuclear size in both visual and motor areas.",
