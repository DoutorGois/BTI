     "AB": "Systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) blocks the expression of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus of the rat. This is coupled with increased IL-1beta concentration and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase activity, as well as an increase in the number of cells displaying apoptotic characteristics in the hippocampus. Vasogen's Immune Modulation Therapy (IMT) is a procedure involving intramuscular administration of syngeneic blood which has been exposed ex vivo to elevated temperature, oxidation and ultraviolet light. We report that Vasogen's IMT significantly abrogates these LPS-induced effects with a concomitant increase in the concentration of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These data suggest that Vasogen's IMT may play a protective role against the deleterious effects of immune insults in the brain.",
