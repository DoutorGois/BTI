     "AB": "The distribution of somatostatin receptors (SRIF-R) was analyzed in the limbic system of the adult rat by in vitro autoradiography with [125I-Tyr0,DTrp 8]S14 as a radioligand. Precise quantification of the density of binding sites, at 0.2 mm intervals throughout the different areas revealed a marked heterogeneity of labeling in most structures. In particular, SRIF-R were concentrated in the basal (104.4 +/- 3.3 fmol/mg proteins) and basolateral amygdaloid nuclei (94.8 +/- 4.3 fmol/mg proteins), and in the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (121.6 +/- 2.4 fmol/mg proteins), whereas moderate densities were detected in the amygdalo-hippocampal nucleus (76.4 +/- 2.8 fmol/mg proteins). The medial (41.3 +/- 1.9 fmol/mg proteins) and the central (24.0 +/- 1.4 fmol/mg proteins) amygdaloid nuclei contained lower SRIF-R concentrations. It appears from these observations, in the light of the anatomical pathways of the amygdala, that intra-amygdalian SRIF-containing neurons project to the amygdalo-hippocampal nucleus, and that SRIF-R in the basolateral complex are the target of afferents from limbic cortical areas. SRIF-R were detected at different levels of the hippocampal formation but their distribution was more restricted than that of SRIF-containing fibers. The maximal density of sites was detected in the ventral and dorsal parts of the subiculum (115.0 +/- 3.4 and 87.0 +/- 2.8 fmol/mg proteins, respectively) and in the parasubiculum (100.1 +/- 5.4 fmol/mg proteins). In Ammon's horn, the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum of the CA1 field were the only sites enriched in SRIF-R (74.1 +/- 2.0 and 74.6 +/- 1.9 fmol/mg proteins, respectively). The apparent lack of receptors in the pyramidal cell layer indicated that, in Ammon's horn, SRIF is involved in intra-hippocampal communication. Low levels of receptors were found in the hippocampal CA2 and CA3 fields. SRIF-R in the dentate gyrus were mainly concentrated in the molecular layer (57.3 +/- 1.2 fmol/mg proteins). A very high density of sites was also observed in the entorhinal cortex (up to 123.1 +/- 1.5 fmol/mg proteins). A clear mismatch between SRIF and SRIF-R was detected in the septum and the habenula. In the profound layers of the cingulum and retrosplenial cortex, a heterogeneous distribution of SRIF-R was observed. High concentrations of sites were detected in the rostral zone of the cingulate cortex (93.4 +/- 2.0 fmol/mg proteins) while the posterior cingulate only exhibited moderate concentrations of sites (66.5 +/- 0.7 fmol/mg proteins).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
