     "AB": "Parvalbumin (PARV), a Ca(2+)-binding protein believed to play a role in neuronal excitability, is contained in certain GABAergic inhibitory neurons of the cerebral cortex. Here we report that expression of PARV in the developing neocortex of rats and mice occurs with a sequence which does not follow the usual 'inside-out' gradient of cortical development. Thus, PARV-immunoreactive neurons appear first in layer V and only thereafter in the remaining cortical layers. An adult-like pattern of immunoreactivity is reached simultaneously in layers II-III and VIb. These observations indicate that the mechanisms regulating the functional maturation of PARV-containing inhibitory neurons are different from those that generally govern developmental processes in the cortex.",
