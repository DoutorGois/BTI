     "AB": "UNLABELLED: Helminthic infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality in many developing countries, where children bear the greatest health burden. The ability of parasites to cause behavioral changes in the host has been observed in a variety of host-parasite systems, including the Taenia crassiceps-mouse model. In murine cysticercosis, mice exhibit a disruption in the sexual, aggressive and avoidance predator behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to characterize short-term memory and depression-like behavior, as well as levels of neurotransmitters and cytokines in the hippocampus of cysticercotic male and female mice. METHODS: Cytokines were detected by RT-PCR and neurotransmitters were quantified by HPLC. RESULTS: Chronic cysticercosis infection induced a decrease in short-term memory in both male and female mice, having a more pronounced effect in females. Infected females showed a significant increase in forced swimming tests with a decrease in immobility. In contrast, male mice showed an increment in total activity and ambulation tests. Serotonin levels decreased by 30% in the hippocampus of infected females whereas noradrenaline levels significantly increased in infected males. The hippocampal expression of IL-4 increased in infected female mice, but decreased in infected male mice. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that intraperitoneal chronic infection with cysticerci in mice leads to persistent deficits in tasks dependent on the animal's hippocampal function. Our findings are a first approach to elucidating the role of the neuroimmune network in controlling short-term memory and mood in T. crassiceps-infected mice.",
