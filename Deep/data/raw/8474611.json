CT and MRI scan failed to document any morphological abnormalities of his brain. However, high resolution rCBF imaging by HMPAO and SPECT demonstrated relatively low-flow areas in the left middle frontal gyrus and the right mesiotemporal/hippocampal region corresponding to the localization of EEG changes.",
