     "AB": "Rats were treated with 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD) daily for 30 days. Hippocampal microslices were then incubated with [32P]phosphate and the in vitro rate of phosphorylation and the immuno-content of glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP) were measured. Exposure to 2,5-HD decreased by 25% the immuno-content of GFAP and increased by 35% its rate of phosphorylation, resulting in an increase of 88% in the ratio phosphorylation rate/immuno-content for this protein.",
