     "AB": "Cerebral vasospasm (CVS) is a severe complication that occurs following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been used to evaluate brain injury following SAH in humans. The present study was designed to assess a rabbit model of symptomatic CVS (SCVS) and the utility of MRA in evaluating SCVS in rabbits. Japanese white rabbits (n=24) were randomly divided into 2 equal groups: A sham group and a SAH group. Neurological scores were evaluated for 7 days following SAH. Basilar artery (BA) diameters were measured using MRA preoperatively and 7 days postoperatively. Rabbits were sacrificed 7 days following SAH and the BA diameter of each rabbit was determined using histological evaluation. Compared with the Sham group, neurological function was significantly reduced in the SAH group at all time points (P<0.05). Furthermore, the BA diameter was significantly smaller in the SAH group on day 7 compared with the baseline measurement (P<0.05). No significant difference was observed between histological and MRA findings in either group at day 7. Histological changes in the hippocampus consistent with ischemia were observed in the SAH group. Hippocampal ischemia was also identified in the SAH group via MRA and there was no difference in detection rates following the use of MRA and histochemistry. MRA appears to be an effective method for assessing vasospasms of the BA and ischemic changes to the hippocampus in a rabbit model of SCVS. Furthermore, the animal model used in the present study may be beneficial for the future study of SCVS.",
