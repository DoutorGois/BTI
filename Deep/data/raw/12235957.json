     "AB": "A rare outbreak of acute hepatic damage in workers exposed to dichloropropanols was reported in 1992. As there are no detailed reports of dichloropropanols (DCPs) toxicity and its mechanism, we reviewed the toxicity of dichloropropanols using our results. 1) A marked elevation of serum AST and ALT with massive necrosis of the liver was noted in the 1/2 x, the 1 x and 2 x LD50 (0.149 mg/kg) of 1, 3-dichloro-2-propanol(DC 2 P). Hepatic malondialdehyde level was significantly increased, and associated with a decrease in liver glutathione S-transferase activity and reduced glutathione content. It is suggested that the free radical is associated with DCPs. 2) A reduction of leukocytes, platelets and fibrinogen, and prolonged prothrombin time were observed in the 1 x LD50 of DC 2 P. 3) In the CA1 area of the hippocampus, inhibition of population spikes was reduced by the 1 x LD50 of DC 2 P. This research was completed with the assistance of several other papers concerning dichloropropanols toxicity.",
