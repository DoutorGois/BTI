     "AB": "Antipsychotic drugs have been reported to increase the expression of subunits of the NMDA receptor at the level of mRNA but it is not clear whether such effects are apparent at the level of the radioligand binding or receptor protein. Therefore, we examined the effect of treatment of, and withdrawal from, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, olanzapine or clozapine on the binding of [3H]N-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine ([3H]TCP ) to the open ion channel of the NMDA receptor in rat caudate-putamen, hippocampus and frontal cortex. [3H]TCP binding was not significantly different in the caudate-putamen, hippocampus and cortex after three months of treatment with any antipsychotic drug. There were significant decreases in [3H]TCP binding in rat caudate-putamen and cortex, but not hippocampus, one month after ceasing treatment. Decreases in the caudate-putamen were detected in rats previously treated with chlorpromazine (0.1 mg/kg/day) and clozapine (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg/day). In the cortex, decreases in [3H]TCP binding were also detected in rats previously treated with olanzapine (0.1 mg/kg/day) for three months. These data suggest that changes in the NMDA receptor associated ion channels occur following antipsychotic drug withdrawal.",
