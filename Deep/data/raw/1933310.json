     "AB": "Spontaneous hippocampal EEG activity and evoked field potentials were investigated in intact rats and in animals with fetal hippocampal grafts. Pieces of hippocampal grafts, derived from 15- to 16-day-old fetuses, were used to prepare cell suspensions and grafted directly into the intact hippocampus. Control animals received suspension grafts of the cerebellum derived from fetuses of identical age. Host hippocampal electrical patterns were monitored with chronic single electrodes or with a 16-microelectrode probe from 7 to 10 months after grafting. In contrast to previously reported high survival rates of fetal grafts in studies with damage to the host brain prior to grafting, survival of both hippocampal (60%) and cerebellar grafts (20%) was very poor in the intact hippocampus. In animals with cerebellar transplants or without surviving grafted neurons the electrical activity of the host hippocampus was indistinguishable from normal controls. In rats with hippocampal grafts short duration, large amplitude EEG spikes (up to 10 mV) were recorded, predominantly during immobility. When the EEG spikes (putative interictal spikes) were of large amplitude and contained population spikes, test evoked responses delivered to the perforant path were suppressed after the spontaneous events. In contrast, evoked responses were facilitated by interictal spikes without population spikes. The threshold of electrically induced afterdischarges did not differ significantly between groups of intact rats and animals with or without hippocampal grafts. However, in three rats with hippocampal grafts the evoked afterdischarges were associated with behavioral seizures. In two of these rats spontaneously occurring seizures were also observed. Synaptophysin-immunoreactivity demonstrated growth of the host mossy fibers into the graft.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
