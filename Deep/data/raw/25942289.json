     "AB": "Addictive behavior is increasingly accepted as a drug-associated pathological memory in which the hippocampus is profoundly engaged. It has been well documented that adaptations of synaptic plasticity of excitatory transmission in the hippocampus may contribute to opioid addiction. However, it remains unknown whether and how adaptive changes of synaptic plasticity of inhibitory transmission in the hippocampus occurs during opioid abuse. Here, we reported that a single in vivo morphine exposure (SM) did not affect inhibitory long-term depression (I-LTD) in the hippocampus, compared with saline control; while repeated morphine exposure (RM) abolished this I-LTD. Interestingly, opioid withdrawal for 3-5 days after repeated (RMW), but not a single morphine exposure (SMW), largely enhanced I-LTD. More importantly, the I-LTD in single morphine treatment is dependent on presynaptic mechanism since it can be blocked by AM251, a selective cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist. While the large I-LTD in RMW group is dependent on combinatorial presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms since it can be blocked by co-application of AM251 and L-type calcium channel blocker LaCl3. Thus, these results demonstrate that opioid use and withdrawal drive the dynamics of presynaptic and postsynaptic I-LTD expression in the hippocampus that may contribute to the persistent behavioral changes during opioid abuse.",
