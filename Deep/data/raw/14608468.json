     "AB": "We examined alterations in post-transcriptional regulation following deafferentation of the perforant pathway by focusing on heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2 and B1 in rat hippocampi subjected to perforant pathway lesions. In control brains, immunoreactivity to both was observed in the nuclei of neurons throughout the hippocampus using immunohistochemical techniques. From 1 to 14 days post-lesion, a slight increase in A2 immunoreactivity was observed in neurons within the dentate granular layer as well in the pyramidal cells of the cornus Ammon fields ipsilateral to the lesion. In contrast, we observed a marked decrease in B1 immunoreactivity in the same regions at 1, 3 and 7 days post-lesion. All these alterations, however, were transient. A2 immunoreactivity returned to normal levels by 30 days post-lesion, and B1 immunoreactivity had completely recovered by 14 days post-lesion. The results of immunoblot analysis for A2 and B1 were wholly consistent with immunohistochemical observations. Our study suggests that post-transcriptional regulation in the hippocampal neurons changes after a perforant pathway lesion. Our study further suggests that the functions of hnRNPA2 and B1 are different, as each was differentially involved in the plastic response to deafferentation of the perforant pathway.",
