     "AB": "Experiments on rabbits with electrodes chronically implanted into the cortex and deep brain structures were made to examine the changes that occur during epileptiform reactions induced by electric stimulation of the motor cortex. Formation of different epileptiform reactions, seizures and hyperkineses was dependent on the current intensity and regimen. It is suggested that the development of stable chronic changes on the electrogram and in the animals' behavior in the course of a direct action on the \"dispatch\" and \"destination\" stations may be a consequence of the functioning of the determinant \"dispatch\" station and formation of the pathological system.",
