     "AB": "In this work, the distributions of some acid-sensitive two-pore-domain K+ channels (TASK-1, TASK-2 and TASK-3) were investigated in the rat and human cerebellum. Astrocytes situated in rat cerebellar tissue sections were positive for TASK-2 channels. Purkinje cells were strongly stained and granule cells and astrocytes were moderately positive for TASK-3. Astrocytes isolated from the hippocampus, cerebellum and cochlear nucleus expressed TASK channels in a primary tissue culture. Our results suggest that TASK channel expression may be significant in the endoplasmic reticulum of the astrocytes. The human cerebellum showed weak TASK-2 immunolabelling. The pia mater, astrocytes, Purkinje and granule cells demonstrated strong TASK-1 and TASK-3 positivities. The TASK-3 labelling was stronger in general, but it was particularly intense in the Purkinje cells and pia mater.",
