     "AB": "Autophagy is responsible for the degradation of long-lived proteins and damaged organelles intracellular, even extracellular,and autophagy is proved to have relationship with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging. The senescence accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) was a non-genetically modified mice widely used as a rodent model of aging and senile dementia. However, little was known about the age-related changes of autophagy in the brain of SAMP8 mice. To better understand the precise relationship between aging, autophagy and neurodegeneration, we explored the time course of cognitive ability, ubiquitin-positive inclusions, ultrastructure of neurons and detected the expression of LC3 and Beclin 1 protein in different brain regions of 2, 7 and 12-month-old SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice. We found that 7 and 12-month-old SAMP8 mice presented cognitive decline and ubiquitinated proteins enhanced. In the hippocampal neurons of 12-month-old SAMP8 mice, lots of dense clumps and autophagic vacuoles were found in the cytoplasm and axons. The LC3-II expression showed an increase in hippocampus and cortex of 7 and 12-month-old SAMP8 mice. The expression of Beclin 1 displayed a significant increase in 7 months old and a decline in 12 months old mice. Based on these data, we suggest that the autophagic activity maybe increase reactively at the beginning of AD and then showed a decline with aging, and the pathological changes of 12-month-old SAMP8 mice are more similar to the late-onset AD in the perspective of autophagy.",
