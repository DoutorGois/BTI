     "AB": "1. Adenosine is an endogenous neuromodulator that exerts its depressant effect on neurons by acting on the A1 adenosine receptor subtype. Excitatory actions of adenosine, mediated by the activation of the A2 adenosine receptor subtype, have also been shown in the central nervous system. 2. Adenosine A2a receptors are highly localized in the striatum, as demonstrated by the binding assay of the A2a selective agonist, CGS2680, and by analysis of the A2 receptor mRNA localization with in situ hybridization histochemistry. However, adenosine A2a, receptors, albeit at lower levels, are also localized in other brain regions, such as the cortex and the hippocampus. 3. In the striatum, adenosine A2a, receptors are implicated in the control of motor activity. Evidences exists of an antagonistic interaction between adenosine A2a and dopamine D2 receptors. 4. Utilizing selective agonists and antagonists for adenosine A2a receptors, their role in the modulation of the release of several neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, dopamine, glutamate, GABA) has been extensively studied in the brain (striatum, cortex, hippocampus). Controversial results have been obtained and, because the overall effect of endogenous adenosine in the brain is that of an inhibitory tonus, the physiological meaning of the excitatory A2 receptor remains to be clarified.",
