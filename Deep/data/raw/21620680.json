     "AB": "Here we describe a new non-human primate model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) to better investigate the cause/effect relationships of human TLE. Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in adult marmosets by pilocarpine injection (250mg/kg; i.p.). The animals were divided in 2 groups: acute (8h post-SE) and chronic (3 and 5 months post-SE). To manage the severity of SE, animals received diazepam 5min after the SE onset (acute group: 2.5 or 1.25mg/kg; i.p.; chronic group/; 1.25mg/kg; i.p). All animals were monitored by video and electrocorticography to assess SE and subsequent spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). To evaluate brain injury produced by SE or SRS we used argyrophil III, Nissl and neo-Timm staining techniques. Magnetic resonance image was also performed in the chronic group. We observed that pilocarpine was able to induce SE followed by SRS after a variable period of time. Prolonged SE episodes were associated with brain damage, mostly confined to the hippocampus and limbic structures. Similar to human TLE, anatomical disruption of dentate gyrus was observed after SRS. Our data suggest that pilocarpine marmoset model of epilepsy has great resemblance to human TLE, and could provide new tools to further evaluate the subtle changes associated with human epilepsy.",
