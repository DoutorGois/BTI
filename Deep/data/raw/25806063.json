     "AB": "In the present study, transplantation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells modified with brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene into the lateral ventricle of a rat model of Alzheimer's disease, resulted in significant attenuation of nerve cell damage in the hippocampal CA1 region. Furthermore, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tyrosine kinase B mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased, and learning and memory were significantly improved. Results indicate that transplantation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells modified with brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene can significantly improve cognitive function in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease, possibly by increasing the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tyrosine kinase B in the hippocampus.",
