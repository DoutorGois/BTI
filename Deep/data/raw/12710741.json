     "AB": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) concentrations (0.1-1 mM) on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), (Na+,K+)-ATPase and Mg(2+)-ATPase activities in homogenates of adult and aged rat hippocampi. Tissues were homogenised, centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min and in the supernatant, AChE activity and Na+,K(+)-ATPase and Mg(2+)-ATPase activities were determined according to Ellman's method and Bowler's and Tirri's method, respectively. After an 1-3 h preincubation of the homogenised tissue with CDP-choline, a maximal AChE stimulation of about 25% for both adult and aged rats (p < 0.001) and a Na+,K(+)-ATPase activation of about 50% for adult rats (p < 0.001) and about 60% for aged rats (p < 0.001) were observed, while hippocampal Mg(2+)-ATPase activity was not influenced in either adult or aged animals. It is suggested that: CDP-choline can restore hippocampal AChE and Na+,K(+)-ATPase activities in the aged rat and thus it may play a role in improving memory performance which is impaired by aging and some neuronal disturbances.",
