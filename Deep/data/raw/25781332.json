     "AB": "AIMS: Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) suffer the symptoms of psychological distress, including excessive and uncontrollable anxiety. Until now, the functional neuroanatomy for working memory (WM) in conjunction with the major anxiety symptoms in GAD patients has not yet been clearly identified. This study investigated the neural activation patterns associated with the effect of neutral and anxiety-inducing distractors during the delayed-response WM task in GAD patients. METHODS: Eighteen patients with GAD and 18 age-matched healthy controls participated in this study. The functional magnetic resonance images were obtained while the subjects performed a delayed-response WM task with neutral and anxiety-inducing distractors. RESULTS: During the neutral distractor, GAD patients compared to controls showed significantly lower activities in the fusiform gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, precuneus, superior occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, cuneus, calcarine gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and cerebellar cortex. During the anxiety-inducing distractor, GAD patients showed significantly higher activity in the hippocampus, whereas they showed lower activities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, precuneus, superior occipital gyrus and cerebellar cortex. The blood-oxygen-level dependent signal changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in GAD patients during the anxiety-inducing distractor were negatively correlated with Anxiety Sensitivity Index-Revised scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the specific brain areas associated with the interaction between emotional regulation and cognitive function associated with neutral and anxiety-inducing distractors during WM maintenance in GAD patients. These findings will be helpful for understanding the neural mechanism on the WM-related cognitive deficits and emotional dysfunction with typical anxiety symptoms in GAD.",
