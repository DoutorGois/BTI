     "AB": "Newborn rats were exposed to intermittent hypobaric hypoxia from birth until the age of 19 days. Spatial memory was tested in a Morris water maze from postnatal day (P) 23 to P32 and from P100 to P109. From P24 to P27 and on days P100 and P101, the escape latencies of hypoxic animals were longer than those of controls. At P24, the number of neuronal bodies increased in cortical layer II of the somatosensory, motor, and auditory areas, and in layer V of the motor area, but the number of neuronal bodies throughout the whole cortical thickness was unchanged. Decreases in the immunostaining density for neurofilaments (anti-NF 160), astrocytes (anti-GFAP), and oligodendrocytes (RIP) were found in the hippocampus, and the typical parallel organisation of neuronal and macroglial processes was lost. Decreases in immunostaining for neurofilaments and oligodendrocytes were also found in the somatosensory cortex and motor cortex. In adult hypoxic rats, at P114-P240, the number of neuronal bodies and the immunostaining density for neurofilaments, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the examined areas were similar to adult controls; however, in the hippocampus we found hypertrophy of fine astrocytic processes and a decreased number of oligodendrocytic processes. We conclude that the neonatal brain damage induced by hypobaric hypoxia impairs spatial memory in infant as well as adult rats. Hypobaric hypoxia delays the maturation of neurones and substantially affects macroglia in the cortex and hippocampus.",
