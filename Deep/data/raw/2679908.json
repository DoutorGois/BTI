     "AB": "The influence of diazepam (1; 5; 10 mg/kg, i. p.), chlorpromazine (1 mg/kg) and amphetamine (1; 5 mg/kg) on the Fourier's spectral EEG power of sensomotor cortex and dorsal hippocampus and conflict behavior freely moving albino and cotton (Sigmondon hispidus) rats was studied. Effects of diazepam (5 mg/kg) in cotton rats were similar, but influence on the theta-activity was more expressed. Correlation between slowing of theta-activity and extent of anxiolytic effect in conflict situation was showed. On the basis of the results obtained the authors discuss possible mutual relations between the influence of diazepam on EEG and anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines.",
