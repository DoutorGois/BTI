     "AB": "N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM)-sensitive factor (NSF) associates with soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP), that binds to SNAP receptors (SNAREs) including syntaxin, SNAP25, and synaptobrevin. The complex of NSF/SNAP/SNAREs plays a critical role in the regulation of vesicular traffic. The present study investigated NEM-regulated alpha7 ACh receptor translocation. NSF associated with beta-SNAP and the SNAREs syntaxin 1 and synaptobrevin 2 in the rat hippocampus. NSF also associated with the alpha7 ACh receptor subunit, the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2, and the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor gamma2 subunit. NEM, an inhibitor of NSF, significantly dissociated the alpha7 ACh receptor subunit from a complex with NSF and increased cell surface localization of the receptor subunit, but such effect was not obtained with the GluA1, GluA2 or gamma2 subunits. NEM, alternatively, dissociated synaptobrevin 2 from an assembly of NSF/beta-SNAP/syntaxin 1/synaptobrevin 2. NEM significantly increased the rate of nicotine-triggered AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, without affecting the amplitude, in rat hippocampal slices. The results of the present study indicate that NEM releases the alpha7 ACh receptor subunit and synaptobrevin 2 from an assembly of alpha7 ACh receptor subunit/NSF/beta-SNAP/syntaxin 1/synaptobrevin 2, thereby promoting delivery of the alpha7 ACh receptor subunit to presynaptic membrane.",
