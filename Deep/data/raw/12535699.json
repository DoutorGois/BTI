     "AB": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls the exchange of peptides and regulatory proteins between the central nervous system (CNS) and the blood. Transport across the BBB of such regulatory substances is altered in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. These alterations could lead to cognitive impairments or diminish their therapeutic potential. Here, we measured the transport rate of radioactively labeled pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) from blood into whole brain and into 11 brain regions in three groups of mice: young (2 months old) ICR, young (2 months old) SAMP8, and aged (12 months old) SAMP8 mice. The SAMP8 is a strain which develops impaired learning and memory with aging that correlates with an age-related increase in brain levels of amyloid beta protein (A beta P). PACAP is a powerful neurotrophin that may have a therapeutic role in neurodegenerative diseases. We found that I-PACAP crossed the BBB fastest at the hypothalamus and the hippocampus in all three groups. Slower transport rates into the whole brain, the olfactory bulb, the hypothalamus, and the hippocampus for aged SAMP8 mice was likely related to differences both from strain and expression of A beta P with aging.",
