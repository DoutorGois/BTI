     "AB": "Chaotic oscillations of extracellular potential of field-type nerve tissues are simulated by a 2D coupled map lattice. These tissues, say, the fields of the hippocampus, are represented by neural mass sheets consisting of current sources. The relationship between the source-sink ensembles and the extracellular field potential at each discrete instant of time t = 1, 2, ... is described by a single-site map creating chaos. The 2D coupled map lattice is viewed as a network of diffusively coupled the maps creating spatiotemporal chaos. The conversion of chaotic oscillations into synchronous ones, which are typical for epileptiform discharges, is studied. The results obtained are in good agreement with those derived from hippocampal slices treated with picrotoxin.",
