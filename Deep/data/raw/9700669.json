     "AB": "Levels of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were determinate in serum of intact rats (INT) and those with septohippocampal pathway lesion (SHPL), which received Cerebrolysin (CRB) or saline solution (SAL) for a week. We found that Cerebrolysin induces a decrease on the CAT and SOD levels. Decrease of CAT levels (19.1) in the group of SHPL-CRB was higher than the values obtained (57.3) in SHPL-SAL group. The lowest CAT levels were detected in the INT-CER group (16.7). The SOD levels obtained in SHPL-CER group (9.84) were also smaller than those obtained in the SHPL-SAL group (14.9) which showed the highest levels of SOD, while the INT animals showed the lowest levels (7.6). In addition, the SHPL animals mortality was of 18% for the CER group against 43% for SAL group. We suggest the Cerebrolysin effect on CAT and SOD activity is related with a beneficial antioxidative role which may have potential application on brain injury.",
