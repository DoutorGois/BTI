     "AB": "We have developed an in vivo 3H-d-LSD-binding method in the rat brain to measure the 3H-d-LSD concentration in specific brain regions and nuclei. In the cortex, d-LSD binding sites increase from the occipital to the frontal part without a change in their affinity. Compared to the hippocampus, striatum, cortex and raphe nuclei, the substantia nigra contains a d-LSD binding site of lower affinity.",
