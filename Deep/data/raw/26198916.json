     "AB": "Microglia are resident immunocompetent cells having important roles in innate immunity in the brains. In the present study, we found that a single lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration significantly increased microglial proliferation in the fornix and dentate gyrus (DG) but not the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum of adult mice. LPS-induced microglial proliferation was especially robust at the white matter of the fornix. The density of microglia increased in the fornix and DG for roughly one week and returned to basal levels at least 20days after a single LPS administration. Consecutive LPS administration did not induce such dramatic increase of microglial proliferation in the fornix. The inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling by AZD2171 largely suppressed LPS-induced increase of microglial proliferation in the fornix. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the hippocampal neuronal system has a higher proliferative microglial capability against LPS-induced inflammatory administration compared with other brain regions.",
