     "AB": "Although apolipoprotein (apo) E is synthesized in the brain primarily by astrocytes, neurons in the central nervous system express apoE, albeit at lower levels than astrocytes, in response to various physiological and pathological conditions, including excitotoxic stress. To investigate how apoE expression is regulated in neurons, we transfected Neuro-2a cells with a 17-kilobase human apoE genomic DNA construct encoding apoE3 or apoE4 along with upstream and downstream regulatory elements. The baseline expression of apoE was low. However, conditioned medium from an astrocytic cell line (C6) or from apoE-null mouse primary astrocytes increased the expression of both isoforms by 3-4-fold at the mRNA level and by 4-10-fold at the protein level. These findings suggest that astrocytes secrete a factor or factors that regulate apoE expression in neuronal cells. The increased expression of apoE was almost completely abolished by incubating neurons with U0126, an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), suggesting that the Erk pathway controls astroglial regulation of apoE expression in neuronal cells. Human neuronal precursor NT2/D1 cells expressed apoE constitutively; however, after treatment of these cells with retinoic acid to induce differentiation, apoE expression diminished. Cultured mouse primary cortical and hippocampal neurons also expressed low levels of apoE. Astrocyte-conditioned medium rapidly up-regulated apoE expression in fully differentiated NT2 neurons and in cultured mouse primary cortical and hippocampal neurons. Thus, neuronal expression of apoE is regulated by a diffusible factor or factors released from astrocytes, and this regulation depends on the activity of the Erk kinase pathway in neurons.",
