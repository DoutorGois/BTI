     "AB": "Spontaneous alternation was examined in young rats following microinjections of antinicotinic agents into one of the 4 hippocampal sites: anterodorsal, or posteroventral dentate gyrus, hippocampal gyrus, or entorhinal cortex. In control and saline-injected animals, the alternation rate was shown to grow suddenly from 40 to 80% between days 15 and 17 (the adult level being 85-90%), to regress partly (to 55%) between days 20 and 30, and return to a near-adult level (75%) by day 40. Meanwhile fear responses to environment (defecation and vocalization) emerged between days 20 and 25, increased to a maximum until day 30, and returned to the typically low adult level by day 40. Injections of mecamylamine (5, 20 micrograms) or hexamethonium (5, 20 micrograms) into any of the 4 sites significantly reduced the rate of alternation from as early as day 10 on, but were no longer effective from day 30 on; on the other hand, they did not alter the level of defecation, but had a tendency to lower the level of vocalization on day 30 only. These results indicate that hippocampal nicotinic cholinergic mechanisms play a role in spontaneous alternation and appear to be involved in the control of one fear reaction (vocalization) until day 30.",
