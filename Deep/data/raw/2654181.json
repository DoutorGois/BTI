     "AB": "The rabies tissue culture infection test (RTCIT) and rapid rabies enzyme immunodiagnosis (RREID) were compared to the fluorescent-antibody test (FAT) with field specimens. At the French National Reference Center for Rabies, 15,248 specimens were analyzed by FAT and RTCIT, and 2,290 of those specimens were also tested by RREID; 818 other specimens were tested by FAT and RREID in 12 laboratories located in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The sensitivities and specificities of RREID and RTCIT were comparable. This study showed that both tests can be used as backup procedures to confirm FAT. RREID is also strongly recommended for epidemiological studies and for laboratories which are not equipped for performing FAT.",
