     "AB": "This study was performed to understand whether P165 improves learning and memory by restoring insulin action using a diabetes mellitus (DM) rat model. A total of 34 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (n = 8), DM group (n = 8), DM group treated with a low dose of P165 (n = 9), and DM group treated with a high dose of P165 (n = 9). After 8 weeks of treatment, the animals were killed and the expression of insulin signaling-related proteins was examined in the hippocampus by Western blot and immunohistochemical staining. Administration of P165 in diabetic rats did not induce a significant effect on the fasting blood glucose level. The expression of IR, IRS-1, AKT, p-CREB, and Bcl-2 proteins was significantly enhanced in the hippocampus in diabetic rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with P165 at both low and high doses significantly attenuated the expression levels of these proteins. Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining showed that IR, IRS-1, AKT, p-CREB, and Bcl-2 were abundantly expressed in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The number of cells positively stained for the above proteins was significantly higher in diabetic tissues compared to control tissues, whereas P165 treatments induced a significant reduction in the expression of these proteins. The expression of IR, IRS-1, AKT, p-CREB, and Bcl-2 was enhanced in DM rats, and administration of P165 normalized the expression of these molecules, suggesting that P165 can improve impaired insulin signal transduction.",
