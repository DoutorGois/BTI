     "AB": "Apoptosis is crucial for proper development of the CNS, wherein a significant percentage of all central neurons produced during early ontogeny die by apoptosis. To characterize the pattern of developmental programmed cell death, we assayed rat brainstem, neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum from birth through senescence. Quantitatively, using an ELISA for oligonucleosomal DNA fragments, we demonstrated that PND1 brainstem, neocortex, and hippocampus have the highest levels of fragmented DNA compared to older ages. Cerebellum displayed a large peak at PND10 and a smaller peak at PND21. Low levels were observed throughout adulthood and into senescence, which was corroborated qualitatively by agarose gel and TUNEL data. These data provide a temporal and regional baseline for further studies of the effects of perturbations of cell death during neural development. Quantitative and qualitative changes in these regional profiles of apoptosis due to environmental insults during early ontogeny may alter neuron number and function later in life.",
