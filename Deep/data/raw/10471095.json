     "AB": "The effects of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), paroxetine, and 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonists on in vivo extracellular 5-HT levels in the guinea-pig frontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus were investigated using the technique of microdialysis. The aim of the study was to further investigate the autoreceptor roles of the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors in the median vs dorsal raphe nuclei. In the frontal cortex, 5-HT1A (WAY 100635, 1 mg/kg i.p.) or 5-HT1B (SB-224289, 4 mg/kg i.p.) receptor antagonists had no effect on extracellular levels of 5-HT, whilst the mixed 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist (GR 127935, 0.3 mg/kg i.p) produced a significant decrease in extracellular 5-HT levels. Paroxetine (10 microM) significantly increased extracellular 5-HT levels when perfused locally into the cortex. Administration of SB-224289, followed 120 min later by WAY 100635, had no effect on extracellular 5-HT levels. In contrast, sequential administration of either WAY 100635 and GR 127935, or SB-224289 and paroxetine significantly increased extracellular 5-HT levels. In the dorsal hippocampus, whilst 5-HT1A receptor antagonism elicited by administration of WAY 100635 had no effect, both 5-HT1B and mixed 5-HT1B/1D receptor blockade significantly increased extracellular 5-HT levels. Administration of SB-224289 followed 120 min later with WAY 100635, or WAY 100635 followed 30 min later with GR 127935, potentiated the effect of the three compounds alone, significantly increasing extracellular 5-HT levels. These data demonstrate that to simultaneously increase extracellular 5-HT in both frontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus of the guinea-pig brain concurrent 5-HTA1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor blockade is required. Whereas in the dorsal hippocampus, 5-HT1B receptor blockade is sufficient to elicit an increase in extracellular 5-HT levels.",
