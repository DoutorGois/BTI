     "AB": "AIMS: To investigate the mechanism behind cytotoxic edema formation following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS: We explored the role of aquaporin-4 (AQP4), inwardly rectifying K(+) 4.1 (Kir4.1) channels and their upstream orchestrators p53 and p38MAPK in this process. A p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha) was administered intraperitoneally to rats undergoing SAH by endovascular perforation. Totally, 98 male SD rats were categorized into sham, SAH, SAH+ dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), SAH+ 0.2 or 2.0 mg/kg PFT-alpha groups. At 24 h after SAH, MRI (diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]), immunohistochemistry, and Western blot were used. RESULTS: MRI (DWI) showed a significant cytotoxic edema in the brain following SAH with PFT-alpha therapy reducing it. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot showed an increased level of p53, phosphorylated-p38MAPK and AQP4 and a reduced level of Kir4.1; all of which could be reversed following PFT-alpha treatment. Treble labeling staining revealed colocalization of p53 with phosphorylated-p38MAPK and unmatched expression of AQP4 and Kir4.1 within astrocyte cells. CONCLUSION: These results indicated p53 mediates the formation of cytotoxic edema in the brain following SAH; an uncoupling expression of AQP4 and Kir4.1 on astrocytic end feet orchestrated by p38MAPK was partly responsible.",
