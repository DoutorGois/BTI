     "AB": "The aim of the present work was to study the effects of interleukin-10 at concentrations of 1 and 10 ng/ml on the development of epileptiform discharges evoked in pyramidal neurons in field CA3 in rat hippocampal slices by transient episodes of hypoxia. Three 3-min episodes of hypoxia led to decreases in the generation threshold for evoked trains of population spikes and an increase in the number of population spikes per train in pyramidal neurons of field CA1. Interleukin-10 at a concentration of 1 ng/ml completely eliminated the development of epileptiform activity, while its protective effect was less marked at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. These effects of interleukin-10 on living hippocampal slices in in vitro conditions show that they may be associated with the functions of this cytokine as an intercellular mediator of the central nervous system itself rather than being mediated by the peripheral immune system. The results of these studies provide the first experimental evidence of the action of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 on the development of hypoxia-evoked epileptiform events in the hippocampus.",
