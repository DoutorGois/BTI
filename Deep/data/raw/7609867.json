     "AB": "Long-term consumption of ethanol both in human and rodent induces a process of chronic degeneration of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons which results in a cholinergic deafferentation of the cortical mantle. We have used quantitative northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization to demonstrate that these degenerative events in rat evoke an increase in the expression of the nerve growth factor gene in a number of brain areas, including the cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei and their cortical target regions. By combining non-radioactive in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry activated astrocytes were identified as the major source of altered nerve growth factor gene expression. This increased nerve growth factor expression is paralleled by a dendritic remodelling of basal forebrain neurons, while the expression of choline acetyltransferase in surviving neurons remains the same. This failure of nerve growth factor to rescue the expression of choline acetyltransferase differs from the effects of exogenously administered nerve growth factor in acutely lesioned systems. The results indicate that under certain conditions of chronic neurodegeneration, the utilization of nerve growth factor might be impaired, which could be due to a defective nerve growth factor signalling mechanism.",
