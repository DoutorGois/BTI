     "AB": "The effect of a single neonatal convulsion on subsequent behaviour was investigated in the male rat. Convulsions were induced by heat or pentylenetetrazol on days 1, 10 or 21. As adults, locomotor activity, spatial ability and convulsion susceptibility were measured. Significant differences were seen in some measures and some groups but a single neonatal convulsion did not induce a consistent and significant pattern of behavioural change, despite the persistent change in hippocampal physiology shown in a previous study.",
