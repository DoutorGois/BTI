     "AB": "Using field potential recording in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slices, the effects of eugenol on synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) were investigated. Population spikes (PS) were recorded in the stratum pyramidal following stimulation of stratum fibers. To induce LTP, eight episodes of theta pattern primed-bursts (PBs) were delivered. Eugenol decreased the amplitude of PS in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect was fast and completely reversible. Eugenol had no effect on PBs-induced LTP of PS. It is concluded that while eugenol depresses synaptic transmission it does not affect the ability of CA1 synapses for tetanus-induced LTP and plasticity.",
