     "AB": "Bacopa monniera is a nerve tonic used extensively in traditional Indian medicinal system \"Ayurveda\". Reports regarding its various antioxidative, adaptogenic and memory enhancing roles have already appeared in the last few decades. In the present study, aluminium chloride (AlCl(3)) was used to generate neurotoxicity. We have investigated the neuroprotective effect of Bacopa extract against aluminium-induced changes in peroxidative products, such as thio-barbituric acid-reactive substance (TBA-RS) and protein carbonyl contents and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Effect on lipofuscin (age pigments) accumulation and ultrastructural changes were also studied. Bacopa effects were compared with those of l-deprenyl. Co-administration of Bacopa extract during aluminium treatment significantly prevented the aluminium-induced decrease in SOD activity as well as the increased oxidative damage to lipids and proteins. Protective effect was also observed at microscopic level. Fluorescence and electron microscopic studies revealed considerable inhibition of intraneuronal lipofuscin accumulation and necrotic alteration in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Observations showed that Bacopa's neuroprotective effects were comparable to those of l-deprenyl at both biochemical and microscopic levels.",
