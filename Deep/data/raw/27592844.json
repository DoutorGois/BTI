     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate brain volumes in patients with well-characterized juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the MRI images of seventeen subjects with EEG and clinically defined JME and seventeen age- and sex-matched controls using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and automated and manual volumetry. RESULTS: We found no significant group differences in the cortical volumes by automated techniques for all regions or for the whole brain. However, we found a larger pulvinar nucleus in JME using VBM with small volume correction and a larger thalamus with manual volumetry (P = 0.001; corrected two-tailed t-test). By analysing the individual subjects, we determined that considerable heterogeneity exists even in this highly selected group. Histograms of all JME and matched control regions' volumes showed more subjects with JME had smaller hippocampi and larger thalami (P < 0.05; chi-square). Subjects in whom the first seizure was absence were more likely to have smaller hippocampi than their matched control, while those without absences showed no differences (P < 0.05, chi-square). CONCLUSIONS: There is ample evidence for frontal cortical thalamic network changes in JME, but subcortical structural differences were more distinct in this group. Given the heterogeneity of brain volumes in the clinical population, further advancement in the field will require the examination of stringent genetically controlled populations.",
