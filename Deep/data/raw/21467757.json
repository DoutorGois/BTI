     "AB": "In this study, we investigated the effects of S-allyl-L-cysteine (SAC), a major sulfur-containing compound present in garlic, on Ki67- and doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells, which were used as a marker for cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation, respectively, in the mouse dentate gyrus. SAC (300 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered to 8-week-old mice once a day for 3 weeks. The animals were then sacrificed at 11 weeks of age. SAC administration significantly increased Ki67-positive nuclei and DCX-immunoreactive neuroblasts in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT(1A)) levels in the hippocampus were also increased. These results suggest that SAC significantly increased cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation by increasing 5-HT(1A) levels in the dentate gyrus.",
