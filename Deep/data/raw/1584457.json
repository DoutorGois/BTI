     "AB": "Using a brief transient ischemic model, we examined changes in regional tissue calcium content and energy metabolism in the hippocampus. In the CA1 region, tissue calcium ions began to increase 24 h after reperfusion, accompanied by changes in tissue pH and ATP. In the CA3 region, energy metabolism remained unchanged for 72 h after reperfusion, and the calcium pool was first noted 24 h after reperfusion, while tissue calcium ions began to increase 48 h after reperfusion. These results suggest that the neurons in the CA3 region seem to survive because of the well-preserved metabolic function to cope with excessive calcium ions.",
