     "AB": "The subsynaptic distribution of kainate receptors is still a matter of much debate given its importance to understand the way they influence neuronal communication. Here, we show that, in synapses of the rat hippocampus, presynaptic kainate receptors are localized within the presynaptic active zone close to neurotransmitter release sites. The activation of these receptors with low concentrations of agonists induces the release of [(3)H]glutamate in the absence of a depolarizing stimulus. Furthermore, this modulation of [(3)H]glutamate release by kainate is more efficient when compared with a KCl-evoked depolarization that causes a more than two-fold increase in the intra-terminal calcium concentration but no apparent release of [(3)H]glutamate, suggesting a direct receptor-mediated process. Using a selective synaptic fractionation technique that allows for a highly efficient separation of presynaptic, postsynaptic and non-synaptic proteins we confirmed that, presynaptically, kainate receptors are mainly localized within the active zone of hippocampal synapses where they are expected to be in a privileged position to modulate synaptic phenomena.",
