     "AB": "Hippocampal neurons in slice preparations were injected with the fluorescent dye Lucifer Yellow CH. Pyramidal neurons in the CA1 and CA3 regions and granule cells in the area dentata were identified and their processes traced. The perikarya and dendrites of injected neurons were clearly visible. Axons could be traced in some cases for up to 500 micrometer before they passed out of the slice. In several cases dye was observed in more than one neuron after a single neuron alone was injected.",
