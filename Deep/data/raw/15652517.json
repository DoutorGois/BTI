     "AB": "To further explore the pathophysiological significance of arachidonic acid-sensitive potassium channels, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to investigate the expression changes of TREK channels in cortex and hippocampus in rat experimental acute cerebral ischemia in this study. Results showed that TREK-1 and TRAAK mRNA in cortex, TREK-1 and TREK-2 mRNA in hippocampus showed significant increases 2 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). While the mRNA expression levels of the all three channel subtypes increased significantly 24 h after MCAO in cortex and hippocampus. At the same time, the protein expressions of all the three channel proteins showed significant increase 24 h after MCAO in cortex and hippocampus, but only TREK-1 showed increased expression 2 h after MCAO in cortex and hippocampus. Immunohistochemical experiments verified that all the three channel proteins had higher expression levels in cortical and hippocampal neurons 24 h after MCAO. These results suggested a strong correlation between TREK channels and acute cerebral ischemia. TREK channels might provide a neuroprotective mechanism in the pathological process.",
