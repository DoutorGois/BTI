     "AB": "Modern neuro- and psychophysiological findings on commissurotomized (\"split-brain\") patients seem to confirm psychoanalytic theories. Twelve commissurotomized patients and one patient who had a right hemispherectomy showed an impoverishment of dreams, fantasies and symbolization. This might have been due to an interruption of the preconscious stream between the two hemispheres, which causes a separation of word-presentations from thing-presentations, as well as to a predominance of a feedback-free primary process in the right hemisphere. The similarity in operational thinking of psychosomatic and split-brain patients leads the author to hypothesize a \"functional commissurotomy\" in cases of severe psychosomatic disturbances.",
