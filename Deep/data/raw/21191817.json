     "AB": "Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) that modulate gene expression by inhibiting HDAC enzymes may contribute to the survival of immature hippocampal neurons. However, it remains unknown how and when HDACIs regulate the survival of newly generated immature hippocampal neurons. In the present study, if the treatment of valproic acid (VPA) and sodium butyrate (SBt) in the specific time window during the development of newly generated n eurons r esulted in the i ncreased survival of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)(+) neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus in mice was investigated. It was found that the number of BrdU(+) cells, the expressions of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and pCREB [D1] were increased by HDACIs when HDACIs were treated no later than 2-3 weeks after BrdU labeling. This suggests that epigenetic modification within a specific time window is critical for the survival of newborn hippocampal neurons by inhibiting the apoptotic pathway.",
