     "AB": "In order to examine if differences in activity and inducibility of antioxidative enzymes in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus are underlying their different sensitivity to radiation, we exposed four-day-old female Wistar rats to cranial radiation of 3 Gy of gamma-rays. After isolation of hippocampus and cortex 1 h or 24 h following exposure, activities of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and catalase (CAT) were measured and compared to unirradiated controls. MnSOD protein levels were determined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Our results showed that CuZnSOD activity in hippocampus and cortex was significantly decreased 1 h and 24 h after irradiation with 3 Gy of gamma-rays. MnSOD activity in both brain regions was also decreased 1 h after irradiation. 24 h following exposure, manganese SOD activity in hippocampus almost achieved control values, while in cortex it significantly exceeded the activity of the relevant controls. CAT activity in hippocampus and cortex remained stable 1 h, as well as 24 h after irradiation with 3 Gy of gamma-rays. MnSOD protein level in hippocampus and cortex decreased 1 h after irradiation with 3 Gy of gamma-rays. 24 h after exposure, MnSOD protein level in cortex was similar to control values, while in hippocampus it was still significantly decreased. We have concluded that regional differences in MnSOD radioinducibility are regulated at the level of protein synthesis, and that they represent one of the main reasons for region-specific radiosensitivity of the brain.",
