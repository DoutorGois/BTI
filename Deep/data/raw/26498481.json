     "AB": "Brain inflammation has a crucial role in various diseases of the central nervous system. The hippocampus in the mammalian brain exerts an important memory function, which is sensitive to various insults, including inflammation induced by exo/endotoxin stimuli. Tetanus toxin (TeT) is an exotoxin with the capacity for neuronal binding and internalization. The present study investigated changes in inflammatory mediators in the mouse hippocampus proper (CA13 regions) and dentate gyrus (DG) after TeT treatment. The experimental mice were intraperitoneally injected with TeT at a low dosage (100 ng/kg), while the control mice were injected with the same volume of saline. At 6, 12 and 24 h after TeT treatment, changes in the hippocampal levels of inflammatory mediators cyclooxygenase2 (COX2) and nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB/p65) were assessed using immunohistochemical and western blot analysis. In the control group, moderate COX2 immunoreactivity was observed in the stratum pyramidal (SP) of the CA23 region, while almost no expression was identified in the CA1 region and the DG. COX2 immunoreactivity was increased by TeT in the SP and granule cell layer (GCL) of the DG in a timedependent manner. At 24 h posttreatment, COX2 immunoreactivity in the SP of the CA1 region and in the GCL of the DG was high, and COX2 immunoreactivity in the SP of the CA2/3 region was highest. Furthermore, the present study observed that NFkappaB/p65 immunoreactivity was obviously increased in the SP and GCL at 6, 12 and 24 h after TeT treatment. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that systemic treatment with TeT significantly increased the expression of COX-2 and NF-kappaB/p65 in the mouse hippocampus, suggesting that increased COX2 and NF-kappaB/65 expression may be associated with inflammation in the brain induced by exotoxins.",
