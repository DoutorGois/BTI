     "AB": "In hippocampal slices arachidonic acid released after NMDA post-synaptic receptor activation is thought to act as a retrograde trans-synaptic messenger which facilitates the pre-synaptic release of L-glutamate to be involved in the expression of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). We measured the mass amount of arachidonic acid released from hippocampal slices incubated under conditions which maintain the electrophysiological responsiveness of the slice. Melittin released arachidonic, oleic and docosahexaenoic acids by phospholipase A2 activation but not palmitic or stearic acids. Of greater interest L-glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate and incubation conditions known to induce LTP selectively and rapidly increased the release of arachidonic acid in amounts over basal levels of 200-300 ng/mg protein. This is the first direct determination of the mass amount of arachidonic acid released following NMDA receptor activation in the hippocampus.",
