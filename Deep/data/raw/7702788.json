     "AB": "Glutamate (GLU) is a neurotransmitter. Massive release of GLU and glycine (GLY) into the brain's extracellular space may be triggered by ischemia, and may result in acute neuronal lysis or delayed neuronal death. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible relationship between hyperventilation and the level of GLU and GLY during brain ischemia. Rabbits were anesthetized with halothane and oxygen. Group 1 was allowed to hyperventilate (PaCO2 25-35 mmHg). PaCO2 was maintained throughout the study. Group 2 was a normal control group that maintained normocapnia. Two global cerebral ischemic episodes were produced. Microdialysate was collected during the peri-ischemic and reperfusion periods from the dorsal hippocampus. GLU and GLY concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. In the control group, GLU and GLY were significantly elevated during each episode of ischemia; these levels returned to baseline within 10 minutes after reperfusion. In contrast, in the hyperventilation group GLU and GLY concentrations increased during ischemia, but they were not statistically significant. We were able to demonstrate that hypocapnia during periischemic period lowered extracellular GLU and GLY concentrations. These results can explain a part of the protective action of hypocapnia during cerebral ischemia.",
