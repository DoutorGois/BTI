     "AB": "The septal region of the basal forebrain plays a dual role: 1) It modulates hippocampal excitability, facilitating synaptic plasticity within hippocampal circuits. Through this mechanism, the septum facilitates diverse cognitive processes that involve hippocampal circuits. 2) Additionally, the septum maintains the hippocampal networks working within normal ranges, decreasing the probability of abnormal excitability states. Through this second mechanism, the septum prevents the occurrence of epileptic discharges. Thus, septal alterations may lead to both decreased cognitive functions and epilepsy, as observed in elderly patients affected with Alzheimer's disease.",
