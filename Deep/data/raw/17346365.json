     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the location and the degree of white matter damage in late-life depression using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS: Thirty-one patients with late-life depression and 15 healthy volunteers matched for age, gender and years of education received conventional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and MR-diffusion tensor scanning. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values of white matter were measured respectively in frontal and temporal regions and the corpus callosum. RESULTS: FA values were significantly decreased in the frontal (superior and middle frontal gyrus), and temporal (right parahippocampal gyrus) regions of elderly patients with depression compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Microstructural changes in the frontal (superior and middle frontal gyrus) and temporal (right parahippocampal gyrus) areas are associated with late-life depression.",
