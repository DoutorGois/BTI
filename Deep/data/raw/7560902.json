     "AB": "The influence of prolonged postischemic hyperventilation was studied in the model of global brain ischemia produced by 15 min cardiac arrest in dogs with 8 h recirculation. Histopathological examination of neuronal damage using silver impregnation showed the presence of numerous heavy argyrophylic neurons in the striatum and CA2 hippocampal subfield after 8 h of normoxic reperfusion. In dogs with prolonged 8 h postischemic hyperventilation a reduction in the occurrence of argyrophylic neurons in the striatum and their significant decrease in the hippocampal area were found. Electron microscopic study was performed to characterize the effect of respiratory alkalosis on the ultrastructural changes in neurons and correlate them with the results of silver impregnation. Ultrastructural analysis after the cardiac arrest without recirculation did not reveal the presence of dark neurons within the striatal and hippocampal areas. Neuronal alterations included a decrease in endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial swelling and a mild chromatin clumping. After 8 h of normoxic reperfusion many dark, shrinked neurons containing perinuclear clusters of clear vesicles were found. In hyperventilated animals the occurrence of dark neurons with extensive perineuronal edema was substantially reduced in the CA2 subfield. The effect of hyperventilation on postischemic calcium overload is discussed.",
