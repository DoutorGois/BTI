     "AB": "Ultrastructural localization of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase (IP3K) in the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus was studied immunohistochemically. In both regions, the major structure expressing a high level of IP3K was the dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons, where immunoreactivity was associated with the spine apparatuses and plasmalemma. The postsynaptic densities showed the most intense labelling. Taking into account the results of our previous observations, which demonstrated the restricted localization of the enzyme in the dendritic spines of Purkinje and basket cells in cerebellum, IP3K may be localized specifically in dendritic spines in various regions of the central nervous system, and involved in synaptic signal transduction at the spines.",
