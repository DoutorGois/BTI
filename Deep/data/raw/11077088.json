     "AB": "The effects of corticosteroids in the brain are mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). We used a sensitive competitive RT-PCR assay to quantify the amounts of GR and MR mRNA in human brain tissue specimens from patients with focal epilepsies. GR and MR mRNAs were expressed at approximately the same levels in the temporal lobe, frontal lobe, and hippocampus as compared to tissues with high glucocorticoid/mineralocorticoid receptor expression (liver/kidney). GR and MR mRNA concentrations in the temporal lobe increased markedly during childhood and reached adult levels at puberty. GR and MR mRNA expression was significantly higher in the temporal lobe and frontal lobe cortex of women than in those of men. In women, MR and GR mRNA concentrations were markedly lower in hippocampal tissue than in frontal and temporal lobe cortex tissue. In conclusion, our data demonstrate sex- and site-dependent expression of corticosteroid receptor mRNA in the human brain.",
