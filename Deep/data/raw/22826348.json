     "AB": "Variations in parental care direct phenotypic development across many species. Variations in maternal pup licking/grooming (LG) in the rat regulate the development of individual differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to stress. The adult offspring of mothers that show an increased frequency of pup LG have increased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and more modest pituitary-adrenal responses to stress. This parental effect is mediated by the epigenetic programming of a GR exon 1 promoter (exon 1(7)) through the binding of the transcription factor nerve growth factor-inducible factor A (NGFI-A). In this paper, we report that: (i) the association of NGFI-A with the exon 1(7) GR promoter is dynamically regulated by mother-pup interactions; (ii) this effect is mimicked by artificial tactile stimulation comparable to that provided by pup LG; (iii) that serotonin (5-HT) induces an NGFI-A-dependent increase in GR transcription in hippocampal neurons and NGFI-A overexpression is sufficient for this effect; and (iv) that thyroid hormones and 5-HT are key mediators of the effects of pup LG and tactile stimulation on NGFI-A binding to the exon 1(7) GR promoter in hippocampus. These findings suggest that pup LG directly activates 5-HT systems to initiate intracellular signalling pathways in the hippocampus that regulate GR transcription.",
