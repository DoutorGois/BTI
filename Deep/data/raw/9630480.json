     "AB": "The effects of escapable and yoked inescapable electric tailshocks on extracellular levels of serotonin (5-HT) in the ventral hippocampus and dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) were measured by in vivo microdialysis. Inescapable, but not escapable shock increased extracellular 5-HT in the ventral hippocampus relative to restrained controls. Basal levels of 5-HT were elevated 24 h after inescapable shock, and previously inescapably shocked subjects exhibited an exaggerated 5-HT response to 2 brief footshocks. In contrast, escapable, but not inescapable shock, increased extracellular 5-HT in the dPAG, increased basal 5-HT in the dPAG 24 h later, and led to an enhanced 5-HT response to subsequent brief footshock.",
