     "AB": "The effects of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) on neuronal excitability in the CA1 region of rat hippocampus were studied using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological techniques. Extracellularly recorded spontaneous firing of CA1 neurons was transiently (2-7 min) increased by PACAP (106+/-32% enhancement, mean+/-SEM, n=11). Using whole-cell patch clamp, PACAP was tested on the resting membrane current of CA1 pyramidal neurons: PACAP activated a slow-onset (20-30 s) and long-lasting (over 20 min) inward current with a mean amplitude of 99+/-34 pA (mean+/-SD, n=8). These results indicate that PACAP induces depolarizing effects on CA1 hippocampal neurons. PACAP-induced long-lasting facilitation in the CA1 region might modify neuronal excitability and/or modulate the effect of other neurotransmitters.",
