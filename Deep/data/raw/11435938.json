     "AB": "The formation of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease is preceded by a pretangle stage of hyperphosphorylated tau. To characterize pretangle tau in vivo, we correlated, in human tau transgenic mice, levels of kinases known to phosphorylate tau in vitro with the phosphorylation of tau at specific epitopes. Levels of cyclin-dependent kinase-5 were increased in axons of CA1 pyramidal neurons, where tau was phosphorylated specifically at the AD2 epitope Ser396/Ser404. The 12E8 epitope serine262/serine356 and the AT180 epitope threonine231/serine235 were phosphorylated in dendrites, and colocalized with increased levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3. CA1 neurons phosphorylated tau at more epitopes than dentate gyrus neurons, suggesting that tau phosphorylation is cell type-specific, a possible explanation for the spatial distribution of neurofibrillary tangles.",
