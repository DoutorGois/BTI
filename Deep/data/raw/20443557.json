     "AB": "Designing biomimetic matrices with precisely controlled structural organization that provides biochemical and physical cues to regulate cell behavior is critical for the development of tissue-regenerating materials. We have developed novel liquid-crystalline film matrices made from genetically engineered M13 bacteriophages (viruses) that exhibit the ability to control and guide cell behavior for tissue-regenerating applications. To facilitate adhesion between the viruses and cells, 2700 copies of the M13 major coat protein were genetically engineered to display integrin-binding peptides (RGD). The resulting nanofiber-like viruses displaying RGD motifs were biocompatible with neuronal cells and could be self-assembled to form long-range-ordered liquid-crystalline matrices by a simple shearing method. The resulting aligned structures were able to dictate the direction of cell growth. Future use of these virus-based materials for regenerating target tissues in vivo would provide great opportunities for various tissue therapies.",
