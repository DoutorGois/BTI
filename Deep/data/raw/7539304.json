     "AB": "Patch clamp recordings were made from CA1 pyramidal neurones to study changes in the glutamate receptor subtypes in the gerbil hippocampus after transient ischaemia. In whole-cell recordings, the maximum chord conductances of AMPA currents in ischaemic neurones were increased over those of control neurones but NMDA-induced currents in the ischaemic neurones were smaller than the control. In AMPA-activated single channel currents, an open time histogram of the control neurones was well fitted by a single exponential function whereas in the ischaemic patches it was fitted by a double exponential function, indicating that currents consisted of at least two kinetically different types. These functional changes of the glutamate receptor channels may contribute to the abnormalities of the excitatory synaptic currents recorded in post-ischaemic CA1 neurones.",
