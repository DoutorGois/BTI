     "AB": "The present study investigates the age-dependent effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on changes in the neurochemical and functional status of brain serotonin neurons. Pregnant rats were administered either saline or (-)cocaine HCl (15 mg/kg, subcutaneously), twice daily from gestational days 13 through 20. Neurochemical changes in frontal cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum and midbrain of prepubescent and adult offspring were determined by measuring: (1) the content of serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA), and (2) the ability of the serotonin releasing drug p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) to reduce brain serotonin levels. Brain catecholamine content was determined in progeny for comparative purposes. Prior to maturation, prenatal exposure to cocaine did not alter basal levels of brain 5-HT or 5-HIAA in any brain region examined. However, in adult progeny prenatally exposed to cocaine, basal 5-HT content was significantly reduced in the frontal cortex (-32%) and hippocampus (-40%), suggesting maturation-dependent effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on brain 5-HT neurons. Consistent with the maturational onset of changes in 5-HT, striatal dopamine was significantly reduced (-10%) by prenatal exposure to cocaine only in adult offspring. Reductions in 5-HT in most brain regions, produced by pharmacological challenge with p-chloroamphetamine (PCA), were comparable in prenatal saline versus cocaine offspring. One notable exception was the markedly greater reduction (-40%) in 5-HT in the midbrain of immature offspring prenatally exposed to cocaine, suggesting alterations in midbrain 5-HT neurons prior to maturation. Overall, these data demonstrate prenatal cocaine exposure produces region-specific changes in 5-HT neurons in offspring with some deficits occurring only following maturation.",
