     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, in which progressive neuron loss, mainly in the hippocampus, is observed. The critical events in the pathogenesis of AD are associated with accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides in the brain. Deposits of Abeta initiate a neurotoxic \"cascade\" leading to apoptotic death of neurons. Aim of this study was to assess a putative neuroprotective effects of two nootropic drugs: piracetam (PIR) and levetiracetam (LEV) on Abeta-injured hippocampal neurons in culture. METHODS: Primary cultures of rat's hippocampal neurons at 7 day in vitro were exposed to Abeta(25-35) in the presence or absence of nootropics in varied concentrations. Flow cytometry with Annexin V/PI staining was used for counting and establishing neurons as viable, necrotic or apoptotic. Additionally, release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to the culture medium, as a marker of cell death, was evaluated. RESULTS: Abeta(25-35) caused concentration-dependent death of about one third number of hippocampal neurons, mainly through an apoptotic pathway. In drugs-containing cultures, number of neurons injured with 20 muM Abeta(25-35) was about one-third lesser for PIR and almost two-fold lesser for LEV. When 40 muM Abeta(25-35) was used, only LEV exerted beneficial neuroprotective action, while PIR was ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the protective potential of both studied nootropics against Abeta-induced death of cultured hippocampal neurons with more powerful neuroprotective effects of LEV.",
