     "AB": "Chronic asthma is one of the most common respiratory diseases, characterized by airway inflammation. However, little is known whether asthma-induced airway inflammation might influence the brain. We found that chronic asthma not only resulted in peripheral inflammation, but also induced neuroinflammation which was characterized by microglial activations and increased levels of TNFalpha and IL-1beta in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Simultaneously, we found that there was significant neuronal loss in the asthmatic mouse brain. Inhaled budesonide, the classic therapeutic drug for chronic asthma, could inhibit asthma-induced microglial activation, down-regulate TNFalpha and IL-1beta but up-regulate TGFbeta and IL-10 of mouse brain, and thereby attenuate neuronal loss. Further study showed that chronic asthma increased the expressions of TLR4 and p65/NFkappaB in the brain, which could be reversed by budesonide treatment. Therefore, the present study reveals that inhaled budesonide protects against asthma-induced neuroinflammation in mouse brain, which might be contributed to attenuate neuronal loss.",
