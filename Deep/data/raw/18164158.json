     "AB": "Our previous study suggested that the functional magnetic resonance imaging MRI (fMRI) COSLOF Index (CI) could be used as a quantitative biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The fMRI CI was lowest in the AD group (0.13+/-0.10), followed by the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group (0.20+/-0.05) and the control group (0.34+/-0.09). The current study continues an investigation into which of the following two factors has a dominant role in determining the CI: the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or the phase shift of spontaneous low-frequency (SLF) components. By using a theoretical model for SLF components, we demonstrated that the normalized CI does not depend on the SNR of the SLF components. Further analysis shows that by taking the ratio of the cross-correlation coefficient to the maximum-shifted cross-correlation coefficient, the SNR factor can be canceled. Therefore, the determination of the phase shift index (PSI) method is independent of the SNR, and the PSI provides an accurate measure of the phase shift between SLF components. By applying this PSI method to the control, MCI and AD groups of subjects, experimental results demonstrated that the PSI was highest in the AD group (72.6+/-11.3 degrees ), followed by the MCI group (58.6+/-5.7 degrees ) and, finally, the control group (40.6+/-8.4 degrees ). These results suggest that the larger is the PSI value, the more asynchrony exists between SLF components.",
