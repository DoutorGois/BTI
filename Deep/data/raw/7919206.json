     "AB": "The immunosuppressant drug [3H]cyclosporin A binds specifically and with high affinity to rat brain membrane preparations. The highest density of binding sites was observed in the hippocampus, cerebellum, cortex and basal ganglia. A similar distribution pattern was seen using a quantitative autoradiographic analysis. This distribution agrees with the localizations of cyclophilin and calcineurin reported in immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies. Thus inhibition of calcineurin activity following cyclosporin A binding to cyclophilin may occur in neurones, as it does in T-cells. These results suggest that the neurological side-effects of cyclosporin A may be mediated through its interaction with these proteins in neurones.",
