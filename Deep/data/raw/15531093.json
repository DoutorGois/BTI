     "AB": "Previous studies in the hippocampus and cerebellum demonstrate that depolarisation of postsynaptic neurones stimulates the rapid synthesis and release of an endocannabinoid that retrogradely interacts with pre-synaptic CB(1) to modulate neurotransmitter release. This study evaluated whether depolarisation of second order neurones in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord by the AMPA receptor agonist, (S)-AMPA, would modulate sensory neurotransmission via release of endocannabinoids. Using an isolated rat dorsal horn with dorsal root attached in vitro preparation the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) after electrical stimulation of the dorsal roots was measured. Superfusion of either WIN55,212-2 (1 microM) or (S)-AMPA (1 microM) significantly attenuated CGRP release in a CB(1)-dependent manner (SR141716A, 5 microM). This provides indirect pharmacological evidence for an AMPA-evoked release of endogenous cannabinoids inhibiting peptide release from primary afferent neurons. This study confirms that CGRP release from the dorsal horn is modulated via CB(1) activation. Furthermore a depolarising stimulus also modulates CGRP release, potentially via the release of endogenous cannabinoids.",
