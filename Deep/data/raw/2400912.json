     "AB": "Histopathological evaluation of rat brains 3 days following unilateral i.c.v. injections of omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-ctx), 0.032 and 0.1 nmol/kg, was performed. An isolated unilateral lesion confined to the injected hemisphere was found in the hippocampal CA3 neurons. Morphometric analysis of these cells revealed a significant reduction in cell area in both dose groups compared to i.c.v. injected vehicle, and to the contralateral hemisphere. These data indicate a specific degenerative process and suggest that CA3 cells possess omega-ctx-sensitive Ca2+ channels which are essential to their viability.",
