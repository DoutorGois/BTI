     "AB": "5HT1A receptors occur in the retina of various species and the administration of 5HT1A agonists results in the inhibition of outgrowth from postcrush goldfish retinal explants. The levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) play a role in the modulation of the outgrowth of the nevous system. Moreover, the stimulation of central 5HT1A receptors with the agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin has been reported to produce an increase or decrease in the activity of adenylate cyclase. In the present investigation we studied the effect of adenylate cyclase stimulation by forskolin, as well as the modulatory effects of 5HT1A receptor agonists and antagonists on the production of cAMP in the goldfish retina, and on the outgrowth of this tissue in vitro. 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin produced a significant and dose-dependent increase in cAMP concentration. This effect was not additive to the stimulation produced by forskolin. By contrast, as previously described, the 5HT1A agonist decreased cAMP concentration in the hippocampus of the rat. Both effects were significantly impaired by the 5HT1A antagonist WAY-100,135. A significant effect of the antagonist alone was observed only in the goldfish retina. The increase in cAMP levels was greater in the intact than in the postcrush retina. In addition, forskolin decreased the outgrowth of postcrush retinal explants in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting the importance of critical levels of cAMP in this process. Taken together, 5HT1A receptors seem to be positively coupled to adenylate cyclase in the goldfish retina, where cAMP plays a role as a modulator of outgrowth and regeneration. The inhibitory effect of 5HT1A receptor agonists on retinal outgrowth might be mediated through the production of cAMP. The activation of other subtypes of 5HT receptors positively coupled to adenylate cyclase by the 5HT1A agonist, such as 5HT7, cannot be discarded.",
