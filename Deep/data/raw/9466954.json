     "AB": "The aim of this study was to determine the neuronal participation of nitric oxide (NO) in experimental epilepsy. To reach this objective, we established the amount of cells presenting nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and the amygdaline concentrations in the L-arginine-nitric oxide synthesis pathway. A group of fully epileptic rats, induced by the kindling procedure and that had reached at least 10 generalized seizures, was studied. We evaluated behavioral stages, electroencephalographic activities, and histochemical NOS-positive cells and carried out high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) determinations of arginine, citrulline, and glutamic acid. Our results showed that behavioral and electrographic frequency, and duration of epileptic activities, were increased during the kindling process. Image processing system of NOS cells showed two types of intensities in cell stains in hippocampus, caudate-putamen, and amygdala. When we independently counted the two types of NOS stain cells, a selective increase in the number and density of weak-stained cells was observed, while dark-stained cells did not change in the studied structures. Additionally, arginine, citrulline, and glutamic acid concentrations in amygdala increased in kindled animals. The differential and specific increase in the stained cells expressing the nitric oxide synthase, as well as the increase in concentrations of the L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway in amygdala, suggested a relationship with the progressive augmentation in the electrophysiological hyperactivity characteristic of generalized epilepsy.",
