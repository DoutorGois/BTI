     "AB": "To identify the roles of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter in epileptogenesis and the recovery mechanisms in spontaneous seizure, a chronological and comparative analysis of GABA transporters (GAT) expression was conducted. GAT-1 immunoreactivity was more strongly detected in the pre-seizure group of seizure sensitive (SS) gerbils than that seen in the seizure resistant group. 30 min postictal, the density of GAT-1 immunoreactivity was significantly decreased in the hippocampal complex, as compared to pre-seizure group. 12 h after seizure on-set, the GAT immunodensity recovered to the pre-seizure level. Following the onset of seizure, GAT-3 immunoreactivity remained unchanged. These results suggest that the increase of GAT-1 expression in the SS gerbil hippocampus may affect epileptogenesis in this animal, and the alteration of immunoreactivity following seizure may be compensatory responses to modulate seizure activity.",
