     "AB": "Although the role of individual brain lipids for learning and memory has been reported, no systematic approach associating brain lipids with spatial memory has been carried out. It was therefore the aim of the study to determine brain lipids in hippocampus of mice forming and yoked controls that did not form spatial memory using the probe trial as the endpoint. 10 animals were trained in the Morris water maze (MWM) and 10 mice were serving as yoked controls i.e. no platform was used during the whole experiment. Hippocampal tissue lipids were extracted and data were acquired with Fourier transformation ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (LTQ-FT) coupled to HPLC. Glycerophosphatidylethanolamines (18:0/22:6, 18:0/20:4 and 18:1/18:1), plasmalogens (16:0-10/22:6 and 18:0-10/22:6) and ceramides (18:0) showed higher levels in the trained group, while glycerolysophosphatidylcholines (16:0, 18:1, 18:0, 20:4), sphingomyelins (16:0, 24:1), ether linked glycerophosphatidylcholines (16:0-10/18:0), glycerophosphatidylcholines (16:0/18:1, 16:0/18:0, 18:0/18:1, 38:7, 18:1/20:1, 20:4/20:4, 22:1/18:1, 22:0/18:1, 20:4/22:6, 22:6/22:6), glucosylceramide (24:1) and plasmalogen (18:0-10/20:1) revealed lower levels in the trained group. Decreased levels of certain species of lysophosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, plasmenylphosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine, glycosylceramide and plasmalogen at the probe trial for spatial memory may indicate catabolism in terms of consumption during this process. Increased hippocampal levels of long chain highly unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines, plasmalogens and ceramides may reflect increased synthesis or decreased degradation at the endpoint of memory testing, probably representing interactions in the brain lipid pathways. The study shows pathways involved in spatial memory, may propose the use of individual brain lipids as probable cognitive enhancers and forms the basis for further studies on the role of brain lipids per se.",
