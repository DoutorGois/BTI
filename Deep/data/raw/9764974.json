     "AB": "The distribution of glutamate receptors in transverse hippocampal sections has been well investigated. However, in spite of the known septotemporal gradients of hippocampal connectivity no systematic studies exist about the distribution of glutamate receptors along the septotemporal (longitudinal) hippocampal axis. Therefore, in the present study this issue was investigated using receptor autoradiography for the [3H]MK-801, [3H]AMPA and [3H]Kainate binding sites. Hippocampi from 30-day-old rats were sectioned perpendicularly to their longitudinal axis, yielding a total of 25-30 equidistantly spaced autoradiographs for each hippocampus. For each section layer-specific concentrations of binding sites were calculated by the aid of a computerized image analysing system. The dependency of concentrations of binding sites on the septotemporal position was evaluated by regression analysis. Gradients of binding were confined to distinct hippocampal layers. Significant septotemporal gradients of [3H]MK-801 binding were observed in selected layers of CA1 and the dentate gyrus, a septal to temporal decrease of binding in the oriens and radiatum layers of CA1 being most prominent. For [3H]AMPA, significant septotemporal gradients of binding were restricted to layers of CA3, CA4 and the dentate gyrus, with values generally increasing from septal to temporal levels. The observed septotemporal gradients possibly reflect functional segregations along the longitudinal hippocampal axis and could be important for the comparability of ligand binding studies using transverse hippocampal sections or hippocampal slice cultures.",
