     "AB": "Dopamine (DA) profoundly modulates excitatory synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in the brain. In the present study the effects of SKF83959, the selective agonist of phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked D(1) -like receptor, on the excitatory synaptic transmission were investigated in rat hippocampus. SKF83959 (10-100 muM) reversibly suppressed the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) elicited by stimulating the Schaffer's collateral-commissural fibers in CA1 area of hippocampal slices. However, the inhibition was not blocked by the D(1) receptor antagonist SCH23390, the D(2) receptor antagonist raclopride, the 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist mesulergine, or the alpha(1) -adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. In addition, SKF83959 inhibited the afferent volley and significantly reduced the paired-pulse facilitation ratios. In dissociated hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, SKF83959 had no detectable effect on glutamate-induced currents but potently inhibited voltage-activated Na(+) current (IC50 value = 26.9 +/- 1.0 muM), which was not blocked by SCH23390 or by intracellular dialysis of GDP-beta-S. These results demonstrate that SKF83959 suppressed the excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal CA1 area, which was independent of D(1) -like receptor. The mechanism underlying the effect could be mainly inhibition of Na(+) channel in the afferent fibers. The suppression of excitatory synaptic transmission and the Na(+) channel by SKF83959 may contribute to its therapeutic benefits in Parkinson's disease.",
