     "AB": "The cerebral dialysis technique was employed to monitor extracellular concentrations of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the dorsal hippocampus of gerbils before and after cerebral ischemia induced by carotid artery occlusion. Extracellular concentrations of DA and NE in the dorsal hippocampus increased from baseline levels of less than 35 fmol/collection interval to 180 and 200 fmol/collection, respectively, within 36 minutes following carotid artery ligation (n = 8 animals). Extracellular concentrations of the DA metabolites, DOPAC and HVA, did not change significantly following carotid artery ligation. These data demonstrate that ischemia in the dorsal hippocampus is associated with a mared release of DA and NE. This release may contribute to the selective vulnerability of the dorsal hippocampus to neuronal damage during ischemia.",
