     "AB": "The ontogeny of muscarinic cholinergic receptors was studied in primary cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal cells. The specific [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate [( 3H]QNB) to intact cells was detected after two days in culture. Scatchard analysis revealed only a unique binding site at all of the days tested, with a very high affinity (0.205-0.253 nM) for the substrate. Specific binding kept increasing up to a level of 2035 fmol/mg protein after 15 days in culture. Protein content by itself also increased over time, reaching the highest level at 15 days (286 micrograms protein/35 mm plate). The cultured hippocampus can thus serve as a model system for the study of the development of muscarinic receptors in vitro.",
