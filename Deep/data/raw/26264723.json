     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that pre-existing susceptible structures in the brain may be associated with the development of newly diagnosed partial epilepsy of unknown etiology. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with newly diagnosed partial epilepsy of unknown etiology and 36 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. In addition, we included 24 patients with chronic partial epilepsy of unknown etiology as a disease control group. We analyzed whole-brain T1-weighted MRIs using FreeSurfer 5.1. The volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, brainstem, cerebellar gray and white matter, as well as cerebral gray and white matter were compared between the groups. We also analyzed the changes in brain volumes associated with the chronicity of epilepsy in the patients with chronic epilepsy compared to newly diagnosed epilepsy. RESULTS: The volume of cerebellar white matter in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy was significantly smaller than that which was observed in the healthy controls (p=0.0001). This finding was also observed in patients with chronic epilepsy (p<0.0001). Cerebral white matter volume was negatively correlated with the duration of epilepsy (r=-0.4, p=0.04). CONCLUSION: These findings support our hypothesis that cerebellar white matter changes may constitute a pre-existing susceptible structure in the brain that is associated with the development of partial epilepsy of unknown etiology. In addition, cerebral white matter was the structure that was the most vulnerable to the progression of epilepsy.",
