     "AB": "Memory processes may be independent, compete, operate in parallel, or interact. In accordance with this view, behavioral studies suggest that the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) may act as an integrated circuit during performance of tasks that require working memory over longer delays, whereas during short delays the HPC and PFC may operate in parallel or have completely dissociable functions. In the present investigation we tested rats in a spatial delayed non-match to sample working memory task using short and long time delays to evaluate the hypothesis that intermediate CA1 region of the HPC (iCA1) and medial PFC (mPFC) interact and operate in parallel under different temporal working memory constraints. In order to assess the functional role of these structures, we used an inactivation strategy in which each subject received bilateral chronic cannula implantation of the iCA1 and mPFC, allowing us to perform bilateral, contralateral, ipsilateral, and combined bilateral inactivation of structures and structure pairs within each subject. This novel approach allowed us to test for circuit-level systems interactions, as well as independent parallel processing, while we simultaneously parametrically manipulated the temporal dimension of the task. The current results suggest that, at longer delays, iCA1 and mPFC interact to coordinate retrospective and prospective memory processes in anticipation of obtaining a remote goal, whereas at short delays either structure may independently represent spatial information sufficient to successfully complete the task.",
