     "AB": "Stress during pregnancy can increase the incidence of emotional problems, learning and language difficulties in human infants and pre-adolescents. Most preclinical studies in rats that attempted to find experimental support for these observations were performed in adult male offspring, but the results are inconsistent. The aim of the current study was to examine the effect of prenatal stress on novel object recognition (NOR) and spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) of juvenile rats of both sexes. By the use of fluorescence immunohistochemistry and protein measurements by Western blot, we measured the expression of markers of neurogenesis (doublecortin, DCX) and neuronal activity that are important for synaptic plasticity and learning (c-fos, GluR1, nNOS). Since neuronal activity in the developing and adult brain can be regulated by astrocytes, we also measured the number of astrocytes and the expression of two astroglial proteins (GFAP and S100B) in the stress-responsive hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Experiments were performed on littermates of rats in which its effects on behavior were measured. We found for the first time that juvenile females performed better than males in the NOR and MWM tests. They also had higher densities of DCX and c-fos in the DG, together with the expression of nNOS and GluR1 in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the DG. There were no sex differences in the expression of GFAP and S100B in astrocytes. Prenatal stress did not affect NOR in females, but improved it in males, together with an increase in DCX+ and c-fos, the number of GFAP-expressing astrocytes and the intensity of GFAP and S100B immunofluorescence in the DG. Staining intensity of GluR1 and nNOS in the hilus and SGZ of the DG, and protein expression in the whole DG, was unchanged in prenatally stressed males. Thus, prenatal stress changed the behavior and expression of key proteins in the DG to resemble that in females. A reduction in plasma testosterone, which although not attaining statistical significance was associated with that in anogenital distance, may contribute to the effect of prenatal stress in males. In females, prenatal stress had no effect on c-fos, DCX or the number of astrocytes but reduced the staining intensity of GluR1 and nNOS. Protein expression of nNOS was also significantly lower than that in prenatally stressed males. The differential effects of prenatal stress on hippocampal neuronal and glial markers may help to explain the sex-dependent effect on spatial learning in prepubertal rats.",
