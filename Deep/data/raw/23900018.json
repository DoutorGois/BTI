     "AB": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: It has been demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD); meanwhile, hypoxia-up-regulated mitochondrial movement regulator (HUMMR) plays an important role in regulating mitochondrial function. The present study aimed to confirm the association between HUMMR and mitochondrial function in AD. METHODS: We detected the expression of HUMMR at transcriptional and translational levels in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. Age- and gender-matched wild-type (WT) littermates were used as controls. Mitochondrial morphology was observed in the hippocampus and cortex of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice using transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Damage to mitochondrial morphology in the hippocampus and cortex of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice was found, including swelling and cavitations. Our analysis showed no statistical differences in the expression of HUMMR between APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and WT littermates (p > 0.05). These results showed that there was no association between HUMMR and mitochondrial dysfunction in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that HUMMR does not play a key role in mitochondrial dysfunction in the APP/PS1 double transgenic AD mouse.",
