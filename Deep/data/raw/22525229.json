     "AB": "Homocysteine is a neurotoxic amino acid that accumulates in several disorders including homocystinuria, neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. In the present study we evaluated the effect of acute and chronic hyperhomocysteinemia on Akt, NF-kappaB/p65, GSK-3beta, as well as Tau protein in hippocampus of rats. For acute treatment, rats received a single injection of homocysteine (0.6 mumol/g body weight) or saline (control). For chronic treatment, rats received daily subcutaneous injections of homocysteine (0.3-0.6 mumol/g body weight) or saline (control) from the 6th to the 28th days-of-age. One or 12h after the last injection, rats were euthanized, the hippocampus was removed and samples were submitted to electrophoresis followed by Western blotting. Results showed that acute hyperhomocysteinemia increases Akt phosphorylation, cytosolic and nuclear immunocontent of NF-kappaB/p65 subunit and Tau protein phosphorylation, but reduces GSK-3beta phosphorylation at 1h after homocysteine injection. However, 12h after acute hyperhomocysteinemia there is no effect on Akt and GSK-3beta phosphorylation. Furthermore, chronic hyperhomocysteinemia did not alter Akt and GSK-3beta phosphorylation at 1h and 12h after the last administration of this amino acid. Our data showed that Akt, NF-kappaB/p65, GSK-3beta and Tau protein are activated in hippocampus of rats subjected to acute hyperhomocysteinemia, suggesting that these signaling pathways may be, at least in part, important contributors to the neuroinflammation and/or brain dysfunction observed in some hyperhomocystinuric patients.",
