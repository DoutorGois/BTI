     "AB": "GABA(A) receptors are heteropentamers that are heterogeneously distributed at different synapses in the central nervous system. Although the modulation of GABA(A) receptors received much attention in hippocampal pyramidal cells, information is scarce regarding the pharmacology of these receptors in inhibitory interneurons. We investigated the pharmacological properties of GABA(A)-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) using whole-cell voltage clamp recordings in two morphologically identified types of hippocampal CA1 interneurons, horizontal and vertical cells of stratum oriens-alveus. The negative modulators zinc (200 microM) and furosemide (600 microM) significantly decreased the amplitude of mIPSCs. Benzodiazepine agonists also produced significant effects: 10 microM zolpidem increased the amplitude, rise time, and decay time constant (decay tau) of mIPSCs, whereas 10 microM flunitrazepam affected similarly the amplitude and decay tau, but not the rise time. The neurosteroid allopregnanolone (10 microM) prolonged the decay tau of mIPSCs. Since these modulators act on different GABA(A) receptor subunits, this pharmacological profile suggests that GABA(A) receptors at spontaneously active inhibitory synapses onto vertical and horizontal interneurons are heterogeneous and formed by co-assembly of different combinations of subunits (alpha(1-5)beta(1-3)gamma(1-3)). Furthermore, these synaptic GABA(A) receptors appear in large part pharmacologically similar to those of pyramidal cells.",
