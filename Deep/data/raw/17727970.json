     "AB": "Navigation in real environments is often impaired by traumatic brain injury (TBI). These deficits in wayfinding appear to be due to disruption of cognitive processes underlying navigation and may in turn be due to damage to the hippocampus and frontal lobes. These wayfinding problems after TBI were investigated using a virtual simulation of a Morris Water Maze (MWM), a standard test of hippocampal function in laboratory animals. The virtual environment consisted of a large virtual arena in a very large virtual room whose walls provided views of a naturalistic landscape. Eleven community-dwelling TBI survivors and 12 comparison participants, matched for gender, age and education were tested to see if they could find a location in the arena marked by one of the following: (a) a visible platform, (b) a single proximal object, (c) a single proximal object among seven other distracter objects, or (d) distal features inside and outside the room. The proximal objects allowed participants to use egocentric (body-centered) navigational strategies that rely on relatively simple stimulus-response associations. The absence of proximal cues forced the participants to rely on distal features of the environment (room walls, landscape elements) and tested their ability to use allocentric (world-based) navigational strategies requiring cognitive mapping. Results indicated that the navigation of TBI survivors was not impaired when the proximal cues were present but was impaired when proximal cues were absent. These results provide more evidence that the navigational deficit after TBI is due to an inability to form, remember or use cognitive maps.",
