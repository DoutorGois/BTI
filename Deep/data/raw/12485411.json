     "PG": "145-56",
     "AB": "Substance P (SP) and somatostatin (SRIF) are widely spread throughout the CNS where they play a role as neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators. A colocalization of both neuropeptides has been demonstrated in several rat brain areas and SP receptors have been detected in rat cortical and hippocampal somatostatinergic cells. The present study was thus undertaken to determine whether SP could modulate SRIF signaling pathways in the rat frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus. A single intraperitoneal injection of SP (50, 250 or 500 micro g/kg) induced an increase in the density of SRIF receptors in membranes from the rat frontoparietal cortex at 24 h of its administration, with no change in the hippocampus. The functionality of the SRIF receptors was next investigated. Western blot analysis of Gi proteins demonstrated a significant decrease in Gialpha1 levels in frontoparietal cortical membranes from rats treated acutely (24 h) with 250 micro g/kg of SP, which correlated with a decrease in functional Gi activity, as assessed by use of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate. SRIF-mediated inhibition of basal or forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was also significantly lower in the frontoparietal cortex of the SP-treated group, with no alterations in the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. SRIF-like immunoreactivity content was increased in the frontoparietal cortex after acute (24 h) SP administration (250 or 500 micro g/kg) as well as in the hippocampus in response to 7 days of SP (250 micro g/kg) administration. All these SP-mediated effects were prevented by pretreatment with the NK1 receptor antagonist RP-67580. Although the physiologic significance of these results are unknown, the increase in SRIF receptor density together with the desensitization of the SRIF inhibitory signaling pathway might be a mechanism to potentiate the stimulatory pathway of SRIF, inducing a preferential coupling of the receptors to PLC.",
