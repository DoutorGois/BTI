     "AB": "Concentrations of proenkephalin B (PENK B) mRNA in porcine brain, pituitary, spinal cord, and peripheral tissues were measured using RNA blotting and solution hybridization. A single hybridizing species of approximately 2,800 bases in size was present in the CNS, with the highest concentration in the caudate nucleus, followed by hypothalamus and hippocampus. The abundance of PENK B mRNA ranged from 22 pg/micrograms of poly(A)-rich RNA in caudate nucleus to less than 0.1 pg/microgram in cerebellum. Concentrations of immunoreactive PENK B-derived peptides showed a similar distribution, with the exception of the hypothalamus, which had lower PENK B mRNA levels than expected from peptide concentrations. PENK B mRNA of the same size as in the brain was also found in the anterior lobe of the pituitary and in the heart ventricle, whereas in intestine, lung, and kidney, smaller mRNA species of 1,800 bases became apparent by RNA blot analysis. An intermediate size of 2,200 bases was found in heart atrium. As revealed by S1 mapping, however, these smaller mRNAs are not completely homologous with PENK B mRNA, but rather may represent closely related mRNAs from a different gene(s).",
