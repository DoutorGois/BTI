     "AB": "The hippocampus develops from the medial wall of the forming cerebral cortex during embryonic life. Morphogenic signals from the Wnt pathway regulate several events during hippocampal development (Galceran et al.: Development 127:469-482, 2000; Lee et al.: Development 127:457-467, 2000; Zhou et al.: J Neurosci 24:121-126, 2004) and we have previously shown that Wnt receptors from the Frizzled (Fzd) family are expressed in discreet cortical domains during development (Kim et al.: Mech Dev 103:167-172, 2001). We generated transgenic mice using the putative control elements of the Fzd9 gene, normally selectively expressed in the developing and adult hippocampus, driving expression of a marker gene. These mice express LacZ in the brain in the same developmental distribution as endogenous Fzd protein. Postnatally, expression remains strong in the dendritic fields of hippocampal principal cells as well as hippocampal efferent axons. These mice provide a genetic and anatomic tool for analyzing development and reorganization in the hippocampus.",
