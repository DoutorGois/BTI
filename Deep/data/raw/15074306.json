     "AB": "CONTEXT: With ageing populations, the prevalence of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease, is set to soar. Alzheimer's disease is associated with progressive cerebral atrophy, which can be seen on MRI with high resolution. Longitudinal MRI could track disease progression and detect neurodegenerative diseases earlier to allow prompt and specific treatment. Such use of MRI requires accurate understanding of how brain changes in normal ageing differ from those in dementia. STARTING POINT: Recently, Henry Rusinek and colleagues, in a 6-year longitudinal MRI study of initially healthy elderly subjects, showed that an increased rate of atrophy in the medial temporal lobe predicted future cognitive decline with a specificity of 91% and sensitivity of 89% (Radiology 2003; 229: 691-96). WHERE NEXT? As understanding of neurodegenerative diseases increases, specific disease-modifying treatments might become available. Serial MRI could help to determine the efficacy of such treatments, which would be expected to slow the rate of atrophy towards that of normal ageing, and might also detect the onset of neurodegeneration. The amount and pattern of excess atrophy might help to predict the underlying pathological process, allowing specific therapies to be started. As the precision of imaging improves, the ability to distinguish healthy ageing from degenerative dementia should improve.",
