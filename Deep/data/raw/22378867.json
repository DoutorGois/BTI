     "AB": "The common neurotransmitter serotonin controls different aspects of early neuronal differentiation, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we report that activation of the serotonin 5-HT(7) receptor promotes synaptogenesis and enhances synaptic activity in hippocampal neurons at early postnatal stages. An analysis of Galpha(12)-deficient mice reveals a critical role of G(12)-protein for 5-HT(7) receptor-mediated effects in neurons. In organotypic preparations from the hippocampus of juvenile mice, stimulation of 5-HT(7)R/G(12) signaling potentiates formation of dendritic spines, increases neuronal excitability, and modulates synaptic plasticity. In contrast, in older neuronal preparations, morphogenetic and synaptogenic effects of 5-HT(7)/G(12) signaling are abolished. Moreover, inhibition of 5-HT(7) receptor had no effect on synaptic plasticity in hippocampus of adult animals. Expression analysis reveals that the production of 5-HT(7) and Galpha(12)-proteins in the hippocampus undergoes strong regulation with a pronounced transient increase during early postnatal stages. Thus, regulated expression of 5-HT(7) receptor and Galpha(12)-protein may represent a molecular mechanism by which serotonin specifically modulates formation of initial neuronal networks during early postnatal development.",
