     "AB": "RATIONALE: The interaction between stress and drugs of abuse is a critical component of drug addiction, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Arc/Arg3.1 is an effector immediate early gene that may represent a bridge connecting short- and long-term neuronal modifications associated with exposure to stress and drugs of abuse. OBJECTIVES: This research aims to study the modulation of Arc/Arg3.1 expression as a marker of neuronal changes associated with exposure to stress and cocaine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats exposed to either single or repeated stress sessions were subjected to a single intraperitoneal injection of cocaine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) and sacrificed 2 h later. RNase protection assay was used to determine changes in Arc/Arg3.1 gene expression in different brain regions. RESULTS: We found significant stress-cocaine interactions in the prefrontal cortex (p < 0.001) and hypothalamus (p < 0.05). In the prefrontal cortex, acute stress potentiated cocaine-induced Arc/Arg3.1 mRNA elevation, whereas prolonged stress attenuated the response to cocaine. In the hypothalamus, although markedly reduced by acute stress, Arc/Arg3.1 gene expression was still increased by cocaine. No interaction was observed following repeated stress. Notably, cocaine-induced Arc/Arg3.1 mRNA levels were not influenced by stress in striatum and hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: In our experimental model, stress interacted with cocaine to alter Arc/Arg3.1 expression in a regionally selective fashion and in a way that depended on whether stress was acute or repeated. These results point to Arc/Arg3.1 as a potential molecular target modulated by stress to alter cellular sensitivity to cocaine.",
