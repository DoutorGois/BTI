     "AB": "The concentration of taurine was measured in 15 brain regions of the rabbit before the onset of convulsions induced by the potent glutamate decarboxylase inhibitor methoxypyridoxine. A significant rise in taurine content was observed in the hippocampus, putamen, caudate nucleus, frontal cortex, thalamus and hypothalamus. GABA levels determined from the same tissue samples were all significantly reduced. An unaffected taurine synthesis coupled with blocked transport to the blood is considered as a possible explanation for this taurine increase.",
