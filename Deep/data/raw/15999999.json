     "AB": "Under pathophysiological conditions, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor activation is considered to play a key role in several disorders of the central nervous system. In the search for AMPA receptor antagonists, the synthesis and pharmacological characterization of a series of novel compounds that are structurally related to GYKI 52466 (1), a well-known selective noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist, was performed. In vitro, 2,3-dimethyl-6-phenyl-12H-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-h]imidazo[1,2-c][2,3]benzodiazepine (ZK 187638, 14a) antagonized the kainate-induced currents in cultured hippocampal neurons with an IC(50) of 3.4 microM in a noncompetitive fashion. When tested in a clinically predictive rat model of acute ischemic stroke, this noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist significantly reduced brain infarction, indicating that it is neuroprotective after permanent focal cerebral ischemia.",
