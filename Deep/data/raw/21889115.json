     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The majority of studies relating amyloid pathology with brain volumes have been cross-sectional. Apolipoprotein varepsilon4 (APOE varepsilon4), a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, is also known to be associated with hippocampal volume loss. No studies have considered the effects of amyloid pathology and APOE varepsilon4 together on longitudinal volume loss. METHODS: We evaluated whether an abnormal level of cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid (CSF Abeta) and APOE varepsilon4 carrier status were independently associated with greater hippocampal volume loss over 1 year. We then assessed whether APOE varepsilon4 status and CSF Abeta acted synergistically, testing the significance of an interaction term in the regression analysis. We included 297 participants: 77 cognitively normal, 144 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 76 with Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: An abnormal CSF Abeta level was found to be associated with greater hippocampal volume loss over 1 year in each group. APOE varepsilon4 was associated with hippocampal volume loss only in the cognitively normal and MCI groups. APOE varepsilon4 carriers with abnormal CSF Abeta in the MCI group acted synergistically to produce disproportionately greater volume loss than noncarriers. CONCLUSION: Baseline CSF Abeta predicts progression of hippocampal volume loss. APOE varepsilon4 carrier status amplifies the degree of neurodegeneration in MCI. Understanding the effect of interactions between genetic risk and amyloid pathology will be important in clinical trials and our understanding of the disease process.",
