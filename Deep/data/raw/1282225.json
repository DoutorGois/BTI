     "AB": "Whole cell recordings from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons using electrode chloride concentrations of 12-80 mM demonstrated that the effect of synaptic activation of GABAA receptors was dependent on the transmembrane chloride gradient. When the chloride reversal potential was positive to action potential threshold, GABAA receptor activation was excitatory, and anticonvulsant barbiturates and benzodiazepines enhanced this excitation. Enhancement of GABAergic excitation of interneurons may contribute to the efficacy of these drugs, while enhancement of GABAergic excitation of principal neurons may be an important mechanism of failure, such as occurs in the treatment of neonatal seizures.",
