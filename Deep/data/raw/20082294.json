     "AB": "Medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a condition known to affect the integrity and function of medial temporal lobe structures such as the hippocampus, has been shown to disrupt memory for real-life episodes. Here, patients with unilateral TLE, patients who received a unilateral temporal lobe resection to cure TLE, and healthy controls produced free narratives of autobiographical memories (AMs). To assess temporal resolution, narratives were segmented into bits of information, or details, which were classified according to how precisely they could be located within the time course of the AM. Categories included details corresponding to the entire AM, to parts or subevents within the AM, and to actions taking place within seconds to minutes. The number of details per category was tallied and compared between patients and controls. Temporal order was assessed by determining the correct (internally consistent) chronological order of the sequence of events within the narrative. Results indicate that while patients' memory for the parts or subevents of personal episodes was intact, as was their temporal order, their memory for the minute-by-minute unraveling of the episode was impaired. We believe this loss of temporally specific details may contribute to the reduced vividness of AM recollection in TLE patients. Our findings provide further evidence that patients with hippocampal damage retrieve skeletal AMs for which the gist of the memory is maintained, but the specific details are lost.",
