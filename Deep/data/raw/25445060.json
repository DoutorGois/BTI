     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Experimental stroke studies use multiple techniques to evaluate histopathological damage. Unfortunately, sensitivity and reproducibility of these techniques are poorly characterized despite pivotal influence on results. METHOD: The present study compared several quantification methods to differentiate between two severities of global cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to moderate (10min) or severe (14min) ischemia by bilateral carotid occlusion (BCAO) with hemorrhagic hypotension. Neuronal cell count was determined in hippocampus at bregma -3.14mm and -3.8mm on day 3 and 28 post insult by counting neurons in the whole CA1 or in one to three defined regions of interest (ROI) placed in NeuN and Fluoro-Jade B stained sections. RESULTS: In healthy rats hippocampal neurons were arranged uniformly, while distribution became inhomogeneous after ischemia. The number of NeuN and Fluoro-Jade B positive cells was dependent on localization. Differences between ischemia severities became more prominent at 28 days compared to 3 days. Fluoro-Jade B positive cell count increased at 28 days, staining rather injured not dying neurons. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Placement of counting windows has a major influence on extent of differences between degree of neuronal injury and variations within groups. CONCLUSIONS: The investigated quantification methods result in inconsistent information on the degree of damage. To obtain consistent and reliable results observation period should be extended beyond 3 days. Due to inhomogeneous distribution of viable neurons in CA1 after ischemia neuronal counting should not be performed in a single ROI window, but should be performed in multiple ROIs or the whole CA1 band.",
