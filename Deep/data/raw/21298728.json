     "AB": "The role of the CAMKK pathway in object recognition memory was investigated. Rats' performance in a preferential object recognition test was examined after local infusion into the perirhinal cortex of the CAMKK inhibitor STO-609. STO-609 infused either before or immediately after acquisition impaired memory tested after a 24 h but not a 20-min delay. Memory was not impaired when STO-609 was infused 20 min after acquisition. The expression of a downstream reaction product of CAMKK was measured by immunohistochemical staining for phospho-CAMKI(Thr177) at 10, 40, 70, and 100 min following the viewing of novel and familiar images of objects. Processing familiar images resulted in more pCAMKI stained neurons in the perirhinal cortex than processing novel images at the 10- and 40-min delays. Prior infusion of STO-609 caused a reduction in pCAMKI stained neurons in response to viewing either novel or familiar images, consistent with its role as an inhibitor of CAMKK. The results establish that the CAMKK pathway within the perirhinal cortex is important for the consolidation of object recognition memory. The activation of pCAMKI after acquisition is earlier than previously reported for pCAMKII.",
