     "AB": "Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a normal reduction in the startle response produced when a brief, low intensity stimulus is presented prior to a startle-evoking stimulus. PPI is often disrupted in humans diagnosed with schizophrenia. As similar stimuli elicit PPI in rodents and humans, interventions in rodents that disrupt PPI may reveal aspects of neuronal dysfunction relevant to schizophrenia. Stimulation of the ventral hippocampus (vHip) with NMDA significantly increases dopamine (DA) efflux in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and disrupts PPI, whereas NMDA infusion into the dorsal hippocampus (dHip) fails to alter PPI. Our previous research shows that brief periods of 20 Hz electrical vHip stimulation also significantly increase NAc DA efflux. The present experiments assessed the effects of stimulating the vHip or dHip on PPI and NAc DA efflux. As predicted, 20 Hz stimulation (10 s, 300 microA) of the vHip, but not the dHip, reversibly disrupted PPI. In contrast, 2 Hz stimulation (100 s, 300 microA) of the vHip failed to affect PPI. Microdialysis experiments revealed that 20 Hz stimulation of the vHip increased NAc DA efflux only in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulating electrode, whereas 20 Hz stimulation of the dHip failed to affect NAc DA efflux. These data demonstrate the regional specificity and frequency-dependent effects of hippocampal activity on PPI. Additionally, it is intriguing that both chemical and electrical stimulation of the vHip disrupt PPI and increase NAc DA efflux, however, the relevance of these changes in NAc DA efflux to the disruption of PPI remains to be determined.",
