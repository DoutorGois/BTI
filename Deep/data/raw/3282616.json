     "AB": "The laminar distribution of decreases in extracellular free calcium and concomitant field potentials induced by repetitive orthodromic stimulation, ionophoretic application of N-methyl-D-aspartate and quisqualate, was studied in the CA1 field of rat hippocampal slices, at two different stages during postnatal development. While stimulation-elicited and quisqualate-induced signals remain maximal in stratum pyramidale during the first postnatal month, the laminar profiles of responses to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) depend on age: the responses to this agonist are maximal in stratum pyramidale in 5-9-day-old rats and in stratum radiatum in 12-30-day-old rats. Our findings suggest that, during the second postnatal week, the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in area CAl become more sensitive to NMDA, which is expressed by big influxes of calcium at this level.",
