     "AB": "One of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) in senile plaques. Abeta-induced oxidative stress is believed to be responsible for degeneration and apoptosis of neurons and consequent cognitive and memory deficits. Here, we investigated the possible neuroprotective effect of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) against amyloid pathogenesis in adult male Wistar rats. GA or vehicle was injected into the lateral cerebral ventricles of rats 24 h before injection of Abeta (1-42) in CA1 area of hippocampus. The learning and memory of the rats were assessed 7 days after injection of Abeta using passive avoidance (PA) task. As potential contributing factors in Abeta-induced memory decline, we evaluated apoptotic markers and also used terminal-transferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique to detect apoptosis in the hippocampus of Abeta-injected rats. Our behavioral data suggest that GA pretreatment can significantly suppress memory deficits in Abeta-injected rats. There was also not only a marked increase in Hsp70 level but also upregulated 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) in the hippocampus of GA-treated groups with a reduction in apoptotic factors including caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and TUNEL-positive cells as well. Thus, we conclude that GA exerts its protective effects against Abeta (1-42) toxicity and memory deficits, at least in part, by upregulating of Hsp70 and P70S6K.",
