     "AB": "Long-lasting synaptic plasticity is often accompanied by morphological changes as well as formation and/or loss of dendritic spines. Since the spine cytoskeleton mainly consists of actin filaments, morphological changes are primarily controlled by actin binding proteins (ABPs). Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-3-kinase-A (ITPKA) is a neuron-specific, actin bundling protein concentrated at dendritic spines. Here, we demonstrate that ITPKA depletion in mice increases the number of hippocampal spine-synapses while reducing average spine length. By employing actin to ABP ratios similar to those occurring at post synaptic densities, in addition to cross-linking actin filaments, ITPKA strongly inhibits Arp2/3-complex induced actin filament branching by displacing the complex from F-actin. In summary, our data show that in vivo ITPKA negatively regulates formation and/or maintenance of synaptic contacts in the mammalian brain. On the molecular level this effect appears to result from the ITPKA-mediated inhibition of Arp2/3-complex F-actin branching activity.",
