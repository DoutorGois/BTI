     "AB": "The first component of the classic complement cascade, C1q, was increased in whole rat brain after lesioning by intraperitoneally injected kainic acid (KA) (20-fold, 3 days after KA) and in the striatum ipsilateral to unilateral decortication (fivefold, 10 days after decortication). C1q was measured after purification by chromatography and electrophoresis. De novo biosynthesis of C1q 3 days after KA was increased >10-fold, as measured by the incorporation of [35S]methionine into C1q after incubation of brain slices from KA-treated rats for 2 h. In parallel with these responses, KA induced fivefold increase of C1q bioactivity, as evaluated with C1q-dependent hemolysis. The contribution of C1q from entrapped cerebrovascular blood was evaluated by the effects of perfusion and was minor relative to the increases of C1q in response to KA lesioning. These findings support the hypothesis that the C1q protein detected by immunocytochemistry in senile plaques of Alzheimer brains and in the hippocampus after deafferenting lesions is synthesized by resident brain cells.",
