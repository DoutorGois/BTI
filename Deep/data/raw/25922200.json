     "AB": "Eph/ephrin signalling plays essential roles in various tissue developments, such as axon guidance, angiogenesis and tissue separation. Interaction between Ephs and ephrins upon cell-cell contact results in forward (towards Eph-expressing cells) and reverse (towards ephrin-expressing cells) signalling. Although the molecular mechanisms downstream of Eph/ephrin forward signalling have been extensively studied, the functions and intracellular molecular mechanisms of Eph/ephrin reverse signalling are not fully understood. Rho GTPases are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton to regulate cell morphology. In this study, we revealed that stimulation with the extracellular domain of EphB2 to activate Eph/ephrin reverse signalling induced axonal retraction in hippocampal neurons. The reduction of axonal length and branching by Eph/ephrin reverse signalling was blocked by inhibition of RhoA or Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK). These results suggest that Eph/ephrin reverse signalling negatively regulates axonal outgrowth and branching through RhoA/ROCK pathway in hippocampal neurons.",
