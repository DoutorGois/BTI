     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore molecular controlling mechanism of mitochondrial injury induced by different density of microwave irradiation. METHODS: Rats were exposed to microwave irradiation for 1 hour at average power density of 3 mW/cm(2) or 30 mW/cm(2). After microwave irradiation, the changes of pathological ultrastructure of rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus were observed by electron microscope, and mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) mRNA expression level were determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: After 3 mW/cm(2) microwave irradiation for 0, 3, 24 h, mitochondrial ultrastructure and mtTFA mRNA expression level didn't significantly change in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus. After 30 mW/cm(2) microwave irradiation for 0, 3, 24 h, mitochondrial ultrastructure obviously changed, mtTFA mRNA expression in rat hippocampus significantly increased by 67.00%, 80.00%, 30.00% respectively, and in rat cerebral cortex by 133.00%, 86.00%, 233.00% respectively. There were significant differences between the corresponding groups of hippocampus and cerebral cortex (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: No obvious change in mitochondria was found after 3 mW/cm(2) microwave irradiation, but it was found after 30 mW/cm(2) microwave irradiation. Mitochondria injury in cerebral cortex was more severe than that in hippocampus. mtTFA mRNA may have certain regulation in mitochondrial energy metabolism.",
