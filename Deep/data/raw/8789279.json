     "AB": "This study characterized the influence of full-term gestational ethanol exposure on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunoreactive neurons that project to the hippocampus, within the medial septal (MS) nucleus and the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (DBv). On gestation days 1-22, pregnant dams were fed either a vitamin fortified ethanol-containing liquid diet, pair fed a calorically equivalent sucrose-containing diet, or given rat chow ad libitum. In a previous study, we found that chronic prenatal exposure to ethanol, in this manner, resulted in a significant decline in the ontogenetic upregulation of ChAT activity in the septal area during the second postnatal week, but was followed by recovery to control levels by adulthood. On postnatal days 14 and 60 (P14 and P60) the brains were prepared for ChAT immunocytochemistry. Ethanol exposure had little influence on the number of ChAT-positive neurons in the MS nucleus of animals at either age. Ethanol exposure had no effect on neuronal size or ChAT staining intensity of MS or DBv neurons when compared to chow-fed offspring. Although age-related increases in cholinergic neuronal numbers and decreases in neuronal size were observed between juvenile and adult animals, prenatal ethanol exposure did not appear to influence these postnatal changes in the population as a whole. Overall, these findings suggest that the anatomical maturation of septal cholinergic neurons may be relatively insensitive to prenatal ethanol exposure under conditions of a vitamin-rich dietary supplementation, while biochemical development within this region may be more susceptible to early ethanol influences.",
