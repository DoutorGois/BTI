     "AB": "It is of interest to record event-related potentials in the course of transient global amnesia (TGA) because the hippocampus and diencephalon, generally considered to be the sites of the dysfunction responsible for the amnesic episodes are also considered as two possible generators of the P300 wave. However, the only four cases reported so far in the literature showed an intact auditive P300 in three cases and an intact auditive P300 with reduction of visual P300 in one case. Here are reported four new cases. The P300 wave was readily identifiable in all four cases, without any amplitude reduction, thus suggesting that the condition did not entail inactivation or functional depression of P300 generators. Concerning P300 latency, in one case it was delayed but became normal after the ictus. In the second case, the latency, although within normal limits, shortened after the ictus. In the third and the fourth cases, the latency, initially within normal limits, remained unchanged. These apparently disparate results should be analysed in the light of the results of isotope measurement of cerebral blood flow during the amnesia, which are also inconsistent but most frequently indicate bilateral temporal or thalamic flow reduction. It remains to be determined in the future whether the stability or change in the P300 will make it possible to predict the brain region involved in transient global amnesia, which could perhaps vary from one patient to another.",
