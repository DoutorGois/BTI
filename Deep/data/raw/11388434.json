     "AB": "Intoxication by the organophosphate compound soman causes prolonged seizures that lead to neuropathology in the brain. This MRI-based study describes the temporal and spatial evolution of brain pathology that follows soman-induced convulsions. We observed significant decreases in apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC; 23% below control) of the hippocampus and thalamus by 12 h after soman treatment. The ADC then returned to near normal values in all regions at 24 h but declined again during the next 7 days. These data suggest that the initial cellular degradation may be resolved but is ultimately followed by regional cellular remodeling. T2 relaxation values declined significantly at 12 h (37% decrease) returning to near normal values by 24 h. These data lend detail to the model suggesting that injured tissues experience an edematous influx that is resolved by 24 h. The imaging data was fully supported by histopathological comparisons where moderate cell loss and swelling within the hippocampus and piriform cortex was observed. This is the first report providing excellenttemporal and spatial resolution of emerging soman-mediated, seizure-induced neuropathology using MRI with histological correlation.",
