     "AB": "Sertraline is one of the most commonly used antidepressants in clinic. Although it is well accepted that sertraline exerts its action through inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin at presynaptic site in the brain, its effect on the neural stem cells (NSCs) has not been well elucidated. In this study, we utilized NSCs separated from the hippocampus of fetal rat to investigate the effect of sertraline on the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. The study demonstrated that sertraline had no effect on NSCs proliferation but it significantly promoted NSCs to differentiate into serotoninergic neurons other than glia cells. Furthermore, we found that sertraline protected NSCs against the lipopolysaccharide-induced cellular damage. These data indicate that sertraline can promote neurogenesis and protect the viability of neural stem cells.",
