     "AB": "Infection of the central nervous system by Borna disease virus (BDV) provides a unique model to study the mechanisms whereby a persistent viral infection can impair neuronal function and cause behavioral diseases reminiscent of mood disorders, schizophrenia, or autism in humans. In the present work, we studied the effect of BDV infection on the response of hippocampal neurons, the main target for this virus, to the neurotrophin BDNF. We showed that persistent infection did not affect neuronal survival or morphology. However, it blocked BDNF-induced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, despite normal expression of the TrkB BDNF receptor. In addition, BDNF-induced expression of synaptic vesicle proteins was abrogated, which resulted in severely impaired synaptogenesis and defects in synaptic organization. Thus, we provide the first evidence that a virus can interfere specifically with neurotrophin-regulated neuroplasticity, thereby hampering proper neuronal connectivity. These results may help to understand the behavioral disorders associated with BDV infection.",
