     "AB": "The high affinity uptake of GABA and glycine by synaptosomal preparations of rabbit hippocampus and spinal cord has been characterized. The high affinity uptake by such preparations from rabbits in which chronic neurofibrillary changes had been induced with aluminum chloride was measured and found to be reduced. The reduction was the greatest when the number of neurons affected was the greatest. These results suggest that normal neurotransmitter function is considerably disturbed in neurons affected with neurofibrillary changes.",
