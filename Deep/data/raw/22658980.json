     "AB": "Several studies have shown that the alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor is involved in controlling extracellular serotonin levels. The administration of the alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin was shown to decrease extracellular serotonin levels in the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex and the raphe nucleus, while the administration of the alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor agonist cirazoline was shown to increase serotonin levels. Furthermore, the elevation of serotonin levels induced by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram was attenuated by prazosin. Thus, alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor antagonists may affect SSRI-induced increases in extracellular serotonin levels and their antidepressive and anxiolytic effects. However, little is known about the influence of alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor antagonists on the behavioral pharmacological effects of SSRIs. The conditioned fear stress-induced freezing behavior is an animal model of anxiety and can detect the anxiolytic effect of SSRIs. To clarify whether an alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor antagonist affects the anxiolytic action of SSRIs, we examined the effects of the co-administration of the alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin and the SSRI citalopram using the contextual conditioned fear stress model. Low-dose prazosin (0.03 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the citalopram (3 mg/kg)-induced decrease in conditioned freezing. Moreover, high-dose (0.5 mg/kg), but not low-dose (0.03 mg/kg), prazosin significantly attenuated citalopram (10 mg/kg)-induced decreases in conditioned freezing. These drugs did not affect the spontaneous motor activity of the rats. Therefore, these results suggest that blocking the alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor decreases the anxiolytic effect of citalopram.",
