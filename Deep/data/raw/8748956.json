     "AB": "J.W. Rudy and R.J. Sutherland (1989) suggested that the hippocampal formation (HF) is necessary for performance of configural tasks and that rats with kainic acid + colchicine (K-C) damage to the HF were impaired on the negative patterning problem (A+, B+, AB-). However, M. Gallagher and P.C. Holland (1992) found spared performance on a similar task (AC+, B+, AB-, C-) when ibotenic acid (IBO) was used. This study compared the effects of K-C- and IBO-induced HF damage on 4 configural tasks: (a) negative patterning, (b) the Gallagher-Holland task, (c) transverse patterning, and (d) place learning. Rats with IBO lesions performed like controls on the Gallagher-Holland task (replicating M. Gallagher & P.C. Holland) but were impaired on negative patterning, transverse patterning, and place learning. In contrast, rats with K-C lesions were impaired on all 4 tasks. The implications of these results for theories of HF function are discussed.",
