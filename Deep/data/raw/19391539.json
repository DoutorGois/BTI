     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study on the mechanism of electroacupuncture for treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: SD rats were randomly divided into a normal group, a sham operation group, a model group and an electroacupuncture group, 12 rats in each group. The AD rat model was prepared by microinjection of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta1-40) into the Meynert nucleus. In the electroacupuncture group, electroacupuncture was given at \"Baihui\" (GV 20), \"Taixi\" (KI 3), \"Zusanli\" (ST 36). The learning and memory ability was assessed by Morris water maze and the glial cell activity in the hippocampus was determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, the glial cell in the hippocampus was activated with increase of the number, and the learning and memory ability reduced in the model group (P < 0.01). After treatment, as compared with the model group, the number of the activated glial cells was reduced and the learning and memory ability was improved in the electroacupuncture group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture treatment can decrease the number of activated glial cells so as to protect the neurons, improving the learning and memory ability in the AD rat.",
