     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we investigated the effects of treadmill exercise on microglial activation and the subsequent release of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1-beta in the hippocampus in a rat model of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: At 30 weeks of age, diabetic (Zucker diabetic fatty, ZDF) rats and their littermate control (Zucker lean control, ZLC) rats were either placed on a stationary treadmill or made to run for 1 hour/day at 12-16 m/minute on five consecutive days, for 10 weeks. Once the rats reached 40 weeks, they were perfused and their hippocampus collected for immunohistochemistry or hippocampus collected fresh for the Western blotting or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The whole blood glucose levels in exercised ZDF rats were significantly higher than in the sedentary or exercised ZLC rats, but were significantly lower than in the sedentary ZDF rats. In the sedentary ZLC and exercised ZLC rats, ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) immunoreactive microglia showed normal morphology which had small cytoplasm with ramified processes. In the sedentary ZDF rats, some Iba-1 immunoreactive microglia showed abnormal morphology which had hypertrophied cytoplasm with retracted processes. However, exercised ZDF rats had small cytoplasm with highly ramified processes. Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta in the hippocampal homogenates were significantly increased in sedentary ZDF rats compared to sedentary ZLC rats, respectively. However, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta levels in the exercised ZDF rats were significantly decreased compared with those of sedentary ZDF rats, respectively. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that exercise in type 2 diabetic rats reduces microglial activation and the subsequent increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the hippocampus.",
