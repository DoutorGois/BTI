     "AB": "Childhood maltreatment is associated with impaired adult brain function, particularly in the hippocampus, and is not only a major risk factor for some psychiatric diseases but also affects early social development and social adaptation in later life. The aims of this study were to determine whether early postnatal stress affects social behavior and whether repeated fluvoxamine treatment reverses these changes. Rat pups were exposed to footshock stress during postnatal days 21-25 (at 3 weeks old: 3wFS). During the post-adolescent period (10-14 weeks postnatal), the social interaction test and Golgi-cox staining of dorsal hippocampal pyramidal neurons were performed. Following exposure to footshock stress, 3wFS rats showed an increase in social interaction time, which might be practically synonymous with hypersociability, and a decrease in spine density in the CA3 hippocampal subregion, but not in CA1. These behavioral and morphological changes were both recovered by repeated oral administration of fluvoxamine at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 14 days. These findings suggest that the vulnerability of the hippocampal CA3 region is closely related to social impairments induced by physical stress during the juvenile period and shed some light on therapeutic alternatives for early postnatal stress-induced emotional dysfunction.",
