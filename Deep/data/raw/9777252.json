     "AB": "1. Exposure to a combined forced swimming-confinement stress resulted in a decrease in insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) mRNA levels in the whole brain (without the cerebellum) and in the isolated brain areas of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum. 2. In an effort to elucidate the neurotransmitter systems involved in this stress-induced decrease, animals were injected prior to exposure to the stress, with either propranolol, diazepam, or MK-801. 3. Administration of diazepam or MK-801 did not affect the stress-induced decrease in IGF-II mRNA in any of the three brain areas examined. 4. Administration of propranolol prior to the exposure to the stress inhibited the stress-induced decrease in IGF-II mRNA in the cerebellum. Propranolol had no such effect in the cerebral cortex or the hippocampus. 5. Our results suggest that in the cerebellum, the stress-induced decrease in IGF-II mRNA is mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors.",
