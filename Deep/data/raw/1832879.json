     "AB": "We have cloned a cDNA for dynamin, a 100 kd microtubule-associated motor protein whose 5' region contains a GTP-binding motif homologous to that of the Mx proteins, from a rat brain library and analyzed its expression. Dynamin mRNA is 3.6 kb and is preferentially expressed in the brain after postnatal day 7, parallel to the developmental increase of the protein. In situ hybridization revealed high levels of dynamin transcripts in neural cells in the cerebellar cortex, hippocampus (particularly in the CA3 area), and cerebral cortex. The transcripts appeared in cerebellar granular cells only after they had ceased dividing and had migrated to the inner granular layer. We show that dynamin is expressed predominantly in neural cells after elongation of their processes, suggesting a role especially in mature neurons.",
