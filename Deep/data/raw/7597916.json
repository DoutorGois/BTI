     "AB": "AIM: To study the effects of tetrandrine (Tet) vs nicardipine (Nic) on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion damages. METHODS: Cerebral ischemia was produced by 10-min occlusion of bilateral carotid arteries followed by 5-min reperfusion in gerbils. The changes in electroencephalogram (EEG), calcium and water contents, lipid peroxide (LPO) content and ultrastructure in gerbil brains were compared. RESULTS: Pretreatment with Tet (15 mg.kg-1, i.v.) and Nic (0.25 mg.kg-1, i.v.) enhanced the recovery of EEG amplitude, reduced the calcium (151.2 +/- 1.1 and 155.3 +/- 2.4 mg/kg dry wt in Tet and Nic groups vs 193 +/- 8 mg/kg dry wt in ischemia-reperfusion group, P < 0.05) and water contents, attenuated the increase in LPO content (293 +/- 29 and 276 +/- 23 mumol.kg-1 wet wt in Tet and Nic groups vs 427 +/- 24 mumol.kg-1 wet wt in ischemia-reperfusion group, P < 0.01), and diminished the ultrastructural abnormalities of cortex and hippocampus in gerbil brain during ischemia and reperfusion. CONCLUSION: Tet and Nic had protective effects against ischemia-reperfusion brain damages in gerbils. The effects of Tet were similar to, but less potent than those of Nic.",
