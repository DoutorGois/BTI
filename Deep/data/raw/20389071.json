     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous condition, and the prognosis differs within the group. Recent findings suggest that hippocampal volumetry and CSF biomarkers can be used to predict which MCI patients have an underlying neurodegenerative disorder. OBJECTIVE: To examine the combined predictive value of hippocampal volume and CSF levels of total tau (T-tau) and beta-amyloid(42) (Abeta(42)) in stable and converting MCI patients. The participants (n = 68) included patients with MCI at baseline and who converted to dementia by the time of the 2-year follow-up (n = 21), stable MCI patients (n = 21) and healthy controls (n = 26). METHODS: The Goteborg MCI study is a clinically based longitudinal study with biannual clinical assessments. Hippocampal volumetry was performed manually, based on data from the 0.5-tesla MRI investigations at baseline. Baseline CSF levels of T-tau and Abeta(42) were measured using commercially available, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: The converting MCI group had significantly smaller left hippocampi, lower CSF Abeta(42) and higher T-tau compared to both the stable MCI group and the healthy controls. Multivariate analysis revealed that a combination of the variables outperformed the prognostic ability of the separate variables. CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal volumes supplement the prognostic accuracy of CSF Abeta(42) and T-tau in MCI.",
