     "AB": "Several magnetic resonance imaging studies have reported reductions in hippocampal volume in patients with psychosis. It is unclear whether structural abnormalities predate illness onset. We conducted a detailed, systematic literature search for studies reporting hippocampal volume in subjects with clinical high-risk, compared to healthy controls. The overall sample size comprised 1429 subjects. Meta-analysis revealed no difference for left, but a small, albeit significant, difference for right hippocampal volume, such that clinical high-risk patients had slightly smaller hippocampal volume than healthy controls (g=0.24, p=0.0418). Meta-regression indicated a moderating effect of manual tracing approach, due to one outlying site. The small difference on the right side did not remain significant (g=0.14, 95%CI=[-0.03-0.32], p=0.11) after removal of this outlier. This meta-analysis suggests that there is no reduction in hippocampal volume before transition to psychosis and hippocampal volume cannot be used as a biomarker in clinical high-risk individuals.",
