     "AB": "We have shown in a previous study that high corticosterone levels during repeated immobilization stress result in a reduction of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the hippocampus. The reduction of GR presumably accounts for loss of or decrease in glucocorticoid-negative feedback, and thus hyperfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis persists during chronic stress. Starvation is a stress state in which the counterregulatory responses against the loss of food occur in the central nervous system. We explored the impact of starvation on the HPA axis, GR and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) mRNAs in the hippocampus, the PVN, and the anterior pituitary (AP) of rats. Rats were starved for 4 days and sacrificed in the morning. Starved rats showed high levels of plasma corticosterone, whereas neither plasma corticotropin (ACTH), AP proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA nor AP type-1 corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor mRNA was altered in the starved rats. In the presence of high corticosterone, starvation resulted in a decrease in both CRH mRNA and type-1 CRH receptor mRNA in the PVN. Consistently, the starved rats did not show any changes in GR mRNA in the hippocampus (CA1-2, CA3, and dentate gyrus), the PVN or the AP despite the elevation of plasma corticosterone. A significant decrease in MR mRNA was seen in the dentate gyrus and the AP, but not in CA1-2, CA3 or PVN. The lack of reduction of GR may be one of the organism's counterregulatory responses during starvation, which allows an intact glucocorticoid negative feedback, thereby resulting in decreased anorectic neuropeptide levels, namely CRH, in the PVN. The results also indicate that GR mRNA in the hippocampus and other brain regions is not solely regulated by circulating glucocorticoids. The mechanism underlying the regulation of GR mRNA in the central nervous system remains to be clarified.",
