     "AB": "Dendritic arborization is one of the key determinants of precise circuits for information processing in neurons. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying dendrite morphogenesis is critical to understanding the establishment of neuronal connections. Here, using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we defined the chromodomain protein and transcription corepressor chromodomain Y-like (CDYL) protein as a negative regulator of dendrite morphogenesis in rat/mouse hippocampal neurons both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpressing CDYL decreased, whereas knocking it down increased, the dendritic complexity of the primary cultured rat neurons. High-throughput DNA microarray screening identified a number of CDYL downstream target genes, including the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Knock-down of CDYL in neuronal cells led to increased expression of BDNF, which is primarily responsible for CDYL's effects on dendrite patterns. Mechanistically, CDYL interacts with EZH2, the catalytic subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), directly and recruits the H3K27 methyltransferase activity to the promoter region of the BDNF gene. In doing so, CDYL and EZH2 coordinately restrict dendrite morphogenesis in an interdependent manner. Finally, we found that neural activity increased dendritic complexity through degradation of CDYL protein to unleash its inhibition on BDNF. These results link, for the first time, the epigenetic regulators CDYL and EZH2 to dendrite morphogenesis and might shed new light on our understanding of the regulation of the neurodevelopment.",
