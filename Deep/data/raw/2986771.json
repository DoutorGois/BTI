Although the cyclic octapeptide ligands label the majority of the regions labeled with [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin, in the cortex and hippocampus only a subpopulation of somatostatin receptors is labeled. Cyclic octapeptide ligands have improved resolution due to their very low non-specific binding.",
