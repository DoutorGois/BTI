     "AB": "The blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) plays important roles in the recovery of spinal cord injury (SCI), and caveolin-1 is essential for the integrity and permeability of barriers. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is an important neuroprotective protein and contributes to the survival of neuronal cells. This study was designed to investigate whether bFGF is beneficial for the maintenance of junction proteins and the integrity of the BSCB to identify the relations with caveolin-1 regulation. We examined the integrity of the BSCB with Evans blue dye and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran extravasation, measured the junction proteins and matrix metalloproteinases, and evaluated the locomotor function recovery. Our data indicated that bFGF treatment improved the recovery of BSCB and functional locomotion in contusive SCI model rats, reduced the expression and activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9, and increased the expressions of caveolin-1 and junction proteins, including occludin, claudin-5, p120-catenin, and beta-catenin. In the brain, in microvascular endothelial cells, bFGF treatment increased the levels of junction proteins, caveolin-1 small interfering RNA abolished the protective effect of bFGF under oxygen-glucose deprivation conditions, and the expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and co-localization with caveolin-1 decreased significantly, which could not be reversed by bFGF treatment. These findings provide a novel mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of bFGF on the BSCB and recovery of SCI, especially the regulation of caveolin-1.",
