     "AB": "Heme oxygenase activity is the sole known physiological source for the production of carbon monoxide (CO), a gaseous messenger candidate. A sensitive radioenzymatic microassay was validated to study regional distribution of heme oxygenase activity within the rat brain. The assay utilized a 14,000 X g supernatant of brain homogenate and [14C]heme as the substrate. Thin layer chromatography revealed that incubation of cerebellar supernatant with (14C]heme yielded a single reaction product, indistinguishable from bilirubin, that was selectively extracted into toluene. Radioactivity in toluene increased linearly in respect to time and added protein, was totally dependent on NADPH and was not detected with boiled homogenate. The reaction was dose-dependently inhibited by Zn-protoporphyrin IX (IC50 0.3 microM) and by an antibody generated against rat NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase indicating specific involvement of heme oxygenase. As little as 36 fmol [14C]bilirubin/min could be readily detected requiring only microgram-quantities of cerebellar homogenate. Heme oxygenase activity measurements from discrete brain regions revealed for the first time marked differences in enzyme activity with the increasing order: frontal cortex < cerebellum = caudate-putamen < hippocampus = hypothalamus = colliculi << trapezoid body. This activity pattern closely reflects the distribution of immunoreactivity and mRNA for heme oxygenase. The present microassay should offer a valuable tool for studies directly assessing a possible role for CO in neural signaling.",
