     "AB": "Although the beta-amyloid peptide is an established core component of neuritic plaques that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease, the mechanisms responsible for its deposition are not well understood. We now report that lesions of rat hippocampal neurons cause a time-dependent, long-lasting elevation of immunoreactivity for the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neighboring astrocytes, a cell type not normally containing the protein. The increase represents astroglial expression of the protein rather than a scavenging of APP released by damaged neurons. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that APP-containing cells are reactive astroglia, both surrounding capillaries and within the neuropil. These results demonstrate that neuronal damage stimulates APP expression in adult brain and suggest that reactive astrocytes may be a source of the beta-amyloid that forms neuropathological plaques in Alzheimer's disease.",
