     "AB": "At present, catecholamines are considered to play a significant role in the regulation of psychic function and emotional states. Our investigations have revealed significant changes in peripheral catecholamine metabolism in alcoholic patients. Catecholamine metabolism in the brain and in the periphery are rather autonomous, and thus in our studies we compared the effects of alcohol on dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems in different brain regions as well as in the periphery. We found a significant decrease in noradrenaline levels in different regions of the CNS, particularly midbrain, hypothalamus and hippocampus. In chronic studies with rats, catecholamine metabolism was studied in animals chronically treated with alcohol, those treated with a single dose after chronic treatment, and those animals undergoing withdrawal from alcohol. Neuropharmacological and neurochemical studies were accompanied by electrophysiological monitoring of the effects of alcohol.",
