     "AB": "Distribution of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) binding sites was investigated in the rat brain and pituitary gland by means of in vitro autoradiography. High densities of specific [125I]PACAP binding were observed in the anterior pituitary, hippocampus (CA1-4 and dentate gyrus) and in the superior colliculus. Moderate to high labeling was observed in the periaqueductal gray matter, substantia nigra pars compacta, and in the habenula. The hypothalamus, thalamus, ventral tegmental area (VTA), mammillary body and medial geniculate body were moderately labeled. The present results support possible actions of PACAP on the pituitary functions, and further suggest that PACAP is a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in the central nervous system.",
