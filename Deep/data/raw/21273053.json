     "AB": "Total saponins extracted from the caudexes and leaves of Panax notoginseng (SCLPN) have been used in the clinic for improving mental function, treating insomnia, and alleviating anxiety. The present study evaluated the potential antidepressant activity of SCLPN in rodent models of depression and the mechanism of action of SCLPN. Mice were received SCLPN at doses of 10-1000 mg/kg daily for 1, 7, and 14 days and then were subjected to the forced swim test and locomotor activity test. The results showed that SCLPN decreased immobility time in the forced swim test, with little effect on locomotion. In the chronic mild stress model, chronic SCLPN treatment (70 mg/kg) reversed the rats' depression-like behavior. Furthermore, SCLPN exerted its antidepressant-like effect by increasing the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, and noradrenaline. Additionally, SCLPN treatment reduced intracellular Ca(2+) in cultured neurons. The present study suggests that SCLPN may function as an antidepressant, and the antidepressant-like effects of SCLPN may be mediated by modulation of brain monoamine neurotransmitters and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration.",
