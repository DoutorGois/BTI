     "AB": "Immunohistochemical distribution and cellular localization of neurotrophins was investigated in adult monkey brains using antisera against nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). Western blot analysis showed that each antibody specifically recognized appropriate bands of approximately 14.7 kDa, 14.2 kDa, 13.6 kDa, and 14.5 kDa, for NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4, respectively. These positions coincided with the molecular masses of the neurotrophins studied. Furthermore, sections exposed to primary antiserum preadsorbed with full-length NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 exhibited no detectable immunoreactivity, demonstrating specificities of the antibodies against the tissues prepared from rhesus monkeys. The study provided a systematic report on the distribution of NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 in the monkey brain. Varying intensity of immunostaining was observed in the somata and processes of a wide variety of neurons and glial cells in the cerebrum, cerebellum, hippocampus, and other regions of the brain. Neurons in some regions such as the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, which stained for neurotrophins, also expressed neurotrophic factor mRNA. In some other brain regions, there was discrepancy of protein distribution and mRNA expression reported previously, indicating a retrograde or anterograde action mode of neurotrophins. Results of this study provide a morphological basis for the elucidation of the roles of NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 in adult primate brains.",
