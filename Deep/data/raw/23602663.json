     "AB": "Recently, there is an increasing interest in the study of the role of brain dysfunction in the pathogenesis of symptoms of functional dyspepsia (FD). More specifically, abnormal brain activities in patients with FD during the resting state have been proven by several positron emission tomography (PET) studies. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is also a valuable tool in investigating spontaneous brain activity abnormalities in pathological conditions. In the present study, we examined the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional (f)ALFF changes in patients with FD by using fMRI. Twenty-nine patients with FD and sixteen healthy controls participated in this study. Between-group differences in ALFF/fALFF were examined using a permutation-based nonparametric test after accounting for the gender and age effects. The results revealed a significant between-group difference in fALFF but not in ALFF in multiple brain regions including the right insula, brainstem and cerebellum. Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity analysis revealed that FD patients have increased correlations between the right cerebellum and multiple brain regions including the bilateral brainstem, bilateral cerebellum, bilateral thalamus, left para-/hippocampus, left pallidum and left putamen. Furthermore, fLAFF values in the right insula were positively correlated with the severity of the disease. These findings have provided further evidence of spontaneous brain activity abnormalities in FD patients which might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease.",
