     "AB": "2-Amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, an antagonist of excitation caused by dicarboxylic amino acids with a selective action on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, has been administered in an anticonvulsant dose (1 mmol/kg i.p.) to fed or fasted rats and mice. The drug impaired motor activity in fasted mice. Glucose and amino acids were determined in dissected regions of brain fixed by microwave irradiation. Glucose content was low in the brains of fasted rats and mice but was restored to normal (fed) concentration 45 min after the administration of 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid in fasted mice. In fed animals, 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid did not change brain aspartate concentration. In fasted animals, aspartate concentration was raised in most brain regions. In fasted rats and mice, 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid significantly increased glutamine in rat cortex and mouse striatum, decreased glutamate content in rat striatum, and decreased aspartate concentration in all regions except mouse cortex and striatum. GABA levels were significantly decreased in rat striatum and hippocampus. These changes are consistent with an increased synaptic release of glutamate and aspartate following blockage of their post-synaptic action at selected sites.",
