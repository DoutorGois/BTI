     "AB": "The rate of neurogenesis within the adult hippocampus has been shown to vary across mammalian species. The canine hippocampus, demonstrating a structural intermediacy between the rodent and human hippocampi, is therefore a valuable model in which to study adult neurogenesis. In vitro culture assays are an essential component of characterizing neurogenesis and adult neural precursor cells, allowing for precise control over the cellular environment. To date however, culture protocols for canine cells remain under-represented in the literature. Detailed here are systematic protocols for the isolation and culture of hippocampal neural precursor cells from the adult canine brain. We demonstrate the expansion of canine neural precursor cells as floating neurospheres and as an adherent monolayer culture, producing stable cell lines that are able to differentiation into mature neural cell types in vitro. Adult canine neural precursors are an underused resource that may provide a more faithful analogue for the study of human neural precursors and the cellular mechanisms of adult neurogenesis.",
