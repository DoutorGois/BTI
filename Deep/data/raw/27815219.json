     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Recently, it was demonstrated that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can transactivate tyrosine kinase receptors in absence of their ligands. In this work, driven by the observation that mAChRs and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) share signalling pathways and regulation of brain functions, it was decided to explore whether mAChRs activation may transactivate FGFRs and, if so, to characterize the related trophic effects in cultured hippocampal neurons. METHODS: Oxotremorine-M transactivation of FGFRs and related trophic effects were tested in primary hippocampal neurons. Western blotting and in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) were used to detect FGFR phosphorylation (pFGFR) levels and M1R-FGFR1 heteroreceptor complexes, respectively. RESULTS: Oxotremorine-M, a non-selective mAChRs agonist, was able to transactivate FGFR and this transactivation was blocked by Src inhibitors. Oxotremorine-M treatment produced a significant increase in the primary neurite outgrowth that was blocked by pre-treatment with the pFGFR inhibitor SU5402 and Src inhibitors. This trophic effect was almost similar to that induced by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). By using atropine as nonselective mAChRs or pirenzepine as selective antagonist for M1 receptor (M1R) we could show that mAChRs are involved in modulating the pFGFRs. Using PLA, M1R-FGFR1 heteroreceptor complexes were identified in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. CONCLUSION: The current findings, by showing functional mAChR-FGFR interactions, will contribute to advance the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the actions of cholinergic drugs on neuronal plasticity. GENERAL SIGNIFICANT: Data may help to develop novel therapeutic strategies not only for neurodegenerative diseases but also for depression-induced atrophy of hippocampal neurons.",
