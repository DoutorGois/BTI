     "AB": "Mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener, diazoxide, is shown to have protective effect on the heart and brain following ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury (IR/II). However, the detailed effect of diazoxide and its antagonist on neuronal death, mitochondrial changes, and apoptosis in cerebral IR/II has not fully studied. IR/II was induced in rats by the 4-vessel occlusion model. Neuronal cell death and mitochondrial changes in CA1-CA4 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus were studied by light and electron microscopy, respectively. Apoptosis was assessed by measuring the amount of protein expressed by Bax and Bcl-2 genes. In light microscopy studies, the number of total and normal cells were increased only following 18 mg/kg of diazoxide. Lower doses (2 and 6 mg/kg) failed to change the cell numbers. All three doses of glibenclamide (1, 5, and 25 mg/kg) decreased the number of total and normal cell populations. In electron microscopy studies, different doses of diazoxide and glibenclamide prevented and aggravated the IR-induced morphological changes, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that diazoxide and glibenclamide inhibited and enhanced Bax protein expression respectively. Regarding Bcl-2 expression, only diazoxide showed a significant enhancement of gene expression. In conclusion, the results show that diazoxide can exhibit neuroprotective effects against IR/II in hippocampal regions, possibly through the opening of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) channels.",
