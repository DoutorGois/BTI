     "AB": "Alterations in adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been observed in numerous neurological diseases that contain a neuroinflammatory component. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that contributes to neuroinflammation in many CNS disorders. Our previous results reveal a severe reduction in adult hippocampal neurogenesis due to focal and chronic expression of IL-1beta in a transgenic mouse model, IL-1beta(XAT), that evokes a complex neuroinflammatory response. Other investigators have shown that IL-1beta can bind directly to neural precursors to cause cell cycle arrest in vitro. In order to observe if IL-1 signaling is necessary in vivo, we conditionally knocked out MyD88, an adapter protein essential for IL-1 signaling, in nestin(+) neural precursor cells (NPCs) in the presence of IL-1beta-dependent inflammation. Our results show that conditional knockout of MyD88 does not prevent IL-1beta-induced reduction in neuroblasts using a genetic fate mapping model. Interestingly, MyD88 deficiency in nestin(+) NPCs causes an increase in the number of astrocytes in the presence of IL-1beta, suggesting that MyD88-dependent signaling is important in limiting astroglial differentiation due to inflammation. MyD88 deficiency does not alter the fate of NPCs in the absence of inflammation. Furthermore, the inflammatory milieu due to IL-1beta is not affected by the absence of MyD88 in nestin(+) NPCs. These results show that sustained IL-1beta causes a reduction in adult hippocampal neurogenesis that is independent of MyD88-dependent signaling in nestin(+) NPCs, suggesting an indirect negative effect of IL-1beta on neurogenesis.",
