     "AB": "Electrical stimulation of the rat locus coeruleus cases about a 300% increase in the activity of the tyrosine hydroxylase prepared from the hippocampus on the stimulated side and assayed in the presence of subsaturating concentrations of tyrosine and pteridine cofactor. Addition of calcium or cAMP to soluble preparations of tyrosine hydroxylase isolated from the hippocampus produces a similar activation of tyrosine hydroxylase. The activation of tyrosine hydroxylase produced by calcium is reversed by addition of the calcium chelator, EGTA, while the activation produced by cAMP addition or by electrical stimulation of the locus coeruleus is unaffected by addition of EGTA to the assay medium. The activation of tyrosine hydroxylase produced by electrical stimulation or by addition of calcium or cAMP to the assay medium appears to be mediated in part by alterations in the kinetic properties of the enzyme. All treatment causes the enzyme to have an increased affinity for substrate and pteridine cofactor and a decreased affinity for the endproduct inhibitor, norepinephrine. These results are suggestive that the activation of tyrosine hydroxylase which occurs during periods of increased impulse flow in noradrenergic neurons may be initiated by alterations in calcium fluxes or by changes in the steady state levels of cAMP which accompany neuronal depolarization.",
