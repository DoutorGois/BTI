     "AB": "Banxia-houpu decoction is a safe and effective traditional Chinese medicinal formula used in the treatment of mild and manic-depressive disorders for centuries. There has been increasing interest in its therapeutic application in depression. However, the mechanisms behind behavioural changes are still poorly understood. Chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced preference behaviour change has been used as a model to predict the clinical efficacy of many types of antidepressant treatment. Both EtOH and water extracts (AE and WE) of Banxia-houpu decoction exhibited a significantly increased sucrose intake in the CMS model in rats, but there was no effect in unstressed animals. In the present study, it was found that the c-fos expression in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum corpora were very high in the CMS model in rats. WE and AE at a dose of 130 mg/kg exhibited a significantly decreased c-fos expression in the cerebral regions in CMS model in rats, respectively. The former was more potent than the latter. However, no significant changes in the c-fos expression were observed in unstressed rats treated with the decoction. Fluoxetine not only significantly reduced c-fos expression in all regions in the CMS model in rats, but only showed a marked decrease in c-fos expression in the hippocampus in unstressed animals. A different molecular mechanism of Banxia-houpu decoction and fluoxetine may be implied. The cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum conpora might be important structural substrates in the central nervous system mediating the section of the Banxia-houpu decoction on preference behaviour in CMS-induced rats, and fos protein might be the common substrate of the signal transduction process of the decoction.",
