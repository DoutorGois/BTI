     "AB": "Neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings reveal that the hippocampus is important for recognition memory. However, it is unclear when and whether the hippocampus contributes differentially to recognition of previously studied items (old) versus novel items (new), or contributes to a general processing requirement that is necessary for recognition of both types of information. To address this issue, we examined the temporal dynamics and spectral frequency underlying hippocampal activity during recognition of old/new complex scenes using magnetoencephalography (MEG). In order to provide converging evidence to existing literature in support of the potential of MEG to localize the hippocampus, we reconstructed brain source activity using the beamformer method and analyzed three types of processing-related signal changes by applying three different analysis methods: (1) Synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) revealed event related and non-event-related spectral power changes; (2) Inter-trial coherence (ITC) revealed time-locked changes in neural synchrony; and (3) Event-related SAM (ER-SAM) revealed averaged event-related responses over time. Hippocampal activity was evident for both old and new information within the theta frequency band and during the first 250 ms following stimulus onset. The early onset of hippocampal responses suggests that general comparison processes related to recognition of new/old information may occur obligatorily.",
