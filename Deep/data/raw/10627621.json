     "AB": "Monkeys with lesions limited to the hippocampal region (the hippocampus proper, the dentate gyrus, and the subiculum) were impaired on two tasks of recognition memory: delayed nonmatching to sample and the visual paired-comparison task. Recognition memory was impaired in five different groups of monkeys, whether the lesions were made by an ischemic procedure, by radio frequency, or by ibotenic acid. The finding that the hippocampal region is essential for normal recognition memory performance is considered in the context of current ideas about the role of the hippocampus in declarative memory.",
