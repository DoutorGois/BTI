     "AB": "We recently demonstrated that recombinant adeno-associated viral vector-induced hippocampal overexpression of neuropeptide Y receptor, Y2, exerts a seizure-suppressant effect in kindling and kainate-induced models of epilepsy in rats. Interestingly, additional overexpression of neuropeptide Y in the hippocampus strengthened the seizure-suppressant effect of transgene Y2 receptors. Here we show for the first time that another neuropeptide Y receptor, Y5, can also be overexpressed in the hippocampus. However, unlike Y2 receptor overexpression, transgene Y5 receptors in the hippocampus had no effect on kainate-induced motor seizures in rats. However, combined overexpression of Y5 receptors and neuropeptide Y exerted prominent suppression of seizures. This seizure-suppressant effect of combination gene therapy with Y5 receptors and neuropeptide Y was significantly stronger as compared to neuropeptide Y overexpression alone. These results suggest that overexpression of Y5 receptors in combination with neuropeptide Y could be an alternative approach for more effective suppression of hippocampal seizures.",
