     "AB": "Reduction of voltage-activated Ca2+ currents by intracellular application of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) through ultraviolet (UV) photolysis of the caged compound, is followed by a re-augmentation to control levels within 10 min, independently of the divalent cation used. The Ca2+ current inhibition by the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptor agonist baclofen, which is also thought to be mediated by a GTP-binding protein (G-protein), is potentiated when GTP gamma S is uncaged during agonist superfusion. The authors suggest that GTP gamma S activates G-protein-dependent pathways that are not activated by the baclofen receptor.",
