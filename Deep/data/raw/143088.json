     "AB": "The in vitro metabolism of 7-3H-5-androstenediol by the pituitary, some brain structures, and ventral prostate of adult castrated male rat was studied. Conversion of 5-androstenediol to radiochemically pure testosterone was demonstrated in all tissues studied in the presence of a NADPH generating system. Formation of dihydrotestosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone was also detected. The higher conversion rates were found in the pituitary, hypothalamus and mesencephalic tegmentum. These results demonstrate the presence of 3beta-hydroxy steroid oxidoreductase, delta4- delta5 isomerase, 5alpha-reductase, and 17beta-ol dehydrogenase in the rat brain which may in part explain the behavioral and brain virilization effects of 5-androstenediol.",
