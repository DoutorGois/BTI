     "AB": "An increased neurogenesis is reported in animal models of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) but the fate of newborn cells is unknown. Here, we attempted to demonstrate neurogenesis in adult epileptic tissue obtained after hippocampectomy. MTLE hippocampi showed increased expression of division markers and of Musashi-1, a marker of neural progenitors, compared to control hippocampi. Large quantities of Musashi-1+ cells were obvious in the subgranular layer and the subventricular zone, both known neurogenic areas, and in the fissura hippocampi. Musashi-1 was expressed by small cells that were mainly vimentin+ or nestin+, rarely Dcx+ or PSA-NCAM+ and negative for markers of mature neurons or astrocytes. Some of them are present in the granular layer, the hilus, and CA1 area resembling the ectopic positions described in rodents. These findings demonstrate that neural progenitors proliferate in chronic epilepsy and suggest that the fissura hippocampi behaves like another neurogenic area.",
