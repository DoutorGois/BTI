     "AB": "Formation of trace processes was studied by means of delayed reactions with a choice, in intact animals and in animals with an ablated dorsal part of the hippocampus, aged six weeks, three and twelve months. It has been found that with age the percentage of correct solutions increases in intact animals, as well as the duration of permissible maximal delay. Lesion of the dorsal part of the hippocampus in six-week and three-month old puppies leads to a complete disturbance of the capacity to retain short traces. In one-year old puppies the operation results in a considerable drop in the level of correct solutions with short delays (5 to 20 sec). The longer the delay, the fewer the number of adequate solutions. With long delays the number of adequate responses is at the level of random choice.",
