     "AB": "A highly debated issue in memory research is whether familiarity is supported by the parahippocampal region, especially the lateral (LEC) and the perirhinal (PER) cortices, or whether it is supported by the same brain structure as recollection: the hippocampus. One reason for this is that conflicting results have emerged regarding the contribution of the hippocampus to familiarity. This might stem from the lack of dissociation between hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3 as these areas are involved to a different extent in processes which are pertinent to familiarity. Another reason is that empirical evidence for a contribution of the LEC is still missing. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the superficial and the deep layers of the LEC would equally contribute to this process as these layers are differentially recruited during memory retrieval which partly relies on familiarity. To identify the specific contribution of the LEC, CA1, and CA3, we imaged with cellular resolution activity in the brain of rats performing a version of a standard human memory task adapted to rats that yields judgments based on familiarity. Using this translational approach, we report that in striking contrast to CA1 and CA3, the LEC is recruited for familiarity-judgments and that its contribution is comparable to that of the PER. These results show for the first time that the LEC, specifically its deep layers, contributes to familiarity and constitute the first cellular evidence that the hippocampus does not, thus establishing that familiarity does not share the same neural substrate as recollection.",
