     "AB": "Rat cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) cDNA was cloned from rat brain. The cDNA showed a high homology of 90% in the nucleotide sequence of the coding region with the human counterpart. By in situ hybridization, the gene expression for cPLA2 was detected in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellar granular cells at very low level of normal rats. The expression was markedly increased in the dentate granule cells of postischemic rat brain. This alteration of the gene expression was discussed in relation to the free fatty acid-mediated neurotoxicity.",
