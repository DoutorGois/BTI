     "AB": "The aims of the present work were to perform a comparative study of the effects of delta sleep-inducing peptide and Deltaran on neurons in emotiogenic brain structures and to address the question of whether it is possible to prevent or decrease the negative influences of stress loads on the severity of subsequent cerebral ischemia in rats, using glycine with delta sleep-inducing peptide combined in the neuroprotective formulation Deltaran. The results showed that Deltaran and delta sleep-inducing peptide had largely the same actions on the nature of spike activity of neurons in the dorsal hippocampus, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and ventral anterior nuclei of the thalamus, evoking activation of some of the neurons in these brain structures. The dorsal hippocampus was dominated by activation of spike activity in response to administration of delta sleep-inducing peptide; Deltaran produced activation mainly in the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. In all animals given Deltaran, the index of brain blood supply was significantly greater than in animals not given Deltaran. The survival rate of cerebral ischemia was 100% in animals given Deltaran. Death occurred in 38% of animals not given Deltaran.",
