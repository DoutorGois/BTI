     "AB": "Vitamin B6 injected intraperitoneally into rats 400 mg/kg body weight, has produced a statistically significant decrease in GABA level concentrations in hippocampus and cerebellum. Cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus and thalamus have shown the decrease in GABA concentrations, but these changes were not statistically significant. No remarkable behavioural changes were noted under such circumstances. The possible functional meaning of these results is discussed in relation to the role of GABA distribution in different brain regions and development of convulsions.",
