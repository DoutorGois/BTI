     "AB": "The effects of subchronic administration of carbamazepine on thyroid hormone metabolism were investigated in the hippocampus in adult male rats at two different measuring times (4 a.m. and 8 p.m.). Carbamazepine enhanced the activity of 5'II-deiodinase, which catalyzes the deiodination of the prohormone T4 to the active compound T3, at 8 p.m., but not at 4 a.m. The activity of 5III-deiodinase, which catalyzes the further deiodination of the active hormone T3 to its metabolite 3,3'T2, was inhibited at 4 a.m. but not at 8 p.m. These effects of carbamazepine on intracellular thyroid hormone metabolism in the hippocampus should theoretically lead to a rise in T3 production. It remains to be investigated whether they are somehow involved in the as yet unknown mechanisms underlying the anticonvulsant/mood-stabilizing effects of carbamazepine.",
