     "AB": "This study has presented cells, fibers and non-neuronal elements as seen in 3 dimensions using the SEM. Our discussion on possible artifacts which can occur with this method is offered in the hope that others will develop better techniques of dissection and specimen preparation. With the picture of normal tissue in mind, the investigator can undertake studies to determine the effects of various interventions on the structures of interest. Such treatments could include deafferentation or the use of macromolecular probes bound to cell surfaces. We anticipate that improvements in tissue preparation techniques by ourselves and others will open the way to intensive investigation of the nervous system using this powerful tool.",
