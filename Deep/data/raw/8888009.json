     "AB": "The effect of 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), an inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) on the dimethylphenylpiperazinium(DMPP)-evoked release of [3H]noradrenaline ([3H]NA) from rat hippocampal slices was studied. The effect of DMPP (20 microM) to increase the basal release of [3H]NA was significantly potentiated by 7-NI (40 microM). In our previous study we showed that the response to DMPP has two components, a nicotinic receptor-mediated, [Ca2+]-dependent exocytosis followed by a [Ca2+]-independent, uptake blocker-sensitive carrier-mediated release. To clarify which part of the response was affected by the inhibition of nNOS, we investigated the effect of 7-NI on the nicotine-evoked NA release (nicotine has only receptor-mediated effect) and on the DMPP-evoked NA release in Ca(2+)-free medium where the receptor-mediated component is abolished. Nicotine (100 microM) significantly increased the basal release of [3H]NA but this release was not affected, whereas in Ca(2+)-free medium the response to DMPP (20 microM) was still potentiated by 7-NI (40 microM). In the presence of the NA uptake blocker desipramine (10 microM) DMPP (20 microM) was unable to provoke NA release independently from the presence or absence of 7-NI (40 microM). Our data show that 7-NI influences the carrier-mediated component of DMPP-evoked [3H]NA release, which indicates that nitric oxide produced by nNOS may play a role in the regulation of the NA uptake carrier.",
