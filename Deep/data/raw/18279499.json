     "AB": "ABSTRACT Methamphetamine (MAP) is a commonly used, addictive drug, and a powerful stimulant that dramatically affects the central nervous system. In this study, we used the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in order to study the reinforcing properties of MAP and the herewith associated changes in proteins within the mesolimbic dopamine system. A CPP was induced by MAP after three intermittent intraperitoneal injections (1 mg/kg) in rats and protein profiles in the nucleus accumbens, striatum, prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex and hippocampus were compared with a saline-treated control group. In addition, a group of animals was run through extinction and protein profiles were compared with a non-extinguished group. Protein screening was conducted using two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis which identified 27 proteins in the group that showed MAP-induced CPP. Some of the proteins were confirmed by Western lot analysis. Identified proteins had functions related to the cytoskeleton, transport/endocytosis or exocytosis (e.g. profilin-2 and syntaxin-binding protein), and signal transduction, among others.",
