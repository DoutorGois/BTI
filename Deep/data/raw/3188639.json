     "AB": "In experiments on dogs with equiprobable right and left reinforcements in the choice of feeder in conditions of free behaviour, direct correlation was found between the strength of the nervous system and the strategy of dogs behaviour. The dogs of strong type, despite the difference in equilibration and lability, manifested one, similar strategy of behaviour with dominating preferences, definite and goal-directed actions; the dogs of the weak type displayed another strategy, characterized by uncertainty, permanent hesitations in choice reaction. In situation of competition of probability and value of reinforcement, some different aspects of animals typology appeared, presumably connected with individual characteristics of functioning of four brain structures as a basis of types of higher nervous activity (frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus). Behaviour of choleric and flegmatic was oriented to a high probability of events and that of sanguinic and melancholic--to a low one. Thus, \"informational\" and \"motivational\" factors of behaviour organization are connected with interaction of specialized brain macrostructures, and properties of this interaction become apparent in animals typology.",
