     "AB": "Acute effects of estrogens on mnemonic processes were examined at the behavioral and neurochemical levels. 17beta-estradiol and 17alpha-estradiol influences on memory consolidation were assessed using object placement (OP) and object recognition (OR) tasks. Subjects received treatment immediately after a sample trial (exploring two novel objects), and memory of objects (OR memory) or location of objects (OP memory) was tested 4h later. Both isomers of estradiol enhanced memory. For spatial memory, 15 and 20 microg/kg of 17beta-estradiol facilitated OP, while lower and higher doses were ineffective. 17alpha-estradiol had a similar pattern, but a lower dose was effective. When treatment was delayed until 45 min after a sample trial, memory was not enhanced. For non-spatial memory, OR was facilitated at 5 microg/kg of 17beta-estradiol and at 1 and 2 microg/kg of 17alpha-estradiol and, similar to OP, lower and higher doses were ineffective. These data demonstrate that beneficial effects of estrogens are dose, time and task dependent, and the dose-response pattern is an inverted U. Because monoamines are known to have contributions to memory, brains were removed 30 min after treatment for measurements of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), and metabolites. Estrogen elevated 5HT, NE metabolite MHPG, turnover ratio of NE to MHPG, and DA metabolite DOPAC levels in the prefrontal cortex, while NE and MHPG were decreased in the hippocampus. Thus, acute estrogens exert rapid effects on memory consolidation and neural function, which suggests that its mnemonic effects may involve activation of membrane associated estrogen receptors and subsequent signaling cascades, and that monoamines may contribute to this process.",
