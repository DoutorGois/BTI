     "AB": "The septohippocampal system regulates spatial behavior, memory and response flexibility. This experiment determined which of these functions is disrupted by medial septal lesions which impair operant delayed alternation in rats. Male hooded rats received either medial septal lesions or a control operation. Following recovery, they were reinforced for alternating left and right lever presses in an operant chamber. The effects of various delays (0, 10 and 20 s), and exteroceptive cues were assessed. Medial septal lesions did not impair alternation performance at the 0-s delay, but did produce severe impairments at the 10- and 20-s delays. An exteroceptive light cue which reduced the spatial requirements of the task did not ameliorate this impairment. However, an exteroceptive light cue which reduced the working-memory requirements of the task did ameliorate the lesion-induced deficit on delayed alternation. While the lesioned rats also made more perseverative errors than the controls, statistically removing this influence from the data did not modify the results. These data suggest that medial septal lesions in rats impair operant delayed alternation by disrupting the general process of working-memory rather than spatial behavior or response flexibility.",
