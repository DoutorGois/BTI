     "AB": "Kainate induces a marked expression of cyclooxygenase-2 after its systemic administration. Because cyclooxygenase-2 activity is associated to the production of reactive oxygen species, we investigated the effects of nimesulide, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, on kainate-induced in vivo oxidative damage in the rat hippocampus. A clinically relevant dose of nimesulide (6 mg/kg, i.p. ) was administered three times following kainate application (9 mg/kg, i.p.). After 24 h of kainate administration, the drastic decrease in hippocampal glutathione content and the significant increase in lipid peroxidation were attenuated in nimesulide-treated rats, suggesting that the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 is involved in kainate-mediated free radicals formation.",
