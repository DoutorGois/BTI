     "PG": "38-53",
     "AB": "S18327 displayed modest affinity for human (h)D(2) and hD(3) receptors and high affinity for hD(4) receptors. At each, S18327 antagonized stimulation of [(35)S]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate binding by dopamine (DA). It also blocked activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase at hD(3) receptors. The affinity of S18327 at hD(1) and hD(5) sites was modest. S18327 showed pronounced affinity for human serotonin (h5-HT)(2A) receptors and human alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptors (hARs), at which it antagonized increases in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration levels elicited by 5-HT and norepinephrine (NE), respectively. S18327 presented significant affinity for halpha(2A)-ARs and antagonized NE-induced[(35)S]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate binding both at these sites and at alpha(2)-ARs in rat amygdala. Reflecting blockade of alpha(2)-autoreceptors, S18327 enhanced firing of adrenergic neurons in locus ceruleus, accelerated hippocampal synthesis of NE, and increased dialysate levels of NE in hippocampus, accumbens, and frontal cortex. S18327 abolished inhibition of ventrotegmental area-localized dopaminergic neurons by apomorphine. However, S18327 alone did not affect their activity and only modestly enhanced cerebral turnover of DA and dialysate levels of DA in striatum and accumbens. In contrast, S18327 markedly increased dialysate levels of DA in frontal cortex, an action abolished by the selective alpha(2)-AR agonist, S18616. Finally, S18327 reduced synthesis and dialysate levels of 5-HT in striatum and suppressed firing of dorsal raphe-localized serotonergic neurons, an action attenuated by the alpha(1)-AR agonist cirazoline. In conclusion, S18327 possesses marked antagonist activity at alpha(1)-ARs and D(4) and 5-HT(2A) receptors and less potent antagonist activity at alpha(2)-ARs and D(1) and D(2) receptors. Antagonism by S18327 of alpha(2)-ARs enhances adrenergic transmission and reinforces frontocortical dopaminergic transmission, whereas blockade of alpha(1)-ARs inhibits dorsal raphe-derived serotonergic pathways. As further described in the accompanying paper, this profile of activity may contribute to the potential antipsychotic properties of S18327.",
