     "AB": "The offspring of rats fed a diet containing 10% (v/v) of ethanol were tested for developmental differences from controls on a variety of maturational events and reflexes. Results indicated slower development of fur onset and ear (pinnae) opening, more rapid and vigorous righting responses and shorter dowel-grasping times in the offspring of ethanol-fed dams. No differences in rooting reflex, Babinski reflex, or in the visual placing response were found. These findings were seen as consistent with the interpretation that gestational alcohol exposure results in reduction in the ability of subjects to inhibit responses. The reduction in inhibition is not inconsistent with damage to the hippocampal area of the brain.",
