     "AB": "We examined the effect of brain ischemia on neuronal expression of cyclooxygenase-2 gene in the hippocampus. Transient forebrain ischemia was produced by occluding bilateral carotid arteries for 5 min in Mongolian gerbil. Northern blotting and in situ hybridization demonstrated that expression of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA was transiently induced in the hippocampal neurons. Although future studies will be needed to clarify if induced cyclooxygenase-2 following ischemia is involved in neuronal damage or neuronal protection, selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may be a new therapeutical approach for the treatment of stroke.",
