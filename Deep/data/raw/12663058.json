     "AB": "Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits with specific structural, functional and pharmacological properties. In this study the distribution of alpha3, alpha4, alpha7, beta2 and beta4 nAChR subunits in the human hippocampus was investigated using immunohistochemistry. Most pyramidal neurons, pre-alpha cells of the entorhinal cortex and dentate granule cells were immunoreactive for all subunits. Small islands of alpha7 immunoreactive cells were present in the outer presubiculum. alpha4 and beta2, and alpha3, alpha4 and beta2 immunoreactive fibre tracts were present in the stratum radiatum and subiculum, respectively, suggesting nAChRs may play a role in modulating inputs to the hippocampus via Schaffer collaterals and along the perforant pathway. Some astrocytes were immunoreactive for alpha3, alpha7 and beta4 subunits. Immunoreactivity to all subunits was noted in association with blood vessels. These results indicate the involvement of multiple nAChR subtypes in the modulation of both neuronal and non-neuronal functions in the human hippocampus.",
