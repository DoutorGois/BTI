     "AB": "Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) is thought to be important in the regulation of feeding and also in the release of Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). Intracerebroventricular administration of NPY to male rats significantly increased plasma ACTH 10 min after injection and stimulated 2-h food intake. A series of analogues of NPY that have a greatly reduced affinity for the Y1 [human pancreatic polypeptide (human PP), NPY(3-36)], the Y2 ([Pro34]NPY, human PP), the Y3 (peptide YY), and the Y6 (human PP) receptor, all markedly stimulated ACTH release. Rat PP, which binds with high affinity to the Y4 receptor, was unable to stimulate ACTH release. A novel analogue fragment [Pro34]NPY(13-36) was synthesized as a ligand with low Y1 and Y2 receptor affinity. Interestingly, neither [Pro34]NPY(13-36) nor the selective Y5 receptor agonist [D-Trp32]NPY stimulated food intake, whereas both significantly increased plasma ACTH. Thus the hypothalamic NPY receptor mediating increases in plasma ACTH has a fragment activation profile unlike the Y1-Y4 or Y6 receptors and appears distinct from the NPY receptor controlling food intake.",
