     "AB": "Some of the neurological deficits that emerge after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in humans are presumably caused by ischemic brain damage consequential to SAH-induced delayed cerebral vasospasm. This vasospasm probably results from an imbalance among vasoactive factors released from both the clot formed by extravasated blood and adjacent tissues, and in particular from a decrease in the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide (NO). Brain ischemia is also known to elevate brain production and deposition of beta-amyloid, and to induce a delayed increase in total NO synthase (NOS) activity due to induction of expression of so-called induced NOS isoform, phenomena that may secondarily contribute to SAH-related brain damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of treatment with the intracellular NO donor hydroxylamine on: (i) basilar arterial wall that remained in a direct contact with the clot, (ii) formation of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP), (iii) total brain NOS activity, and (iv) neurological outcome in a 'two-hemorrhage' rat SAH model. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 0.18 mmol/kg hydroxylamine hydrochloride (12.5 mg/kg) twice daily for 7 days beginning immediately after the first 'hemorrhage' (intracisternal blood injection) reduced basilar arterial wall damage and attenuated post-SAH neurological deficit. It also reduced the SAH-related increases in hippocampal and cortical beta-APP immunoreactivities and hippocampal NOS activity measured 24 h after commencement of the treatment. These results indicate that intracellular NO donors that yield NO through the action of widely distributed enzymes in brain cells (cytochromes, catalase) can attenuate detrimental effects of SAH.",
