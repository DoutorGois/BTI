     "AB": "The influence of four inhibitors of the high-affinity glutamate uptake system (DL-aspartic acid beta-hydroxymate, DL-AHM; L-aspartic acid beta-hydroxymate, L-AHM; threo-beta-methylaspartate, DLM; L-transpyrrolidine-2, 4-dicarboxylate, PDC) on potentials recorded from hippocampal slices was investigated. At low concentrations of DL-AHM, L-AHM and DLM (50-150 microM) the population spike was permanently amplified. NMDA receptor antagonists blocked this facilitatory effect of L-AHM, DL-AHM and DLM. At higher concentrations (400-700 microM) DL-AHM and DLM abolished the population spike, while L-AHM did not eliminate the population spike at any concentration tested. None of these uptake inhibitors influenced an antidromic potential recorded in Ca(2+)- free Ringer solution. PDC at lower concentrations (75 microM) did not affect the population spike and at higher concentrations (150 microM-500 microM) induced only a transient elevation in population spike. Our data demonstrate that modification of glutamate uptake may be an important factor in the regulation of synaptic efficiency of glutamergic pathways.",
