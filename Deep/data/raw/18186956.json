     "AB": "We examined whether acupuncture can reduce both the incidence of seizures and hippocampal cell death using a mouse model of kainic acid (KA)-induced epilepsy. ICR mice were given acupuncture once a day at acupoint HT8 (sobu) bilaterally during 2 days before KA injection. After an intracerebroventricular injection of 0.1 microg of KA, acupuncture treatment was subsequently administered once more (total 3 times), and the degree of seizure was observed for 20 min. Three hours after injection, the survival of neuronal cells and the expressions of c-Fos, c-Jun, and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-67 in the CA1 and CA3 were determined using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting techniques. Acupuncture reduced the severity of the KA-induced epileptic seizure and the rate of neural cell death, and it also decreased the expressions of c-Fos and c-Jun induced by KA in the hippocampus. Furthermore, acupuncture increased GAD-67 expressions in the same areas. These results demonstrated that it could inhibit the KA-induced epileptic seizure and hippocampal cell death by increasing GAD-67 expressions.",
