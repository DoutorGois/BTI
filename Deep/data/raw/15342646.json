     "AB": "Intracellular Ca2+ store release contributes to activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system by modulating the amplitude, propagation, and temporal dynamics of cytoplasmic Ca2+ changes. However, neuronal Ca2+ stores can be relatively insensitive to increases in the store-mobilizing messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Using a fluorescent biosensor we have visualized M1 muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptor signaling in individual hippocampal neurons and observed increased IP3 production in the absence of concurrent Ca2+ store release. However, coincident glutamate-mediated synaptic activity elicited enhanced and oscillatory IP3 production that was dependent upon ongoing mACh receptor stimulation and S-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid receptor activation of Ca2+ entry. Moreover, the enhanced levels of IP3 now mobilized Ca2+ from intracellular stores that were refractory to the activation of mACh receptors alone. We conclude that convergent ionotropic and metabotropic receptor inputs can facilitate Ca2+ signaling by enhancing IP3 production as well as augmenting release by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release.",
