These events consist of one or more synchronized neuronal bursts. In this experimental system, epileptic events occur because of blockade of synaptic inhibition by the convulsant agent. A sparse network of excitatory synaptic interconnections in the hippocampus serves to synchronize a population of neurons, each of which is capable of bursting after appropriate stimulation.",
