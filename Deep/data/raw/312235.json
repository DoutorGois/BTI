     "AB": "Variations on the distribution of acid phosphatase and 5'-nucleotidase were observed among the cerebral nuclei of the Uromastix hardwickii. Most of the nuclei revealed more intensely positive reaction for 5'-nucleotidase than the acid phosphatase. However, an identical enzymatic pattern, demonstrating intense activity for the two enzymes, was observed in the cortical centers excepting the primordial hippocampus. The possible causes of the intensity and the functions of the enzymes were established in relation to the nuclei and fiber bundles.",
