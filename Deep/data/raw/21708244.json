     "AB": "Evidence suggests that obesity-induced cognitive impairments are driven by in brain inflammatory responses and inflammation-mediated brain insulin resistance. Ursolic acid (UA), a triterpenoid compound, has many important biological functions, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we evaluated the effect of UA on cognitive impairment induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), and we explored the potential mechanisms mediating this effect. Results showed that UA administration significantly improved the behavioral performance of C57/BL6J mice fed a HFD in both the step-through test and the Morris water maze task. These results were associated with the inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress and IkappaB kinase beta/nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated inflammatory signaling and the restoration of insulin signaling and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. UA administration also increased memory-related protein expression in the hippocampus of mice given a HFD. However, the neuroprotective effects of UA were blocked by an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of PI-103, a specific PI3K 110alpha inhibitor. These results suggest that UA may be a potent candidate for the prevention and treatment of cognitive deficits caused by type 2 diabetes.",
