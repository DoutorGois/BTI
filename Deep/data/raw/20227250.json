     "AB": "Brain functional asymmetry abnormalities have previously been reported in schizophrenia. In the present study, we hypothesized that the pattern of functional asymmetry in schizophrenia may differ between patients suffering from positive and negative symptoms. We examined the relationship between altered asymmetry of functional connectivity and symptom type (positive/negative) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We selected the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and hippocampus as regions of interest, and analyzed functional connectivity patterns between these and other brain regions. Furthermore, a voxel-based two-level asymmetry analysis was conducted to investigate differences in the asymmetry of functional connectivity patterns within and between groups. Our results showed that patients exhibiting positive symptoms had significantly increased leftward asymmetry of functional connectivity. The negative symptom group, in contrast, exhibited increased rightward asymmetry of functional connectivity. The strength of the asymmetry in these regions was found to be significantly correlated with symptom ratings obtained using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. These results suggest that predominantly positive and predominantly negative schizophrenia may have different neural underpinnings, and that certain regions in the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as the cingulate gyrus and precuneus, play important roles in mediating the symptoms of this complex disease. Our study also provided further evidence for the hypothesis that schizophrenia is related to abnormalities in functional brain networks.",
