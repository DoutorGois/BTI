     "AB": "Acute cocaine toxicity is frequently associated with seizures. The mechanisms underlying the convulsant effect of cocaine are not well understood. Previously, we have shown that cocaine depresses whole-cell current evoked by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in hippocampal neurons freshly isolated from rats. Cocaine's effect was voltage-independent and concentration-dependent. In the present study, using whole-cell patch-clamp recording on rat neurons freshly isolated from hippocampus, we examined the intracellular mechanisms involved in cocaine's action. Increasing intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca]i) from 0.01 to 5 microM strongly increased the depressant effect of cocaine. By contrast, 1-[N, O-bis (5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazine (KN-62), a specific antagonist of Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), attenuated or enhanced cocaine's action in different neurons: in three out of nine neurons dialysed with 5 microM KN-62,1 mM cocaine depressed GABA current by only 33%, but in another three out of nine neurons, cocaine depressed GABA current by as much as 83%. Chelerythrine (a specific CaCa(2+)/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C [PKC] antagonist) had minimal effect on cocaine's action. We suggest that cocaine induces an increase in [Ca]i, which stimulates phosphatase activity and thus leads to dephosphorylation of GABA receptors. This dephosphorylation-mediated disinhibitory action may play a role in cocaine-induced convulsant states.",
