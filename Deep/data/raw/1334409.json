     "AB": "Mammalian brain possesses ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channels, which in muscle cells mediate rapid Ca2+ release from intracellular stores during excitation-contraction coupling. Analysis of bovine brain ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels suggests specific expression of the cardiac-muscle RyR isoform in mammalian brain. Localization using cardiac-muscle RyR-specific antibodies and antisense RNA revealed that brain RyRs were present in dendrites, cell bodies and terminals of rat forebrain, and highly enriched in the hippocampus. Activity of skeletal-muscle RyR channels is coupled to sarcolemmal voltage sensors, in contrast with cardiac-muscle RyR channels, which are known to be Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)-release channels. Thus Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores mediated by brain RyR channels may be a major Ca(2+)-signalling pathway in specific regions of mammalian brain, and hence may play a fundamental role in neuronal Ca2+ homoeostasis.",
