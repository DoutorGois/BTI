     "AB": "Neurosteroids are involved in sex-specific epilepsies. Allopregnanolone and related endogenous neurosteroids in the brain control excessive neuronal excitability and seizure susceptibility. Neurosteroids activate GABA-A receptors, especially extrasynaptic alphagammadelta-GABA-A receptor subtypes that mediate tonic inhibition and thus dampen network excitability. Our studies over the past decade have shown that neurosteroids are broad-spectrum anticonvulsants and confer seizure protection in various animal models. Neurosteroids also exert antiepileptogenic effects. There is emerging evidence on a critical role for neurosteroids in the pathophysiology of the sex-specific forms of epilepsies such as catamenial epilepsy, a menstrual cycle-related seizure disorder in women. Catamenial epilepsy is a neuroendocrine condition in which seizures are clustered around specific points in the menstrual cycle, most often around the perimenstrual or periovulatory period. Apart from ovarian hormones, fluctuations in neurosteroid levels could play a critical role in this gender-specific epilepsy. Neurosteroids also regulate the plasticity of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors in the hippocampus and other regions involved in epilepsy pathology. Based on these studies, we proposed a neurosteroid replacement therapy for catamenial epilepsy. Thus, neurosteroids are novel drug targets for pharmacotherapy of epilepsy.",
