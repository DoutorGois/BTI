     "AB": "Conditional deletion of Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome ten) in differentiated cortical and hippocampal neurons in the mouse results in seizures, macrocephaly, social interaction deficits and anxiety, reminiscent of human autism spectrum disorder. Here we extended our previous examination of these mice using electroencephalogram/electromyogram (EEG/EMG) monitoring and found age-related increases in spontaneous seizures, which were correlated with cellular dispersion in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Increased spontaneous locomotor activity in the open field on the first and the second day of a 3-day continuous study suggested heightened anxiety in Pten mutant mice. In contrast, the mutants exhibited decreased wheel running activity, which may reflect reduced adaptability to a novel environment. Synchronization to the light-dark cycle was normal, but for up to 28 days under constant darkness, the Pten mutants maintained a significantly lengthened and remarkably constant free-running period of almost exactly 24 h. This result implies the involvement of Pten in the maintenance of circadian rhythms, which we interpret as being due to an effect on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade.",
