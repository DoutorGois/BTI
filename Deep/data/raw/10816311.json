     "AB": "In central neurons, the second messenger cGMP is believed to induce long-term changes in efficacy at glutamatergic synapses through activation of protein kinase G (PKG). Stimulating nitric oxide synthase, activating soluble guanylyl cyclase or elevating concentrations of intracellular cGMP depressed excitatory synaptic transmission in CA1 hippocampal neurons. Unexpectedly, intracellular cGMP depressed responses of AMPA receptors and inhibited excitatory postsynaptic currents in hippocampal neurons independently of phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate that cGMP's modulation of excitatory transmission may involve a coupling of AMPA channel activity to levels of cGMP.",
