     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To know the effect of brief-repetitive intermittent hypoxia-ischemia on the development of perinatal brain damage. STUDY DESIGN: Seven-day-old Wistar rats underwent ligation of the unilateral common carotid artery. The animals were allocated to three groups (n=12 in each group) and exposed to 8% oxygen as follows: group A: continuous exposure for 180 min; group B: continuous exposure for 90 min; and group C: 10 min of exposure repeated at 10-min intervals over a period of 180 min (total exposure time, 90 min). Seventy-two hours after exposure to hypoxia, the cerebral cortex was examined to assess the degree of neuronal necrosis and brain damage was classified into four grades of severity, 0-3. To evaluate the extent of brain damage, we used immunohistochemical staining with TIB-128 antibody, which reacts to MAC-1 antigen specific to microglia, and observed the glial reaction in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and striatum. RESULTS: All the brain damage observed in groups A-C occurred on the side where the ligation was performed. The most severe damage was found in group A animals, of which seven showed significant neuronal necrosis, having a grade 2 or more advanced lesion. In group B, neuronal necrosis was modest, with only one animal having a grade 2 lesion. In group C, a significant neuronal necrosis was found in six animals despite having the same period of hypoxic exposure as those in group B. MAC-1 positive cells appeared in the cerebral cortex of histologically damaged animals and extended to the hippocampus, thalamus, and striatum in severely damaged animals from groups A, B, and C. CONCLUSION: Examination of the neonatal rat model suggested that repetitive and intermittent, rather than continuous hypoxia-ischemia, causes pronounced damage in the immature brain.",
