     "AB": "We used Magnesium Green AM to measure Ca(2+) transients in Schaffer collateral presynaptic terminals simultaneously with postsynaptic field potentials (fEPSPs) to investigate the mechanism of neurosteroid enhancement of short-term synaptic facilitation. Measurement of [Ca(2+)](i), isolated to presynaptic events, using the fluorescence ratio (DeltaF/F(0)) demonstrated that at a constant stimulus intensity there was no change in the excitability of presynaptic fibres between paired stimuli or between ACSF and 1 mum pregnenolone sulphate (PREGS). Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) was correlated with residual Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](res)), and there was an additional increase in the integralDeltaF/F(0) for the [Ca(2+)](res)-subtracted response to the second of paired stimuli, resulting primarily from a slowing of the decay time constant. In addition to the role of presynaptic [Ca(2+)](res) in PPF, we observed a decrease in EC(50) and a greater maximum for Hill function fits to fEPSP versus DeltaF/F(0) during the second of paired responses. The enhancement of fEPSP PPF by PREGS did not result from an increase of DeltaF/F(0). The data presented here support a PREGS-induced increase in presynaptic glutamate release from the second, but not the first, of a pair of stimuli for a given presynaptic [Ca(2+)] because: (a) there is actually a decrease in the integralDeltaF/F(0) of the [Ca(2+)](res)-subtracted second response over that seen in ACSF; (b) PREGS causes no change in presynaptic Ca(2+) buffering; and (c) there is a decrease in EC(50) and an increase of y(max) in the Hill function fits to DeltaF/F(0) versus fEPSP data. We hypothesize that PREGS enhances short-term facilitation by acting on the Ca(2+)-dependent vesicle release machinery and that this mechanism plays a role in the cognitive effects of this sulphated neurosteroid.",
