     "AB": "Pathological processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is assumed to be responsible for the amyloid deposits in Alzheimer-diseased brain tissue, but the physiological function of this protein in the brain is still unclear. The aim of this study is to reveal whether the expression of different splicing variants of APP transcripts in distinct brain regions is driven by postnatal maturation and/or regulated by cortical cholinergic transmission, applying quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry using 35S-labeled oligonucleotides as specific probes to differentiate between APP isoforms. In cortical brain regions, the expression of both APP695 and APP751 is high at birth and exhibits nearly adult levels. The developmental expression pattern of cortical APP695 displays a peak value around postnatal day 10, while the age-related expression of APP751 demonstrates peak values on postnatal days 10 and 25, with the highest steady state levels of APP751 mRNA on day 25. During early development, the cortical laminar distribution of the APP695, but not APP751, mRNA transiently changes from a more homogeneous distribution at birth to a pronounced laminar pattern with higher mRNA levels in cortical layer III/IV detectable at the age of 4 days and persisting until postnatal day 10. The distinct age-related changes in cortical APP695 and APP751 mRNA levels reflect the functional alterations during early brain maturation and suggest that APP695 might play a role in establishing the mature connectional pattern between neurons, whereas APP751 could play a role in controlling cellular growth and synaptogenesis. Lesion of basal forebrain cholinergic system by the selective cholinergic immunotoxin 192IgG-saporin resulted in decreased levels of APP695 but not APP751 and APP770 transcripts by about 15-20% in some cortical (cingulate, frontal, parietal, piriform cortex), hippocampal regions (CA1, dentate gyrus), and basal forebrain nuclei (medial septum, vertical limb of diagonal band), detectable not earlier than 30 days after lesion and persisting until 90 days postlesion, suggesting that the nearly complete loss of cortical cholinergic input does not have any significant impact on the expression of APP mRNA isoforms in cholinoceptive cortical target regions.",
