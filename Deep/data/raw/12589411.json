     "AB": "Possible role of the dentate gyrus (DG) and the hippocampus (HPC) in temporal lobe epileptogensis was investigated in an electrogenic model of rat epilepsy. Chronic tetani (60 Hz, 0.4-0.6 mA. 2 s) were administered once daily for 7 days to the right dorsal hippocampus (DHPC) or the right DG. Animal behavior was observed and depth electro-graphic seizures and T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance images (T(2)-WI) were measured. Results indicated that the frequency of primary wet dog shakes (WEDS) in the DG-stimulated rats was much lower than that in the DHPC-stimulated rats (P<0.05). The mean maximal wave-amplitude in DG electrographs was also much lower than that in HPC electrographs (P<0.05). The oscillations proportion of DHPC electrographs increased after DHPC-tetanization (from 2/9 up to 7/9 rats). T(2)-WI hyperintensity in the lateral ventricle area was detected only in the DHPC-tetanized rats, not in the DG-tetanized rats (P<0.05). These results suggest that the DG acts as a filtering site in the entorhinal cortex-HPC neuronal circuitry and its dysfunction causes damage to the HPC and the generation of temporal lobe epilepsy.",
