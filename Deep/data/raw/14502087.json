     "AB": "Progressive and long-term sex hormone imbalance in the FSH-R haploinsufficient menopausal mouse leads to degenerative changes in the CNS associated with increased anxiety. The brain region most affected by aging in these mice is the hippocampus. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) enzymatic activity and synapsin immunoreactivity are reduced at 20 months of age. Neurons in the dentate gyrus show signs of progressive degenerative changes, hypertrophy and glyosis, and subsequent cell shrinkage and death. These results suggest that the menopausal mouse mimics degenerative changes in the hippocampus of hormonally imbalanced aging humans. We propose using this animal model to test the effectiveness of potential therapeutics in paradigms of accelerated aging.",
