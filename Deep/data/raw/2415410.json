     "AB": "Peptidase(s) activity of different subcellular fractions isolated from cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, thalamus with hypothalamus, cerebellum and medulla oblongata exerted against less than Glu SP6-11 (3H-Phen8) was evaluated in \"low-ionic\" and similar (in composition) to both extracellular and intracellular conditions. The incubation of less than Glu SP6-11 with different fractions leaves the hexapeptide undegraded in the studied conditions in most cases. Peptidases activity results in the formation of the first of all C-terminal and exceptionally \"internal\" labelled products. Labelled N-terminal products were not seen. The most effective degradation in vitro of less than Glu SP6-11 takes place, in the majority of cases, in \"low ionic\" conditions when compared to those similar to extra or intracellular ones. The biggest total (per 1 g of wet mass) and specific activities against less than Glu SP6-11 can be shown in the hippocampus areas.",
