     "AB": "Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine levels were measured in the cortex, caudoputamen, and hippocampus of rats during 30 min of severe forebrain ischemia (induced by occlusion of both carotid and vertebral arteries) and subsequent recirculation. During ischemia, polyamine levels did not change significantly. During postischemic recirculation, however, putrescine levels dramatically increased whereas those of spermine and spermidine did not change, with the exception of the severely damaged caudoputamen, where the concentration declined after 24 h. The increase of putrescine is explained by postischemic activation of ornithine decarboxylase and inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. It is suggested that the accumulation of putrescine during postischemic recirculation may be responsible for the delayed neuronal death occurring after ischemia.",
