     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study is to identify novel, time-indexed imaging biomarkers of epileptogenesis in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). METHODS: We used high-resolution brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the translationally relevant methionine sulfoximine (MSO) brain infusion model of MTLE. MSO inhibits astroglial glutamine synthetase, which is deficient in the epileptogenic hippocampal formation of patients with MTLE. MSO-infused (epileptogenic) rats were compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-infused (nonepileptogenic) rats at early (3-4 days) and late (6-9 weeks) time points during epileptogenesis. RESULTS: The epileptogenic rats exhibited significant changes in DTI-measured fractional anisotropy (FA) in numerous brain regions versus nonepileptogenic rats. Changes included decreases and increases in FA in regions such as the entorhinal-hippocampal area, amygdala, corpus callosum, thalamus, striatum, accumbens, and neocortex. The FA changes evolved over time as animals transitioned from early to late epileptogenesis. For example, some areas with significant decreases in FA early in epileptogenesis changed to significant increases late in epileptogenesis. Finally, the FA changes significantly correlated with the seizure load. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest (1) that high-resolution DTI can be used for early identification and tracking of the epileptogenic process in MTLE, and (2) that the process identified by DTI is present in multiple brain areas, even though infusion of MSO is restricted to the unilateral entorhinal-hippocampal region.",
