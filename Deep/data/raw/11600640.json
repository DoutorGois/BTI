     "AB": "Activation of muscarinic receptors and GABA(B) receptors causes presynaptic inhibition of glutamatergic synaptic potentials at excitatory feedback connections in cortical structures. These effects may regulate dynamics in cortical structures, with presynaptic inhibition allowing extrinsic afferent input to dominate during encoding, while the absence of presynaptic inhibition allows stronger excitatory feedback during retrieval or consolidation. However, proposals for a functional role of such modulatory effects strongly depend on the time course of these modulatory effects; how rapidly can they turn off and on? In brain slice preparations of hippocampal region CA1, we have explored the time course of suppression of extracellularly recorded synaptic potentials after pressure pulse application of acetylcholine and GABA. Acetylcholine causes suppression of extracellular potentials with onset time constants between 1 and 2 s, and decay constants ranging between 10 and 20 s, even with very brief injection pulses. GABA causes suppression of extracellular potentials with onset time constants between 0.2 and 0.7 s, and decay time constants that decrease to values shorter than 2 s for very brief injection pulses. These techniques do not give an exact measure of the physiological time course in vivo, but they give a notion of the relative time course of the two modulators. The slow changes due to activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors may alter the dynamics of cortical circuits over longer intervals (e.g., between different stages of waking and sleep), setting dynamics appropriate for encoding versus consolidation processes. The faster changes in synaptic potentials caused by GABA could cause changes within each cycle of the theta rhythm, rapidly switching between encoding and retrieval dynamics during exploration.",
