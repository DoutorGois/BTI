     "AB": "Evidence supports the view that \"memory traces\" are formed in the hippocampus and in the cerebellum in classical conditioning of discrete behavioral responses (e.g. eyeblink conditioning). In the hippocampus, learning results in long-lasting increases in excitability of pyramidal neurons that appear to be localized to these neurons (i.e. changes in membrane properties and receptor function). However, these learning-altered pyramidal neurons are distributed widely throughout CA3 and CA1. Although it plays a key role in certain aspects of classical conditioning, the hippocampus is not necessary for learning and memory of the basic conditioned responses. The cerebellum and its associated brain stem circuitry, on the other hand, does appear to be essential (necessary and sufficient) for learning and memory of the conditioned response. Evidence to date is most consistent with a localized trace in the interpositus nucleus and multiple localized traces in cerebellar cortex, each involving relatively large ensembles of neurons. Perhaps \"procedural\" memory traces are relatively localized and \"declarative\" traces more widely distributed.",
