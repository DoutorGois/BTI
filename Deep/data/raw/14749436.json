     "AB": "The regulated delivery of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) to synapses is an important mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity. Here, we ask whether the synaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 (postsynaptic density 95) participates in AMPAR incorporation during two forms of synaptic plasticity. In hippocampal slice cultures, the expression of PSD-95-green fluorescent protein (PSD-95-GFP) increases AMPAR currents by selectively delivering glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1)-containing receptors to synapses, thus mimicking long-term potentiation (LTP). Mutational analysis shows that the N terminal of PSD-95 including the first two PDZ [PSD-95/Discs large (Dlg)/zona occludens-1 (ZO-1)] domains is necessary and sufficient to mediate this effect. Further supporting a role in synaptic plasticity, wild-type PSD-95 occludes LTP and dominant negative forms block LTP. Moreover, we demonstrate that PSD-95 also participates in AMPAR delivery during experience-driven plasticity in vivo. In the barrel cortex from experience-deprived animals, the expression of PSD-95-GFP selectively increases AMPAR currents, mimicking experience-driven plasticity. In nondeprived animals, PSD-95-GFP produces no additional potentiation, indicating common mechanisms between PSD-95-mediated potentiation and experience-driven synaptic strengthening. A dominant negative form of PSD-95 blocks experience-driven potentiation of synapses. Pharmacological analysis in slice cultures reveals that PSD-95 acts downstream of other signaling pathways involved in LTP. We conclude that PSD-95 controls activity-dependent AMPAR incorporation at synapses via PDZ interactions not only during LTP in vitro but also during experience-driven synaptic strengthening by natural stimuli in vivo.",
