     "AB": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) presynaptically inhibits excitatory transmission in area CA1 of rat hippocampus. As postsynaptic NPY receptors in certain other tissues have been shown to be coupled to G-proteins, we have tested the hypothesis that the hippocampal NPY effects are also mediated by G-proteins. Pretreatment of rats with pertussis toxin (PTX) was ineffective in blocking NPY's presynaptic inhibitory actions in area CA1 of the hippocampal slice. The presynaptic inhibitory action of baclofen was also unaffected by PTX pretreatment. However, in these same PTX-pretreated slices, the postsynaptic hyperpolarizing actions of baclofen and 5-hydroxytryptamine were blocked. We suggest that pre- and postsynaptic receptors possess different coupling mechanisms to their effectors.",
