     "AB": "Single or repeated electroconvulsive shock (ECS) treatment-induced changes in [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate [( 35S]TBPS) binding patterns in specific regions, i.e., cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and striatum of rat brain were investigated. Specific [35S]TBPS binding in these brain regions was not altered following a single or repeated administration of ECS, nor was the inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding to GABA affected. These observations tend to suggest that the picrotoxin-site on the GABA receptor complex may not be directly involved in electroconvulsive shock.",
