     "AB": "Rat embryos exposed on gestational day 15 to methyl-azoxymethanol acetate develop a microencephaly characterized primarily by a hypoplasia of the neocortex and CA fields of the hippocampus that in adulthood is associated with disturbances in learning. In brain slices prepared from microencephalic rats, we have examined the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials and population spike in the CA1 field of the hippocampus evoked by stimulation of the stratum radiatum. These parameters did not differ from those obtained in slices from control rats. High frequency stimulation of the stratum radiatum afferent fibres, which readily induced long-term potentiation of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials and population spike in the CA1 field of the hippocampus of control rats, failed to induce long-term potentiation in that of microencephalic rats. High frequency stimulation of the perforant path readily elicited long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus of both control and microencephalic rats. Picrotoxin had no apparent effect on field excitatory postsynaptic potentials and population spike in the CA1 field of the microencephalic rats, indicating that little GABAergic inhibition was present in slices from these rats. D-2-Amino-phosphonovalerate suppressed the field potentials in slices from microencephalic rats by more than 50%, suggesting that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors contributed markedly to the synaptic responses evoked by single stimuli. D-Serine, but not picrotoxin, restored long-term potentiation in the CA1 field of the microencephalic rats. The D-serine effect was prevented by pretreating the slices with either 7-chloro-kynurenate or D-2-amino-phosphonovalerate. The failure to induce long-term potentiation, if also found in vivo, may be among the factors related to the learning deficits displayed by these rats.",
