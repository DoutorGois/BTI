     "AB": "Salvianolic acid B (SalB) is a polyphenolic compound found in Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge that has several anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. In the present study, we investigated whether SalB has neuroprotective effects in an amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide-induced Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Mice were injected with Abeta25-35 peptide intracerebroventricularly and were subsequently administered SalB once daily for 7 days. Subchronic SalB administration (10mg/kg) significantly ameliorated the Abeta25-35 peptide-induced memory impairment in the passive avoidance task (P<0.05). SalB treatment also reduced the number of activated microglia and astrocytes that were observed during the inflammatory reaction after the administration of the Abeta25-35 peptide. Moreover, SalB markedly reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression levels and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, which were increased by the administration of the Abeta25-35 peptide. Furthermore, SalB administration significantly rescued the Abeta25-35 peptide-induced decrease of choline acetyltransferase and brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein levels. These results suggest that SalB exerts neuroprotective activity via anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects and that SalB may be a potential candidate for Alzheimer's disease therapy.",
