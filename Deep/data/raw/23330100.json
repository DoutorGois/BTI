     "AB": "Enlargement of the brain weight was attained in rats by reducing the number of neonates in the litter. The brain of 14- and 30-day-old animals was examined (controls: intact animals from litters of average numbers). Difference between the brain weight at 14 and 30 days was about 200 mg. The parameter in the experimental rats was higher than in control: by 19.9 and 15.8% at the age of 14 and 30 days, respectively. The neocortex and hippocampus of the experimental rat brain differed by the size of the neuron cytoplasm and nucleus, these cells' count in a visual field, and activities of NADH- and NADPH-dehydrogenases in the neuron cytoplasm. During the suckling period, the differences in the weights of experimentally enlarged brain were paralleled by specific features of the cortex, morphometric and histochemical characteristics of the neurons.",
