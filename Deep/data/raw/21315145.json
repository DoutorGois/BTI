     "AB": "Chronic ethanol exposure (CEE) can produce developmental abnormalities in the CNS of the embryo and developing fetus. Folic acid (FA) is an important nutrient during pregnancy and low folate status exacerbates ethanol-induced teratogenicity. This study tested the hypotheses that (1) CEE depletes folate stores in the mother and fetus; and (2) maternal FA supplementation maintains folate stores. CEE decreased fetal body, brain, hippocampus weights, and brain to body weight ratio but not hippocampus to body weight ratio. These effects of CEE were not mitigated by maternal FA administration. The FA regimen prevented the CEE-induced decrease of term fetal liver folate. However, it did not affect maternal liver folate or fetal RBC folate at term, and did not mitigate the nutritional deficit-induced decrease of term fetal hippocampus folate. This study suggests that maternal FA supplementation may have differential effects on folate status in the mother and the fetus.",
