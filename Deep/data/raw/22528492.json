     "AB": "The roles of metal ions in promoting amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) oligomerization associated with Alzheimer disease are increasingly recognized. However, the detailed structures dictating toxicity remain elusive for Abeta oligomers stabilized by metal ions. Here, we show that small Zn(2+)-bound Abeta1-40 (Zn(2+)-Abeta40) oligomers formed in cell culture medium exhibit quasi-spherical structures similar to native amylospheroids isolated recently from Alzheimer disease patients. These quasi-spherical Zn(2+)-Abeta40 oligomers irreversibly inhibit spontaneous neuronal activity and cause massive cell death in primary hippocampal neurons. Spectroscopic and x-ray diffraction structural analyses indicate that despite their non-fibrillar morphology, the metastable Zn(2+)-Abeta40 oligomers are rich in beta-sheet and cross-beta structures. Thus, Zn(2+) promotes Abeta40 neurotoxicity by structural organization mechanisms mediated by coordination chemistry.",
