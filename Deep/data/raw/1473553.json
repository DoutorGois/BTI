     "AB": "The number of muscarinic receptors in the striatum and hippocampus of aged rats is significantly lower than the number measured in young animals. The treatment of aged rats for 30 days with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) restored the number of muscarinic receptors to levels found in the striatum and hippocampus from young animals. We did not observe a clear-cut difference between the dissociation constants of untreated young and untreated or SAM-treated aged rats, whereas the binding capacity varied. Moreover, in vitro addition of SAM to hippocampal membranes from aged rats resulted in a significant increase in the number of binding sites. This in vitro effect was antagonized by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, a specific in vitro inhibitor of methyltransferase activity. The reduction in the muscarinic receptor density could be related to a decrease in neuronal membrane fluidity induced by aging, while its increase after SAM treatment might be ascribed to the ability of this methyl donor to increase the fluidity of cell membranes by stimulating phospholipid synthesis.",
