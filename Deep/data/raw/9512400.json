     "AB": "The distribution and cellular localization of the somatostatin sst2(a) receptor was investigated in selected human brain areas using an anti-peptide antibody raised against a carboxy-terminal portion of the receptor protein. The sst2(a) receptor was found to be present on neurones and processes in the deep layers of the cerebral cortex, in the subicular complex and the hippocampal formation. Further signals were obtained in the molecular and granular layer of the cerebellum, with occasional weakly stained Purkinje cells. The regional distribution of the receptor protein was compared with quantitative autoradiography using a sst2 receptor selective ligand [125I]BIM23027.",
