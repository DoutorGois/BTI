     "AB": "The effects of chronic treatment with piracetam (100 mg/Kg) plus choline (100 mg/Kg) on rabbits' hippocampal electrical activity and behavior have been studied. Animals were exposed to a neutral environment, in the absence of any external stimulus, and then to an object and a stuffed sparrow-hawk. Results show a drug related reduction in the amount of the hippocampal rhythmic slow activity (RSA) and an increase in RSA high frequency values in the presence of the object and of the stuffed animal, but not in the neutral environment. This would suggest that piracetam plus choline treatment has an effect on RSA in situations in which selective attention is required.",
