     "AB": "The specific photoaffinity labeling of membrane-bound and detergent-solubilized benzodiazepine binding sites has been investigated using UV irradiated [3H] flunitrazepam as a photochemical probe. The time course and the regional and pharmacological specificity of the photolabeling reaction has been determined for \"brain-specific\" benzodiazepine binding sites; \"peripheral-type\" binding sites treated in an identical manner were not specifically labeled. Comparison of the number of sites labeled and blocked by [3H]flunitrazepam photolabeling of detergent-solubilized preparations indicated that about one site was blocked and unavailable for reversible binding for each site photolabeled. In contrast, when membrane-bound sites were photolabeled, about four sites were inactivated for each site photolabeled. Examination of photolabeled binding sites from various brain regions including cortex, striatum, and hippocampus using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave only a single labeled band of apparent Mr = 48,000.",
