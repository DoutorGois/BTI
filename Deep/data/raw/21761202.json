     "AB": "CK2 is a heterotetrameric ubiquitous kinase consisting of two catalytic subunits and two regulatory subunits. The two catalytic subunits, alpha and alpha', are highly homologous but differ in their C-terminal regions. It is not known whether CK2alpha and alpha' have distinctive substrate specificity, since no alpha- or alpha'-specific substrate has been identified. Thus, it is assumed that the two kinase isoforms overlap in their substrate specificity. CK2 protein levels and activity were found to be elevated in the brain when compared to other organs. Here we have studied the protein levels of CK2alpha and alpha' isoforms in nine major brain regions. We found that both, CK2alpha and alpha', are expressed in all brain regions tested. Whereas CK2alpha levels do not vary strongly across the regions, CK2alpha' levels are slightly higher in the cortex and hippocampus than in other regions. Furthermore, we show that CK2alpha protein levels in the striatum are relatively high when compared to CK2alpha'. The approximate stoichiometry ratio of CK2alpha:CK2alpha' is 8:1. Therefore, one can consider that CK2alpha levels are predominant in comparison to CK2alpha' levels throughout the mammalian brain.",
