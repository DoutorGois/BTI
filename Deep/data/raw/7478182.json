     "AB": "We have examined the effects of the redox reagent 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) on synaptic potentials recorded extracellularly from the CA1 area in hippocampal slices following low frequency stimulation (LFS) and tetanic stimulation (TS). Application of DTNB (200 microM) neither changed synaptic responses, nor prevented the expression of TS-induced long-term potentiation of synaptic responses and their depotentiation by LFS. Conversely, in naive slices, LFS still induced long-term depression of synaptic responses following application of DTNB. This depression could be subsequently reversed with a TS. It is concluded that the redox state of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors does not affect the expression of long-term potentiation and depression of synaptic responses.",
