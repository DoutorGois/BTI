     "AB": "Kindled seizures evoked by electrical stimulation of limbic pathways in the rat induce sprouting and synaptic reorganization of the mossy fiber pathway in the dentate gyrus (DG). To investigate whether seizures evoked by different methods also induce reorganization of this pathway, the distribution of mossy fiber terminals in the DG was examined with Timm histochemistry after systemic administration of pentylenetetrazol, a chemoconvulsant that reduces Cl- mediated GABAergic inhibition. Myoclonic seizures evoked by subconvulsant doses of pentylenetetrazol (24 mg/kg i.p.) were not accompanied by electrographic seizures in the DG, and did not induce mossy fiber sprouting. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures evoked by repeated administration of PTZ (24 mg/kg i.p.) were consistently accompanied by electrographic seizure activity in the DG, and induced sprouting and synaptic reorganization of the mossy fiber pathway. The results demonstrated that repeated generalized tonic-clonic seizures evoked by pentylenetetrazol induced mossy fiber synaptic reorganization when ictal electrographic discharges activated the circuitry of the DG.",
