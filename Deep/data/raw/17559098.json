     "AB": "The subiculum and the entorhinal cortex (EC) are important structures in processing and transmitting information between the neocortex and the hippocampus. The subiculum potentially receives information from the EC through two routes. In addition to a direct projection from EC to the subiculum, there is an indirect polysynaptic connection. The latter uses a number of possible pathways, which all converge onto the final projection from the hippocampal field CA1 to the subiculum. In this series of experiments we investigated to what extent activity in both pathways influences population activity of subicular neurons. We used voltage sensitive dyes in combined hippocampal-EC slices of the rat to measure the spatio-temporal activity patterns. To activate the two inputs to the subiculum, stimulation electrodes were placed in the stratum oriens/alveus of CA1 and in layer III of the medial EC. The response patterns evoked in the subiculum after electrical stimulation of each of these input pathways separately were compared with the response patterns after simultaneous stimulation of both areas (medial EC + CA1). A comparison of the computed added responses of the two individual stimulations with the measured responses after simultaneous stimulation suggests that both inputs are linearly added in the subiculum with very little nonlinear interactions. This strongly suggests that in the subiculum interaction at a single cell level of the direct and the indirect pathways from the EC is an unlikely scenario.",
