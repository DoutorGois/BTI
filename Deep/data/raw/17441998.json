     "AB": "We describe two patients who underwent intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP) postoperatively following temporal lobectomy (one right temporal and one left temporal lobectomy), prompted by consideration of reoperation for persistent, intractable seizures. IAP memory score, consisting of the percentage of correctly recognized dually encoded stimuli, was calculated for each hemisphere. Both patients performed well on the IAP baseline memory assessment prior to injections, and both were left hemisphere dominant for language. The IAP memory results were consistent with the postoperative neuropsychological memory evaluation in that the patient who had undergone nonlanguage-dominant temporal resection performed within normal limits, while the patient who had undergone language-dominant temporal resection performed poorly, although not completely amnestic, on memory testing. Injection of the nonsurgical, presumably healthy, hemisphere resulted in complete failure of memory in both patients, implying that baseline memory was dependent on the functional integrity of the nonsurgical hemisphere, inactivation of which led to complete memory disruption. Secondly, the hippocampus in the nonlanguage-dominant hemisphere was able to support memory to some extent, if not completely, when it functioned in isolation without the influence of the language-dominant hemisphere during the IAP. These findings are discussed in the context of functional reserve and adequacy models.",
