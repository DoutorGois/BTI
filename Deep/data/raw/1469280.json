     "AB": "Colchicine eliminates selectively dentata area granular cells after topical microinjections. In rats treated this way it was impossible to evoke field potentials by perforant parth stimulation and the animals were unable to learn if perforant path stimulation was used as conditioned signal. After colchicine lesion neonatal dentate area tissue was grafted into the lesioned region. Between 4 and 10 weeks after grafting it was again possible to evoke potentials after perforant path stimulation and the rats were able to learn, whereas colchicine-treated rats without grafts failed. The histological investigation showed well on grown neurons within the grafts. The grafts were well integrated. It was shown that the mossy fibers from the grafts innervated the deserted CA3 sector, and that the grafted neurons were innervated by nervous fibers from the recipient brain. It can be supposed that the granular cells from the grafts were able to taken the function of the damaged granular cells of the colchicine treated dentate area.",
