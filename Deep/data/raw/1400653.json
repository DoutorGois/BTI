The purpose of this study was to compare the regional effects of hypoxia-ischemia on the expression of the proto-oncogene, c-fos, and the heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) gene in developing brain. Unilateral hypoxia-ischemia was produced in the brain of immature rats (7, 15, and 23 days after birth) using a combination of carotid artery ligation and systemic hypoxia (8% O2). After recovery for 2 and 24 h, the regional expression of c-fos and HSP-70 mRNA was determined using in situ hybridization. Littermates were permitted to recover for 1 week for assessment of histologic injury. Hypoxia-ischemia increased the expression of both c-fos and HSP-70 mRNA, but the topography of expression varied with the age of the animal as well as the mRNA species. In the 7-day-old group, expression of c-fos at 2 h increased in multiple regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere in nearly one-half of the animals, while HSP-70 mRNA was not expressed until 24 h and, then, predominantly in the hippocampus. In 15- and 23-day-old rats, expression of c-fos was increased at 2 h in the entorhinal cortex and in the dendritic field of the upper blade of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, while HSP-70 mRNA was prominently expressed in neocortex and the cell layers of the hippocampus. Interestingly, the strong expression of HSP-70 mRNA in dentate granule cells did not occur in the innermost layer of cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
