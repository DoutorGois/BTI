     "AB": "The inheritance of spatial learning ability in inbred mice was examined by performance of a classical genetic cross between the 2 inbred strains C57BL/6Ibg and DBA/2Ibg. The inbreds were crossed to produce the 1st filial generation (F1) hybrids. F1 mice were bred to each other and were backcrossed to the parental strains to produce 3 hybrid generations with recombinant genotypes. The animals were tested for spatial learning ability in the Morris water task. All hybrid generations showed greater spatial learning ability than the inbreds, with F1 hybrids showing the greatest degree of spatial learning. The inheritance pattern for spatial learning differed between male and female mice, with males showing a type of inheritance in which dominant genes made the major contribution to the expression of the behavior. Females showed equal contributions of dominance deviation and additive genetic effects. The results are discussed in terms of fitness value to the animals.",
