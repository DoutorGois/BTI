     "AB": "In this study, the 5 d and 7 d training paradigms were adopted to investigate the influences of different training procedures on the performance of spatial learning and memory of the hippocampal injured rats. The results showed that during the hidden-platform acquisition training, similar spatial learning dysfunctions were indicated in those two training paradigms. Whereas, when the spatial memories have been evaluated, compared with the 5 d training groups, the rats under 7 d training procedure not only crossed the platform location less, but also preferred to spend less time in the target quadrant.",
