     "AB": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) appear to be involved in several neurodegenerative disorders. We tested the hypothesis that oxidative stress could have a role in the hippocampal neurodegeneration observed in temporal lobe epilepsy induced by pilocarpine. We first determined the spatio-temporal pattern of ROS generation, by means of detection with dihydroethidium oxidation, in the CA1 and CA3 areas and the dentate gyrus of the dorsal hippocampus during status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine. Fluoro-Jade B assays were also performed to detect degenerating neurons. ROS generation was increased in CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus after pilocarpine-induced seizures, which was accompanied by marked cell death. Treatment of rats with a NADPH oxidase inhibitor (apocynin) for 7 days prior to induction of status epilepticus was effective in decreasing both ROS production (by an average of 20%) and neurodegeneration (by an average of 61%). These results suggest an involvement of ROS generated by NADPH oxidase in neuronal death in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy.",
