     "AB": "The effects of pentylenetetrazol on behavior, EEG activity and regional CNS levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP) in mice and guinea pigs were studied. Pentylenetetrazol increased cGMP levels in all regions of brain examined (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum) and increased cAMP levels in all regions except striatum. cGMP levels were increased by both sub-convulsant and convulsant doses of pentylenetetrazol. In contrast, cAMP levels were elevated only by concentrations of pentylenetetrazol that produced clinically evident seizures or epileptiform EEG activity. These data indicate that increases in CNS cGMP levels produced by epileptogenic stimuli can occur independently of seizure discharges, whereas accumulation of cAMP requires and is secondary to seizure activity. In conjunction with results of other studies, these data support the hypothesis that cGMP may have a role in seizure genesis and/or propagation, whereas cAMP may be involved in processes that attenuate or terminate seizures.",
