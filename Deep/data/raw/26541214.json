     "AB": "The diversification between dorsal (DH) and ventral (VH) hippocampus includes the different ability to support NMDA receptor-dependent long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). In this study, we assessed the ability of associational/commissural connections in the CA3 hippocampal field to show NMDA receptor-independent LTP. We found that high-frequency stimulation under blockade of NMDA receptors induced greater LTP in DH (40.7+/-8.5%) than in VH (17.1+/-4.6%). The blocker of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) nifedipine prevented the induction of LTP. We hypothesize that the different ability for VDCC-LTP between DH and VH might have important implications in the memory-related information processing performed by the circuits of the two hippocampal segments.",
