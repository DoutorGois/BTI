     "AB": "We examined ultrastructural correlates of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of young (3 months) vs aged (30 months) Wistar rats and established the effects of the calcium antagonist nimodipine in animals chronically treated from 24 to 30 months. The effects of nimodipine was studied since this compound improves hippocampal neuronal physiology and enhances cognitive function during aging. In the supragranular layer of the dentate gyrus we found a 24% decrease in synaptic density (Nv) in aged animals, while synaptic size (S) was not significantly altered. After nimodipine treatment Nv in aged rats was not significantly different from young adults, thus being significantly increased compared to age-matched controls. The size of synapses was not significantly altered after nimodipine administration. Total synaptic surface area (Sv) in nimodipine-treated animals was significantly increased compared to aged controls, however, Sv remained significantly lower than in young adults. These data indicate that chronic administration of nimodipine enables granular cells in the dentate gyrus to maintain its number of synaptic contacts during the aging process. Furthermore, the presented influence of nimodipine on synaptic plasticity processes may underlie previously reported improved cognitive functioning of aged animals treated similarly with nimodipine.",
