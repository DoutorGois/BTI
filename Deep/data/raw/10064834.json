     "AB": "Cortical metabolites and regional cerebral intracellular pH (pHi) were measured in normoglycemic (NM), acute hyperglycemic (AH), and chronic hyperglycemic (CH, 2 week duration, streptozotocin-induced) Wistar rat brains during cardiac arrest and resuscitation. During total ischemia in AH and CH rats (plasma glucose approximately 30 mM), cortical ATP, PCr, glucose, and glycogen all fell significantly as expected. Lactate levels increased dramatically in association with a concomitant intracellular acidosis. Although lactate reached higher concentrations in AH and CH than NM, pHi was significantly lower only in the AH group. With 5 min of reperfusion, all groups recovered to near baseline in all variables, though lactate remained elevated. In a separate aspect of the study, animals from each experimental group were allowed to recover for 4 days following resuscitation, with outcome being gauged by mortality rate and hippocampal CA1 neuron counts. NM survival rate was significantly better than AH and CH. In particular, no CH rats survived for 4 days despite rapid initial recovery. After 4 days, the AH group had suffered significantly greater CA1 neuron loss than the NM rats. In summary, our research identified differences in intra-ischemic acid-base status in the two hyperglycemic groups, suggesting that chronic hyperglycemia may alter the brain's buffering capacity. These observations may account for differences between acutely and chronically hyperglycemic subjects regarding outcome, and they suggest that factors other than hydrogen ion production during ischemia are responsible for modulating outcome.",
