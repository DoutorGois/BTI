     "AB": "This study examined the effects of ibotenate lesions of either the entorhinal cortex (EC) or the subiculum (SUB) on the ability of mice to memorize a single spatial location (initial discrimination), and on their capacity to switch to a new location (transfer) following the initial learning in an eight-arm radial maze. Results indicated that mice with ibotenate lesions of the EC or SUB were impaired in postoperative acquisition of the spatial discrimination task, making more reference, but not working memory, errors and displaying fewer first correct response trials than sham-operated control mice. Furthermore, additional damage to the ventral hippocampus exacerbated the impairment of performance induced by lesions of the SUB alone. In addition, all mice, except for the combined lesion group, exhibited similar performance levels when they were trained to choose another arm of the maze that had not previously been baited (transfer). These findings suggest that both the EC and the SUB play important roles in spatial information processing in mice.",
