     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of yizhi jiannao granule concentration fluid (YCF) on the expression of peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans isomerase A (Pin1) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) mRNA in the hippocampus of senescence accelerated mice Senile-Prone8(SAMP8). METHODS: Six-month old SAMP8 mice were randomly divided into a YCF group and a model group. Six-month old SAMP8 mice were served as a normal control group. The YCF group was ravaged, while the model group and the normal control group were gavaged with double-distilled water for 8 weeks. The hippocampus was taken out for examination. The expression of Pin1 and HMGB1 mRNA was measured by RT-PCR. RESULTS: In the YCF group, the level of Pin1 mRNA increased, and the level of HMGB1 mRNA decreased compared with that of the model group. CONCLUSION: Yizhi jiannao granules can prevent Alzheimer's disease by increasing the Pin1 level and decreasing the HMGB1 level.",
