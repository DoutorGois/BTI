     "AB": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Compelling evidence suggests that a small group of men who develop schizophrenia display a stable pattern of antisocial behaviour from childhood onwards, causing considerable suffering to victims and to themselves and imposing a significant financial burden on society. We reviewed the literature on the neurobiological correlates of antisocial behaviour and violence to further the understanding of this subgroup of persons with schizophrenia and develop testable hypotheses for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Few studies have been conducted, sample sizes are small and measures vary greatly. Taken together, the results suggest that among men with schizophrenia, those who have displayed a stable pattern of antisocial and aggressive behaviour since childhood, as compared with those with no such history, perform better on neuropsychological tests tapping specific executive functions and more poorly on assessments of orbitofrontal functions. We hypothesize that individuals in this subgroup are less compromised neurologically and display structural brain abnormalities in the amygdala-orbitofrontal system and in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. SUMMARY: A better understanding of the distinctive neurobiological characteristics of this subgroup of men with schizophrenia will contribute to developing treatments tailored to their needs, to prevent antisocial behaviours and to reduce the symptoms of schizophrenia.",
