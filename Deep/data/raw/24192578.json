     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Drug development for Alzheimer disease (AD) is challenged by the success in animal models tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) and the subsequent failures to meet primary outcome measures in phase II or III clinical trials in patients. The human variant of MWM (hMWM) enables us to examine allocentric and egocentric navigation as in the MWM. OBJECTIVE: It was the aim of this study to examine the utility of a computerized hMWM to assess the effects of donepezil in mild AD. METHODS: Donepezil 5 mg/day was started after initial hMWM testing in the treated group (n = 12), and after 28 days, the dose was increased to 10 mg/day. The performance after 3 months was compared to that of a non-treated group (n = 12). RESULTS: Donepezil stabilized or improved the spatial navigation performance after 3 months, especially in the allocentric delayed recall subtask (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: The computerized hMWM has the potential to measure the effects of donepezil in mild AD. It is a sensitive cognitive outcome measure in AD clinical trials.",
