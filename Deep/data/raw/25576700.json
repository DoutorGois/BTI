     "AB": "Depression is one of the most prevalent challenges of mental conditions. Yet its exact etiology has not been clear. Chronic stress increases the production of cytokines, which can lead to depression. Hepcidin, an iron modulator, is involved in the inflammation process as well as iron homeostasis. This study was designed to investigate the role of hepcidin, on stress-induced depression. 60 male wistar rats were entered the experiment. We used a chronic unpredictable mild stress (for 28 days) as a rat model of depression. In stressed group, three subgroups were treated with three different doses of dalteparin (a hepcidin inhibitor): 70IU/kg, 100IU/kg and 140IU/kg daily, for 4 weeks. The animals in the stressed group had more depressive-like behavior than the control group. Moreover, chronic mild stress produced an increased serum interleukin-6 levels. These effects were accompanied by an obvious increase in hepcidin mRNA level and iron content in the hippocampus. These changes were blocked by the injection of dalteparin. In conclusion, inhibition of hepcidin may reduce many pathological changes seen in stress-induced depressive disorders.",
