     "AB": "Activity dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP, 828 amino acids, pI 5.99) is a glial-derived protein that contains a femtomolar active neuroprotective peptide, NAPVSIPQ (NAP). VIP induces a two- to threefold increase in ADNP mRNA in astrocytes, suggesting that ADNP is a VIP-responsive gene. ADNP is widely distributed in the mouse hippocampus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex. VIP has been shown to possess neuroprotective activity that may be exerted through the activation of glial proteins. We suggest that ADNP may be part of the VIP protection pathway through the femtomolar-acting NAP and through putative interaction with other macromolecules.",
