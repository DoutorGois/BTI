     "AB": "Regional strain-based brain injury intensity during controlled cortical impact (CCI) was studied using a three-dimensional numerical rat brain model. A full factorial design of CCI computer experiments was performed using two typical impactor shapes (flat or hemispherical) at a fixed impact velocity of 4?m/s with various impact depths (1, 1.5, 1.6, 2, 2.5, 2.7, and 3?mm) and various impactor diameters (4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.5?mm). In total, 70 CCI cases were simulated numerically. Two injury assessment measures, the cumulative strain damage measure (CSDM), which accounts for the volume of brain tissue with elevated strains, and cumulative strain damage percentage measure (CSDPM), which is a strain-based estimate of the neuronal cell loss percentage, were used to evaluate the risk of brain injury. Results demonstrated positive nonlinear relationships between impact depth and these injury assessment measures in six regions of interest: ipsilateral cortex, ipsilateral corpus callosum, ipsilateral hippocampus, ipsilateral thalamus, cerebellum, and brainstem. However, the impactor diameter was not always positively correlated with regional tissue strains. For the flat impactor group, the 5?mm diameter impactor induced more tissue strain in the corpus callosum/hippocampus, and a smaller impactor induced more strain in the thalamus. For the hemispherical impactor group, a larger impactor tended to induce more tissue strain in subcortical regions, with the exception of the 6?mm diameter impactor. This study systematically predicts regional intensity of primary brain injury according to tissue strain distributions in the hope that strain distribution maps may become a common platform to compare CCI severities with different configurations.",
