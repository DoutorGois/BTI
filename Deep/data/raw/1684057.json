     "AB": "The effect of the psychomotor stimulant, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"Ecstasy\"), upon integrated cerebral function was measured in rats using the quantitative [14C]deoxyglucose autoradiographic technique. Animals were injected with MDMA (20 mg/kg sc) twice daily for 4 days. Fourteen days after the final administration, [3H]-paroxetine binding to 5HT uptake sites was reduced by 89% in membranes prepared from tissue samples of frontal cortex. In the same rats [3H]-paroxetine binding autoradiography revealed heterogeneity in the regional distribution of 5-HT uptake site depletion within neocortex (0-92%) and hippocampus (30-95%). Despite these profound reductions in 5-HT uptake sites no significant alterations were found in glucose utilisation in any area of neocortex examined. However, significant increases in glucose use were found in subregions of the hippocampus, most notably within the pyramidal cell layer of CA2 and CA3 (25-35%). This study provides direct evidence that the loss of 5-HT innervation caused by exposure to MDMA results in lasting functional changes in hippocampus.",
