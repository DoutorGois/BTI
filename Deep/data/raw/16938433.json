     "AB": "PURPOSE: The present study was performed to understand the characteristics of septal kindling in rats, especially the efficacies of antiepileptic drugs in comparison with amygdala kindling. METHODS: Under pentobarbital anesthesia, rats were fixed to a stereotaxic apparatus, and electrodes were implanted into the right frontal cortex, the hippocampus, the lateral septal and the amygdala. Electrodes were connected to a miniature receptacle, which was embedded in the skull with dental cement. Bipolar stimulation was applied to the lateral septal or the amygdala every day until a generalized seizure was obtained. Carbamazepine (CBZ), zonisamide (ZNS) and clobazam (CLB) were orally administered to fully kindled rats. RESULT: A considerable number of stimulations was required to establish septal-kindled seizures. In addition, wet dog shakes were observed during the septal kindling procedure, different from amygdala kindling. The oral administration of CBZ, ZNS and CLB caused a dose-dependent inhibition both of seizure stage and after-discharge (AD) duration of septal-kindled seizures. CBZ and ZNS caused a more potent inhibition of septal-kindled seizures than amygdala kindled seizures, whereas CLB inhibited both septal and amygdala kindled seizures to almost the same extent. CONCLUSION: Septal kindling was confirmed to possess some characteristics, which were evidently different from that of amygdala kindling. In addition, it was demonstrated that septal kindling was also available as a model for the evaluation of antiepileptic drugs.",
