     "AB": "Neurons strongly immunoreactive for substance P are present as subpopulations in the stratum oriens, pyramidal layer and polymorphic layer of the hippocampus of the human infant. Substance P immunoreactive terminals are numerous on other neuronal cell bodies in the polymorphic layer and over pyramidal cells of the subiculum and the CA1, 2 and 3 regions. There is a high density of substance P-immunoreactive axons in the granular layer. Enkephalin immunoreactive neurons are relatively few in number and are present in the polymorphic and pyramidal layers. The results indicate that substance P probably plays a major role in short range circuits in the human hippocampus and that intrinsic enkephalin neurons probably play a relatively minor role.",
