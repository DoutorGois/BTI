     "AB": "The neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) is widely distributed in the CNS. We herein investigated the immunocytochemical localization of CCK in the glutamatergic excitatory pathways in the mouse hippocampus, with particular reference to the dorsoventral difference. The intense CCK-like immunoreactivity (CCK-LI) was found in the mossy fiber pathway (stratum lucidum and dentate hilus) and in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. In the mossy fiber pathway, the CCK-LI was more intense at the ventral level than at the dorsal level. On the other hand, the CCK-LI in the stratum lucidum was more intense in the distal portion than in the proximal portion, both at the dorsal and ventral levels. High-resolution three-dimensional image analysis revealed the coexpression of CCK and synaptoporin (SPO) in the single mossy terminal, where they were spatially segregated but adjacent to each other. Quantitative image analysis indicated the difference in the amount of CCK within the mossy terminals along the dorsoventral and transverse axes of the hippocampus. On the other hand, in the inner molecular layer, CCK- and SPO-positive elements appeared to have little relation to each other. We also examined the postnatal development of the CCK-LI in the mouse hippocampus. The CCK-LI was detected in the inner molecular layer of the ventral dentate gyrus at postnatal day (P) 7. In the mossy fiber pathway, the CCK-LI was first evident at P 14, but it was restricted to the distal portion of the stratum lucidum in the ventral hippocampus. Interestingly, the distributions of the SPO immunoreactivity at P 7 were already similar to those of adult mice. The patterns of expression of CCK-LI at P 28 were almost similar to those of adult mice. The present data demonstrate the heterogeneous expression of CCK-LI in the mouse hippocampus, and provide a baseline to understand the role of CCK in the mouse brain.",
