     "AB": "In this study, we compared the protective effect of bilobalide, a purified terpene lactone component of ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761, (definition see editorial) and EGb 761 against ischemic injury and against glutamate-induced excitotoxic neuronal death. In ischemic injury, we measured neuronal loss and the levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded cytochrome oxidase (COX) subunit III mRNA in vulnerable hippocampal regions of gerbils. At 7 days of reperfusion after 5 min of transient global ischemia, a significant increase in neuronal death and a significant decrease in COX III mRNA were observed in the hippocampal CA1 neurons. Oral administration of EGb 761 at 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day and bilobalide at 3 and 6 mg/kg/day for 7 days before ischemia progressively protected CA1 neurons from death and from ischemia-induced reductions in COX III mRNA. In rat cerebellar neuronal cultures, addition of bilobalide or EGb 761 protected in a dose-dependent manner against glutamate-induced excitotoxic neuronal death (effective concentration [EC (50)] = 5 microg/ml (12 microM) for bilobalide and 100 microg/ml for EGb 761. These results suggest that both EGb 761 and bilobalide are protective against ischemia-induced neuronal death in vivo and glutamate-induced neuronal death in vitro by synergistic mechanisms involving anti-excitotoxicity, inhibition of free radical generation, scavenging of reactive oxygen species, and regulation of mitochondrial gene expression.",
