     "AB": "The IgM monoclonal antibodies, Elec-39, HNK-1 and NC-1, recognize the same subset of Torpedo electric organ acetylcholinesterase (AChE). We show that they react against a glycosphingolipid (SGPG) containing a sulfated glucuronic acid (SGA). The three antibodies appear essentially identical in their specificity but differ in their affinity for the antigens. We have examined their binding in the CNS, nerves and muscles of several vertebrate species, at the optical and in some cases at the electron microscope level. All three antibodies label the same structures: they show diffuse staining around neuromuscular endplates and label the plasma membrane of the Schwann cells, surrounding the outer layer of myelin sheaths. In the adult rat CNS, the antibodies label certain defined structures, notably extracellular material in the habenula and in the CA2 layer of the hippocampus. In the cortex and cerebellum, they label the surface of neural processes and terminals apposed to large multipolar neurons and Purkinje cells, as well as membranous material contained in inclusions dispersed in the cytoplasm of these neurons. These localizations are consistent with the suggestion that the SGA-antigens may be involved in cellular interactions.",
