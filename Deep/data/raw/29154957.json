     "AB": "Sleep loss induces a low-grade inflammatory status characterized by a subtle but sustained increase of pro-inflammatory mediators, which are key regulators of blood-brain barrier function. To investigate the influence of inflammatory status on blood-brain barrier dysfunction induced by sleep restriction we performed an experiment using two strains of mice with different immunological backgrounds, C57BL/6 mice that have a predominant pro-inflammatory response and BALB/c mice that have a predominant anti-inflammatory response. Mice were sleep-restricted during 10days using the flowerpot technique during 20h per day with 4h of daily sleep opportunity. The systemic inflammatory status, blood-brain barrier permeability, and the hippocampal expression of neuroinflammatory markers were characterized at the 10thday. Serum levels of TNF and IFN-gamma increased in sleep-restricted C57BL/6 but not in BALB/c mice; no changes in other cytokines were found. Sleep restriction increased blood-brain barrier permeability in C57BL/6 strain but not in BALB/c. The hippocampus of sleep-restricted C57BL/6 mice exhibited an increase in the expression of the neuroinflammatory markers Iba-1, A2A adenosine receptor, and MMP-9; meanwhile in sleep-restricted BALB/c mice the expression of this markers was lesser than the control group. These data suggest that cytokines may be playing a key role in modulating blood-brain barrier function during sleep restriction, and probably the effects are related to Iba-1, MMP-9 and A2A adenosine receptor overexpression.",
