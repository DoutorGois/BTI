     "AB": "We have recently identified a Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 interacting zinc-finger protein (MIZIP) from a human brain cDNA library. Here, we report the generation of a specific antibody against MIZIP and its distribution in rodent tissues using immunoblotting and immunohistochemical techniques. MIZIP was detected as a 27 kDa protein in brain, liver, and skeletal muscle, and to a lower extend, in lung, testis, and heart. Subcellular fractionation of adult mouse brain revealed the presence of MIZIP and MCHR1 in the cytoplasmic, membrane, and synaptosomal fraction, but not in a postsynaptic density preparation. In cultured rat, embryonic hippocampal neurons MIZIP is somatodendritically localized. In the adult rodent brain, MIZIP is widely distributed. High levels of expression were detected in brain regions involved in olfaction, feeding behavior, sensorimotor integration, and learning and memory, for example, the olfactory bulb, the olfactory tubercle, the caudate putamen, the thalamus and hypothalamus, the nucleus accumbens, the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus formation, and the cerebellum. Co-expression of MIZIP and MCHR1 was observed, for example, in pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, in neurons of the olivary nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, pontine, and mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus. However, there are also differences in the expression patterns, for example, high expression of MCHR1 was detected in the lateral habenula, but no expression of MIZIP. These data support the notion that MIZIP might interact with MCHR1 in a cell type specific manner in vivo, suggesting a role in the regulation of MCH signalling in distinct regions of the mammalian brain.",
