     "AB": "In the present study the acute effect of intravenous aluminum chloride (1 mg/kg) on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities of rats was investigated. Aluminum was found to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as indicated by the detection of aluminum in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 30 min after femoral vein injection. Two hours following aluminum injection, ChAT activity in the basal forebrain and hippocampus was significantly reduced by 30% and 22%, respectively, whereas no change was observed in the caudate nuclei. On the other hand, AChE activity was significantly increased by 45% in the caudate nuclei, whereas little change was observed in other brain areas. This report demonstrates that rapid transport of Al across the BBB, and the acute nature of Al neurotoxicity in rats.",
