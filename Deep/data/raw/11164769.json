     "AB": "The 2,3-benzodiazepine GYKI 52466, administered intracerebrally or systemically, was assessed for its ability to protect against the neuronal death in the brain caused by intra-hippocampal injections of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonists, kainate and L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA). In contrast to a previous report, a low intra-hippocampal dose of GYKI 52466 (25 nmol) did not protect against kainate toxicity. In order to achieve higher doses of GYKI 52466, solubilization in 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin was used, and limited protection against AMPA, but not kainate toxicity was found. There was a commensurate reduction in seizure-related neuronal loss in the limbic regions of the brain. When diazepam was used to prevent seizures, GYKI 52466 had no effect on hippocampal neuronal loss caused by the direct toxicity of AMPA and kainate on hippocampal neurons. Systemic administration of GYKI 52466 had only a minimal effect on preventing neuronal death caused by AMPA. In vivo, GYKI 52466 is only weakly effective as a neuroprotective agent.",
