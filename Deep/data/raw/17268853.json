     "AB": "The work is a continuation of studies on tau expression and alternative splicing in the central nervous system of transgenic mice harboring human SOD1 with G93A amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated mutation. Since age is an important risk factor for ALS, we expanded the studies into younger animals (age 5 and 25 days). We also included cerebellum, a structure not studied in the context of neurodegeneration in ALS. We found decreased total tau-mRNA expression in hippocampus but not in cortex and spinal cord of young transgenics, and a lack of exon 10 in 5-day-old mice. In cerebellum, the total tau-mRNA expression was increased in transgenic animals during the whole period of life, however at the symptomatic stage of ALS (age 120 days) the level of protein was decreased. It can be concluded that the SOD1 G93A mutation causes early alterations of tau expression in cns, which are not exclusively restricted to the upper and lower motor neuron.",
