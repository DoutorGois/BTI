     "AB": "This study was aimed to evaluate effects of peptides from Phascolosoma esculenta and its ferrous-chelating peptides on spatial learning and memory in mice by Morris water maze test. 100mg/kg peptide on spatial learning and memory function about quadrant time and passing times through the platform better than 50 and 150mg/kg group during exploration period (P<0.05), without body weight between the weight and visual ability. 100mg/kg ferrous-chelating peptide group performed better ability of spatial learning and memory than 100mg/kg peptide group (P<0.05). qRT-PCR results showed that 50 and 100mg/kg administration peptide and 100mg/kg ferrous-chelating peptide can significantly improve mRNA expression of NR2A, NR2B and BDNF with oxidative stress status (GSH-Px, SOD, TAC and MDA), which explained mechanism for improving learning and memory ability in mice via anti-oxidative character.",
