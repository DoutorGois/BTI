     "AB": "Oseltamivir, a widely used anti-influenza drug, inhibits virus neuraminidase. A mammalian homologue of this enzyme is expressed in the brain, yet the effect of oseltamivir on central neurons is largely unknown. Patch-clamp recordings ex vivo revealed that oseltamivir enhanced spike synchronization between hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells. Time-lapse multineuron calcium imaging revealed that oseltamivir and its active metabolite evoked synchronized population bursts that recruited virtually all neurons in the network. This unique, so-far-unknown, event was attenuated by muscarinic receptor antagonist. Thus, oseltamivir is a useful tool for investigating a new aspect of neural circuit operation.",
