     "AB": "We studied paired-pulse facilitation and long-term potentiation/depression in anesthetized rats to determine whether the hippocampal CA1 region inhibits local differences in short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity in its projections to the prefrontal cortex. We compared projections with the PFC from the posterior dorsal and ventral hippocampal CA1 regions (pdCA1 and vCA1 respectively). The two pathways displayed similar properties. However, the PPF properties of the pdCA1, projections differed dramatically from those of the pdCA1 projections. The pdCA1 projections showed the opposite of facilitation (i.e. suppression) at 25-50 ms intervals and more pronounced facilitation at 100-400 ms intervals. These results suggest that there are functional differences between these pathways.",
