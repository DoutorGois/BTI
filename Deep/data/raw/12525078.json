     "AB": "Effect of long-term exposure to aluminum on the content of aluminum, iron, zinc, copper and the lipid peroxidation in hippocampus was studied. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups by body weight. Aluminum chloride was added to diet at doses of Al3+ 0, 11.2, 55.9 and 111.9 mg/kg BW for successive 90 days. Neuro-behavioral tests consisted of open field and passive-avoidance conditioning were performed. SOD and GSH-Px activities and MDA levels were detected by spectrophotometry. The values of aluminum, iron, zinc and copper were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The spontaneous motor ability in the open field and the latency of passive avoidance were decreased as compared with the controls. The concentration of aluminum was increased and iron and zinc were decreased copper was not changed significantly; the activities of SOD and GSH-Px were reduced, while the value of MDA was increased in hippocampus. The results suggested that long-term aluminum-exposure could lead to high accumulation of aluminum in hippocampus, which could disturb the normal distribution of iron and zinc, decrease the activities of antioxidase and increase the level of lipid peroxidation. Accumulation of aluminum and accompany with reduction of iron, zinc in hippocampus and oxidative damage to hippocampus might interpret the neurotoxicity of aluminum.",
