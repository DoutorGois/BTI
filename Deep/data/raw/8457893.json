     "AB": "Axonal regeneration of septal cholinergic neurons was examined after lesion of the septohippocampal pathway of the adult rat and implantation of tubes containing peripheral cellular or acellular substrates. After empty tube implantation, no regenerated structures were observed in the conduit. However, after implanting tubes filled with sections of predegenerated sciatic nerves or a fibrin-fibronectin-containing matrix provided by peripheral regeneration chambers, numerous regenerated axons were detected 6 weeks after the operation. At the electron microscopic level, regenerated axons were observed in the grafted sciatic nerves in contact with Schwann cells but also in contact with astrocytes which were able to migrate and send processes into the graft. After fibrin-fibronectin-containing-matrix implantation, the regenerated structure between septum and hippocampus was composed mainly of fibroblasts, astrocytes, and regenerated axons associated to these central glial cells.",
