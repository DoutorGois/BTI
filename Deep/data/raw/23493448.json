Adapting the rat pups to the apparatus by housing them in it overnight, the difference in behavioral patterns can readily be observed in a single laboratory session. The opportunity of the pups to \"nipple attach\" to an anesthetized dam serves as the reinforcer. Discussion questions are formulated that encourage students to analyze the behaviors structurally, functionally and developmentally.",
