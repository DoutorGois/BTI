     "AB": "In the absence of ovarian estrogens, increased levels of estrogen receptor (ER)alpha in the hippocampus are associated with improvements in cognition. In vitro evidence indicates that under conditions of low estrogen, growth factors, including Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), can activate ERalpha and regulate ERalpha-mediated transcription through mechanisms that likely involve modification of phosphorylation sites on the receptor. The goal of the current work was to investigate a role for IGF-1 in ligand-independent activation of ERalpha in the hippocampus of female rats. Ovariectomized rats received a single intracerebroventricular infusion of IGF-1 and hippocampi were collected 1 or 24 hours later. After 1 h, IGF-1 increased hippocampal levels of phosphorylated ERalpha at serine 118 (S118) as revealed by Western blotting. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that at 1 hour after infusion, IGF-1 increased association between ERalpha and steroid receptor coactivator 1, a histone acetyltransferase that increases transcriptional activity of phosphorylated ERalpha. IGF-1 infusion increased levels of the ERalpha-regulated proteins ERalpha, choline acetyltransferase, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus 24 hours after infusion. Results indicate that IGF-1 activates ERalpha in ligand-independent manner in the hippocampus via phosphorylation at S118 resulting in increased association of ERalpha with steroid receptor coactivator 1 and elevation of ER-regulated proteins. To our knowledge, these data are the first in vivo evidence of ligand-independent actions of ERalpha and provide a mechanism by which ERalpha can impact memory in the absence of ovarian estrogens.",
