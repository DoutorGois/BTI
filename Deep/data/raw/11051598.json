A statistically significant elevation of zinc serum was observed in AD subjects (136.4+/-66.8 microg/dL) compared with age-matched control subjects (71.1+/-35.0 microg/dL). No significant differences were observed between AD and control zinc concentrations in the amygdala, hippocampus, cerebellum, and superior and middle temporal gryi.",
