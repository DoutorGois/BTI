Current therapies are largely symptomatic and are aimed at controlling seizures in affected individuals. This review focuses on emerging insights into mechanisms underlying the most common form of epilepsy--complex partial epilepsy--and also addresses progress in molecular genetic approaches. Such developments will hopefully lead to more effective therapies.",
