     "AB": "Adult neurogenesis in hippocampus is associated with behaviors such as learning. Hippocampus is involved in the regulation of prepulse inhibition (PPI), but the relationship between neurogenesis and PPI is unexplored. We conducted four experiments to determine the role of neural progenitor cell proliferation in PPI. Intracerebroventricular infusion of cytostatic cytosine arabinoside caused PPI disruption but repeated exposure to PPI sessions prevented the PPI disruption. Corticosterone treatment, which decreases hippocampal cell proliferation, caused PPI disruption, whereas antidepressant and exercise, which increased cell proliferation, did not affect PPI. These results suggest that cell proliferation is involved in the first encounter with PPI test while its importance may decrease upon repeated exposures to the tests.",
