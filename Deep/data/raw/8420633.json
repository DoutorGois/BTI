     "AB": "The present study evaluated the effects of bilateral hippocampal lesions on appetitive instrumental conditioning with delayed (5-s interval) reinforcement in rats. Acquisition of a bar press response was considerably slower than rates observed with immediate reinforcement; however, no significant differences between hippocampally lesioned and control groups were noted regarding training to criteria or ratio of responses to reinforcements. These results suggest that the hippocampus is not essential for the association of temporally discontinuous stimuli, and that deficits in other forms of associative learning, such as spatial cognition, must be mediated by the loss of other functions. Putative functions and underlying substrates are discussed for response modulation and sensory (cue relations) associations.",
