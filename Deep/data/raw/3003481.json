     "AB": "The brain benzodiazepine system has been implicated to be important in both the mechanism, and treatment of ethanol related syndromes. In this report evidence is presented which indicates that \"peripheral type\" benzodiazepine binding sites are probably more relevant than \"central type\" receptors for the neurochemical consequences of ethanol dependence and withdrawal states. Utilizing radioreceptor binding techniques 20-50% increases in the binding of [3H]RO-5-4864 (a \"peripheral type\" ligand) to brain membranes derived from rat cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus are observed in ethanol dependent rats. These increases persist for 3 days after cessation of ethanol. The number of [3H]RO-5-4864 binding sites in cerebellum returns to normal during 4-7 days after ethanol withdrawal. In all brain areas examined no changes were observed in the \"central type\" benzodiazepine receptor as judged by [3H]-ethyl-Beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, BCCE binding. Scatchard analysis revealed that the number of [3H]RO-5-4864 binding sites is increased in each brain area while the affinity was unchanged.",
