     "AB": "The distribution of the calcium-binding protein calretinin was investigated by immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus, the subicular areas, and the entorhinal cortex in patients with Alzheimer's disease and in control subjects. By double immunolabelling, the calretinin immunoreactivity was compared to the immunoreactivity for beta/A4 amyloid or for tau proteins. Calretinin-positive neurons were mainly observed in the molecular layer of the gyrus dentatus, the stratum radiatum of the Ammon's horn, and in layers II and III of the entorhinal cortex. The general pattern of calretinin immunoreactivity was conserved in Alzheimer's disease. Calretinin-positive neurons appeared normal in the hippocampus but had a reduced dendritic tree in the entorhinal cortex. Dystrophic calretinin immunoreactive fibres were often observed in the outer molecular layer of the gyrus dentatus and in the CA4 sector in Alzheimer's disease. Most neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles were not calretinin immunoreactive and most senile plaques were not associated with calretinin positive fibres. These results show that entorhinal calretinin-positive neurons are affected in Alzheimer's disease in spite of an absence of systematic association with neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques.",
