     "AB": "Neuronal failure leading to dementia in neurodegenerative diseases is evidenced in vivo by functional and structural changes in the brain such as reductions of glucose consumption and volume of grey matter. The earliest phase of cognitive decline and presymptomatic stages of these diseases are heralded by specific patterns of hypometabolism, even in the absence of atrophy, which are currently considered as diagnostic biomarkers. Atrophy is less consistently found as an initial marker of these diseases and is invariably present in moderate to severe stages with a disease-related topography. The relationship between these two markers is not uniform, but in the two diseases in which they have been directly compared, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, altered hypometabolism precedes and exceeds atrophy in most regions. This suggests a two-step degenerative process. In contrast to these findings, the hippocampus skips this pattern and is more structurally than functionally affected, thereby suggesting a different pathological mechanism in this particular area. More studies are needed to disentangle the mechanisms underlying both markers and their relationship in neurodegenerative diseases.",
