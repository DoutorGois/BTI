     "AB": "Our group previously reported that arsenic (As) exposure induced apoptosis in hippocampus neurons. The aim of the present study was to clarify the protective capacity of taurine (Tau) on As-induced neuronal apoptosis and the related mechanism in mouse hippocampus. Mice were divided into: control group, Tau control group, As exposure group and Tau protective group, randomly. The apoptotic rate of mouse hippocampus was determined by TUNEL staining. The levels of Bcl-2 and Bax gene and protein were analyzed by real time RT-PCR and WB, respectively. Furthermore, cytochrome c (Cyt C) release, and the activity of caspase-8 and caspase-3 were also determined. The results showed that Tau treatment induced the decrease of TUNEL-positive cells, prohibited the disturbance of Bcl-2 and Bax expression, and inhibited Cyt C release and caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation significantly. The results indicated that Tau supplement markedly ameliorates As-induced apoptosis by mitochondria-related pathway in mouse hippocampus.",
