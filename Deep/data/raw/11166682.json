     "AB": "This study provides an analysis of the chemoarchitecture of the posterior hypothalamic area (PHA) and a retrograde transport analysis of inputs to the PHA in the rat. The chemoarchitectural analysis reveals that the majority of PHA neurons contain glutamate. Hypocretin, melanin concentrating hormone, tyrosine hydroxylase, neuropeptide Y and gamma-aminobutyric acid are also found in subsets of PHA neurons, and fibers immunoreactive for these substances as well as for serotonin, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and met-enkephalin are observed in the area and aid in the delineation of its borders. The retrograde tracing study demonstrates that the PHA receives input from multiple, diverse neuron populations. Descending projections to the PHA arise from the limbic forebrain (cingulate cortex and lateral septum) and both the medial and lateral hypothalamus. Subcortical visual nuclei, including the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and intergeniculate leaflet, pretectal area, and superior colliculus, and the subthalamus (zona incerta, fields of Forel) also project to the PHA. Ascending projections to the PHA arise from brainstem cholinergic nuclei, the reticular formation, midbrain raphe nuclei, periaqueductal gray and parabrachial nucleus. Retrograde transport studies using the psuedorabies virus (PRV) demonstrate that the PHA receives input indirectly from the hippocampus, amygdala and suprachiasmatic nucleus through circuits including nuclei in the limbic forebrain and hypothalamus. These data suggest that the PHA is important in the neural control of behavioral state, modulating aspects of hippocampal, autonomic and cortical function as they relate to the elaboration of adaptive behavior.",
