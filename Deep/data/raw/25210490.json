     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The time course of cytokine dynamics after seizure remains controversial. Here we evaluated the changes in the levels and sites of interleukin (IL)-1beta expression over time in the hippocampus after seizure. METHODS: Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in adult Wistar rats by means of intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA). Subsequently, the time courses of cellular localization and IL-1beta concentration in the hippocampus were evaluated by means of immunohistochemical and quantitative assays. RESULTS: On day 1 after SE, CA3 pyramidal cells showed degeneration and increased IL-1beta expression. In the chronic phase (>7 days after SE), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive reactive astrocytes-appeared in CA1 and became IL-1beta immunoreactive. Their IL-1beta immunoreactivity increased in proportion to the progressive hypertrophy of astrocytes that led to gliosis. Quantitative analysis showed that hippocampal IL-1beta concentration progressively increased during the acute and chronic phases. CONCLUSION: IL-1beta affects the hippocampus after SE. In the acute phase, the main cells expressing IL-1beta were CA3 pyramidal cells. In the chronic phase, the main cells expressing IL-1beta were reactive astrocytes in CA1.",
