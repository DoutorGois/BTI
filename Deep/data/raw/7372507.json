     "AB": "The fate of ATP exposed to rat hippocampal extracts was investigated after their separation by a microdisc electrophoresis tenhnique. It could be demonstrated that the histochemical adenylate cyclase procedure using ATP as substrate is not suitable for specific localization of the enzyme, since other ATP hydrolysing enzymes were also able to convert ATP unless the concentrations of inhibitors reached 1 mM (ouabain) and 40 mM (NaF). With a prolonged incubation time of 18 h further substrate splitting protein zones could be revealed, possibly reflecting activities of enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of degradation products of ATP.",
