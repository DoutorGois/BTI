     "AB": "Delayed neuronal death was produced in the CA1 area of the hippocampus following 5 min of forebrain ischemia in adult gerbils. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-x was examined in control (age-matched, non-operated and sham-operated) and ischemic gerbils. Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was low in CA1 neurons, but Bax was highly expressed in CA1 neurons of control gerbils. Moderate Bcl-x immunoreactivity was observed in control CA1 neurons. Strong Bcl-2 and Bcl-x immunoreactivity was found in CA1 neurons following ischemia. Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-x were localized in dying cells, thus suggesting that expression of Bcl-2 was not sufficient to prevent nerve cells from dying. Although the Bcl-x antibody does not discriminate between Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS content in tissue sections, Western blots disclosed a marked increase in the intensity of the band corresponding to Bcl-xS, but not of the band corresponding to Bcl-xL in ischemic hippocampi, thus indicating that the increase in Bcl-xS is associated with delayed cell death following transient forebrain ischemia in the adult gerbil.",
