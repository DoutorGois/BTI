     "AB": "Protein resynthesis was studied in CNS structures of rats sensitized with antigens from different regions of the allogenous brain. There was an activation of 35S-methionine incorporation into brain proteins in accordance with the immunization antigen used, and in proteins from other structures. Radiomethionine distribution in brain tissue remained unchanged. Potential mechanisms of protein resynthesis alteration during neurosensitization are discussed.",
