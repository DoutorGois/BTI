     "AB": "In this study we investigated iron deposition in the hippocampus CA1 area and the corpus striatum pars dorsolateralis in a rat model of cerebral ischemia and ischemic tolerance. Forebrain ischemia was induced by four-vessel occlusion for 5-min as ischemic preconditioning. Two days after the preconditioning or the sham operation, a second ischemia was induced for 20-min. With the use of iron histochemistry, regional changes were examined after 2 to 8 weeks of recirculation following the 20-min ischemia with or without preconditioning. Perl's reaction with DAB intensification demonstrated iron deposits in the CA1 area and in the corpus striatum pars dorsolateralis after 2 weeks of recirculation. These iron deposits gradually increased in density and formed clusters by the 8th week. When the rats were exposed to 5-min ischemia 2 days before lethal 20-min ischemia, the deposition of iron in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and also in the corpus striatum pars dorsolateralis was decreased and produced a minimal number of iron-containing cells between the second and the 8th week of recirculation. Preconditioning with sublethal 5-min ischemia followed by 2 days of reperfusion also prevented the neuronal destruction of the hippocampal CA1 region induced by 20-min ischemia.",
