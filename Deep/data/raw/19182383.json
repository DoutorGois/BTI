     "AB": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Anemarrhena asphodeloides BUNGE (AA) on cholinergic memory deficits in mice. This agent has previously been used as an antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and antidepressant in traditional Chinese medicine. Mangiferin was isolated from AA and showed a dose-dependent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity (IC(50) value, 62.8 microM). Cholinergic dysfunction was induced in mice by administering scopolamine, and the animals were then tested using the passive avoidance test as well as the Morris water maze test. Mangiferin (20 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reversed scopolamine-induced deficits in the passive avoidance test, and also improved escape latencies in training trials and increased swimming times in the Morris water maze test (p<0.05). Mangiferin also reduced acetylcholine and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels induced by scopolamine in mice brain (p<0.05) and inhibited nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation in scopolamine or TNF-alpha-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells. These results suggest that mangiferin can improve long-term cholinergic memory deficits by AChE inhibition or cholinergic receptor stimulation and inhibition of NF-kappaB activation.",
