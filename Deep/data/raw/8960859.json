     "AB": "Central administration of the N-type Ca2+ channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA in conscious rabbits has previously been shown to result in a slowly developing hypotensive and sympatholytic effect, with peak changes observed after 48 h. The aim of the current study was to examine the distribution of [125I] omega-conotoxin GVIA binding in rabbit brain alone or following a prior i.c.v. injection of omega-conotoxin GVIA to determine the site(s) of action of centrally administered omega-conotoxin GVIA. Brains were removed from rabbits 2 or 48 h after central administration of vehicle or non-labelled omega-conotoxin GVIA (30 pmol/kg, i.c.v.). Brain sections were then incubated with [125I] omega-conotoxin GVIA (50 pM) and the density of specific [125I] omega-conotoxin GVIA binding measured in dpm/mm2 was determined by quantitative receptor autoradiography. In the vehicle group, highest densities of [125I] omega-conotoxin GVIA binding sites (> 20 dpm/mm2) were detected in cortex, caudate, putamen, and the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum of the hippocampus. Prior (48 h) i.c.v. injection of omega-conotoxin GVIA resulted in a decrease in specific binding of [125I] omega-conotoxin GVIA, particularly in cortex and some portions of the caudate and hippocampus. Lesser effects were observed with a prior (2 h) i.c.v. injection of omega-conotoxin GVIA. Central administration of omega-conotoxin GVIA may be acting to disrupt neurotransmission in higher brain regions which may, in turn, affect cardiovascular control mechanisms in the rabbit.",
