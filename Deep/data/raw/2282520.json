     "AB": "The effect of an 8% casein and a control 25% casein diet on the granule cells in the dorsal blade of the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampal formation was studied at 30, 90 and 220 days of age. Female rats were fed either an 8% or 25% casein diet 5 weeks prior to conception and the litters were maintained on these respective diets until killed. In rapid-Golgi-impregnated cells, we measured major and minor axes of the soma of the dentate granule neurons, the number of spines on 50-microns segments of proximal, middle and terminal regions of the largest dendrite per granule cell and the number of dendrites intersecting 8 concentric rings 38 microns apart. At all 3 ages studied undernourished rats showed, when compared to controls, significant reductions of the major and minor axes of the somata and significant reductions in the number of spines on dendrites in the middle and terminal dendritic segments. Dendritic branching was significantly reduced in undernourished rats compared to controls in all but the 4th concentric rings, with the greatest effect being seen on the outer 3 concentric rings at 90 and 220 days of age. The location of the deficit in dendritic synaptic spines and the greatest deficit in dendritic branching correspond to the sites of termination of the lateral and medial perforant pathway projection to the dentate gyrus on the terminal and middle dendritic segments of the granule cells. The deficits noted in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus in this study were more severe than those found in our previous studies on the effect of the low protein diet in these same rats on visual cortical pyramidal cells and on the 3 cell types in the nucleus raphe dorsalis and nucleus locus coeruleus.",
