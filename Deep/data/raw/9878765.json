     "AB": "The present study examined the effects of ibotenic acid lesions of the ventral subiculum (SUB) on the ability of rats to memorize a rewarded alternation test in a T-maze. Results indicated that rats with ibotenic acid lesions (IL) of the ventral subiculum were impaired in postoperative acquisition of the spatial discrimination task, making more errors than the vehicle treated and normal control rats. In addition, all rats, including the IL group of rats, were able to memorize an acquired spatial behaviour. These findings suggest that the SUB play an important role in spatial information processing in rats.",
