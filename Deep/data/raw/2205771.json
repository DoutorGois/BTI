     "AB": "Global cerebral ischemia (four vessel model) was induced in renovascular hypertensive rats (two kidney, one clip model) chronically treated with intraperitoneal administration of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors, either captopril (100 mg/kg per day) or Wy-44,655 (10 mg/kg per day). Mortality following cerebral ischemia was higher in renovascular hypertensive rats than in normotensive controls. Reduction of blood pressure with captopril or Wy-44,655, lowered mortality. In surviving renovascular hypertensive and normotensive rats cerebral ischemia induced hyperactivity and lesions of the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Prolonged treatment with captopril--but not with Wy-44,655--reduced hyperactivity and the extent of the CA1 lesions. In conclusion, hypertension increases mortality following cerebral ischemia but does not affect the extent of brain injury in survivors. Prior treatment with converting enzyme inhibitors lowers mortality. Treatment with captopril attenuates brain injury in survivors.",
