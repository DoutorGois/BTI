     "AB": "beta-Site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)-the neuronal beta-secretase responsible for producing beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides-emerged as one of the key therapeutic targets of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although complete ablation of the BACE1 gene prevents Abeta formation, we reported that BACE1 knock-out mice display severe presynaptic deficits at mossy fiber (MF)-to-CA3 synapses in the hippocampus, a major locus of BACE1 expression. We also found that the deficits are likely due to abnormal presynaptic Ca(2+) regulation. Cholinergic system has been implicated in AD, in some cases involving Ca(2+)-permeable alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Here we report that brief application of nicotine, via alpha7-nAChRs, can restore MF long-term potentiation in BACE1 knock-outs. Our data suggest that activating alpha7-nAChRs can recover the presynaptic deficits in BACE1 knock-outs.",
