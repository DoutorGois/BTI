     "AB": "Brief elevation in postsynaptic calcium in hippocampal CA1 neurons leads to prolonged changes in synaptic strength. The calcium may enter the postsynaptic neuron via different routes, such as voltage-gated calcium channels or glutamate receptor channels of N-methyl-D-aspartate type, and/or be released from intracellular stores. The manner in which the synapse is altered, leading to the expression of an enhanced/depressed synaptic strength, is still unclear. The present study, performed using whole-cell recording from CA1 pyramidal cells of three- to five-week-old guinea-pigs, shows that postsynaptic depolarization alone, allowing for calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, leads to a synaptic potentiation characterized by an altered time-course of the evoked excitatory synaptic response, an unaltered coefficient of variation of that response and a decreased paired-pulse facilitation likely related to a postsynaptic mechanism. These characteristics contrasted with those of long-term potentiation induced via activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels, where the time-course was unaltered, the coefficient of variation was decreased and no change in paired-pulse facilitation was observed. Synapses can thus have mechanistically separate, but co-existent, potentiations of synaptic transmission initiated from separate sources for postsynaptic calcium.",
