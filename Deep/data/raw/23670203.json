     "AB": "Exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) is known to impair intelligence in children and cause neurobehavioral abnormalities in animals. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not clear. Lanthanum is often used to study the effects of REEs. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of lanthanum chloride (LaCl3) on spatial learning and memory and a possible underlying mechanism involving nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signalling pathway expression in the hippocampus. The rats were exposed to 0, 0.25, 0.50 or 1.00 % LaCl3 in drinking water during pregnancy and lactation (i.e. while feeding their offspring). After weaning, young rats continued to receive 0, 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 % LaCl3 in the drinking water for 1 month. LaCl3 exposure impaired the spatial learning and memory of young rats and significantly decreased the expression of phosphorylated IkappaB kinase complex, phosphorylated IkappaBalpha, NF-kappaB, c-fos, c-jun and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus. These results indicate that LaCl3 exposure impairs spatial learning and memory in rats by inhibiting NF-kappaB signalling pathway.",
