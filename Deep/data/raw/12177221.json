     "PG": "7264-71",
     "AB": "Methylphenidate (MP) (ritalin) is widely used in the treatment of children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but little is known about therapeutic mechanisms or about possible consequences of long-term exposure. To more closely simulate the clinical use of the drug, we orally administered MP to adolescent rats during the dark-active phase of the circadian cycle at doses (0.75-3.0 mg/kg) below threshold for locomotor activation. We found that doses in this range increased extracellular norepinephrine in hippocampus without affecting dopamine in nucleus accumbens. These results suggest that norepinephrine systems may play an important role in the therapeutic action of this drug. To examine one potential consequence of long-term exposure to MP, i.e., the development of locomotor sensitization, an adaptational change that has been implicated in drug abuse liability, animals received three daily oral administrations of these doses of MP for up to 4 weeks through adolescence. The animals were then challenged with methamphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). We found that the behavioral response to MP did not change during the course of chronic treatment and that MP-pretreated animals did not exhibit a sensitized locomotor response to the methamphetamine challenge. We propose that, to the extent that this treatment protocol more closely reflects clinical exposure patterns, the relative insensitivity of accumbens dopamine to the acute administration of these MP doses, and the corresponding absence of evidence for the development of locomotor sensitization, supports one clinical view that there is little abuse liability associated with low dose, long-term MP treatment.",
