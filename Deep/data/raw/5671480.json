The suspension was injected into a buffered 30 percent Ficoll, 58 percent sucrose discontinuous gradient previously loaded in the B XlV zonal rotor spinning at 3500 revolutions per minute. Intact neuronal perikarya were recovered as a discrete band in the dense sucrose zone of the gradient after centrifugation at 35,000 revolutions per minute for 45 minutes.",
