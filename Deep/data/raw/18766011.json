     "AB": "Neurogenesis occurs in two neurogenic regions of the adult mammalian brain: the subgranular zone and the subventricular zone. We have recently demonstrated that the number of bromodeoxyuridine-positive and doublecortin-positive cells is decreased in the subgranular zone of amyloid precursor protein with a Swedish mutation and presenilin-1 with a deletion of exon 9 transgenic mice, an animal model of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we characterized neurogenesis in the subventricular zone of amyloid precursor protein with a Swedish mutation and presenilin-1 with a deletion of exon 9 transgenic mice at 9 months of age and compared it with neurogenesis in the subgranular zone. In the subventricular zone, the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive and bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells were normal. In the subgranular zone, the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells was normal; however, the number of bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells was significantly decreased. These results suggest that neurogenesis, probably reflecting the survival of neural progenitor cells, differs between the subgranular zone and the subventricular zone.",
