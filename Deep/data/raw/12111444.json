     "AB": "The changes in extracellular acetylcholine levels were investigated by microdialysis in the cortex and hippocampus of aging rats after administration of metrifonate (80 mg/kg), rivastigmine (0.75 mg/kg), donepezil (1.5 mg/kg) or vehicle for 21 days (twice daily p.o.). Eighteen h after the last administration, cholinesterase inhibition was 85, 52 and 39% after metrifonate, rivastigmine and donepezil, respectively, and was accompanied by 988, 590 and 75% increase in cortical acetylcholine level. In the hippocampus, metrifonate and rivastigmine brought about a 169 and 108% increase in acetylcholine levels. A challenge dose of metrifonate, rivastigmine and donepezil was followed by a further increase in cortical and hippocampal acetylcholine levels. The retrograde perfusion of the M(2)-M(4) receptor antagonist AFDX-384 (10 microM) induced a 500 and 300% increase in cortical and hippocampal acetylcholine release, in control and rivastigmine-treated rats, respectively, no increase in metrifonate-treated rats, and a 210% increase in donepezil-treated rats. In conclusion, chronic treatment of aging rats with metrifonate, rivastigmine and donepezil induces a long-lasting increase in acetylcholine levels, and reveals marked differences between the three drugs.",
