     "AB": "In the rat hippocampus, bipolar non-pyramidal neurons in stratum radiatum and stratum oriens and multipolar neurons in stratum lacunosum-moleculare react for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) immunostaining, but pyramidal cells do not. Such bipolar VIP-like immunoreactive neurons in strata radiatum and oriens of regio superior were studied by electron microscopy for synaptic contacts with commissural afferents. The commissural fibers were identified by their anterograde degeneration induced by contralateral fimbria transections 2 days before sacrifice. Electron-dense degenerated boutons of commissural origin were found in synaptic contact with the cell bodies and dendrites of the VIP-like immunoreactive non-pyramidal cells.",
