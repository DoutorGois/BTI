     "AB": "Previously our laboratory has shown that 17beta-estradiol in vivo rapidly decreases R(+)-8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding (a measure of the initial biochemical event in the intracellular signaling pathway associated with 5-HT(1A) receptors) in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and amygdala. Studies were designed to determine if 17beta-estradiol also acts in vitro on estrogen receptors in the hippocampus and frontal cortex to decrease 5-HT(1A) receptor function. Hippocampus and frontal cortex were dissected from ovariectomized rats and incubated for up to 3 h with various estrogens and antiestrogens; membrane homogenates were prepared for R(+)-8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assays. 17beta-Estradiol (10(-6) M) decreased the maximal response in the R(+)-8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay in a time-dependent manner (observed at 30, 60 and 120 min) in both hippocampus and frontal cortex. The hormone, however, did not alter the EC(50) of R(+)-8-OH-DPAT. When hippocampus and frontal cortex were incubated in graded concentrations of 17beta-estradiol for 1 h, the calculated EC(50) was approximately 2.5 x 10(-8) M in both brain regions. The nonestradiol estrogen diethylstilbestrol also decreased 5-HT(1A) receptor function while the less potent estrogens 17alpha-estradiol and estriol were inactive at 5 x 10(-8) M. The estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 potently and completely blocked the effects of 17beta-estradiol on 5-HT(1A) receptor function with an apparent K(B) of approximately 10(-9) M. These data demonstrate clearly that estrogens can act on estrogen receptors located in hippocampus and frontal cortex of ovariectomized rats to produce rapid heterologous decreases in 5-HT(1A) receptor function.",
