     "AB": "An unexpected and novel finding is described and discussed here concerning the synaptic physiology of hippocampal slices during the period of recovery after brain dissection. Contrary to the common notion that the amplitude of synaptic responses recovers in a single exponential rising fashion, we found that synaptic response amplitude displayed an oscillatory pattern. The period of oscillation was of 6h and its frequency depended on the input frequency of stimulation. Based on these preliminary data we can make an assumption that the recovery-associated oscillatory behavior of synaptic responses may be hippocampus specific. These data suggest the existence of a previously undescribed element that modifies the electrical properties underlying the modulation of synaptic responses in a neuronal population. The article hypothesizes a mechanism for this phenomenon.",
