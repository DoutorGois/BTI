     "AB": "With the single exception of the occipital cortex, the flow of blood to most regions of the brains of conscious, unrestrained rats was reduced within 10 min after intravenous administration of alphaMSH. Though these effects were transitory for most regions of the brain, perfusion of cerebellum, pons and medulla, hippocampus, and parietal cortex was still significantly low by 20 min. Assuming that flow changes reflect functional changes, these early responses to alphaMSH suggest an explanation for the effects of this hormone in which visual learning is improved.",
