     "AB": "High concentration of phosphocreatine (P-creatine) was accumulated in the hippocampal slices incubated in the medium containing creatine. Electrophysiological study revealed that the accumulation of P-creatine in the slice not only prolonged the latency of the loss of the postsynaptic potential (PSP) during anoxia (deprivation of oxygen and glucose), but also enhanced the tolerance to the deprivation resulting in the complete recovery of the PSP. Biochemical study revealed that the P-creatine accumulation not only slowed down the rate of decrease of ATP during anoxia but facilitated the recovery of the high-energy phosphates during recovery. Thus the accumulation of P-creatine in the slices prolonged the survival time of the brain tissue during deprivation of O2 and glucose.",
