     "AB": "Adenosine (ADO) has been characterized as an endogenous anticonvulsant and alternative therapeutic drug, but its mechanism is not entirely clear. This study aimed to examine the relationship of ADO with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in a Wistar rat model of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced acute status epilepticus. ADO (200 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before PTZ (55-65 mg/kg) treatment, and Western blot assays and immunohistochemistry were performed 3 h after the onset of acute status epilepticus to detect phospho-TOR and the downstream target of mTOR, phospho-S6. The expression of these phosphoproteins in the hippocampus was significantly increased in PTZ-treated rats, but this increase was attenuated by the addition of ADO. To further verify a role for ADO in attenuating mTOR activity, we also evaluated its ability to suppress mTOR activity in normal rats that were not treated with PTZ. Our results suggest that ADO suppresses mTOR and S6 phosphorylation in normal rats and that this suppression can be reversed by the application of Compound C, an inhibitor of AMP-activated protein kinase, which functions as an upstream suppressor of the mTOR pathway. Thus, our results provide a novel antiepileptic mechanism for ADO in suppressing mTOR pathway activation upon PTZ-induced acute status epilepticus.",
