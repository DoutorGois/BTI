     "AB": "Steady potential (omega-potential) and infraslow oscillations of potentials within the 0.2-0.5 Hz range (zeta-waves) were simultaneously recorded in the hypothalamus, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, RF and cortex of the brain as well as in liver in chronic experiments on rabbits in resting, terminal state and in posthumous period. A compatibility of amplitude--temporal parameters of the processes under study was revealed in subcortical brain structures and in liver in resting state as well as their stability in repeated recordings at the same time on different days. Types of transitory processes were differentiated in the systems under study in crucial stages of terminal state. omega-potential and zeta-waves are shown as indices of state of cerebral structures and liver.",
