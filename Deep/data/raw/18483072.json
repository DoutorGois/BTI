     "AB": "Synaptic plasticity is the foundation of learning and memory. The protein kinase CK2 phosphorylates many proteins related to synaptic plasticity, but whether it is directly involved in it has not been clarified. Here, we examined the role of CK2 in synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices using the CK2 selective inhibitors 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) and 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB). These significantly inhibited N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). DRB also inhibited NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission, while leaving NMDA receptor-independent LTP unaffected. NMDA receptors thus appear to be the primary targets of CK2. Although both long-term depression (LTD) and LTP are induced by the influx of Ca(2+) through NMDA receptors, surprisingly, LTD was not affected by CK2 inhibitors. We postulated that the LTP-selective modulation by CK2 is due to selective modulation of NMDA receptors, and tested two hypotheses concerning the modulation of NMDA receptors: (i) CK2 selectively modulates NR2A subunits possibly related to LTP, but not NR2B subunits possibly related to LTD; and (ii) CK2 selectively affects synaptic but not extrasynaptic NMDA receptors whose activation is sufficient to induce LTD. DRB decreased NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in the presence of selective NR2A subunit antagonist. The former hypothesis thus appears unlikely to be correct. However, DRB decreased synaptic NMDA receptor responses in cultured hippocampal neurons without affecting extrasynaptic NMDA receptor current. These findings support the latter hypothesis, that CK2 selectively affects LTP by selective modification of synaptic NMDA receptors in a receptor-location-specific manner.",
