     "AB": "To test for the contribution of the parietal cortex and hippocampus to memory for allocentric spatial cues, the authors trained rats on a go/no-go task that required the rat to remember the distance between two visual cues. Total hippocampal lesions impaired working-memory representation for allocentric distance, whereas parietal cortex lesions resulted in only a transient impairment. In a second experiment, neither hippocampal nor parietal cortex lesions impaired allocentric distance discrimination. A third experiment showed that both the dorsal and ventral areas of the hippocampal formation must be destroyed to impair working memory for allocentric distance information. There appears to be a dissociation between the hippocampus and parietal cortex in mediating memory for allocentric distance information.",
