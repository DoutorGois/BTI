     "AB": "Memory encoding and retrieval were studied in a nonclinical sample of participants that differed in the amount of reported dissociative experiences (trait dissociation). Behavioral as well as functional imaging (fMRI) indices were used as convergent measures of memory functioning. In a deep vs. shallow encoding paradigm, the influence of dissociative style on elaborative and avoidant encoding was studied, respectively. Furthermore, affectively neutral and negative words were presented, to test whether the effects of dissociative tendencies on memory functioning depended on the affective valence of the stimulus material. Results showed that (a) deep encoding of negative vs. neutral stimuli was associated with higher levels of semantic elaboration in high than in low dissociators, as indicated by increased levels of activity in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex during encoding and higher memory performance during recognition, (b) high dissociators were generally characterized by higher levels of conscious recollection as indicated by increased activity of the hippocampus and posterior parietal areas during recognition, (c) nonclinical high dissociators were not characterized by an avoidant encoding style. These results support the notion that trait dissociation in healthy individuals is associated with high levels of elaborative encoding, resulting in high levels of conscious recollection. These abilities, in addition, seem to depend on the salience of the presented stimulus material.",
