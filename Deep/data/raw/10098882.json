     "AB": "The type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R1) is a Ca2+ channel protein that is expressed abundantly in the CNS, such as in the cerebellar Purkinje cells and hippocampus. We previously demonstrated that the box-I element, which is located -334 relative to the transcription initiation site of the mouse IP3R1 gene and includes an E-box consensus sequence, is involved in the up-regulation of such IP3R1 gene expression. Furthermore, the previous study also indicated that some CNS-related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors bind to the box-I and activate IP3R1 gene expression. In this study, we demonstrated that one of the CNS-related bHLH factors, neuronal differentiation factor (NeuroD)-related factor (NDRF), specifically bound to the box-I sequence with a ubiquitously expressed bHLH protein, E47, and activated IP3R1 gene expression. In situ hybridization of adult mouse brain revealed that IP3R1 and NDRF mRNA were co-expressed in many subsets of neurons, highly in Purkinje cells and hippocampus and moderately in cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, and caudate putamen. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal expression patterns of these two genes resembled one another throughout postnatal development of the mouse CNS. From these results, we suggest that NDRF is involved in the tissue-specific regulation of IP3R1 gene expression in the CNS.",
