     "AB": "Contextual fear conditioning involves forming a representation for the context and associating it with a shock, which were attributed by the prevailing view to functions of the hippocampus and amygdala, respectively. Yet our recent evidence suggested that both processes require integrity of the dorsal hippocampus (DH). In view of the DH involvement in uniting multiple stimuli into a configuration, this study examined whether the DH would integrate context and shock into a shocked-context representation. Male Wistar rats were trained on a two-phase training paradigm of contextual fear conditioning. They explored a novel context on the first day to acquire a contextual representation, and received a shock in that context on the second day to form the context-shock memory. Tests of conditioned freezing given on the following days revealed two properties of configural memory-direct and mediated pattern completion: First, the contextual fear memory was retrieved in a novel context by a cue embedded in the configural set-a shock that did not elicit significant freezing on its own. Second, freezing was also elicited in a novel context by a transportation chamber that was not directly paired with the shock but could activate the fear memory inferentially. The effects were specific to the cue and not due to context generalization. Infusion of lidocaine into the DH, but not the amygdala, immediately after context-shock training impaired conditioned freezing elicited through either type of pattern completion. Our data suggest that the DH in contextual fear conditioning associates context and shock in parallel with the amygdala by incorporating the shock into an otherwise neutral context representation and turning it into a shocked-context representation.
