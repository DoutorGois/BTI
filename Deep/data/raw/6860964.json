     "AB": "The cholinergic and adrenergic afferents innervating the hippocampal formation in the rat reach the target region via three distinctly separate routes, two dorsal and one ventral one. Partial deafferentation of the hippocampus obtained by destruction of the dorsal routes (through the fimbria-fornix and the supracallosal striae) resulted in removal of 90% and 60% of the cholinergic and adrenergic innervations, respectively, within one month. By 6-10 months after lesion, the remaining cholinergic and adrenergic inputs, reaching the target via the ventral route, had expanded more than two-fold, resulting in a significant recovery in the original cholinergic and adrenergic innervation patterns. Because of its slow and protracted time-course and its ability to re-establish innervation also in initially denervated areas, this compensatory collateral sprouting phenomenon may be of particular interest for the understanding of the long-term, protracted functional recovery that is seen both after experimental brain lesions as well as in patients with severe brain injuries.",
