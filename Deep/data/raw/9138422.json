     "AB": "Primary cultures enriched in neurons dissociated from embryonic rat cerebral cortex, cerebellum, or hippocampus were treated in a chemically defined serum-free media with either vehicle, dodecylglycerol (DDG, 3 microM), or glutamate (75 microM), or preincubated with DDG for 4 or 24 h, and further incubated with glutamate. Their morphological and biochemical assessments (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] release in the culture media, neuronal viability and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization) were made. Neurotoxic effects of glutamate and glutamate-mediated increases in intracellular Ca2+ were maximal in neurons from cerebellum and minimal in neurons from cortex. Cotreatment of cells with DDG and glutamate failed to provide significant neuronal protection against glutamate in the three brain regions. Pretreatment of cells with DDG for 4 or 24 h prior to glutamate treatment provided significant neuroprotection as judged by morphological changes and a decrease in LDH activity. Neuroprotection of approximately 15-35% was observed following 4 h of DDG pretreatment, increasing to 60-85% protection after 24 h of DDG pretreatment. Although the mechanism of DDG's neuroprotective action remains to be elucidated, these results demonstrate that both glutamate and DDG have differential specificity for anatomical regions of the brain.",
