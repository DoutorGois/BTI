     "AB": "Rats were kindled by intraperitoneal injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) (30 mg/Kg) every 48 h. Once kindled, some of the animals received a single injection of cysteamine (200 mg/Kg). Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) and 125 I-Tyr11-somatostatin binding were measured in the frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus of the two experimental groups and the control rats. After PTZ kindling the following was observed: 1) SLI content was increased in the two areas; 2) Somatostatin receptor affinity decreased in the frontoparietal cortex and was unaltered in the hippocampus; 3) The number of somatostatin receptors decreased in the hippocampus and was unaltered in the frontoparietal cortex. Cysteamine, an agent which depletes brain somatostatin and suppresses kindled seizures in PTZ-treated rats, reversed the altered SLI levels and binding in these rats.",
