     "AB": "Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is a common subtype of temporal lobe epilepsy. Its most common cause is hippocampal sclerosis, which contributes to its distinct electroclinical phenotype that is seen commonly in the epilepsy monitoring unit setting. The common electrophysiological data show anterior temporal interictal sharp waves as well as rhythmic theta activity in the same localization. While the electrophysiological data can at times be misleading, its stereotyped and characteristic semiology can often allow for accurate diagnosis on its own. As patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy often fail medical therapy, surgical therapy can be considered. Early accurate diagnosis in these patients is essential for optimal care.",
