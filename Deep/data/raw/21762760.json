     "AB": "Preterm infants undergo several painful procedures during their stay in neonatal intensive care units. Previous studies suggest that early painful experiences may have an impact on brain development. Here, we used an animal model to investigate the effect of neonatal pain on the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus. Rat pups received intraplantar injections of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), a painful inflammatory agent, on either P1 or P8 and were sacrificed on P22. We found that rat pups injected with CFA on P8 had more BrdU-labeled cells and a higher density of cells expressing doublecortin (DCX) in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. No change in BrdU-labeling or DCX expression was observed in pups injected with CFA on P1. These findings indicate that neonatal pain can increase hippocampal neurogenesis, suggesting that early painful experiences may shape brain development and thereby influence behavioral outcome.",
