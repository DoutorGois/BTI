     "AB": "The diagnosis of combined Pick's and Alzheimer's disease is rare, and over the years different authors have used different criteria to arrive at such a diagnosis. A case is reported of presenile dementia in which the histological changes of Pick's disease and Alzheimer's disease were mingled. The brain showed no focal atrophy, but the Pick changes were most numerous in the hippocampus and in the temporal lobe. An antibody against the 155 kilodalton component of neurofilaments demonstrated not only neurofibrillary tangles and components of senile plaques, but also Pick's inclusions.",
