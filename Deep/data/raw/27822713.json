     "AB": "Elevated levels of glucocorticoid, a steroid hormone released in response to stress, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetes, which is now known to extend its effect on brain functions. Hence, we aimed to investigate the status of brain insulin signaling in response to dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) treatment in female Charles Foster rat. This model exhibited pronounced hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance with loss in appetite and body weight. Immunoblotting of insulin receptor (INSR)-PI3kinase-AKT demonstrated reduced insulin signaling in hypothalamus but no change in hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum in dexamethasone-treated rats as compared to vehicle-treated rats, signifying the diversity of distribution and function of insulin in different brain regions. These results also correlated with appetite change, a key function governed by hypothalamus. Hence, we further explored the hypothalamic feeding circuit and found altered levels of neuropeptide genes (Agrp, Npy, Pomc) and candidate nutrient sensors (GLUT1, SirT1, and PPARgamma). There was also a considerable reduction in glycogen content and appetite-regulating neurotransmitters (GABA, glutamate, dopamine) in dexamethasone-treated rats. Thus, concluding that dexamethasone not only induces peripheral insulin resistance but also impairs hypothalamic function of appetite regulation via the interwoven cascade of insulin signaling, neurotransmitters, and neuropeptides. Graphical Abstract Reduced insulin signaling as well as elevated glucocorticoid levels in hypothalamus modulates the key appetite regulating neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, and nutrient sensors resulting into reduced appetite and bodyweight.",
