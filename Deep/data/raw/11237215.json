     "AB": "The pancreas is essential for digestion and glucose homeostasis. Diseases associated with the pancreas (e.g., pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, diabetes) are generally debilitating for the patient. Diabetes is particularly prominent in the United States, affecting nearly 6 percent of the population, with associated annual health costs in the billions of dollars. Pancreas development is a complex process that requires the timely expression of numerous factors. Among them, a basic Helix-Loop-Helix factor, BETA2, was shown to be important for terminal differentiation of islet cells including insulin- and glucagon-producing cells. Expression studies demonstrated the presence of BETA2 in islet cells and specific neurons. Targeted deletion of the BETA2 gene in mice revealed its significance in pancreas development. In addition, BETA2 is important in granule cell development of the hippocampus and cerebellum. This chapter will focus on the role of BETA2 in pancreas physiology, neuronal development, and its molecular biology.",
