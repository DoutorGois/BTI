     "AB": "The effects of 8-phenyltheophylline (8PT) were studied on coronal slices of rat hippocampus. 8PT was more potent than theophylline in enhancing the pyramidal cell responses evoked by stimulation of the stratum radiatum. 8PT dose dependently antagonized the depression of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials induced by cyclohexyladenosine and did not change the amplitude of antidromically evoked responses of pyramidal cells. These findings suggest that 8PT is a potentially powerful tool for studying adenosine neuromodulation in the CNS.",
