     "AB": "The behavioural and electrocortical effects of alpha-methylornithine and alpha-difluoromethylornithine, two ornithine decarboxylase inhibitors, were evaluated after their infusion into several areas of the brain in the rat. Both compounds induced, in dose-dependent manner, similar epileptogenic effects, stereotyped behaviour and postural asymmetry, depending upon the site of injection. Unilateral injection of DFMO into the entopeduncular nucleus or the substantia nigra pars reticulata, caused an increase in locomotor activity. Unilateral injection of DFMO into the caudate nucleus or the substantia nigra pars compacta had no effect on locomotor activity. Among the areas of the brain studied, the most sensitive site from which electrocortical epileptogenic disorders were evoked, was the hippocampus. The GABA agonist muscimol, infused prior to DFMO, resulted in an anticonvulsant action, while DFMO, infused prior to putrescine, increased the convulsant properties of putrescine. In conclusion, these results indicate that DFMO and alpha-methylornithine produced epileptogenic effects after their intracerebral infusion and suggest that may act as analogues of putrescine.",
