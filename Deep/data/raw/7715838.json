     "AB": "Three different GABA-insensitive Cl- channels could be resolved in cultured hippocampal neurons using the inside-out patch clamp configuration. The most commonly observed channel revealed an inward rectification with a chord conductance of 40 pS in symmetrical Cl- solutions at a membrane potential of -50 mV and had voltage sensitive gating kinetics. Channel openings were not observed in cell-attached patch, and after excision, several minutes of perfusion of the cytoplasmic side were required before detecting the first openings. The open state probability was increased by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP-gamma-S 10(-4) M) and reduced by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiophosphate) (GDP-beta-S 10(-4) M) suggesting its regulation by G proteins. This new identified chloride channel may account for the previously described voltage-sensitive, inward-rectifying whole cell Cl- current which was enhanced by adenosine in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner.",
