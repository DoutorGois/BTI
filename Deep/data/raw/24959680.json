     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to examine the application of the coordinated cis-[Cr(C2O4)(pm)(OH)2]+ cation where pm denotes pyridoxamine, as a specific sensing ion for the detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The proposed method for H2O2 detection includes two key steps. The first step is based on the nonenzymatic decarboxylation of pyruvate upon reaction with H2O2, while the second step is based on the interaction of cis-[Cr(C2O4)(pm)(OH2)2]+ with the CO2 released in the previous step. Using this method H2O2 generated during glutamate-induced oxidative stress was detected in HT22 hippocampal cells. The coordination ion cis-[Cr(C2O4)(pm)(OH2)2]+ and the spectrophotometric stopped-flow technique were applied to determine the CO2 concentration in cell lysates, supernatants and cell-free culture medium. Prior to CO2 assessment pyruvate was added to all samples studied. Pyruvate reacts with H2O2 with 1:1 stoichiometry, and consequently the amount of CO2 released in this reaction is equivalent to the amount of H2O2.",
