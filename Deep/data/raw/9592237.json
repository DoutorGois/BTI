In the present studies, Rg1 was found to selectively enhance the deteriorated immune function in aged animals, ameliorate age-related alterations in both behavior and motor response, promote hippocampal neuronal function of aged rats, and provide partial protection against the excitotoxic effect of glutamate. All of these provide several aspects of explanation to elucidate Rg1's anti-aging and nootropic mechanisms.",
