     "AB": "The effects of flunarizine on local cerebral blood flow, cortical energy metabolism and neuronal necrosis were evaluated in a rat model of forebrain ischemia. The application of flunarizine (2 X 40 mg/kg p.o.) at 24 and 4 h before ischemia accelerated the restoration of cortical high-energy phosphates during early post-ischemic recirculation and also increased the flow in cortical but not in hippocampal areas. Neuronal necrosis was reduced in the hippocampal CA 1 sector but unchanged in the cortex. It is concluded that flunarizine reduces ischemic damage mainly via a direct effect on brain tissue.",
