     "AB": "Estrogen and androgen are synthesized from cholesterol locally in hippocampal neurons of adult animals. These neurosteroids are synthesized by cytochrome P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) and 5alpha-reductase. The expression levels of enzymes are as low as 1/200-1/50,000 of those in endocrine organs, however these numbers are high enough for local synthesis. Localization of P450(17alpha), P450arom, 17beta-HSD and 5alpha-reductase is observed in principal glutamatergic neurons in CA1, CA3 and the dendate gyrus. Several nanomolar levels of estrogen and androgen are observed in the hippocampus. Estrogen modulates memory-related synaptic plasticity not only slowly but also rapidly in the hippocampus. Rapid action of 17beta-estradiol via membrane receptors is demonstrated for spinogenesis and long-term depression (LTD). The enhancement of LTD by 1-10nM estradiol occurs within 1 h. The density of spine is increased in CA1 pyramidal neurons within 2h after application of estradiol. The density of spine-like structure is, however, decreased by estradiol in CA3 pyramidal neurons. ERalpha, but not ERbeta, induces the same enhancement/suppression effects on both spinogenesis and LTD.",
