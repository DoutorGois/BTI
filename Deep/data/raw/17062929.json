     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Baisong tablets on the nerve-biochemistry and neuroendocrine of chronic mild unpredicted stress depression in rats. METHODS: Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to 4 groups: a normal control (NC), a model control (MC), a fluoxetine control (FC) and a Baisong tablet treatment group (BST). All rats except the control group were singly housed and exposed to an unpredicted sequence of mild stressor. The levels of serotonin (5-HT), glutamate (Glu) and gama-aminobutyric acid (GABA) of the hippocampus were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentration of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT) in the plasma of the rats were detected by radio-immunity. The CRHmRNA expressions in the hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex were semiquantified by RT-PCR method. The differences of BDNF and TrkB protein expression in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal and dentate gyrus granule cells layers of hippocampus were investigated with immunohistochemistry technique. RESULTS: In comparison with NC group, the levels of 5-HT, and GABA of the hippocampus in MC rats reduced significantly (P<0.01), and the concentration of CRH, ACTH, and CORT of the plasma and the level of Glu of the hippocampus and CRH mRNA expression in the brain increased significantly. Fluoxetine or Baisong could significantly regulate the abnormal changes of all the above. CONCLUSION: Chronic mild unpredicted stress can affect neuroendoerine and cause depression, and Baisong tablet has antagonism against it.",
