     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) on synaptic ultrastructure and the synaptophysin expression (p38) in hippocampal CA3 after hypoxia-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) in neonatal rats. METHODS: The rat model of HIBD was made by the method of Bjelke and divided randomly into two groups (n = 10)--HIBD group and HBO-treated HIBD group. Another 20 rats underwent sham-operation and were also divided randomly into HBO-treated control group and the control group. After 24 h of the operation, the rats of the HBO-treated groups received HBO (2ATA, 1 h/d) for 14 days. When rats were 4 weeks old, the learning-memory ability of rats in every group was evaluated through water-maze test. Their hippocampal ultrastructure was observed with electron microscope and the p38 expression was detected immunohistochemically. RESULTS: Compared with the control group [(10.6 +/- 3.4) times], the water-maze learning ability of the rats in HIBD group [(15.5 +/- 4.9) times] was significantly decreased (P < 0.01), while the learning-memory ability of the HBO-treated HIBD group [(11.3 +/- 2.6) times] was significantly improved. There was no significant difference in the water-maze test between the HBO-treated HIBD group and the control group (P > 0.05). Compared with the control group, the ultrastructure of pyramidal neuron of hippocampal CA3 was distorted in HIBD group under the electron microscope. Compared with that in HBO-treated HIBD group (0.77 +/- 0.17, 0.67 +/- 0.16, 0.46 +/- 0.13, 0.86 +/- 0.14) and the control group (0.82 +/- 0.16, 0.70 +/- 0.16, 0.53 +/- 0.15, 0.91 +/- 0.17), the corrected optical densities (COD) of immunoreactive products of the hippocampal CA3 p38 were significantly decreased in HIBD group (0.41 +/- 0.19, 0.21 +/- 0.11, 0.08 +/- 0.03, 0.38 +/- 0.16) (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in either ultrastructure or immunohistochemically reactive COD of p38 between the HBO-treated HIBD group and the control group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Underlying the induction of synaptic plasticity and reducing the ultrastructural damage may be involved in the mechanism of HBO in the brain rehabilitation in perinatal brain damage with hypoxia-ischemia.",
