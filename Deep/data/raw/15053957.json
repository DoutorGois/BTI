     "AB": "Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are important for hippocampal interneuron function. We used whole-cell recording and confocal imaging to characterize group I mGluR actions in CA1 oriens/alveus interneurons in slices. In tetrodotoxin and ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, the group I mGluR specific agonist DHPG increased intradendritic Ca(2+) levels and depolarized interneurons, whereas the group II mGluR specific agonist DCG-IV and the group III mGluR specific agonist L-AP4 did not. DHPG-induced depolarizing and Ca(2+) responses were antagonized by the group I mGluR antagonist 4CPG, but only Ca(2+) responses were significantly inhibited by the mGluR1 antagonist CPCCOEt. DHPG-induced depolarizing responses were not blocked by the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptor inhibitor heparin, the protein kinase C (PKC) antagonists GF-109203X, or the inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC) U73122. Thus, these responses to DHPG may not be transduced by the PLC-->IP(3)/diacylglycerol (DAG) pathway classically linked to group I mGluRs. DHPG-induced depolarizations were not blocked by intracellular GDP beta S or bath-application of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), suggesting the involvement of a G protein-independent pathway. Our findings indicate that group I mGluRs induce a depolarization of oriens/alveus interneurons via a G protein-independent mechanism different from their classic signalling pathway. Since depolarizations are associated with intracellular Ca(2+) rises, these actions may be important for their synaptic plasticity and vulnerability to excitotoxicity.",
