     "AB": "We have previously shown that voluntary wheel running activity in mice is associated with an increase in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Unfolded Protein stress response in multiple regions of the brain. Mice that are given access to running wheels show large variations in individual running activity. In contrast, when food is placed on the lid of their cages, rather than within the cage, all mice must undertake significant physical activity in order to gain access to their food. Hence we investigated the effects of food location on food intake and growth of C57BL/6 mice and on the activity of the ER stress system in the brain as reflected in the expression of two marker genes, Xbp1 and Atf6. Mice that had food in cups within their cages and allowed access to running wheels showed the anticipated changes in food intake, body weight and ER stress in the hippocampus compared to mice with no access to running wheels. Locating the food on the lid had no effect on food intake but reduced weight gain significantly. Likewise, locating food on the lid increased the expression of both Xbp1 and Atf6 in the hippocampi in the absence of any running wheel activity. Voluntary wheel running activity was reduced in mice whose food was located on the cage lid and this running actually reduced the expression of the two marker ER stress genes. We conclude that the usual practice of providing food for mice on their cage lids provides a significant level of physical activity that alters the metabolic status and increases ER stress. As such, this may not be the optimal model for the majority of mouse studies that are reported in the literature and it may significantly alter the interpretation of the effect of wheel running activity on ER stress. The differential effects of food location on hippocampal Bdnf gene expression also suggest that BDNF does not directly regulate UPR activity but may be coordinately regulated in response to running activity.",
