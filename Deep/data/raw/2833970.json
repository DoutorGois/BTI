     "AB": "1. The effects of chronic oral administration of desmethylimipramine (DMI) or zimelidine (1.25 and 5 mg kg-1 twice daily for 21 days) were studied on rat whole cortical gamma-aminobutyric acidB (GABAB) binding sites. No changes in receptor affinity or number were found with either drug. 2. A subsequent study of GABAB binding sites using higher doses of these drugs (5 and 10 mg kg-1) and rat frontal cortex was also without effect, when investigated 24 h after termination of drug administration or 72 h after DMI administration (5 mg kg-1). 3. The number of frontal cortical 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2) binding sites was significantly and dose-dependently decreased after both drugs, whereas the number of hippocampal 5-HT2 binding sites was not significantly altered after either drug. 4. As the number of frontal cortical GABAB binding sites was unaltered whereas the number of 5-HT2 binding sites was significantly decreased under identical study conditions, it may be concluded that the effects of antidepressant administration upon GABAB binding sites is a less consistent observation than their effects on 5-HT2 binding sites.",
