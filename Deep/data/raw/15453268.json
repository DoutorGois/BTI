     "AB": "The effect of diazepam on NO-mediated cGMP synthesis was studied in rat brain slices. It was found that diazepam dose-dependently decreased cGMP synthesis in cerebellar slices, with an inhibition of 90% at 1 mM diazepam. cGMP levels in the presence of diazepam were not restored to control levels by the addition of 0.1 mM sodium nitroprusside, whereas the decrease in cerebellar cGMP levels induced by 0.1 mM L-NAME was restored by the simultaneous application of NO-donors. In addition to the decrease of cGMP levels in neuronal structures induced by 1 mM diazepam, we observed increased cGMP immunoreactivity in glial cells in the cerebellum, the hippocampus, and the cerebral cortex. The significance of this observation is discussed.",
