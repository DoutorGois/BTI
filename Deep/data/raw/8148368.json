     "AB": "Repeated treatment with fluoxetine and citalopram, which are potent 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, resulted in different regulation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors in the rat brain. Their effects were compared with those of other antidepressants: imipramine, mianserin and levoprotiline. The density of 5-HT1A receptors, labelled with [3H]8-OH-DPAT, in the rat hippocampus was enhanced after citalopram, imipramine, mianserin and levoprotiline, but not altered after fluoxetine administration. [3H]Ketanserin binding sites, which label 5-HT2 receptors, were increased after fluoxetine and levoprotiline, but decreased after citalopram, imipramine and mianserin in the rat cerebral cortex. Acute administration of fluoxetine, but not citalopram, resulted in a decreased density of 5-HT1A receptors. 5-HT2 receptors were not changed by acute administration of either fluoxetine or citalopram. The obtained results indicate that besides 5-HT reuptake inhibiting properties of both compounds, there may exist an additional mechanism(s) of their action, which leads to different regulation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors.",
