     "AB": "Morphine produces a state dependent learning. The hippocampus is involved in this kind of learning. Gap junctions (GJs) are involved in some of the effects of morphine and exist in different areas of the hippocampus. We investigated the effects of blocking GJ channels of the hippocampal CA1 area, by means of pre-test bilateral injection of carbenoxolone (CBX), on morphine state dependent learning, using a passive avoidance task. Post-training subcutaneous administrations of morphine (0.5, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg/kg) dose-dependently impaired memory retrieval. Pre-test administration of morphine (0.5, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg/kg) induced a state-dependent retrieval of the memory acquired under post-training morphine influence. Pre-test injections of CBX (25, 75 and 150 nM) dose dependently prevented memory retrieval by post-training (7.5 mg/kg) and pre-test (0.5, 2.5, 5, 7.5 mg/kg) injections of morphine. The results suggest that intercellular coupling via GJ channels of the hippocampal CA1 area modulates morphine state dependent learning.",
