     "AB": "Escitalopram (ES-CIT) is a widely used, highly specific antidepressant. Until now there has been very little evidence on how this drug under pathological conditions affects an important feature within the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders such as depression: the endogenous neurotrophins. By using a well-characterized rat model in which chronic stress induces depressive-like behavior, the levels of neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) were determined in representative brain regions and serum using a highly sensitive improved fluorometric two-site ELISA system. There was a significant increase of BDNF in the left and right cortices after stress treatment (twofold increase) that was reversed by application of ES-CIT. An ES-CIT-dependent NGF reduction in stressed rats was detectable in the right cortex only (P = 0.027). The left hippocampus revealed significantly higher amounts of BDNF (2.5-fold increase) protein than the right hippocampus. These interhemispheric differences were unrelated to stress or ES-CIT treatment in all animals. BDNF and NGF of the frontal cortex, cerebellum, and serum did not change between the study groups. There was a negative correlation between body weight and serum BDNF, independent of stress or ES-CIT treatment. In conclusion, BDNF and NGF show substantial changes in this rodent model of chronic social stress, which is susceptible to antidepressant treatment with ES-CIT and therefore may constitute a neurobiological correlate for the disease.",
