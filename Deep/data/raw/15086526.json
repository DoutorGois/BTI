     "AB": "We explored the effects of chronic alpha-linolenic acid dietary deficiency on serotoninergic neurotransmission. In vivo synaptic serotonin (5-HT) levels were studied in basal and pharmacologically stimulated conditions using intracerebral microdialysis in the hippocampus of awake 2-month-old rats. We also studied the effects of reversion of the deficient diet on fatty acid composition and serotoninergic neurotransmission. A balanced (control) diet was supplied to deficient rats at different stages of development, i.e. from birth, 7, 14 or 21 days of age. We demonstrated that chronic n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid dietary deficiency induced changes in the synaptic levels of 5-HT both in basal conditions and after pharmacological stimulation with fenfluramine. Higher levels of basal 5-HT release and lower levels of 5-HT-stimulated release were found in deficient than in control rats. These neurochemical modifications were reversed by supply of the balanced diet provided at birth or during the first 2 weeks of life through the maternal milk, whereas they persisted if the balanced diet was given from weaning (at 3 weeks of age). This suggests that provision of essential fatty acids is durably able to affect brain function and that this is related to the developmental stage during which the deficiency occurs.",
