     "AB": "We examined the role of the parahippocampal regions in humans during two types of verbal recognition process, i.e. delayed matching and non-matching, by measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using PET. The results showed differential activation of each parahippocampal region during verbal memory tasks in which the side activated shifted depending on the nature of the task employed; an increase in rCBF in the left parahippocampal gyrus was associated with retrieval strategy of non-matching, and an increase in rCBF in the right parahippocampal gyrus was associated with retrieval strategy of matching. We conclude that lateralized parahippocampal activation may depend on the type of response required.",
