     "AB": "The well-documented but little-understood failure of lengthy axonal regeneration after injury of the adult mammalian CNS may be caused by an insufficient availability of local growth-promoting factors. If so, identifying and supplying the missing factors may result in better central axonal regeneration. This hypothesis was tested in an adult rat CNS model in which peripheral nerve grafts were placed into a lesion cavity between the septum and hippocampal formation. Continuous infusion of nerve growth factor (NGF) into the dorsal hippocampal tissue dramatically enhanced and accelerated the regrowth and penetration of cholinergic axons into the hippocampal formation. Thus, NGF can overcome the apparent resistance of the hippocampal CNS tissue to cholinergic reinnervation.",
