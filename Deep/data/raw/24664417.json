     "AB": "Lithium (Li) and lamotrigine (LTG) have neuroprotective properties. However, the exact therapeutic mechanisms of these drugs have not been well understood. We investigated the antioxidant properties of Li (40 and 80 mg/kg/day) and LTG (20 and 40 mg/kg/day) in a rat model of global cerebral ischemia based on permanent bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries (BCAO). Nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GSH-R), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were measured as an indicator of oxidative-nitrosative stress in both prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus after 28 days of treatment. The spatial learning disability was also assessed at the end of the study by Morris water maze (MWM) test. All oxidative-nitrosative parameters were found to be higher in the groups under treatment than in sham. Both drugs caused a decrease in PFC NO and MDA elevation, meanwhile the increase in GSH, GSH-R, CAT and SOD levels was significantly more evident in treated groups. We also found higher PFC GSH-R and hippocampal SOD levels in BCAO + Li (80 mg/day) treated group when compared with BCAO + LTG 40 mg/day. MWM test data showed a similar increase in spatial learning ability in all groups under treatment. We found no other statistical difference in comparison of treated groups with different dosages. Our findings suggested that Li and LTG treatments may decrease spatial learning memory deficits accompanied by lower oxidative-nitrosative stress in global cerebral ischemia. Both drugs may have potential benefits for the treatment of vascular dementia in clinical practice.",
