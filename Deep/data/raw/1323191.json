     "AB": "The collector is an adaptive algorithm for pattern recognition. It proposes new in-line fully-automatic technique to learn and recognize effective patterns of input data stream. Evoked potentials (EP) were recorded by ADDA 100 KHz, 4 channels, and described by 200 points per each EP. The collector recognized different studies of conditioned response (CR) by patterns of EPs in amygdalar central nucleus. In dogs with implanted into the limbic structures concentric electrodes an instrumental CR was elaborated to electrical stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus. Generalization or transfer of this CR was tested by means of electrostimulation of amygdalar basal nucleus. The generalization in the first experiment took place approximately in 86% of cases, in the second one in 52% of cases. In the first experiment the amplitudes of initial negativity and of late positive waves were smaller than those in the second one and in the experiments before conditioning.",
