     "AB": "ABSTRACT: A combined composition of the extracted powders from Hippocampus kuda and Rhizoma Homalomenae together with honey in a form of medical pill (named as BRONAS) for the treatment of asthma has thoroughly been investigated under this study. BRONAS has shown its high anti-inflammatory effects and strong inhibition upon the pathogenesis of asthma. In comparison with other treatments without using BRONAS, the restoration of patients' health was improved by a factor of 2-3. CLINICAL TRIALS WITH ACTR NUMBER: ACTRN12612000766819.",
