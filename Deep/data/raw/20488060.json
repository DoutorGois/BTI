     "AB": "The effects of the GABA agonist, muscimol on [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding were examined in cerebellum and hippocampus regions proposed to contain different populations of benzodiazepine binding site subtypes. Quantitative analysis was made of the contribution of different components of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding by utilising the selective affinities of propyl ?-carboline-3-carboxylate for these sites. The influence of muscimol on each of these components was determined and the results provide clear evidence that GABA receptors interact with only some subtypes of benzodiazepine binding sites; for example, whilst the cerebellar site and the low affinity hippocampal site are influenced, the high affinity site in hippocampus appears to be quite unaffected.",
