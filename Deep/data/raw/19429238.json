     "AB": "Nanoparticles are small scale substances (<100 nm) used in biomedical applications, electronics, and energy production. Increased exposure to nanoparticles being produced in large-scale industry facilities elicits concerns for the toxicity of certain classes of nanoparticles. This study evaluated the effects of silver-25 nm (Ag-25) nanoparticles on gene expression in different regions of the mouse brain. Adult-male C57BL/6N mice were administered (i.p.) 100mg/kg, 500 mg/kg or 1,000 mg/kg Ag-25 and sacrificed after 24h. Regions from the brain were rapidly removed and dissected into caudate nucleus, frontal cortex and hippocampus. Total RNA was isolated from each of the three brain regions collected and real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed using Mouse Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Defense Arrays. Array data revealed the expression of genes varied in the caudate nucleus, frontal cortex and hippocampus of mice when treated with Ag-25. The data suggest that Ag-25 nanoparticles may produce neurotoxicity by generating free radical-induced oxidative stress and by altering gene expression, producing apoptosis and neurotoxicity.",
