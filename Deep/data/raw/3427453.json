     "AB": "The stability of long-term potentiation (LTP) elicited by a stimulation paradigm in which short high-frequency bursts of pulses were given in a 'theta' pattern (i.e. 5 bursts/s) was tested in a chronic recording study. Stimulation electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the Schaffer-commissural system while the recording electrode was placed in the apical dendritic field of the Ca1 zone of the hippocampus. Following 4 days of baseline testing, 'theta' stimulation was applied to one electrode for a total of 2 s (ten 30 ms bursts), after which testing was continued for 3 weeks or until the responses fell to below baseline levels. Data were collected from 25 animals and 3 types of results were obtained: (1) no LTP (n = 4), (2) LTP that decreased steadily from 24 h after high frequency stimulation onward (n = 4), and (3) LTP that was stable until recording was terminated or until the responses began a precipitous decrease to below baseline values (n = 17). The mean of the slopes of the curves relating degree of potentiation to days after 'theta' stimulation was less than 1%/day with a mean correlation coefficient of only 0.1 prior to the point at which the responses began their rapid decline. Control responses were unaffected by the induction of LTP in neighboring CA1 afferents and did not exhibit a reliable relationship with time. These results suggest that, for most rats, LTP elicited by theta pattern stimulation is stable until such time that stimulation-recording arrangements begin to deteriorate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
