     "AB": "In an attempt to study more precisely the glial cells involved in reactions following specific brain injuries, we tried to culture cells derived from surgically-lesioned rat brains or adult rat hippocampus previously treated with kainic acid, a convulsant which induces status epilepticus associated with structural modifications. We find that, contrary to cultures derived from normal adult rat brain, cultures from lesioned rat brains can survive and proliferate in vitro. Characterization of the cell types using double labeling with isolectin B4 for microglia and GFAP antisera for astrocytes shows that cultures from KA-treated adult rats consist of nearly 100% macrophagic-microglial cells, whereas those obtained from surgically-lesioned brains are composed of a mixed population of microglial cells and astrocytes. These models are proposed as suitable for the further study of microglial-neuronal interactions involved in brain damage and repair.",
