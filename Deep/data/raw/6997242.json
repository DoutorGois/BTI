     "AB": "An immunohistochemical assay for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) has been developed, validated by parallel radioimmunoassay and a series of tests with monoamines or related molecules, and applied to the detection of 5HT in rat brain sections. The procedure seems to be more sensitive and specific than the classical Falck-Hillarp technique. Among amines and related compounds tested, only 5-methoxytryptamine has been found to cross-react. 5HT-immunoreactive neurons and/or fibres have been observed in the spinal cord, brain stem, hypothalamic nuclei, epiphysis and subcommissural organ, thalamus, striatum, corpus callosum, amygdala, hippocampus, olfactory tubercle, and cerebral cortex.",
