     "AB": "We have considered how the neuronal network architecture of the hippocampus may enable it to act as an intermediate term buffer store for recent memories, and how information may be recalled from it to the cerebral cortex using modified synapses in back-projection pathways from the hippocampus to the cerebral cortex. The recalled information in the cerebral neocortex could then be used by the neocortex in the formation of long-term memories, which is severely impaired by damage to the hippocampus.",
