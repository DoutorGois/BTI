     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) has been used in cardiac surgery involving infant complex congenital heart disease and aortic dissection. DHCA carries a risk of neuronal apoptotic death in brain. Serum ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) level is elevated in a number of neurological diseases involving neuron injury and death. We studied the hypothesis that UCH-L1 may be a potential biomarker for DHCA-induced ischemic neuronal apoptosis. METHODS: Anesthetized piglets were used to perform cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). DHCA was induced for 1 hour followed by CPB rewarming. Blood samples were collected and serum UCH-L1 levels were measured. Neuron apoptosis and Bax and Bcl-2 proteins in hippocampus were examined. The relationship between neuron apoptosis and UCH-L1 level was determined by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and correlation analysis. RESULTS: DHCA resulted in marked neuronal apoptosis, significant increase in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio in hippocampus and UCH-L1 level elevations in serum (all P<0.05). Positive correlation was obtained between serum UCH-L1 level and the severity of neuron apoptosis (r= 0.78, P<0.01). By ROC, the area under the curve were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.74-0.99; P<0.01), 0.81 (95% CI: 0.81-0.96; P<0.05), 0.71 (95% CI: 0.47-0.92; P=0.11) for UCH-L1, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and Bax, respectively. Using a cut-off point of 0.25, the UCH-L1 predicted neuronal apoptosis with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 57%. CONCLUSION: Serum UCH-L1, as an easy and quick measurable biomarker, can predict neural apoptosis induced by DHCA. The elevation in UCH-L1 concentration is consistent with the severity of neural apoptosis following DHCA.",
