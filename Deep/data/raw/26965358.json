     "AB": "The probability that an individual will suffer from a major depressive episode is often considered to be influenced by risk factors such as gender, premature parental loss, exposure to pathogenic parental rearing, personality, a history of traumatic events, a previous history of major depression, low social support, recent stressful life events and difficulties and predisposing genetic influences. Although several studies suffer from methodological limitations, major depression (endogenous depression) is regarded as a multifactorial disorder and understanding its etiology requires the rigorous integration of several risk factors.",
