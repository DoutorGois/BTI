     "AB": "The aim of this study was to examine the effects of amygdalohippocampal deep brain stimulation (AH-DBS) on cognitive functioning in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. The population consisted of 10 patients (7 men) who underwent ipsilateral (n=8) or bilateral (n=2) AH-DBS. Intellectual and neuropsychological evaluation was performed before and 6 months after initiation of AH-DBS. Group analyses revealed no overall pattern of change in cognitive measures, but improvement was seen in emotional well-being. Individual results varied over a broad spectrum ranging from no cognitive effects to negative effects on intelligence capacities, divided attention, and concept formation, to positive effects on speed of information processing and speed of finger movements. AH-DBS is a valuable treatment alternative for patients with refractory epilepsy that appears to have no major adverse neuropsychological consequences and enhances emotional well-being on the group level. Individual results are too diverse at this moment to allow viable interpretation. Additional studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.",
