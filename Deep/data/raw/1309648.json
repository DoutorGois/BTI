     "AB": "Recombinant human ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was infused for 2 weeks into the lateral ventricle of fimbria-fornix transected adult rats, and its effects were compared with those of purified mouse nerve growth factor (NGF). We provide evidence that CNTF can prevent degeneration and atrophy of almost all injured medial septum neurons (whereas NGF protects only the cholinergic ones). CNTF is also involved in up-regulation of immunostainable low affinity NGF receptor (LNGFR) in cholinergic medial septum and neostriatal neurons and in a population of lateral septum neurons. In contrast to NGF, CNTF did not stimulate choline acetyltransferase in the lesioned septum and normal neostriatum (pointing to different mechanisms for the regulation of choline acetyltransferase and LNGFR), cause hypertrophy of septal or neostriatal cholinergic neurons, or cause sprouting of LNGFR-positive (cholinergic) septal fibers.",
