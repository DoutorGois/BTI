     "AB": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Memory deficits due to multiple sclerosis (MS) have been variably linked to lower subcortical grey matter (SCGM) and mesial temporal lobe (MTL) volumes. We investigated which is the better predictor and whether this changes across disease stages. METHODS/RESULTS: Memory was assessed in 315 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measured volumes of total brain, grey matter, white matter, MTL (hippocampus, amygdala) and SCGM (thalamus, caudate). MTL predicted memory in the total sample and in patients with earlier (<10 years) or later (10 years) relapsing disease. SCGM (specifically thalamus) predicted memory in progressive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroanatomical correlates of memory deficits differ across disease stages.",
