     "AB": "The retrograde fluorescent tracers Fast Blue and Nuclear Yellow were injected into the intermediate part of the medial hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV) of the chick telencephalon. After the appropriate survival times, the brains were processed for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry using the thiocholine technique. In some telencephalic regions, fluorescent retrograde labelling and brown AChE reaction product were observed simultaneously in the same neurones by using a combination of ultraviolet and bright-field illumination. These AChE-positive afferents of IMHV arose from the hippocampus, septum, septal nuclei, hyperstriatum ventrale and neostriatum.",
