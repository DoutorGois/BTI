     "AB": "We propose a dynamic model for a system consisting of self-propelled agents in which the influence of an agent on another agent is weighted by geographical distance. A parameter alpha is introduced to adjust the influence: The smaller value of alpha means that the closer neighbors have a stronger influence on the moving direction. We find that there exists an optimal value of alpha leading to the highest degree of direction consensus. The value of optimal alpha increases as the system size increases, while it decreases as the absolute velocity, the sensing radius, and the noise amplitude increase.",
