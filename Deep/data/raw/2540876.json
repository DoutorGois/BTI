     "AB": "Argiotoxin 636, (AR636), a synaptic antagonist from orb weaver spider venom, is shown to produce reversible blockade of excitatory transmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the in vitro rat hippocampus. Microtopical application of AR636 (5-50 nM) resulted in a concentration-dependent suppression of the amplitude of the dendritic field EPSP recorded from stratum radiatum, and the amplitude of the population spike recorded from stratum pyramidale in response to stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals. The maximum effect of AR636 occurred at about 15-25 min. These effects were reversible after washing with toxin-free physiological solution with the rate of recovery having an inverse relationship to the concentration of AR636. In contrast to the effects observed with orthodromic stimulation, the amplitude of the antidromic spike was not affected by exposure to AR636. The temporal pattern of GABAergic paired-pulse inhibition was unaffected by exposure to AR636. Neuronal discharge elicited by pressure ejection of L-glutamate was abolished by AR636, whereas, responses to L-aspartate were not significantly affected. These data suggest that AR636 functions as a selective antagonist of glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission in rat hippocampus.",
