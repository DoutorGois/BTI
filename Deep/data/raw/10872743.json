     "AB": "Divalent metal ion transporter 1 (DMT1) is a recently identified metal-ion transporter that appears to mediate the absorption of iron in the intestine. DMT1 mRNA is also present in discrete areas of the brain. In this study, we examined the expression of DMT1 mRNA in developing rat brain. DMT1 mRNA was found by in situ hybridization in the striatum, cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. During development, DMT1 mRNA was found in Purkinje and granule cells in the cerebellum at post-natal day (PND) 14 and PND 30. DMT1 mRNA was also expressed in the external granular layer of the cerebellum at PND 14. No change in the level of DMT1 mRNA was observed by Northern analysis in the cerebellum at different ages between PND 1 and 21. DMT1 was found by Northern analysis in cultures of rat astrocytes. Activation of protein kinase C increased the expression of DMT1 in kidney epithelial cells but not astrocytes from newborn rats. Because DMT1 is expressed in a wide variety of types of cells, we suggest that it plays an important role in metal homeostasis in the brain.",
