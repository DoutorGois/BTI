     "AB": "We found a dramatic upregulation in the expression of LC3 in the hippocampus of rats upon status epilepticus (SE). However, the enhancement in LC3 expression might be caused by a reduction in lysosomal activity or by alterations in autophagosome-lysosome fusion leading to a cytosolic vesicular retention. In order to dissect this aspect, we monitored the spatial and temporal expression of LC3 and LAMP1 in the hippocampus of rats with SE. The Western blot analysis showed that the expression of LAMP1 was slightly increased in hippocampal cells at 6, 24, and 48 h post-SE. However, immunofluorescence analysis showed dramatic spatial changes in LAMP1 distribution within the hippocampus. LAMP1 in controls was localised only in cytosol as dot like staining, however at 24 h post-SE LAMP1 was not only highly expressed, but accumulated in mossy fibers of dentate gyrus. In parallel, we found few scattered LC3-positive-dots in neurites of dentate gyrus which co-localise with LAMP1-positive structures. We conclude that SE not only increased autophagosomal abundance, but also lysosomal activities and a massive accumulation of LAMP1 in axons of dentate gyrus. This could support the hypothesis that the marked increased autophagosomal abundance in cytosol reflects an increase in the autophagic activity more than an inhibition of autophagosomal clearance. Although LAMP1 may have contributed to cell damage in the selective vulnerable hippocampal CA1-subfield, it is also possible that lysosomal/autophagic mechanisms in mossy fibers were compensatory and reflected an attempt to survive the epileptic insult by breaking down non-essential components.",
