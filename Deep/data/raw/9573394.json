     "AB": "We investigated medial basal hypothalamic-preoptic area (MBH-POA) 5alpha-reductase and aromatase enzyme activities in gonadally intact and castrated adult Long-Evans (L-E) male rats treated with testosterone (T), progesterone (P), and a combination of T+P. MBH-POA 5alpha-reductase and aromatase activities did not differ significantly among the groups. The lack of a difference in MBH-POA aromatase between control and castrated L-E animals was unexpected. In two further experiments, MBH-POA aromatase was examined in intact and castrated L-E and Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats, using direct and indirect assays. The activity in castrated S-D (but again, not in L-E) rats significantly decreased compared to control values. These data suggest that the absence of gonads does not decrease MBH-POA aromatase in adult L-E rats.",
