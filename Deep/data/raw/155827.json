     "AB": "The existence of a synchronizing system generating theta (RSA) activity of an average frequency of 4 Hz has been demonstrated in the brain of the turtle Testudo Graeca. Three brain structures probably participate in the activity--the septum, amygdala and hippocampus. The septal region seems to play a leading role in this complex--lesions in this region abolished the generation of theta activity in 71% of experiments. This synchronizing system is functionally coupled with the olfactory generator of electrographic respiratory response (ERR), which is brought into activity by nasal air flow. This coupling can play a role in genesis of epileptic electrographic activities not only in the turtle, but also in phylogenetically higher species.",
