     "AB": "Xamoterol, a partial beta(1)-adrenergic receptor agonist, has been reported to impair the retrieval of hippocampus-dependent spatial reference memory in rats. In contrast, xamoterol restores memory retrieval in gene-targeted mice lacking norepinephrine (NE) and in a transgenic mouse model of Down syndrome in which NE levels are reduced. Restoration of retrieval by xamoterol in these two models complements the observation that NE and beta(1) signaling are required for hippocampus-dependent retrieval of contextual and spatial reference memory in wild-type mice and rats. Additional evidence indicates that cAMP-mediated PKA and Epac signaling are required for the retrieval of hippocampus-dependent memory. As a result, we hypothesized that xamoterol has effects in addition to the stimulation of beta(1) receptors that, at higher doses, act to counter the effects of beta(1) signaling. Here we report that xamoterol-induced disruption of memory retrieval depends on beta(2)-adrenergic receptor signaling. Interestingly, the impairment of memory retrieval by xamoterol is blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin, an uncoupling agent for G(i/o) signaling, suggesting that beta(2) signaling opposes beta(1) signaling during memory retrieval at the level of G protein and cAMP signaling. Finally, similar to the time-dependent roles for NE, beta(1), and cAMP signaling in hippocampus-dependent memory retrieval, xamoterol only impairs retrieval for several days after training, indicating that its effects are also limited by the age of the memory. We conclude that the disruption of memory retrieval by xamoterol is mediated by G(i/o)-coupled beta(2) signaling, which opposes the G(s)-coupled beta(1) signaling that is transiently required for hippocampus-dependent emotional memory retrieval.",
