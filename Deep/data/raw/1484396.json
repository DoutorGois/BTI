     "AB": "With a quantitative dot-immunobinding assay, the time course changes of neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) concentrations and total tissue content were monitored in the rat hippocampus after a 40 nmol NMDA injection. A biphasic alteration was observed; a decrease occurred at day 3, an increase at day 30. The time course of changes differed from that of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for reactive astroglial cell, but was similar to that for the markers of sprouting neurites, i.e., low (L) and high (H) molecular weight subunits of the neurofilament polypeptides. It is suggested that NCAM is implicated in the onset of neurite sprouting in the hippocampus after an excitotoxic trauma.",
