     "AB": "Ketamine, phencyclidine and MK801 are uncompetitive NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists which are used widely to model certain features of schizophrenia in rats. Systemic administration of NMDAR antagonists, in addition to provoking an increase in c-Fos expression, leads to important neurochemical and electrophysiological changes within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Since the mPFC is considered to exert a top-down regulatory control of subcortical brain regions, we examined the effects of local infusion of the NMDAR antagonist, MK801, into the mPFC on the expression of c-Fos protein (widely used marker of neuronal activation) in several subcortical structures. The experiment was performed on freely moving rats, bilaterally implanted with guide cannulae in the prelimbic mPFC, infused with MK801 or saline. Bilateral administration of MK801 to the mPFC produced changes in the behavior (increased stereotypy and decreased sleep-like behavior) and complex changes in c-Fos protein expression with significant increases observed in the nucleus accumbens (core and shell), amygdala (basolateral and central nuclei), the CA1 field of the hippocampus, and mediodorsal and paraventricular thalamic nuclei, as compared to the saline group. Together, we demonstrate that blockade of NMDA receptors in the mPFC is sufficient to lead to behavioral abnormalities and increased c-Fos expression in many, but not all, of the subcortical structures examined. Our findings suggest that some of the behavioral abnormalities produced by uncompetitive NMDAR antagonists may result from aberrant activity in cortico-subcortical pathways. These data support an increasing body of literature, suggesting that the mPFC is an important site mediating the effects of NMDAR antagonists.",
