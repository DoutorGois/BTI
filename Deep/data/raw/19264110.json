     "AB": "Peripheral and central diabetic neuropathies were studied in streptozotocin-diabetic rats, using behavioral, biochemical and electrophysiological techniques. Diabetic rats showed thermal hypoalgesia and decreasing motor nerve conduction velocity at 4 and 8 weeks of diabetes. In addition, amplitude of the evoked potential recorded in primary somatosensory cortex after stimulation of the sciatic nerve was markedly reduced at 8 weeks of diabetes. This decrease was accompanied by decreases in GluR2/3 AMPA receptor subunits. These changes seem to be specific to the somatosensory system and to originate in higher centers since they were not present in the hippocampus and were not observed at the level of gracilis nucleus. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) treatment reversed the reduced thermal sensitivity and peripheral nerve conduction velocity but did not reverse changes in the CNS, suggesting that once initiated, both anomalies may develop independently in this model of diabetic neuropathy. In conclusion, the results indicate that diabetes induces a wide spectrum of alterations in the central somatosensory system that are independent of the decreases in peripheral sensory transmission that could be responsible for the disturbances in somatosensory perception observed in diabetes.",
