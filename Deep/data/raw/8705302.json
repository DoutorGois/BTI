     "AB": "We studied the effects of trimethyltin (TMT) (9 mg/kg, p.o.) on the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-containing neurons in the rat hippocampus by NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry and a biochemical assay of NOS activity. TMT exposure caused the typical behavioral changes and a loss of the CA3/4 pyramidal cells, which were NADPH diaphorase-negative. The scattered interneurons and the CA1 pyramidal cells, which were NADPH diaphorase-positive, were spared. Hippocampal NOS activity showed no reduction in the TMT-treated rats compared with the controls. These results provide evidence of the preservation of the NOS-containing neurons in TMT intoxication.",
