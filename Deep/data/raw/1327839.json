     "AB": "Levels of mRNA for the alpha 1, gamma 2 and beta 1 subunits of the GABAA receptor complex were examined in rats maintained on a chronic, continuous schedule of exposure to the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142. The effect of chronic exposure to the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam was also examined on levels of gamma 2 subunit mRNA. FG 7142 (2 mg/ml of 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or vehicle (100% DMSO) was administered continuously for 8 days in the right ventricle via an osmotic minipump. At the end of the eighth day of exposure, the brain was removed and cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus were dissected and mRNA prepared from each region. Levels of GABAA alpha 1 and gamma 2 subunit mRNA were examined by Northern blot analysis with cDNA probes specific for these subunits. A significant increase in alpha 1 mRNA was measured in both cortex and hippocampus, but not in cerebellum, of rats chronically exposed to FG 7142 relative to vehicle-treated rats. A significant increase in gamma 2 subunit mRNA in cortex was also evident in drug-treated rats; however, no change in gamma 2 subunit mRNA was observed in either the hippocampus or cerebellum. Examination of GABAA beta 1 subunit mRNA by solution hybridization using a beta 1 riboprobe revealed no effect of chronic FG 7142 treatment on this subunit in either cortex, hippocampus or cerebellum. In rats chronically exposed to diazepam (21 days via silastic implants), levels of gamma 2 subunit mRNA were significantly decreased in cortex, but not changed in either hippocampus or cerebellum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
