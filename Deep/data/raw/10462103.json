     "AB": "We investigated the effects of basolateral amygdala (BLA) priming on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus (DG). In the control animals, the induction of high-frequency stimulation (HFS) to the perforant path (PP) resulted in hippocampal LTP at all the time intervals tested. A priming stimulation to the BLA prior to the application of HFS to the PP resulted in the enhancement of the excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP)-LTP and population spike (PS)-LTP in the DG from 90-min post-HFS onwards. These findings suggest that the amygdala has a potential role in the modulation of some aspects of memory that are mediated by the hippocampus.",
