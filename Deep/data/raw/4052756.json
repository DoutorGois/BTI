     "AB": "Nervous mutant mice and normal littermate controls explored a 4 X 4 hole matrix for 3 consecutive days. No difference was found between the groups for the following measures: total number of hole visits, visits to the center holes, and visits to contiguous holes or different holes. However, nervous mutants persevered more in visiting the same hole than controls. These results are discussed in terms of a possible role for the cerebellum in spatial working memory, similar to that suggested for the hippocampus.",
