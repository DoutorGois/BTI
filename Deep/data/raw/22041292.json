     "AB": "This study investigated the role of underlying pathology on memory function of children with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Memory was assessed in 44 children with TLE resulting from hippocampal sclerosis (HS) or dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours (DNT), and 22 control children. Delayed story and paired associate recall performance was significantly more impaired in children with HS compared to those with DNT, irrespective of the affected side. Semantic memory was impaired in both HS groups, and also in the left DNT group. These results suggest a role for type, and to a lesser extent, side of pathology in the memory profile of children with TLE.",
