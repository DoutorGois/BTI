     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of immunization with the fusion protein CAC (a product of prokaryotic expression of recombinant HBcAg and beta-amyloid peptide fusion gene) against the toxicity induced by intrahippocampal injection of aggregated beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in rats. METHODS: SD rats were immunized intraperitoneally with the fusion protein CAC, and the titer of anti-Abeta antibody was evaluated by ELISA. When the titers of the anti-Abeta antibody reached 1:3 000, aggregated Abeta was injected into the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. Two weeks after Abeta injection, the rats underwent morris water maze test before sacrificed to prepare the brain slices with Congo red and haematoxylin staining. RESULTS: The titer of anti-Abeta antibody reached 1:3 000 after 5 immunizations with the fusion protein. After Abeta injection, the saline-immunized rats showed a reduced cognitive behavior in the Morris water maze test compared to the CAC-immunized rats. In the saline-immunized rats, the neurons around the site of Abeta injection exhibited obvious cell damages with Abeta deposits and glial infiltration, whereas in CAC-immunized rats, Abeta deposits were significantly reduced or even absent. CONCLUSION: Immunization with the fusion protein CAC can inhibit the toxicity induced by intrahippocampal aggregated Abeta injection.",
