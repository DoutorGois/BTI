     "AB": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y1 and Y5 receptor subtypes mediate many of NPY's diverse actions in the central nervous system. The present studies use polyclonal antibodies directed against the Y1 and Y5 receptors to map and compare the relative distribution of these NPY receptor subtypes within the rat brain. Antibody specificity was assessed by using Western analysis, preadsorption of the antibody with peptide, and preimmune serum controls. Immunostaining for the Y1 and Y5 receptor subtypes was present throughout the rostral-caudal aspect of the brain with many regions expressing both subtypes: cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, amygdala, and brainstem. Further studies using double-label immunocytochemistry indicate that Y1R immunoreactivity (-ir) and Y5R-ir are colocalized in the cerebral cortex and caudate putamen. Y1 receptor ir was evident in the central amygdala, whereas both Y1- and Y5-immunoreactive cells and fibers were present in the basolateral amygdala. Corresponding with the physiology of NPY in the hypothalamus, both Y1R- and Y5R-ir was present within the paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic, arcuate nuclei, and lateral hypothalamus. In the PVN, Y5R-ir and Y1R-ir were detected in cells and fibers of the parvo- and magnocellular divisions. Intense immunostaining for these receptors was observed within the locus coeruleus, A1-5 and C1-3 nuclei, subnuclei of the trigeminal nerve and nucleus tractus solitarius. These data provide a detailed and comparative mapping of Y1 and Y5 receptor subtypes within cell bodies and nerve fibers in the brain which, together with physiological and electrophysiological studies, provide a better understanding of NPY neural circuitries.",
