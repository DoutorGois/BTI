     "AB": "Epilepsy and Parkinson's disease (PD) are common neurological disorders. Both epilepsy and PD are potentially progressive disabling diseases that can be treated with the established therapy of deep brain stimulation (DBS). The difference in therapy is target selection and stimulation parameter modulation. The anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) is chosen for intractable epilepsy and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is chosen for PD. Long-term stable symptom control of STN-DBS can be seen in PD patients while the positive effect of ANT-DBS can be observed in epilepsy patients. Experimental data and clinical evidence have been reported that indicate the neuroprotective property of STN-DBS could be found in PD patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that the neuroprotective benefits of ANT-DBS may be present in epilepsy patients.",
