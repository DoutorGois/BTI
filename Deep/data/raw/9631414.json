     "AB": "Quinoxalinediones such as NBQX are neuroprotective in most models of cerebral ischemia but their poor solubility results in nephrotoxicity limiting their clinical utility. We have investigated the neuroprotective effects of a water soluble AMPA receptor antagonist, YM872, using two in vitro models. The viability of cortical cultures exposed to 400 microM AMPA for 15 min (16.4 +/- 2.6%; n = 10) was significantly (p < 0.05) increased (84.7 +/- 4.6%; n = 6) with YM872 (10 microM) in a concentration-dependent manner. Evoked post-synaptic response amplitudes in oxygen-glucose deprived hippocampal slices treated with 10 microM YM872 (3.5 +/- 0.3 mV; n = 27) were significantly different from untreated deprived slices (0.3 +/- 0.1 mV; n = 31, p < 0.05) and the CA1 neurons appeared viable using a confocal live/dead fluorescence assay with confocal microscopy. The neuroprotection seen with YM872 in vitro warrants further investigation in vivo.",
