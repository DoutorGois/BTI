Three different types of L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitors (+)PN 200-110, a 1,4-dihydropyridine, (-)D888, a phenylalkylamine, and fluspirilene, a diphenylbutylpiperidine, were potent blockers of the convulsant-induced hyperexcitatory effects when they were administered preventively. D-AP5, a N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, was active on the 4-AP-induced seizures but was without effect on the MCD- and dendrotoxin-induced seizures.",
