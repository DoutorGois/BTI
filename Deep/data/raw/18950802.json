     "AB": "The objective of the present study was to evaluate the neurotoxic effects of lindane, in mice and the protective potential of two antioxidants alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and vitamin E, against the observed lindane induced toxicity. 7-8 weeks old healthy Swiss mice were administered acute doses of lindane (40 mg/kg b.w.) or antioxidants or both subcutaneously and analyzed 18 h later. ALA and vitamin E were used in the combination for neuroprotection in the concentration of 20 mg/kg b.w. and 50 mg/kg b.w. respectively. Lipid peroxidation, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and serotonin level were used as biochemical test of toxic action for lindane induced acute toxicity. Protective effects of ALA and vitamin E were also evaluated on the same parameters. Reduced glutathione (GSH) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) level served as an index for determining the extent of lipid peroxidation. Treatment of lindane to normal control animals resulted in a significant decrease and increase in GSH (P<0.01) and TBARS level (P<0.01) respectively in crude homogenate of whole brain. Antioxidants treatment significantly altered the level of GSH (P<0.01) and TBARS (P<0.01). GABA and serotonin level in whole brain as well as in different regions of brain were measured. Main brain regions under the investigation were olfactory lobe, cerebrum, hippocampus-hypothalamus, cerebellum and pons-medulla. Critical difference (CD) of GABA level in various groups was found significant at 1% in cerebrum and hippocampus-hypothalamus, at 5% in whole brain, cerebellum and pons-medulla (i.e. P<0.01 and P<0.05 respectively). Change in serotonin level in whole brain as well as in all studied brain regions of various groups was found significant at 1% CD (i.e. P<0.01).",
