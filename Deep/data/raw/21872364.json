     "AB": "The decline in cognitive function that accompanies normal aging has a negative impact on the quality of life of the elderly and their families. Studies in humans and rodents show that spatial navigation and other hippocampus-dependent functions are particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of aging. However, reduced motor activity and alterations in the stress response that accompany normal aging can hinder the ability to study certain cognitive behaviors in aged animals. In an attempt to circumvent these potential confounds, we used a hippocampus-dependent object-place recognition task to show that long-term spatial memory is impaired in aged mice. Aged animals performed similarly to young adult mice on an object recognition task that does not rely on hippocampal function.",
