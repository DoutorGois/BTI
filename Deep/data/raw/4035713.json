     "AB": "4-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) turnover was measured in mice 8 h after an acute injection of 1 g/kg of technical grade chlordane in corn oil. Significant decreases in GABA turnover were observed in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus after chlordane treatment. A smaller, though significant, decrease was also observed in the cerebellum. These results may help to explain the hyperexcitability and convulsions observed after acute high-dose exposure to this compound.",
