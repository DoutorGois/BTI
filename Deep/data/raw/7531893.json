     "AB": "Hippocampal neurones in the CA1 region have become a model system to study the mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory processes. The CA1 region is also highly vulnerable to ischaemic or anoxic episodes which induce a selective and delayed degeneration of pyramidal neurones. In CA1 neurones, anoxic episodes generate a novel form of LTP to which we refer as anoxic LTP. In common with tetanic LTP, the induction of anoxic LTP is voltage- and NMDA receptor-dependent. However, in contrast with tetanic LTP, the expression of anoxic LTP is mediated exclusively by NMDA receptors. These observations suggest that anoxic-ischaemic episodes trigger a switch in favour of NMDA receptor-operated synaptic transmission. We suggest that the multiple forms of NMDA receptor-dependent LTPs are determined by extracellular and intracellular modulatory sites of this receptor.",
