     "AB": "We investigated the effects of interleukin-2 (IL-2) on the survival and morphology of primary cultured neurons from fetal rat brain. Addition of recombinant human IL-2 significantly supported the survival of brain neurons in high cell density culture, but did not show any effect on the neuronal survival in low cell density culture. In addition, IL-2 significantly promoted the neurite elongation and branching of hippocampal neurons in low cell density culture. These results suggest that IL-2 supports neuronal survival indirectly and promotes neuritogenesis by directly acting on brain neurons.",
