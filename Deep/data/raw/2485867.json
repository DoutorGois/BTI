     "AB": "Adenylate cyclase activity, stimulated by dopamine, norepinephrine and forskolin, was demonstrated histochemically in electron microscopy of the CA1 sector of Ammon's horn in Mongolian gerbil. Cobalt and strontium were used as precipitating agents. The reaction product located in the synapses was mostly associated with the postsynaptic membranes. It was also present in the plasma membrane of some nerve fibers. There were no differences in the enzyme activity in particular layers of Ammon's horn as well as between symmetric and asymmetric types of synapses. The intensity of the reaction product depended mostly on the stimulator used.",
