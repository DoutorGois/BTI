     "AB": "Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) play a major role during the development of the central nervous system (CNS). Ca(2+) influx via VGCCs regulates axonal growth and neuronal migration as well as synaptic plasticity. Specifically, L-type VGCCs have been well characterized to be involved in the formation and refinement of the connections within the CA3 region of the hippocampus. The majority of the growth, formation, and refinement in the CNS occurs during the third trimester of human pregnancy. An equivalent developmental time period in rodents occurs during the first 2weeks of post-natal life, and the expression pattern of L-type VGCCs during this time period has not been well characterized. In this study, we show that Cav1.2 channels are more highly expressed during this developmental period compared to adolescence (post-natal day 30) and that L-type VGCCs significantly contribute to the overall Ca(2+) currents. These findings suggest that L-type VGCCs are functionally expressed during the crucial developmental period.",
