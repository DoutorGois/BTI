     "AB": "1. Enzyme activities and contents of manganese and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Mn-, Cu/Zn-SOD) and oxygen free-radical scavengers were determined in the myocardium (right, left ventricle) and brain (cerebral cortex, hippocampus) of 15 and 31 week old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). 2. In 15 week old SHRSP myocardium, both Mn- and Cu/Zn-SOD activities were higher but in 31 week old SHRSP, these were lower than that in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Further, correlation between Mn-SOD content and activity in 31 week old SHRSP myocardium showed that specific activity was lower than that in WKY. 3. In 15 and 31 week old SHRSP cerebral cortex and hippocampus, SOD content and activity showed a tendency to be lower than that in WKY. 4. These results indicate that enzymatically inactive or low-active Mn-SOD protein exists in SHRSP myocardium, and that the alteration of SOD may be one of the causative factors for the vulnerability of the myocardium and brain against O2-radicals.",
