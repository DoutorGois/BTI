     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Early life stress (ELS) increases the vulnerability to developing psychopathological disorders in adulthood that are accompanied by brain inflammatory processes. However, it is not known how a combined double hit (stress and immune) at an early age affects the response of the neuroimmune system. Here we investigated the effect of periodic maternal separation (MS) followed by administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on glial cells in the CA3 region and hilus of the hippocampus and on cytokine release on postnatal day (PN) 15. METHODS: Male rat pups were subjected to MS (3 h/day, PN1-14). MS and control pups received a single LPS injection (1 mg/kg of body weight) on PN14. They were subjected to an open field test 1 h later. The pups were sacrificed 90 min after LPS injection (PN14) or on PN15 for cytokine or immunohistological analyses, respectively. RESULTS: LPS reduced the locomotion and induced high corticosterone levels in treated pups. MS or LPS reduced microglial density and activated microglial cells in the hippocampal CA3 and hilus regions. Microglial activation was highest in MS-LPS pups. The astrocyte density was mildly reduced by MS or LPS in the CA3 region and hilus, but the reduction was maximal in MS-LPS pups. LPS increased the secretion of plasmatic interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-6, and of hippocampal IL-1beta protein, but these were attenuated in MS-LPS pups. CONCLUSION: Although MS and LPS activate neuroimmune cells, stress attenuates the hippocampal and peripheral cytokine response to LPS through an as-yet unidentified adaptive mechanism. These results provide information regarding the neurobiology of stress and inflammation.",
