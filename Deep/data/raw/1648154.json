     "AB": "Quantitative receptor autoradiography using the ligand [3H]U 69593 and tritium sensitive film was used to visualize the kappa subtype of opiate receptor in sections from 4 normal human postmortem brains. Data obtained from cortical scans, which measured receptor densities across the left and right parahippocampal gyri, were subject to Fourier analysis. This revealed that the kappa receptor distribution was described by a curve having significant first and second component harmonics. This analysis method can be used to describe a binding pattern mathematically, thus enabling a comparison to be made between normal and diseased brains. The same analysis was applied to [3H]U 69593 autoradiograms prepared from sections of 4 schizophrenic postmortem brains. The kappa receptor distribution in the schizophrenic group not only failed to produce the same pattern as the controls, but also showed no consistent pattern within the group. The method described can be used to investigate alterations in receptor distribution which occur in neuropsychiatric diseases involving neuronal dysplasia or atrophy.",
