The characteristics of the binding were similar in both types of tissue and paralleled those of the B2 bradykinin receptor. Following exposure to nerve growth factor for 72 hours, the number of BK binding sites in PC-12 cells significantly increased, but other characteristics of the binding remained unchanged.",
