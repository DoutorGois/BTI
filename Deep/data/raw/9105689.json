     "PG": "177-81",
     "AB": "Moderate lesions of the septohippocampal pathway by intraventricular infusions of ethylcholine aziridinium (AF64A) induced a dose-dependent decrease of hippocampal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, which partially recovered between 1 and 5 weeks after treatment. The cholinergic deficit was associated with an increase in nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA only within the hippocampal dentate gyrus and hilus by maximally 51% and 111% 3 and 7 weeks after AF64A treatment, respectively, whereas no changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor- and neurotrophin-3 mRNA were observed. The content of NGF protein transiently increased in the ventral part of the hippocampus 3 weeks after AF64A infusion but returned to control levels at 5 weeks. At that time, however, NGF content as well as ChAT activity were significantly increased in the septum, suggesting an increased utilization of NGF by the remaining cholinergic neurons. Thus, the present data provide correlative evidence for a critical role of endogenous NGF in neuroregeneration and plasticity of the cholinergic basal forebrain in case of incipient damage.",
