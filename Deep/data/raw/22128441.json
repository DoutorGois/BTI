     "AB": "Taurine and the neurotransmitter GABA are both inhibitory in nature in the brain. The effects of GABA receptor agonists and antagonists on taurine release were studied in hippocampal slices prepared from developing 7-day-old and young adult 3-month-old mice. In ischemia no significant effects were discernible, but in normoxia the agonists of all three classes of GABA receptors enhanced the basal release of taurine among mice of both ages. The K+-evoked release was potentiated only in adults. The effects were receptor-mediated, being blocked by GABA receptor antagonists. Taurine may thus augment GABAergic inhibition in this brain region.",
