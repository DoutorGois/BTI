     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Drug-induced temporary amnesia is one of the principal goals of general anesthesia. The nonimmobilizer 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane (F6, also termed 2N) impairs hippocampus-dependent learning at relative, i.e., lipophilicity-corrected, concentrations similar to isoflurane. Hippocampal theta oscillations facilitate mnemonic processes in vivo and synaptic plasticity (a cellular model of memory) in vitro and are thought to represent a circuit level phenomenon that supports memory encoding. Therefore, the authors investigated the effects of F6 and isoflurane on theta oscillations (4-12 Hz). METHODS: Thirteen adult rats were implanted with multichannel depth electrodes to measure the microelectroencephalogram and were exposed to a range of concentrations of isoflurane and F6 spanning the concentrations that produce amnesia. Five of these animals also underwent control experiments without drug injection. The authors recorded the behavioral state and hippocampal field potentials. They confirmed the electrode location postmortem by histology. RESULTS: The tested concentrations for isoflurane and F6 ranged from 0.035% to 0.77% and from 0.5% to 3.6%, respectively. Isoflurane increased the fraction of time that the animals remained immobile, consistent with sedation, whereas F6 had the opposite effect. Electroencephalographic power in the theta band was less when the animals were immobile than when they explored their environment. F6 suppressed the power of oscillations in the theta band. Isoflurane slowed theta oscillations without reducing total power in the theta band. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-induced changes in theta oscillations may be a common basis for amnesia produced by F6 and isoflurane. The different patterns suggest that these drugs alter network activity by acting on different molecular and/or cellular targets.",
