     "AB": "Spontaneous superslow electrical brain activity and its changes were studied in acute experiments on curarized rabbits after administration of etimysol in doses of 1.0, 1.5 and 2.5 mg/kg. The effect of the drug persisted for three hours. Two oscillation phases were recorded in the medial group of mesencephalic reticular nuclei and the lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus: a short positive phase and a prolonged negative one. In other brain structures only negative waves were recorded. A significant functional rearrangement of correlative connections of brain structures took place in 90 minutes after the drug administration. The factor analysis showed that the most subtle connections were preserved in the neocortex and the dorsal hippocampus.",
