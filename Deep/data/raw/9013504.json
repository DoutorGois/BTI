     "AB": "There is evidence that glucocorticoids may play a role in learning and memory. To further explore this possibility, we examined the effect of the Type II glucocorticoid antagonists on contextual fear conditioning. This conditioning task is dependent on the hippocampal formation, a brain structure known to be rich in glucocorticoid receptors. Rats systemically injected with a Type II antagonist either 1 h prior to conditioning (RU 38486 and RU 40555) or immediately after conditioning displayed less contextual fear conditioning than rats injected with vehicle. Although RU impaired contextual fear conditioning, it had no effect on auditory fear conditioning. These data are consistent with other reports that contextual fear conditioning and auditory-cue fear conditioning depend on different processes and with the hypothesis that glucocorticoid activity contributes to the processes involved in the consolidation of some forms of memory.",
