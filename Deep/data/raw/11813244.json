     "AB": "Heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (G-proteins) couple many different cell surface receptor types to intracellular effector mechanisms. Uncoupling between receptors and G-proteins and between G-proteins and adenylyl cyclase (AC) and phospholipase C (PLC) has been described for Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. However, there is little information on whether altered G-protein signaling in AD is just an end-stage phenomenon or is important for the progression of disease pathology. Here we used [(35)S]GTPgammaS autoradiography to study G-protein distribution in sections of entorhinal cortex and hippocampus from 23 cases staged for neurofibrillary changes and amyloid deposits according to Braak and Braak (Acta Neuropathol. [1991] 82:239-259). We also studied the effects of GTP, which has been found to increase [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding in an Mg(2+)-dependent manner. Results show that the ability of GTP (3 microM) to stimulate [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding declined significantly with staging for neurofibrillary changes in the entorhinal cortex (P < 0.05, ANOVA) and CA1 subfield of the hippocampus (P < 0.05, ANOVA). No significant changes were seen for [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding in the absence of GTP. Our results suggest a decrease in G-protein GTP hydrolysis, which correlates with the progression of AD neurofibrillary changes, in the regions most affected by this pathology. These alterations appear to occur prior to stages corresponding to clinical disease and could lead to an impaired regulation of several signaling systems in AD brain.",
