     "AB": "AIM: To study the effects of ginseng root saponins (GRS) on interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression in hippocampal neurons in chronic inflammation model of aged rats. METHODS: Chronic inflammation was induced by consecutive intraperitioneal injections of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in aged rats. The semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for determination of IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA in hippocampal neurons of aged rats. RESULTS: No marked expression of IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA was found in hippocampal neurons of young rats (3 months). In adult rats (9 months) the levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 expressed were 1.54 +/- 0.21 and 1.63 +/- 0.21, respectively; in aged rats (24 months) treated with LPS the levels were 1.98 +/- 0.21 and 1.91 +/- 0.11 respectively, significantly higher than those of adult rats. After treatment with GRS (10, 20, 40 mg/kg), the IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA content in aged rats decreased markedly. CONCLUSION: The levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA in hippocampal neurons increased with aging. GRS exerted inhibitory effects on IL-1 beta and IL-6 gene expression in chronic inflammation model of aged rats.",
