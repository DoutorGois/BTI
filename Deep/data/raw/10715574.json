     "AB": "By mediating cell adhesion and signal transduction, the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) regulates neurite outgrowth, fasciculation and target recognition in the developing nervous system. In addition, a number of studies suggest an important role for the NCAM in regeneration and learning in the adult nervous system. NCAM-deficient mice are impaired in spatial learning. Moreover, by interfering with normal NCAM function by intracranial injections of NCAM-antibodies, long-term potentiation (LTP) in rat hippocampal slices and learning in rats and chicks have been inhibited. In the vertebrate nervous system, NCAM is the dominant carrier of polysialic acid (PSA), an unusual carbohydrate consisting of long homopolymers of sialic acid. The PSA-NCAM expression decreases markedly during development. However, an upregulation of polysialic acid (PSA) in restricted brain areas including the hippocampus has been observed following learning. Moreover, enzymatic removal of PSA results in impaired LTP and learning. In muscle, the PSA-NCAM expression is upregulated following denervation. This response is weakened in aging rats. The expression of NCAM and PSA have been shown to be regulated by neuronal activity suggesting that the NCAM may promote structural remodelling in an activity dependent manner associated with learning and regeneration.",
