     "AB": "Alzheimer's dementia may be considered a synaptic disease of central neurons: the loss of synapses, reflected by early cognitive impairments, precedes the appearance of extra cellular focal deposits of beta-amyloid peptide in the brain of patients. Distinct immunocytochemical patterns of amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) have previously been demonstrated in the synapses by ultrastructural analysis in the cerebellum and hippocampus of adult rats and mice. Now we show that during postnatal development and during aging in these structures, the immunocytochemical expression of APPs increases in the synapses in parallel with the known up-regulation of total APPs brain levels. Interestingly, as shown previously in the adult rodents, the presenilins (PSs) 1 and 2, which intervene in APPs metabolism, exhibit a synaptic distribution pattern similar to that of APPs with parallel quantitative changes throughout life. In the brain tissue, single and double immunocytochemistry at the ultrastructural level shows co-localisation of APPs and PSs in axonal and dendritic synaptic compartments during postnatal synaptogenesis, adulthood and aging. In addition, double-labelling immunocytofluorescence detects these proteins close to synaptophysin at the growth cones of developing cultured neurons. Thusly, the brain expression of APPs and PSs appears to be regulated synchronously during lifespan in the synaptic compartments where the proteins are colocated. This suggests that PS-dependent processing of important synaptic proteins such as APPs could intervene in age-induced adjustments of synaptic relationships between specific types of neurons.",
