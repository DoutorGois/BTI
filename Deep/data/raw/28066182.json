     "AB": "The proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) is important for neural regeneration after cerebral injury. Here, for the first time, we show that phosphorylated (p)-ser847-nNOS (NP847), rather than nNOS, may play a major role in NSC proliferation after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Western blot results demonstrated that the expression of NP847 and Sox2 in the hippocampus is up-regulated after TBI, and they both peak 3 days after brain injury. In addition, an immunofluorescence experiment indicated that NP847 and Sox2 partly co-localize in the nuclei of NSCs after TBI. Further immunoprecipitation experiments found that NP847 and Sox2 can directly interact with each other in NSCs. Moreover, in an OGD model of NSCs, NP847 expression is decreased, which is followed by the down-regulation of Sox2. Interestingly, in this study, we did not observe changes in the expression of nNOS in the OGD model. Further research data suggest that the NP847-Sox2 complex may play a major role in NSCs through the Shh/Gli signaling pathway in a CaMKII-dependent manner after brain injury.",
