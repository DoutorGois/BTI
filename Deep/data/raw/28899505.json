     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The brain is exposed to many excitotoxic insults that can lead to neuronal damage. Among these, Epilepsy is a neurological disease that affects a large percentage of world population and is commonly associated with cognitive disorders and excitotoxic neuronal death. Most experimental strategies are focused on preventing Status Epilepticus (SE), but once it has already occurred, the key question is whether it is possible to save neurons. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine if a purified alkaloid extract (AE) obtained from Phlegmariurus saururus, a genus of Lycophyte plants (sometimes known as firmossesor fir club mosses) could induce neuroprotection following SE. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo techniques were applied for this purpose. Protein levels were measured by western blotting procedures. Neuronal death analysis was performed by calcein-ethidium staining and the presence of the NeuN protein as a marker for presence or absence of cells (in vitro experiments) and by Fluoro Jade B staining for the in vivo experiments. RESULTS: The effect of AE in the hippocampal neurons culture was the first determination, where we found an increase in neuronal survival and in the level of pErk and TrkB activation, 24h after the addition of AE. In a well-established in vitro model of SE, we found that 24h after being added to the hippocampal neuron-astrocyte co-culture, the AE induces a significant increase in neuronal survival. In addition to this, in the in vivo Li-pilocarpine model of SE, the AE induced a remarkable neuroprotection in areas such as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal CA1 area. CONCLUSION: These results make the AE an excellent candidate for potential clinical use in neurological disorders where memory impairment and neuronal death occurs.",
