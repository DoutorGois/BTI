     "AB": "We investigated the effect of pre-training on the improvement of spatial navigation performance provided by a cholinesterase inhibitor, tetrahydroaminoacridine (3 mg/kg, i.p.), and a positive modulator of NMDA receptor, D-cycloserine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), or their combination in aged rats. Pre-training consisted of spatial or non-spatial conditions and took place in either the same or a separate room. We found that any kind of pre-training was able to eliminate the enhancing effect of tetrahydroaminoacridine and D-cycloserine on spatial navigation. However, none of these pre-training conditions was able to block the age-related deficit in spatial navigation. These results indicate that tetrahydroaminoacridine and D-cycloserine, separately or in combination, do not themselves alleviate the age-related spatial memory deficit, but may enhance procedural aspects of water maze learning in aged rats.",
