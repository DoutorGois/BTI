     "AB": "The mRNA expression of the major subunits of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NR1, NR2A and NR2B) following ischemia-reperfusion was studied in structures with different vulnerabilities to ischemic insult in the rat brain. The study was performed using quantitative real-time PCR on samples from 3-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats after global transient forebrain ischemia followed by 48h of reperfusion. Expression of NMDA receptor subunits mRNAs decreased significantly in all structures studied in the injured animals as compared to the sham-operated ones. The hippocampal subfields (CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus) as well as the caudate-putamen, both reported to be highly ischemic-vulnerable structures, showed outstandingly lower mRNA levels of NMDA receptor subunits than the cerebral cortex, which is considered a more ischemic-resistant structure. The ratios of the mRNA levels of the different subunits were analyzed as a measure of the NMDA receptor expression pattern for each structure studied. Hippocampal areas showed changes in NMDA receptor expression after the insult, with significant decreases in the NR2A with respect to the NR1 and NR2B subunits. Thus, the NR1:NR2A:NR2B (1:1:2) ratios observed in the sham-operated animals became (2:1:4) in insulted animals. This modified expression pattern was similar in CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus, in spite of the different vulnerabilities reported for these hippocampal areas. In contrast, no significant differences in the expression pattern were observed in the caudate-putamen or cerebral cortex on comparing the sham-operated animals with the ischemia-reperfused rats. Our results support the notion that the regulation of NMDA receptor gene expression is dependent on the brain structure rather than on the higher or lower vulnerability of the area studied.",
