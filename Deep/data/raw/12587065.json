     "AB": "In central nervous system (CNS) tissue preparations, wild-type Semliki Forest virus (SFV) mainly infects neurons, and in vivo it causes lethal encephalitis in neonatal and adult rodents. The SFV strain A7(74), by contrast, is avirulent in adult rodents, triggering only limited CNS infection. To examine A7(74) infection in hippocampal tissue, the authors constructed a replicon, termed SFV(A774nsP)-GFP, expressing green fluorescent protein. The results were compared to replication-proficient recombinant A7(74) encoding GFP, named VA7-EGFP. As nonstructural gene mutations can confer temperature sensitivity, the authors also tested whether infection was temperature-dependent. Indeed, at 31 degrees C both viral recombinants transduced significantly more baby hamster kidney cells than at 37 degrees C. When rat hippocampal slices and dissociated cells were incubated at 37 degrees C, SFV(A774nsP)-GFP transduced glial cells but virtually no neurons-the opposite of conventional SFV. For VA7-EGFP at 37 degrees C, the preferred GFP-positive cells in hippocampal slices were also non-neuronal cells. At 31 degrees C, however, a more wild-type phenotype was found, with 33% and 94% of the GFP-positive cells being neurons for SFV(A774nsP)-GFP in slices and dissociated cells, respectively, and 94% neurons for VA7-EGFP in slices. Immunochemical and electrophysiological analyses confirmed that at 37 degrees C virtually all cells transduced by SFV(A774nsP)-GFP in slices were astrocytes, while at 31 degrees C they also contained neurons. These results show that in addition to the developmental age, the temperature determines which cell type becomes infected by A7(74). Our data suggest that A7(74) is avirulent in adult animals because it does not readily replicate in mature neurons at body temperature, whereas it still does so at lower temperatures.",
