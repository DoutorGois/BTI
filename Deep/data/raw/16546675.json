     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Sigma-1 receptors are expressed throughout the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) and are implicated in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and depression. We have recently evaluated the high-affinity (K(D)=0.5+/-0.2 nM, log P=2.9) sigma-1 receptor radiotracer [(18)F]1-(3-fluoropropyl)-4-(4-cyanophenoxymethyl)piperidine, [(18)F]FPS, in humans. In contrast to appropriate kinetics exhibited in baboon brain, in the human CNS, [(18)F]FPS does not reach pseudoequilibrium by 4 h, supporting the development of a lower-affinity tracer [Waterhouse RN, Nobler MS, Chang RC, Zhou Y, Morales O, Kuwabara H, et al. First evaluation of the sigma-1 receptor radioligand [(18)F]1-3-fluoropropyl-4-((4-cyanophenoxy)-methyl)piperidine ([(18)F]FPS) in healthy humans. Neuroreceptor Mapping 2004, July 15-18th, Vancouver, BC Canada 2004]. We describe herein the in vivo evaluation in rats of [(18)F]1-(2-fluoroethyl)-4-[(4-cyanophenoxy)methyl]piperidine ([(18)F]SFE) (K(D)=5 nM, log P=2.4), a structurally similar, lower-affinity sigma-1 receptor radioligand. METHODS: [(18)F]SFE was synthesized (n=4) as previously described in good yield (54+/-6% EOB), high specific activity (2.1+/-0.6 Ci/micromol EOS) and radiochemical purity (98+/-1%) and evaluated in awake adult male rats. RESULTS: Similar to [(18)F]FPS, regional brain radioactivity concentrations [percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g), 15 min] for [(18)F]SFE were highest in occipital cortex (1.86+/-0.06 %ID/g) and frontal cortex (1.76+/-0.38 %ID/g), and lowest in the hippocampus (1.01+/-0.02%ID/g). Unlike [(18)F]FPS, [(18)F]SFE cleared from the brain with approximately 40% reduction in peak activity over a 90-min period. Metabolite analysis (1 h) revealed that [(18)F]SFE was largely intact in the brain. Blocking studies showed a large degree (>80%) of saturable binding for [(18)F]SFE in discrete brain regions. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that [(18)F]SFE exhibits excellent characteristics in vivo and may provide a superior PET radiotracer for human studies due to its faster CNS clearance compared to [(18)F]FPS.",
