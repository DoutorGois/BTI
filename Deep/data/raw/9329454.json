     "AB": "RC3/neurogranin is a postsynaptic protein kinase C (PKC)-/calmodulin-binding substrate implicated in long-term potentiation (LTP) forms of synaptic plasticity. Our previous digoxigenin in situ hybridization (DIG-ISH) studies detected RC3 mRNA in apical dendrites and cell bodies of neurons in the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus. This observation suggested that RC3 mRNA is selectively translocated to dendrites, where it may be translated locally in response to synaptic activity. To test this hypothesis further, we isolated a full-length cDNA clone of the homologous human RC3 mRNA from a human cortex lambda GT11 library, determined its nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences, and performed mRNA expression studies in cerebral cortex from normal human patients and from patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD). The human cDNA clone detects a single approximately 1.3 kb mRNA whose nucleotide sequence is 73% similar to the rat nucleotide sequence and 96% similar to its amino acid sequence. DIG-ISH studies detect robust staining of RC3 mRNA in cell bodies of numerous neurons throughout Layers II-VI and in both apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons in human neocortex (temporal/frontal). We conclude that dendritic targeting of RC3 mRNA is conserved in human brain. In AD neocortex tissue, there is little or no evidence for RC3 mRNA translocation to dendrites, while in FTD neocortex, targeting of RC3 mRNA to apical dendrites is preserved. Comparative studies in AD and FTD point to the potential importance of synapse integrity and the dendritic cytoskeleton in RC3 mRNA targeting in the human neocortex.",
