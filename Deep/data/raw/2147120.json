     "AB": "The influence of dopamine D1 receptor agonist, SKF 38393 has been studied in vitro in the model of low calcium spontaneous epileptiform discharges. Application of SKF 38393 (3 microM) to the perfusing medium evoked a decrease in neuronal firing rate of hippocampal CA1 neurons. The effect of SKF 38393 was blocked by pretreatment with SCH 23390. It is concluded that simulation of hippocampal D1 dopamine receptors by SKF 38393 inhibits epilepsy-like events induced by low calcium concentration in the perfusing fluid.",
