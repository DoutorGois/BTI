     "AB": "The kinetics of exo-endocytotic recycling could restrict information transfer at central synapses if neurotransmission were entirely reliant on classical full-collapse fusion. Nonclassical fusion retrieval by kiss-and-run would be kinetically advantageous but remains controversial. We used a hydrophilic quencher, bromophenol blue (BPB), to help detect nonclassical events. Upon stimulation, extracellular BPB entered synaptic vesicles and quenched FM1-43 fluorescence, indicating retention of FM dye beyond first fusion. BPB also quenched fluorescence of VAMP (synaptobrevin-2)-EGFP, thus indicating the timing of first fusion of vesicles in the total recycling pool. Comparison with FM dye destaining revealed that kiss-and-run strongly prevailed over full-collapse fusion at low frequency, giving way to a near-even balance at high frequency. Quickening of kiss-and-run vesicle reuse was also observed at higher frequency in the average single vesicle fluorescence response. Kiss-and-run and reuse could enable hippocampal nerve terminals to conserve scarce vesicular resources when responding to widely varying input patterns.",
