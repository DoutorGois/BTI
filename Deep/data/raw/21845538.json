The generation of new neurons in the adult mammalian brain has been documented in several works. Many studies show that adult hippocampal neurogenesis relates to hippocampal function, in several ways. In this study, we assessed the effect of single and fractionated cobalt radiation on neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. The irradiation time for delivering 2 Gy (for fractionated dose radiation) and 10 Gy (for single dose radiation) at maximum depth were respectively 1.98 min and 9.92 min. To study the association with memory function we examined inhibitory avoidance memory using a step-through device. Brains were withdrawn and fixed, and then sections were stained with cresyl violet for neurons. We found that a 10 Gy dose can induce lower neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (p < 0.05), in such a way that a fractionated dose (5 fractions of 2 Gy) is more effective than a single dose (one fraction of 10 Gy). Moreover, a fractionated dose could reduce step-through latency corresponding to damaged inhibitory avoidance memory (p < 0.05). Synergic action of an anaesthetic drug may be the cause of more reduction of neurogenesis in fractionated irradiated rats. There was no significant difference in latency of the inhibitory avoidance memory response between the single 10 Gy group and the sham group, while fractionated 10 Gy could reduce latency. Different mechanisms of action in the two regimens of irradiation may be a reason.",
