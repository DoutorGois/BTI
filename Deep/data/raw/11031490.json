It was established that the increase of activity MAO in hypothalamus reached the maximal meaning at modulation frequency of 6 Hz that corresponded 160% (p < 0.01) of the control level; and at modulation frequency of 20 Hz the decrease of enzyme activity up to 74% (p < 0.01) was found. Mainly the action of ultralow power pulse-modulated EMR on activity of MAO in hippocamp was activating; and the maximal increase of enzyme activity up to 174% (p < 0.01) was registered at modulation frequency of 4 Hz.",
