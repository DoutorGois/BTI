     "AB": "Oxidative stress is a major pathogenic event occurring in several brain disorders and is a major cause of brain damage due to ischemia/reperfusion. Thiol proteins are easily oxidized in cells exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the present study, we investigated transient ischemia-induced chronological changes in hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins (Prx-SO3) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH-SO3) immunoreactivity and protein levels in the gerbil hippocampus induced by 5 min of transient forebrain ischemia. Weak Prx-SO3 immunoreactivity is detected in the hippocampal CA1 region of the sham-operated group. Prx-SO3 immunoreactivity was significantly increased 12 h and 1 day after ischemia/reperfusion, and the immunoreactivity was decreased to the level of the sham-operated group 2 days after ischemia/reperfusion. Prx-SO3 immunoreactivity in the 4 days post-ischemia group was increased again, and the immunoreactivity was expressed in glial components for 5 days after ischemia/reperfusion. GAPDH-SO3 immunoreactivity was highest in the CA1 region 1 day after ischemia/reperfusion, the immunoreactivity was decreased 2 days after ischemia/reperfusion. Four days after ischemia/reperfusion, GAPDH-SO3 immunoreactivity increased again, and the immunoreactivity began to be expressed in glial components from 5 days after ischemia/reperfusion. Prx-SO3 and GAPDH-SO3 protein levels in the ischemic CA1 region were also very high 12 h and 1 day after ischemia/reperfusion and returned to the level of the sham-operated group 3 days after ischemia/reperfusion. Their protein levels were increased again 5 days after ischemia/reperfusion. In conclusion, Prx-SO3 and GAPDH-SO3 immunoreactivity and protein levels in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region are significantly increased 12 h-24 h after ischemia/reperfusion and their immunoreactivity begins to be expressed in glial components from 4 or 5 days after ischemia/reperfusion.",
