     "AB": "Experimental cardiac arrest (CA) in aging research is infrequently studied in part due to the limitation of animal models. We aimed to develop an easily performed mouse CA model to meet this need. A standard mouse KCl-induced CA model using chest compressions and intravenous epinephrine for resuscitation was modified by blood withdrawal prior to CA onset, so as to decrease the requisite KCl dose to induce CA by decreasing the circulating blood volume. The modification was then compared to the standard model in young adult mice subjected to 8 min CA. 22-month old mice were then subjected to 8 min CA, resuscitated, and compared to young adult mice. Post-CA functional recovery was evaluated by measuring spontaneous locomotor activity pre-injury, and on post-CA days 1, 2, and 3. Neurological score and brain histology were examined on day 3. Brain elF2alpha phosphorylation levels were measured at 1 h to verify tissue stress. Compared to the standard model, the modification decreased cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration and increased 3-day survival in young mice. For aged mice, survival was 100 % at 24 h and 54% at 72 h. Neurological deficit was present 3 days post-CA, although more severe versus young mice. Mild neuronal necrosis was present in the cortex and hippocampus. The modified model markedly induced elF2alpha phosphorylation in both age groups. This modified procedure makes the CA model feasible in aged mice and provides a practical platform for understanding injury mechanisms and developing therapeutics for elderly patients.",
