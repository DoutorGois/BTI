     "AB": "In this article we describe a new method, using SPM99, that searches explicitly for bilateral structural abnormalities. Children with bilateral pathology have a poorer prognosis than children with unilateral damage. After brain injury or disease in childhood, it is thought that rescue of function is only possible if the neuronal substrates of that function are preserved and operational in at least one hemisphere [Vargha-Khadem and Mishkin, 1997]. If this is the case, the detection of bilateral abnormalities would greatly facilitate more accurate prognosis in children with brain injury or developmental disorders. We have therefore developed a technique to detect bilateral abnormalities that uses conjunction analysis with voxel based morphometry. It is illustrated using a group of patients with bilateral hypoxic-ischaemic damage to the hippocampus. The approach is shown to have enhanced specificity and sensitivity relative to conventional unilateral characterisations.",
