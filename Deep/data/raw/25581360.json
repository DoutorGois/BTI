     "AB": "Human chromosome 16p11.2 microdeletion is the most common gene copy number variation in autism, but the synaptic pathophysiology caused by this mutation is largely unknown. Using a mouse with the same genetic deficiency, we found that metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5)-dependent synaptic plasticity and protein synthesis was altered in the hippocampus and that hippocampus-dependent memory was impaired. Notably, chronic treatment with a negative allosteric modulator of mGluR5 reversed the cognitive deficit.",
