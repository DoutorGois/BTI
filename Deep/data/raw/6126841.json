     "AB": "Responses of CAl pyramidal cells to cholinergic compounds were recorded with intracellular microelectrodes in guinea-pig hippocampal slices. Perfusion of slices with medium containing the muscarinic antagonists atropine or scopolamine (10(-7)-10(-6)M) blocked all actions of acetylcholine. Properties of control neurons and those from separate populations of neurons impaled in slices exposed to muscarinic blocking agents were compared. 1-2 h of perfusion with atropine-containing media significantly decreased membrane input resistance from 37.6 +/- 8.7 (S.D.) M omega (n = 74) to 21.9 +/- 7.7 (S.D.) M omega (n = 24) without producing significant changes in membrane potential. Muscarinic antagonists also reduced or eliminated the anomalous inward rectification normally seen in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Exposure of slices to 10(-5)-10(-6)M eserine for about 1 h produced changes in neuronal membrane input resistance and potential and slow after hyperpolarizations similar to those elicited by application of acetylcholine. Bethanechol mimicked the actions of acetylcholine but was effective at lower concentrations and had longer lasting effects on afterhyperpolarizations. Nicotine produced an excitatory response in only one of 7 neurons. These experiments demonstrate that the actions of acetylcholine on hippocampal CAl neurons result from interaction with muscarinic receptors. Acetylcholine has modulatory effects on cell membrane properties which may be mediated through tonic release mechanisms.",
