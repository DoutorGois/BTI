     "AB": "Fluoride intoxication and dexamethasone treatment produce deleterious effects in bone and brain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of fluoride (F) and dexamethasone (Dex) co-exposure on oxidative stress and apoptosis in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 and hippocampal HT22 cell lines. Co-exposure to F and Dex resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability, induction of apoptosis and increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) following 72 h of incubation. Fluoride-induced apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 and HT22 cells was attenuated by catalase and L-NNMA, indicating a role for H2O2 and NO as mediators of cytotoxicity. Dexamethasone-induced apoptosis was associated with H2O2 generation in both cell lines and it was attenuated during co-incubation with catalase. These data indicate that co-exposure to F and Dex amplifies their respective cytotoxicity in H2O2- and NO-dependent manner. As flavonoid fisetin prevented F- and Dex-induced cytotoxicity the potential role of this product in pharmacology and diet may be considered.",
