Over a period of 9 weeks the animals received daily IP injections of either 5 micrograms/kg or 50 micrograms/kg substance P (SP) or vehicle. Seizures provoked by the lesions were suppressed by the daily administration of the neuropeptide SP in a dose of 50 micrograms/kg for the whole period of observation. The neurokinin significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the number of seizures compared to the vehicle-treated animals.",
