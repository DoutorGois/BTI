     "AB": "A learning event initiates a cascade of altered gene expression leading to synaptic remodelling within the hippocampal dentate gyrus, a structure vital to memory formation. To illuminate this transcriptional program of synaptic plasticity we used microarrays to quantify mRNA from the rat dentate gyrus at increasing times following passive avoidance learning. Approximately, 500 known genes were transcriptionally regulated across the 24 h post-training period. The 0-2 h period saw up-regulation of genes involved in transcription while genes with a role in synaptic/cytoskeletal structure increased 0-6 h, consistent with structural rearrangements known to occur at these times. The most striking feature was the profound down-regulation, across all functional groups, 12 h post-training. Bioinformatics analysis identified the likely transcription factors controlling gene expression in each post-training period. The role of NF kappa B, implicated in the early post-training period was subsequently confirmed with activation and nuclear translocation seen in dentate granule neurons following training. mRNA changes for four genes, LRP3 (0 h), alpha actin (3 h), SNAP25 and NSF (6-12 h), were validated at message and/or protein level and shown to be learning specific. Thus, the memory-associated transcriptional cascade supports the cardinal periods of synaptic loosening, reorganisation and selection thought to underpin the process of long-term memory consolidation in the hippocampus.",
