     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized, in part, by atrophy of the adult brain and increased presence of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques. Previous studies in our lab have shown that peripheral inflammation can lead to increased central Abeta and deficits in learning and memory. In order to determine whether Abeta accumulation in the brain is responsible for the learning deficits, we attempted to decrease peripheral production of Abeta in order to reduce central Abeta accumulation. It has previously been shown that Abeta is produced in large quantities in the liver, and is transferred across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recent research has shown that peripheral treatment with imatinib methanesulfonate salt (IM), known to interfere with the interaction between gamma (gamma)-secretase and the gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP), decreases the cleavage of peripheral amyloid precursor protein into Abeta. Because IM poorly penetrates the BBB, we hypothesized that co-administration of IM with LPS would decrease peripheral production of Abeta in the presence of LPS-induced inflammation, leading to a decrease in Abeta accumulation in the hippocampus. We show that peripheral IM treatment eliminates hippocampal Abeta elevation that follows LPS-induced peripheral inflammation. Importantly, IM also eliminates the cognitive impairment seen following seven consecutive days of LPS administration, implicating Abeta peptides as a likely cause of these cognitive deficits.",
