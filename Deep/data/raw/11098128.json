     "AB": "Previous studies established that the populations of neurons that frequently degenerate in Alzheimer's disease exhibit robust up-regulation of the lysosomal system. In this study, we investigated alterations of the lysosomal system during different forms of experimental injury in rat hippocampal neurons in culture, utilizing a combination of immunocytochemical and biochemical methods. Using triple-label immnocytochemistry for activated caspase-3, fragmentation of DNA and the microtubule-associated protein-2, we characterized treatment paradigms as models of the apoptotic (staurosporine, camptothecin), the oncotic (high-dose menadione, glutamate), and the mixed apoptotic and oncotic (low-dose menadione) pathways of neuronal death. Slowly developing apoptotic or slowly developing mixed apoptotic and oncotic forms of neuronal injury were associated with substantial increases in the number and size of cathepsin D-positive vesicles (late endosomes and mature lysosomes) as determined by immunocytochemistry, and elevated levels of cathepsin D by western blotting. In agreement with our previous findings in Alzheimer's disease, where lysosomal system activation was not restricted to overtly degenerating neurons, up-regulation of this system was also detected quite early during the course of experimental neuronal injury, preceding the development of dystrophic neurites, nuclear segmentation or fragmentation of DNA. These findings implicate lysosomal system activation, both in Alzheimer's disease and in experimental models of neuronal injury, as an important event associated with early stages of neurodegeneration.",
