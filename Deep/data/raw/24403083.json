     "AB": "Brain ischemia occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, leading to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). This triggers a cascade of events causing a synaptic accumulation of glutamate. Excessive activation of glutamate receptors results in excitotoxicity and delayed cell death in vulnerable neurons. Following global cerebral ischemia, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons are more vulnerable to injury than their cortical counterparts. The mechanisms that underlie this difference are unclear. Cultured hippocampal neurons respond to OGD with a rapid internalization of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA2, resulting in a switch from GluA2-containing Ca(2+)-impermeable receptors to GluA2-lacking Ca(2+)-permeable subtypes (CP-AMPARs). GluA2 internalization is a critical component of OGD-induced cell death in hippocampal neurons. It is unknown how AMPAR trafficking is affected in cortical neurons following OGD. Here, we show that cultured cortical neurons are resistant to an OGD insult that causes cell death in hippocampal neurons. GluA1 is inserted at the plasma membrane in both cortical and hippocampal neurons in response to OGD. In contrast, OGD causes a rapid endocytosis of GluA2 in hippocampal neurons, which is absent in cortical neurons. These data demonstrate that populations of neurons with different vulnerabilities to OGD recruit distinct cell biological mechanisms in response to insult, and that a crucial aspect of the mechanism leading to OGD-induced cell death is absent in cortical neurons. This strongly suggests that the absence of OGD-induced GluA2 trafficking contributes to the relatively low vulnerability of cortical neurons to ischemia.",
