     "AB": "The alkaloid lobeline (Lob) has been studied due to its potential use in treatment of drug abuse. This study evaluates the possible anticonvulsant and neuroprotective activities of Lob to obtain new information on its properties that could confirm it as a candidate in the treatment of alcohol addiction. The anticonvulsant effect of Lob was evaluated using a pilocarpine-induced seizure model. In addition, possible neuroprotective effects were investigated measuring DNA damage using the comet assay, assessing free radical levels by dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF) oxidation, and measuring the antioxidant potential using the alpha, alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging assay, besides measuring superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzyme activities in brain tissues. Lobeline increased the latency to the first seizure and decreased the percentage of seizures in a similar way as diazepam, used as control. DNA damage induced by Pil and hydrogen peroxide were decreased in hippocampus and cerebral cortex from mice treated with Lob. The levels of free radicals and CAT activity increased in cortex and hippocampus, respectively, in mice treated with Pil. Lobeline decreased CAT in hippocampus, leading to similar values as in the saline negative control. In conclusion, Lob has anticonvulsant and neuroprotective actions that may be mediated by antioxidant-like mechanisms, indicating its potential as candidate drug in alcoholism therapy.",
