     "AB": "Changes of amino acids release in rat's hippocampus were studied by using push-pull perfusion and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorometric detection techniques during kainic acid (KA) induced epilepsy and acupuncture. The results indicated that the levels of glutamate, aspartate, glycine and GABA were statistically increased in hippocampus 40min after administration of KA. After EA treatment, there was marked elevation in the extracellular level of taurine. It's shown that the inhibitory effect of EA on epilepsy may be related to the increase of inhibitory amino acids's release in hippocampus.",
