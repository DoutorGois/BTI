     "AB": "We examined spatial-temporal patterns of neural activity, as inferred from 700 nm light reflectance, from the dorsal hippocampus and surrounding neocortex in seven freely behaving cats following 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 5.0 mg/kg intravenous cocaine administration. Images were acquired using a new technique which gathered reflected light from cortical and subcortical structures. Cardiac and respiratory patterning, collected simultaneously with optical images, revealed increased rates and diminished variation after intravenous cocaine administration. Cocaine increased reflectance correlates of hippocampal neural activity in a dose-dependent fashion over a 120 min period, with a lengthening time-to-peak effect (22-76 min). The largest dose resulted in an initial decrease, followed by the greatest enhancement in neuronal activity. Correlates of neural activation in the neocortex displayed an inverse dose-response curve to that found in the hippocampus; the time-to-peak effect was shorter (6-43 min) and the maximal change was reduced. Regional patches and bands of activation occurred during the period of the cocaine response, and were more pronounced in the hippocampus than the neocortex. Procaine, administered in a similar dose, slightly increased neural activity for 10 min in both the hippocampus and neocortex, and elicited a small increase in respiration. Cocaine induces a pronounced enhancement of neural activation in the neocortex and dorsal hippocampus; the time course of activation in the hippocampus parallels an increased respiratory pattern and outlasts the neocortical response. We speculate that hippocampal activation may be related to the profound respiratory acceleration found in response to cocaine.",
