     "AB": "Overexpression of GSK3beta in transgenic mice induces learning deficits and some features associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), including dentate gyrus (DG) atrophy. Here, we assessed whether these mice also recapitulate DG atrophy as well as impaired neurogenesis reported in AD. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that there were fewer and more disorganized neurogenic niches in these animals, coupled with an increase in the proportion of immature neurons. Indeed, the maturation of granule cells is delayed as witnessed by the alterations to the length and patterning of their dendritic trees and to the mossy fiber terminals. Together with an increase in neuronal death, these phenomena lead to a marked decrease in the number and disorganization of granule cells of the DG. Our results suggest that GSK3beta overexpression perturbs proliferation and maturation, resulting in the loss of immature neurons. In turn, the activation of microglia is stimulated in conjunction with a decrease in the birth of new functional neurons, leading to the deterioration of this structure. These data support the idea that by inducing degeneration of the DG, GSK3beta could be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.",
