     "AB": "Ovarian steroids have numerous effects on the brain throughout the life span, beginning during gestation and continuing into senescence. Ovarian steroids have widespread effects on catecholaminergic neurons and serotonergic pathways and on the basal forebrain cholinergic system. Another important action of ovarian hormones is the regulation of synapse turnover in the hippocampus as exhibited during the fourth or fifth day of a female rat's estrus cycle. In the human brain, estrogen replacement therapy is associated with improvements in episodic and declarative memory, which depend on the hippocampus, and is involved in the processing of emotional information. Because of their widespread influences on neuronal systems, ovarian steroids are important factors to consider in the treatment of depressive illness.",
