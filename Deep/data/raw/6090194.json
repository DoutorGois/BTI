     "AB": "Previous electrophysiological experiments in rabbits have suggested that medial septal stimulation activates dentate granule cells and evokes an associated negative field response at the granule cell layer, without an associated \"dendritic\" response. Anatomical studies have suggested that septal input to the granule cells may be to stratum moleculare, or close to the cell layer, or may not exist at all. The present experiments confirmed in rats anaesthetised with urethane that medial septal stimulation elicits single action potentials from cells in the granule layer. The associated negative field potential was maximal in the granule cell layer and there was no sign of a separate dendritic potential. The fibres responsible for this potential travel to the dorsal hippocampus in the fornix superior rather than the fimbria, taking the same course as the fibres which contribute to the dense cholinesterase staining just above the granule cell layer. Stimulation at 100 Hz for 1 s of either medial septal, or perforant path, input to the dentate granule cell layer produced long term potentiation of the subsequent evoked field responses to the stimulated pathway. The responses to the non-stimulated pathway were unchanged. Paired pulse stimulation produced both homosynaptic and heterosynaptic potentiation. These data suggest that medial septal input synapses close to granule cell bodies and produces a negative field potential which is a combination of dendritic and population spike potentials. Medial septal input also appeared to produce direct activation of hilar neurones, some of which may be basket cells or other interneurones. The data also show that long term potentiation is specific to this input, perhaps dependent on presynaptic mechanisms. Paired pulse potentiation, at least in the heterosynaptic case appears to depend on postsynaptic mechanisms.",
