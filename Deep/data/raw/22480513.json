     "AB": "AIMS: The aim of the present study is to investigate the status of proinflammatory cytokine in the brain of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) okadaic acid (OKA) induced memory impaired rat. MAIN METHODS: OKA (200 ng) intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) was administered in rats. Memory was assessed by Morris water maze test. Biochemical marker of neuroinflammation (TNF-alpha, IL-beta), total nitrite, mRNA (RT PCR) and protein expression (WB) of iNOS and nNOS were estimated in rat brain areas. KEY FINDINGS: OKA caused memory-impairment in rats with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and total nitrite in brain regions hippocampus and cortex. The expression of mRNA and protein of iNOS was increased while; the expressions were decreased in case of nNOS. Pretreatment with antidementic drugs donepezil (5 mg/kg, p.o.) and memantine (10 mg/kg, p.o) for 13 days protected i.c.v. OKA induced memory impairment and changes in level of TNF-alpha, IL-beta, total nitrite and expressions of iNOS and nNOS in OKA treated rat. SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests that neuroinflammation may play a vital role in OKA induced memory impairment.",
