Cells in normal rats responded more intensely to a conditioned stimulus when it was applied within 1 min from a previous one. The rats with lesions had smaller conditioned hippocampal responses and, in addition, there were no differences between responses to stimuli applied after short or long intertrial intervals. No effects on gross conditioned behavior were noticed.",
