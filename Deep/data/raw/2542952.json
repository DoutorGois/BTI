     "AB": "The influence of chronic vitamin D3 application on the concentration of the four calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin, the 28-kDa calbindin-D, calmodulin, and S-100 was studied in various brain regions and in the kidney. Young rats were administered daily 20,000 international units of vitamin D3 per kg (body weight) over a period of 4 months. This chronic treatment resulted in a clinically mild hypervitaminosis that did not affect the content of calmodulin, the 28-kDa calbindin-D, and S-100. Also the concentration of parvalbumin in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and kidney remained unchanged. On the other hand, parvalbumin was increased about 50% in the caudate putamen of hypervitaminotic animals as compared to controls. Our results indicate that the metabolism of parvalbumin in the caudate putamen can be influenced by variations of the blood level of this steroid hormone.",
