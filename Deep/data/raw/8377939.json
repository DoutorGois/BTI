     "AB": "In monolayer cultures of hippocampal neurons from newborn rats, an immunocytochemical quantitative study was carried out to investigate age-dependent arrangement of the neural cell adhesion molecules in different parts of cell membranes. On the fifth and 12th day in vitro, neural cell adhesion molecules were labelled with specific antibodies and protein A conjugated to colloidal gold particles. Samples of randomly selected electron micrographs that displayed labelled membrane fragments of cell bodies, growth cones, and axons were numerically analysed for the five- and 12-day in vitro neurons. Neural cell adhesion molecules surface topography was quantitatively described and compared, using a statistical stereological approach. The mean surface density of labelled neural cell adhesion molecules was found to be approximately 2.5 times higher in growth cone membranes relative to somatic and axonal membranes in five-day in vitro neurons. By the 12th day in vitro, this density decreases in somatic membranes (approximately 18%) and increases in axonal membranes (approximately 60%). Representative spectra of lateral intervals between labels as well as images that show typical topography of label on membrane surfaces were simulated. The results revealed regular patterns of neural cell adhesion molecules on the somatic surface and allowed consideration of neural cell adhesion molecules arrangement in a view of membrane adhesion properties. Participation of cytoskeleton in neural cell adhesion molecules rearrangement is discussed.",
