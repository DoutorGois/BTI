     "AB": "Truncated IGF-1 (tIGF-1), a form of IGF-1 identified in the human brain, has been suggested, from in vitro experiments, to exert neurotrophic effects on developing fetal brain tissue. We studied the effects of tIGF-1 and IGF-1 on small defined areas of the developing central nervous system by using the in vivo model of intraocular transplantation which allows for direct observations of graft survival and growth. Truncated IGF-1 was found to significantly enhance the growth of fetal spinal cord (Embryonic Day (E) 14) and parietal cortex (E16-17) grafts transplanted to the anterior chamber of the eye of adult rats. tIGF-1 increased the volume of cerebral cortex grafts by approximately 100% and of E14 spinal cord grafts by approximately 50%. E18 spinal cord grafts and hippocampal grafts were not stimulated by tIGF-1 as compared to controls given HSA. Effects in cortex were seen with tIGF-1 using concentrations down to at least 10 ng/microliters. Interestingly, intact IGF-1 had no effect on cortical grafts. These findings show for the first time, using an in vivo system, that tIGF-1 is a potent stimulator of growth of grafted fetal cortex cerebri and spinal cord and suggest a possible role for endogenous tIGF-1 in cortical and spinal cord development.",
