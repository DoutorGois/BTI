A significant fall in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was observed in the cortex, hippocampus and amygdala of the SDAT cases and was maximal in the temporal cortex. The fall in ChAT activity observed in the temporal cortex was accompanied by a significant reduction (47%) in immunoreactive somatostatin.",
