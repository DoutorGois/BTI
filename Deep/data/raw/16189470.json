     "AB": "For many diseases and injuries of the central nervous system, transplantation of neural progenitor cells is being evaluated as a possible treatment option. Although local, intravenous and subarachnoid injections have been reported as administration methods of neural progenitor cells, each of these methods has limitations. More effective and minimally invasive cell delivery systems are necessary for transplanting neural progenitor cells. In this study, we have developed a technique to form magnetically labeled neural progenitor cells for a magnetic targeting system. We demonstrated that neural progenitor cells can couple with magnetic beads, and that the labeled neural progenitor cells preserve the characteristics of non-labeled neural progenitor cells, and that they can be localized by magnetic force in vitro. Labeled neural progenitor cells have the potential to be used in magnetic targeting systems in-vivo models.",
