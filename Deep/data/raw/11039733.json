     "AB": "Recently, a new family of potassium channels with two pore domains in tandem and four transmembrane segments has been identified. Seven functional mammalian channels have been reported at this time. These channels give rise to baseline potassium currents because they are not gated by voltage and exhibit spontaneous activity at all membrane potentials. Although the physiological role of these ion channels has yet to be determined, three mammalian members of this family (TREK-1, TASK-1, TASK-2) are activated by volatile anesthetics and may therefore contribute to the central nervous system (CNS) depression produced by volatile anesthetics. In this study we used northern blot analysis and immunohistochemical localization to determine the expression of TASK-1 subunits in the CNS. TASK-1 immunoreactivity was prominently found in astrocytes of the hippocampus, in the median eminence, in the choroid plexus, and the granular layer, Purkinje cell layer, and molecular layer of the cerebellum. In the spinal cord, strong TASK-I immunoreactivity was seen in ependymal cells lining the central canal and in white matter. These findings suggest a role for the TASK-1 channel in the production of cerebrospinal fluid and function of hypothalamic neurosecretory cells.",
