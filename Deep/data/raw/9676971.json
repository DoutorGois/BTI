     "AB": "To examine whether the avian hippocampus-parahippocampus (HF) is necessary for nonspatial, paired-associate learning, as has been suggested for rodents, HF-lesioned and control homing pigeons were tested on a visual paired-associate learning task. Both groups learned equally well to discriminate trials that consisted of a stimulus preceded by its paired associate from trials that consisted of a stimulus preceded by stimuli from other paired associates (mispair trials), even when a mispair was experienced for the first time. The groups also learned equally well not to respond to 2 stimuli that were never rewarded. The results demonstrate that HF lesions do not impair nonspatial paired-associate learning in birds, suggesting that the role of HF in nonspatial cognition differs between birds and mammals.",
