     "AB": "The influence of cyclooxygenase inhibitors on functional stability of hippocampal slices, determined by electrophysiological criteria of recovery after slicing and long-term maintainence of population activity, was studied. Transient (3 min) treatment of slices during slicing with indomethacin (45 microM) or aspirin (0.5 mM) allowed registration of the population responses from the second minute. The activity reached 100% after 15 min incubation and could be registrated for 3 days under conditions of overnight hypothermia. The presence of the same drugs for the entire incubation period had the same effect. The present findings suggest that slicing is a crucial point for triggering of pathological events mediated by cyclooxygenase products and that blockade of cyclooxygenase provides for the further high longterm functional stability of brain slices.",
