     "AB": "The hippocampus is the only known brain region where physiological neurogenesis continues into adulthood across mammalian species and in humans. However, disease and injury can change the level of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which plays an important role in regulating cognitive and emotional abilities. Alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis can mediate treatment of mental illness or affect the brain's capacity for repair and regeneration. In the present review, we evaluate how adult neurogenesis contributes to the repair and regeneration of hippocampal circuitry in the face of diseases and injuries. We also discuss possible future directions for harnessing adult neurogenesis for therapeutic use.",
