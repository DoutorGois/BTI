     "AB": "Normally noradrenaline release ~30 min after training in the day-old chick is essential for memory consolidation by simultaneously increasing both glycogenolysis, by its stimulation of beta2-adrenergic (AR) receptors, and glycogen synthesis, by its stimulation of alpha2-AR receptors in astrocytes. At the same time noradrenaline stimulation of beta3-AR receptors increases glucose uptake solely in astrocytes. Intracerebral injection of small oligomeric beta-amyloid protein (Abeta1-42) (Abeta) 45 min before one-trial bead discrimination learning in day-old chicks abolishes consolidation of memory 30 min post-learning. The ensuing memory loss can be rescued by injection of selective beta3- and beta(2-AR agonists (CL316243 and zinterol), which also have the ability to consolidate weakly-reinforced learning into long-term memory. However, although CL316243 rescues Abeta-induced memory loss over a similar time period to when it consolidates weak learning (up to 25 min post training), zinterol is effective over a more limited time period and unexpectedly it does not rescue at the time it promotes glycogenolysis. Injection of Abeta into the hippocampus and the locus coeruleus (LoC) also produces similar memory deficits and injection of both AR agonists into a cortical area can rescue memory from LoC Abeta. We have previously shown that beta3-AR stimulation increases astrocytic glucose uptake and have suggested there may be sensitization or upregulation of the receptor. Since beta2-AR stimulation does not rescue memory at the time it promotes glycogenolysis, but the receptor does not appear to be impaired, it is suggested that Abeta may be causing an impairment in the synthesis of readily available glycogen.",
