     "AB": "The intraocular grafts of the septal or hippocampal embryonic tissues developing in the rat anterior eye chamber for three to four months were investigated by electron microscopy. The aim of this study was both the ultrastructural identification of the peripheral nervous fibers entering the grafts from host iris and the estimation of their capacity to establish true synaptic contacts with the central nervous system neurons of the grafts. The bundles of myelinated and unmyelinated axons, surrounded by the Schwann cell cytoplasm, were observed within the perivascular spaces of the ingrowing blood vessels. In the neuropil areas of the grafts, both types of the peripheral nervous fibers were also identified. It was demonstrated on the ultrastructural level that the unmyelinated axons lost their glial envelope of the Schwann cell and formed the typical asymmetric synapses with the dendrites and dendritic spines of the grafted neurons. The results are indicative of the high morpho-functional plasticity of both parts of the nervous system.",
