     "AB": "We investigated the effect of hyperthermic pretreatment before induction of ischemia using a gerbil model of 5-min forebrain ischemia. A single hyperthermic treatment 18 h before ischemia exhibited a partial protective effect, and repetitive hyperthermic pretreatments at 18-h intervals before ischemia showed clear protection against neuronal death in the CA1 area of the hippocampus, whereas single hyperthermic treatment 3, 6, 24, or 50 h before ischemia exhibited little protective effect. This transient and cumulative neuroprotective effect of hyperthermic pretreatment strongly suggested the involvement of stress reactions after hyperthermia in the protective mechanism against ischemic neuronal death.",
