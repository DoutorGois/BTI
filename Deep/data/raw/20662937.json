     "AB": "The Eag1 and Eag2, voltage-dependent potassium channels, and the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (Kcnn3) are highly expressed in limbic regions of the brain, where their function is still unknown. Eag1 co-localizes with tyrosine hydroxilase enzyme in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. Kcnn3 deficiency leads to enhanced serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission accompanied by distinct alterations in emotional behaviors. As exposure to stress is able to change the expression and function of several ion channels, suggesting that they might be involved in the consequences of stress, we aimed at investigating Eag 1, Eag2 and Kcnn3 mRNA expression in the brains of rats submitted to isolation rearing. As the long-lasting alterations in emotional and behavioral regulation after stress have been related to changes in serotonergic neurotransmission, expressions of serotonin Htr1a and Htr2a receptors in male Wistar rats' brain were also investigated. Rats were reared in isolation or in groups of five for nine weeks after weaning. Isolated and socially reared rats were tested for exploratory activity in the open field test for 5 min and brains were processed for reverse-transcription coupled to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Isolated reared rats showed decreased exploratory activity in the open field. Compared to socially reared rats, isolated rats showed reduced Htr2a mRNA expression in the striatum and brainstem and reduced Eag2 mRNA expression in all examined regions except cerebellum. To our knowledge, this is the first work to show that isolation rearing can change Eag2 gene expression in the brain. The involvement of this channel in stress-related behaviors is discussed.",
