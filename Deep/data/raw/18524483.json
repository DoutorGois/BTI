     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease, which primarily affects the elderly. Clinical signs of AD are characterized by the neuron loss and cognitive impairment. At gene and protein levels, the senescence-accelerated mouse/prone 8 (SAMP8) is a suitable animal model to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of age-related learning and memory deficits. Huang-Lian-Jie-Du decoction (HL), a well-known traditional Chinese medicinal prescription, has been employed in the treatment of wide range of disease conditions. Modern pharmacological studies have showed that HL possesses many effects, which include amelioration of learning and memory function of CNS. This paper investigated the gene expression patterns of hippocampus and cerebral cortex of SAMP8, which were treated with HL employing the cDNA microarray and real time quantitative RT-PCR techniques. The results showed that HL has the significant modulating effects on age-related changes of the gene expressions in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex in SAMP8, which include genes that involved in signal transduction (Dusp12, Rps6ka1, Rab26, Penk1, Nope, Leng8, Syde1, Phb, Def8, Ihpk1, Tac2, Pik3c2a), protein metabolism (Ttc3, Amfr, Prr6, Ube2d2), cell growth and development (Ngrn, Anln, Dip3b, Acrbp), nucleic acid metabolism (Fhit, Itm2c, Cstf2t, Ddx3x, Ercc5, Pcgfr6), energy metabolism (Stub1, Uqcr, Nsf), immune response (C1qb), regulation of transcription (D1ertd161e, Gcn5l2, Ssu72), transporter (Slc17a7, mt-Co1), nervous system development (Trim3), neurogila cell differentiation (Tspan2) and 24 genes whose biological function and process were still unknown. It was suggested by the changes of the 62 genes with HL treatment that the ameliorating effect of HL on the cognitive impairments of SAMP8 might be achieved by multi-mechanism and multi-targets.",
