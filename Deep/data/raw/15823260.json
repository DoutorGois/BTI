     "AB": "We investigated the effect of ketogenic diet (KD) on clusterin accumulation in the kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure model. Two days after KA administration, strong clusterin-like immunoreactivity (IR) was detected in the hippocampus in the normal diet (ND)-fed mice. But in the KD-fed mice, few clusterin-like IR was detected. These results indicate that KD has neuroprotective effects throughout diminishing nuclear clusterin accumulation that is involved in caspase-3 independent cell death mechanism.",
