     "AB": "We explored the capacity of exercise to impact select events comprising synaptic transmission under the direction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which may be central to the events by which exercise potentiates synaptic function. We used a specific immunoadhesin chimera (TrkB-IgG) that mimics the BDNF receptor, TrkB, to selectively block BDNF in the hippocampus during 3 days of voluntary wheel running. We measured resultant synapsin I, synaptophysin, and syntaxin levels involved in vesicular pool formation, endocytosis, and exocytosis, respectively. Synapsin I is involved in vesicle pool formation and neurotransmitter release, synaptophysin, in the biogenesis of synaptic vesicles and budding, and syntaxin, in vesicle docking and fusion. Exercise preferentially increased synapsin I and synaptophysin levels, without affecting syntaxin. There was a positive correlation between synapsin I and synaptophysin in exercising rats and synapsin I with the amount of exercise. Blocking BDNF abrogated the exercise-induced increases in synapsin I and synatophysin, revealing that exercise regulates select properties of synaptic transmission under the direction of BDNF.",
