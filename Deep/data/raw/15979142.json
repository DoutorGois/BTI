     "AB": "In a series of studies, we applied a neural network to study the neural bases of latent inhibition. We first designed a model able to handle behavioral data and then we investigated whether structures and neural elements in the brain were able to carry out the operations described by network. We demonstrated that the network was able to describe many of the behavioral properties of LI, and elucidate the effects of several manipulations of the dopaminergic system, the hippocampus, and the nucleus accumbens on LI, as well as some of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The results support the idea that a 'conceptual nervous system' can be successfully used to relate brain and behavior.",
