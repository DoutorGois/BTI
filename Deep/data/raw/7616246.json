     "AB": "In this study, we examined the effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) administration on cholinergic enzyme activity in both normal and ethylcholine mustard aziridinium (AF64A)-treated rats. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase activity were measured in the hippocampus and septum of rats chronically administered NGF (0.36-2.85 micrograms/day) into the lateral ventricle for 14 days. In both normal and AF64A-treated rats, NGF increased cholinergic enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, although NGF increased ChAT activity in normal rats by 147%, it had a greater effect in AF64A-treated rats, increasing ChAT activity as much as 273%. NGF increased acetylcholinesterase activity in normal rats by only 125% but produced a 221% increase in this activity in AF64A-treated rats. These data indicate that AF64A produces an increased sensitivity to NGF in cholinergic neurons.",
