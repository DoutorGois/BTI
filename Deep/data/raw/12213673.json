     "AB": "We demonstrate the rare disorder of triple H syndrome in a 25-year-old man. He was pointed out as having short stature, at -5.9 s.d., and diagnosed as GH deficient at 6 years old. Approximately a year ago, he noticed systematic hair loss. He lost body weight by 7 kg during the last half year. He was admitted to Jichi Medical School Hospital because of unconsciousness. Physical findings showed disturbance of consciousness with Japan Coma Scale I-3. He had emaciation and alopecia universalis. Laboratory findings showed plasma glucose was as low as 1.11 mmol/l. GH and ACTH deficiency with hypoadrenocorticism were clarified. His intelligence was in the low normal range with a WAIS IQ of 70, and anterograde amnesia was suggested in the presence of a little, but not significant, morphological change in the hippocampus on a magnetic resonance imaging scan. Replacement by a physiological dose of hydrocortisone normalized plasma glucose, and restored body weight and growth of hair during the 7 month therapeutic period. The present finding strongly supports a clinical entity of triple H syndrome, including ACTH deficiency, alopecia universalis and anterograde amnesia, and that there may be some variation of the triad among the subjects.",
