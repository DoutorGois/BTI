     "AB": "Ischemic damage to the brain, whether induced experimentally or observed clinically, often produces a pattern of delayed selective cell death in subfield CA1 of hippocampus which has been associated with significant neurologic deficits. The present study demonstrates that this selective vulnerability of CA1 neurons to ischemia, with relative preservation of their neighbors, is expressed in organotypic tissue culture and is prevented by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, MK-801. These data provide conclusive evidence that this selective cell death does not have a vascular etiology but is mediated by factors intrinsic to the hippocampal neurons and/or local circuitry. This model system provides an opportunity both to examine mechanisms of ischemic cell death in an avascular environment and to study methods of prevention in the absence of systemic variables.",
