     "AB": "We and others have previously shown that reactive microglia express the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II antigens in the hippocampus of patients suffering from epilepsy. Although the MHC glycoproteins serve as restriction elements for T lymphocytes, there is little information available regarding T lymphocytes in hippocampal sclerosis. In the present study, we investigated T lymphocyte infiltration in human hippocampi in four cases of epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, as well as in four control cases without neurological disease. No CD8- or CD4-positive T lymphocytes were seen in hippocampi from the control cases. In contrast, CD8- and CD4-positive T lymphocytes had infiltrated into the hippocampi of patients with hippocampal sclerosis. In addition, expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was diffusely upregulated in the hippocampi with hippocampal sclerosis. These results indicate that T lymphocyte infiltration is involved in the pathology of hippocampal sclerosis.",
