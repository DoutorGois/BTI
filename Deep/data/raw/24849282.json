     "AB": "The functional activation of Gi/o proteins coupled to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) was investigated with the conventional guanosine-5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio) triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding assay in rat brain membranes. The most efficacious stimulation elicited by acetylcholine or carbachol (CCh) was obtained in striatal membranes. The pharmacological properties of mAChR-mediated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding determined with a series of muscarinic agonists and antagonists were almost identical among the three brain regions investigated, i.e., cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, except for the apparent partial agonist effects of (alphaR)-alpha-cyclopentyl-alpha-hydroxy-N-[1-(4-methyl-3-pentenyl)-4-piperidinyl ]benzeneacetamide fumarate (J 104129) observed only in the hippocampus, but not in the other two regions. Among the muscarinic toxins investigated, only MT3 attenuated CCh-stimulated [(35)S] GTPgammaS binding. The highly selective allosteric potentiator at the M4 mAChR subtype, 3-amino-N-[(4-chlorophenyl)methyl]-4,6-dimethylthieno[2,3-b]pyridine-2-carboxamid e (VU 10010), shifted the concentration-response curve for CCh leftwards as well as upwards. On the other hand, neither thiochrome nor brucine N-oxide was effective. The increases induced by CCh and 5-HT were essentially additive, though not completely, indicating that the mAChRs and 5-HT1A receptors were coupled independently to distinct pools of Gi/o proteins. Collectively, all of the data suggest that functional activation of Gi/o proteins coupled to mAChRs, especially the M4 subtype, is detectable by means of CCh-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay in rat discrete brain regions.",
