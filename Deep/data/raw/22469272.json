     "AB": "Hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP) is known to promote differentiation of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. The HCNP precursor protein (HCNP-pp) may play several roles, for example, as an ATP-binding protein, a Raf kinase inhibitor protein, and a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein, as well as a precursor for HCNP. This study therefore aimed to elucidate the involvement of HCNP-pp in specific neural lineages after stroke using a hypoxic-ischemic (HI) rat model of brain ischemia. The specific neural lineages in the hippocampus were investigated 14 days after ischemia. Some bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)(+) neural progenitor cells in the hippocampus of hypoxic, HI, or sham-operated rats expressed HCNP-pp. Almost half of the BrdU(+)/HCNP-pp(+) cells also expressed the oligodendrocyte lineage marker 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase, whereas only a few BrdU(+)/HCNP-pp(+) cells in the hippocampus in HI brains expressed the neuronal lineage marker, doublecortin (DCX). Interestingly, no BrdU(+)/HCNP-pp(+) progenitor cells in hypoxic, HI, or sham-operated brains expressed the astrocyte lineage marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein. Together with previous in vitro data, the results of this study suggest that the expression level of HCNP-pp regulates the differentiation of neural progenitor cells into specific neural lineages in the HI hippocampus, indicating that neural stem cell fate can be controlled via the HCNP-pp mediating pathway.",
