     "AB": "Rats with kainate-colchicine hippocampal lesions (HL) and controls (C) were initially trained in the Morris water maze with procedures that deterred their prepotent thigmotaxic response. Training began with an escape platform that occupied nearly the entire pool. The area to which the rats could escape was made smaller by substituting smaller platforms as training progressed. In contrast to standard procedures, HL rats and C rats showed comparable performance during acquisition and preferentially searched the goal quadrant on probe trials during which the platform was removed. In a follow-up experiment, the platform was moved to a random position along the wall, which required a switch to a thigmotaxic response for most effective escape. HL rats that were thigmotaxic before place training did not switch to a thigmotaxic response as readily as did controls, behavior consistent with the view that hippocampal damage reduces pliancy.",
