     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Pingyu capsule on such important regulatory factors as cAMP, PKA and PKC of the signal transduction in rats with chronic stress-induced depression. METHOD: Wistar male rats were randomly divided into control group, model group, paroxetine group, and Pingyu capsule low, middle and high doses groups; rats in all groups but the control group were fed in single cage for 21 days and were given such irritations as lightening stroke on pelma, ice water swimming, pyretic fumigation and tail clipping during this period; lobe cortex and hippocampus of all rats were taken out for detection of the cAMP content by means of radioactive immunization, PKA and PKC content by Elisa, and the PKA and PKC activity by radioactive isotope. RESULT: Content of cAMP in lobe cortex and hippocampus, content and activity of PKA in hippocampus, and content of PKC in lobe cortex of rats in the model group were lower than those in the normal group. Pingyu capsule and paroxetine can increase them. CONCLUSION: The anti-depression effect of Pingyu capsule maybe related to its function of adjusting the signal transduction of cAMP-PKA.",
