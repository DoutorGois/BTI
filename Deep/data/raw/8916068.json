     "AB": "The 4-vessel occlusion model of ischaemia in the rat was used to assess the effects of two dopaminergic agonists, lisuride and piribedil, on some behavioural and histological changes. Animals were either sham-operated, subjected to 20 min 4-vessel occlusion, or administered lisuride (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) or piribedil (10 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h before 20 min 4-vessel occlusion. Both drugs attenuated deficits in neurological testing, Morris water maze and 14-unit T-maze (p < 0.05). Extensive neuronal death was observed in the CA1, CA3 and CA4 regions of the hippocampus of 4-vessel-occluded animals. Pretreatment with both lisuride and piribedil provided protection against cell death in the hippocampal regions. These findings suggest dopamine may play a role in cerebral ischaemia and dopaminergic agonists may be beneficial in preventing ischaemia-induced neurodegeneration.",
