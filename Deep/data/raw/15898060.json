     "AB": "In humans and rodents, multiple ERbeta variants with sizes ranging from 477-549 amino acids (aa) have been described. The identification of these variants in target tissues has important implications for estrogen signaling and cellular responsiveness. Western blot analysis using two anti-ERbeta antibodies specific for mammalian ERbeta sequences (PA1-310B and PA1-311) was employed to examine ERbeta protein expression in neural tissues from ovariectomized (OVX) cynomolgus macaques and CF-1 mice as well as to assess potential regulatory effects of acute and extended estradiol (E(2)) treatment. In hypothalamic extracts from both species, a single ERbeta immunoreactive (ERbeta-ir) band was detected at approximately 54 kDa, corresponding to the expected molecular weight for ERbeta477 and/or 485. In cynomolgus females, oral E(2) administration for 16 weeks had no apparent effect on hypothalamic ERbeta protein expression. In mouse, a single injection of E(2) did not change hypothalamic ERbeta protein levels 1.5, 4, 8, 16, or 24 h after injection. Extending the hormonal treatment to 4 or 21 days in OVX female mice also had no effect on the level of hypothalamic ERbeta protein. Additional regional analyses in female mouse brain with PA1-310B antibody showed that a second, 59 kDa ERbeta-ir band was present in cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and amygdala that could represent one or both of the larger ERbeta variants (530 and 549aa). The expression level of the second ERbeta isoform exhibited regional variation, with the strongest immunoreactivity detected in cortex and amygdala. Elucidating the functions of these ERbeta isoforms in the CNS will facilitate our understanding of the tissue- and promoter-specific actions of estrogen.",
