     "AB": "A sensitive LC-MS/MS method with a simple solid-phase extraction for the determination of acteoside in rat plasma and tissue homogenates was established for the investigation of bioavailability and brain distribution in freely-moving rats. Acteoside in Cistanche deserticola and Boschniakia rossica was also determined. Acteoside and internal standard were separated on a RP-select B column (125mmx4.6mm i.d., particle size 5microm). The mobile phase consisted of 35% methanol and 65% acetic acid-water (1:100, v/v) at a flow-rate of 1mL/min. Acteoside and the internal standard were monitored using the multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode at m/z transitions of 623-->161 and 609-->301, respectively. The acteoside content was 38.4+/-2.4mg/kg (n=3) for B. rossica, which is obviously lower than 21134.2+/-805.5mg/kg (n=3) of C. deserticola. The protein binding in rat plasma was 75.5+/-1.8%. The brain distribution result indicated that acteoside was evenly distributed in brain tissues (brain stem, cerebellum, the rest of the brain, cortex, hippocampus and striatum) which was about 0.45-0.68% of that in plasma (4.5+/-0.5microg/mL) after 15min of acteoside administration (10mg/kg, i.v.). After acteoside was given (3mg/kg, i.v.; 100mg/kg, p.o.), the oral bioavailability (AUC(p.o.)/dose(p.o.))/(AUC(i.v.)/dose(i.v.)) was only 0.12%.",
