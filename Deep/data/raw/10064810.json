     "AB": "Using immunohistochemistry and immunoblots, we show that alterations in hippocampal microtubule-associated protein-2 appear to be highly correlated with contextual memory as measured by significantly heightened fear responses. Compared to naive controls, rats trained in a novel context showed significantly increased immunostaining for the high molecular weight microtubule-associated protein-2a/b. This increase was observed 2 weeks after training and it was selective for hippocampal CA1 and CA2 pyramidal cells. Pre-exposure to the training context one month before training altered the hippocampal microtubule-associated protein-2 response; in these animals only the dentate gyrus showed significantly increased microtubule-associated protein-2a/b. Training-related increases in immunohistochemical staining for microtubule-associated protein-2 suggested that there was an increase in overall intact protein, an increase in immunoreactive breakdown products, or changes in protein compartmentalization. Immunoblots of hippocampal homogenates reacted with monoclonal antibodies to microtubule-associated protein-2a/b showed an increased presence of breakdown products in trained animals compared to untrained controls. Additional immunoblot studies demonstrated statistically significant decreases in the levels and/or phosphorylation state of the low molecular weight microtubule-associated protein-2c in the hippocampus of trained animals as compared to that of controls. These alterations in microtubule-associated protein-2 may reflect dendritic remodeling related to contextual memory storage.",
