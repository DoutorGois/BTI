     "AB": "The constituents of Ginkgo biloba leaf extract, ginkgolides A, B, C and J are known as effective antagonists of platelet-activating factor (PAF). Here, we will demonstrate that these substances are also effective blockers of glycine-activated chloride channels in the hippocampal neurons of rat. As examined in several other voltage- and ligand-operated channels, this ginkgolide action is selective. The blocking action of all tested ginkgolides is use-dependent--they block open glycine-activated channels. The IC (50) values for saturating blocking action of ginkgolides B and C are 0.273 microM and 0.267 microM, respectively, while ginkgolides A and J are less effective--IC (50) values are 1.97 microM and 2.0 microM. Corresponding dose-response relationships are close to single-site binding isotherms. Another constituent of EGb 761, bilobalide, is a weak inhibitor of NMDA receptor-activated current. Its synthetic analogue, NV-31, demonstrates a weak facilitatory action on Gly-activated conductance. Novel findings have indicated the possibility that the unique modulating activity profiles of the EGb 761 (definition see editorial) constituents examined are due to their effects on the anion homeostasis of central neurons.",
