     "AB": "A procedure was developed to conduct simultaneously immunocytochemical and neurochemical studies on the serotonergic system in adjacent 300-micron-thick slices of rat hippocampus. This procedure was applied to correlate morphological (innervation pattern and density), neurochemical (5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid levels and [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine uptake and release) and behavioral (spatial learning) effects of neurotoxin-induced denervation and reinnervation by grafting fetal mesencephalic raphe cells. Intracerebroventricular injections of a low dose of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine caused a discrete serotonergic denervation of the hippocampus. Eleven months after lesioning, 5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid levels and [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine uptake capacity were decreased by 50-60%. By this time, the residual fibers displayed an enhanced vulnerability towards K(+)-induced depolarization. Grafting of a fetal raphe cell suspension resulted in a reinnervation of the host hippocampus. The pattern of reinnervation was comparable to control innervation and the density was supranormal at the level of the graft. As observed semiquantitatively, the innervation density decreased with distance from the core of the graft. Neurochemical studies showed that the fibers were capable of synthesizing, metabolizing and releasing 5-hydroxytryptamine. The turnover of 5-hydroxytryptamine in both the denervated and the reinnervated hippocampus was comparable to that in control tissue. Previous behavioral testing of the denervated and of the denervated and implanted animals did not reveal any effect on spatial learning, either in an individual or in a social test paradigm. The latter data substantiate the notion that interference with the hippocampal serotonergic innervation does not hamper adequate spatial learning.",
