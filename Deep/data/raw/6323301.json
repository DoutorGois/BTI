     "AB": "Three days after the subcutaneous implant of a dexamethasone pellet, which depletes both corticosterone and ACTH, normal rats showed impaired acquisition of a two-way avoidance task. Rats who had received systemic 6-hydroxydopamine at birth to lesion the forebrain noradrenergic terminals from the locus coeruleus did not show this impairment. After a single injection of metyrapone, which inhibits corticosterone synthesis and increases ACTH release, both intact and norepinephrine (NE)-depleted rats showed impaired avoidance acquisition. After the seventh injection, however, acquisition in normal rats was no longer impaired by the drug while the NE-depleted rats were still deficient. These results indicate that the simple combination of forebrain NE loss with reduced corticosterone levels does not necessarily retard avoidance acquisition. Rather, they suggest that the NE efferents from the locus coeruleus are essential for the brain's adaptation to at least some behavioral consequences of changes in the circulating level of ACTH.",
