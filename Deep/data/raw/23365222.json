     "AB": "Acid-sensing ion channel-1a (ASIC1a) is localized in brain regions with high synaptic density and is thought to contribute to synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. A prominent hypothesis is that activation of postsynaptic ASICs promotes depolarization, thereby augmenting N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor function and contributing to the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). However, evidence for activation of postsynaptic ASICs during neurotransmission has not been established. Here, we re-examined the role of ASIC1a in LTP in the hippocampus using pharmacological and genetic approaches. Our results showed that a tarantula peptide psalmotoxin, which profoundly blocked ASIC currents in the hippocampal neurons, had no effect on LTP. Similarly, normal LTP was robustly generated in ASIC1a-null mice. A further behavioral analysis showed that mice lacking ASIC1a had normal performance in hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. In summary, our results indicate that ASIC1a is not required for hippocampal LTP and spatial memory. We therefore propose that the role of ASIC1a in LTP and spatial learning should be reassessed.",
