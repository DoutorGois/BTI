     "AB": "In pentobarbital anesthetized Wistar rats and tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) the hypothalamus, the hippocampus and the amygdala were simultaneously superfused through push-pull cannulae with artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Blood samples were withdrawn in order to make an attempt to correlate release rates of noradrenaline (NA), adrenaline and dopamine in the above-mentioned areas with plasma catecholamine levels. A strong, positive correlation was found between NA release in central amygdala and NA concentrations in peripheral blood suggesting a functional relationship between noradrenergic systems in discrete brain areas and the activity of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system.",
