     "AB": "We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of combined treatment of Abeta-immunization with simvastatin in an Alzheimer mouse model at age 22 months. DNA prime-adenovirus boost immunization induced modest anti-Abeta titers and simvastatin increased the seropositive rate. Abeta-KLH was additionally administered to boost the titers. Irrespective of simvastatin, the immunization did not decrease cerebral Abeta deposits but increased soluble Abeta and tended to exacerbate amyloid angiopathy in the hippocampus. The immunization increased cerebral invasion of leukocytes and simvastatin counteracted the increase. Thus, modest anti-Abeta titers can increase soluble Abeta and simvastatin may reduce inflammation associated with vaccination in aged Alzheimer mouse models.",
