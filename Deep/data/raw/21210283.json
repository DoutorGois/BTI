     "AB": "Immunocytochemistry for transactive response binding protein-43 (TDP43) was assessed in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus in 250 cases displaying hippocampal pathology identified by haematoxylin-eosin staining. 18%, nearly one in five displayed TDP43 immunoreactive pathology in the granular cell layer of hippocampus. This percentage increased to 43% when only subjects with hippocampal pathology other than vascular in origin were included. When only subjects with severe Alzheimer's disease-related pathology were included, 42% displayed TDP43-immunoreactive pathology, increasing to 60% when concomitant Alzheimer's disease and alpha-synuclein pathology were present. Within this setting, TDP43-immunoreactive pathology was observed to be present in 6% of subjects with hippocampal pathology but without any cognitive impairment. Our findings justify assessment of TDP43 pathology in every case where a pathological alteration is observed in the hippocampus using a routine stain.",
