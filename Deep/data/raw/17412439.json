     "AB": "Bisphenol A (BPA) has been shown to interfere with thyroid hormone receptors (THRs) and to influence the expression of THR-responsive elements in vivo and in vitro, while some studies reported hyperactivity induced by BPA treatment. In the present study, our purpose was to investigate the effect of BPA exposure on behavioral alteration and its mechanism of action, especially focusing on the thyroid hormone pathway. Significant sexual difference on behaviors was observed in perinatal BPA exposure, as manifested by hyperactivity and impaired spatial learning/memory in male pups after matured. Dams treated with 0.1mg/l BPA showed transient hypothyroidism, while male pups were found to exhibit a transient hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism. Furthermore, significant up-regulated expression levels of mRNA and protein of SRC-1 in the hippocampus were observed in male pups by 0.1mg/l BPA treatment. However the expression of THRalpha/beta and RC3/neurogranin were not affected by BPA treatment. These results indicate that perinatal BPA exposure at a very low level may influence thyroid function and then consequently affects brain development, but at the same time, suggest that thyroid hormone receptor may not be a direct target of BPA action, but instead, another factor may be involved in this action.",
