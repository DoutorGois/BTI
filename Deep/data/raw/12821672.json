     "AB": "Tau hyperphosphorylation, leading to self-aggregation, is widely held to underlie the neurofibrillary degeneration found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. However, it is unclear exactly what environmental factors may trigger this pathogenetic tau hyperphosphorylation. From several perspectives, the coagulation serine protease, thrombin, has been implicated in AD and activates several different protein kinase pathways but has not previously been shown how it may contribute to AD pathogenesis. Here we report that nanomolar thrombin induced rapid tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation in murine hippocampal neurons via protease-activated receptors, which was followed by delayed synaptophysin reduction and apoptotic neuronal death. Mechanistic study revealed that a persistent thrombin signaling via protease-activated receptor 4 and prolonged downstream p44/42 mitogenactivated protein kinase activation are at least in part responsible. These results pathogenetically linked thrombin to subpopulations of AD and other tauopathies associated with cerebrovascular damage. Such knowledge may be instrumental in transforming therapeutic paradigms.",
