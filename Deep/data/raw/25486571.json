     "AB": "Stress regulates a panel of important physiological functions and disease states. Epinephrine is produced under stresses threaten to homeostasis. Thioredoxin-1(Trx-1) is a redox regulating protein which is induced to resist stresses and related with various diseases. Thus, it is important to examine whether Trx-1 is induced by epinephrine and to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that Trx-1 modulates epinephrine stress. Here, we show that the expression of Trx-1 was induced by epinephrine via beta-adrenergic receptor/Cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway in PC12 cells. The down-regulation of Trx-1 by siRNA aggravated accumulation of gamma-H2AX and further decreased expression of p53 by epinephrine. Accordingly, Trx-1 overexpression alleviated accumulation of gamma-H2AX and restored the expressions of p53 and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in the cortex, hippocampus and thymus of mice. Moreover, Trx-1 overexpression reduced the malondialdehyde concentration by epinephrine. We further explored the mechanism on p53 and gamma-H2AX regulated by Trx-1. We found that overexpression of Trx-1 suppressed beta-arrestin-1 expression through interaction with beta-arrestin-1. Consequently, the downregulation of beta-arrestin-1 suppressed the cell viability and the expressions of gamma-H2AX and cyclin D1, and increased p53 expression. Taken together, our data suggest that Trx-1/beta-arrestin-1 interaction may represent a novel endogenous mechanism on protecting against stress.",
