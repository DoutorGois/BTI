     "AB": "Prostaglandin H synthase (PHS)-2 (COX-2) is implicated in the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Multiple mechanisms may be involved, including PHS-catalyzed bioactivation of neurotransmitters, precursors, and metabolites to neurotoxic free radical intermediates. Herein, in vitro studies with the purified PHS-1 (COX-1) isoform and in vivo studies of aging PHS-1 knockout mice were used to evaluate the potential neurodegenerative role of PHS-1-catalyzed bioactivation of endogenous neurotransmitters to free radical intermediates that enhance reactive oxygen species formation and oxidative DNA damage. The brains of 2-year-old wild-type (+/+) PHS-1 normal and heterozygous (+/-) and homozygous (-/-) PHS-1 knockout mice were analyzed for 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine formation, characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection and by immunohistochemistry. Compared to aging PHS-1(+/+) normal mice, aging PHS-1(-/-) knockout mice had less oxidative DNA damage in the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brain stem. This PHS-1-dependent oxidative damage was not observed in young mice. In vitro incubation of purified PHS-1 and 2'-deoxyguanosine with dopamine, L-DOPA, and epinephrine, but not glutamate or norepinephrine, enhanced oxidative DNA damage. These results suggest that PHS-1-dependent accumulation of oxidatively damaged macromolecules including DNA may contribute to the mechanisms and risk factors of aging-related neurodegeneration.",
