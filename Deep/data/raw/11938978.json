     "AB": "The learning-memory behavior was tested in mice on a Y-maze after drinking different concentration of sodium fluoride. The impairment on the structure of Gray 1 synaptic interface in the CA3 area of mice hippocampus were quantitatively analyzed by electron microscopy and computer image processing appliance. The main results are as follows: the learning ability of mice drinking high concentration of fluoride presented remarkable deterioration, the thickness of post-synaptic density (PSD) was decreased, and the width of synaptic cleft was remarkably increased. The results suggested that the impairment on the learning capability induced by fluorosis may be closely related with the pathological changes of synaptic structure in the brain of mice.",
