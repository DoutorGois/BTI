     "AB": "Despite the widespread view of the brain as a large complex network, the dynamicity of the brain network over the course of a day has yet to be explored. To investigate whether the spontaneous human brain network maintains long-term stability throughout a day, we evaluated the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of results from an independent component analysis (ICA), seed correlation analysis, and graph-theoretical analysis of resting state functional MRI, acquired from 12 young adults at three-hour intervals over 24 consecutive hours. According to the ICC of the usage strength of the independent network component defined by the root mean square of the temporal weights of the network components, the default mode network centered at the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, the superior parietal, and secondary motor networks showed a high temporal stability throughout the day (ICC>0.5). However, high intra-individual dynamicity was observed in the default mode network, including the anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex or posterior-anterior cingulate cortex, the hippocampal network, and the parietal and temporal networks. Seed correlation analysis showed a highly stable (ICC>0.5) extent of functionally connected regions from the posterior cingulate cortex, but poor stability from the hippocampus throughout the day. Graph-theoretical analysis using local and global network efficiency suggested that local brain networks are temporally stable but that long-range integration behaves dynamically in the course of a day. These results imply that dynamic network properties are a nature of the resting state brain network, which remains to be further researched.",
