     "AB": "To separate the direct pharmacological effects of cocaine from those associated with active drug self-administration we employed a yoked control-operant paradigm and investigated the expression of well established markers of the rapid action of cocaine, i.e. the inducible early genes Arc and Zif268 and trophic factors, i.e. brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), in rats after a single intravenous (i.v.) cocaine self-administration session. Animals self-administering cocaine (SA, 0.25 mg/0.1 ml saline per infusion, 2-h session) did more active lever-presses than yoked-cocaine (YC) and yoked-vehicle (YV) animals. This goal-oriented behaviour was accompanied by a selective increase in Arc mRNA levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). There were no changes in the expression of the other genes in this brain region. mRNA levels of Arc and Zif268 in striatum and Zif268 in the nucleus accumbens markedly increased both in SA and YC animals; but there was no change in the expression of FGF-2 and BDNF. No changes were observed in hippocampus, hypothalamus, frontal cortex, and midbrain in SA and YC animals compared to YV animals in any of the genes. These findings demonstrate that a single session of cocaine i.v. self-administration is sufficient to shape rat behaviour towards goal-directed behaviours and selectively up-regulate Arc expression in mPFC (of SA animals), providing the first evidence that the mPFC's function is already profoundly influenced by the first voluntary cocaine exposure.",
