     "AB": "In vitro experiments have indicated that the perirhinal cortex is highly excitable and its relationship to the basolateral amygdala and piriform cortex is altered by previous amygdala or dorsal hippocampal kindling. As a result, we felt it was important to assess the excitability of the perirhinal cortex in vivo by comparing its kindling profile to that of the basal amygdala, piriform cortex or dorsal hippocampus. We observed that the after-discharge (AD) threshold of the perirhinal cortex was higher than the other 3 structures but the AD duration was not different. Subsequently, the perirhinal cortex kindled more rapidly than the other 3 structures, and with extremely short latencies to onset of forelimb clonus. With the view that synchronized discharge in the perirhinal-piriform area provides the critical trigger for limbic kindled convulsions, the relationship of kindling rate and convulsion latencies and durations between the 4 structures was discussed.",
