     "AB": "Changes in the thiol/disulphide status in the neonatal rat brain were evaluated after an episode of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in 7-day-old rats. The glutathione level decreased in the post-HI period. The lowest values (43-68%) were obtained 24 h post-HI. A statistically significant difference first appeared in hippocampus, immediately after the HI event, and only 12 h later in striatum and cortex. On the 7th day post-HI the glutathione content was completely recovered in the hippocampus and the striatum, and partially in the cortex. The glutathione loss could not be explained through its conversion to glutathione disulphide or to protein mixed disulphide (S-thiolation), whose values remained constant. Furthermore, we found a consistent decrease (20-30%) in protein thiols, which were not recovered after 7 days post-HI. Perturbations in protein thiols, along with the glutathione loss, may represent a valuable marker of immature rat brain damage.",
