     "AB": "Recovery of finger movements after hemiparetic stroke has been shown to involve sensorimotor brain areas in perilesional and remote locations. Hand use, however, critically depends on visual guidance in such patients with stroke lesions in the middle cerebral artery territory. Using regional cerebral blood flow measurements, we wished to identify interrelated brain areas that are engaged in relation to manual activity in seven patients after their first hemiparetic brain infarction. During the blind-folded performance of sequential finger movements, the patients differed significantly from healthy controls (n = 7) by the recruitment of a predominantly contralesional network involving visual cortical areas, prefrontal cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Greater expression of this cortical-subcortical network correlated with a more severe sensorimotor deficit in the acute stage after stroke reflecting its role for post-stroke recovery. Patients also differed from controls on a lesion-related pattern expressed during rest. A third differentiating pattern involved the ipsilesional supplementary motor area and the contralesional premotor cortex. Our results suggest that post-stroke recovery form impaired sensorimotor integration utilizes crossmodal plasticity of a visual network.",
