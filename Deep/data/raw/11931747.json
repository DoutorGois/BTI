     "AB": "The functional roles of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in the developed CNS have been enigmatic. Here we show that striatal enriched tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) is a component of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complex. Functionally, exogenous STEP depressed NMDAR single-channel activity in excised membrane patches. STEP also depressed NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents whereas inhibiting endogenous STEP enhanced these currents. In hippocampal slices, administering STEP into CA1 neurons did not affect basal glutamatergic transmission evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation but prevented tetanus-induced long-term potentiation (LTP). Conversely, inhibiting STEP in CA1 neurons enhanced transmission and occluded LTP induction through an NMDAR-, Src-, and Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism. Thus, STEP acts as a tonic brake on synaptic transmission by opposing Src-dependent upregulation of NMDARs.",
