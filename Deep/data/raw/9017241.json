     "AB": "Of the three genes encoding the Ca2+ transport ATPases of the endoplasmic reticulum, the SERCA2 gene is the major isoform expressed in the mammalian brain. The SERCA2 transcript is alternatively processed generating two protein isoforms: SERCA2a which is expressed in cardiac and slow-skeletal muscle, and SERCA2b, the house-keeping isoform which is ubiquitously expressed. We have studied the expression of SERCA2 in the cat brain, and at a less refined level also in the rat brain, using antibodies specific for either SERCA2a or SERCA2b. The SERCA2a staining was very restricted. The SERCA2a antibody clearly labeled the cell body of the Purkinje neurons and weakly stained the giant cells of the gigantocellular reticular nuclei. In contrast, the SERCA2b isoform was found in most regions of the brain. It appeared to be largely confined to neuronal cells. Neuroglial cells were negative. The antibody stained the cell body. In heavily labeled cells such as the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and of the cerebral cortex, it also stained the proximal portion of the dendrites. The most intense labeling was observed in the Purkinje neurons, which were stained all over the cell including the distal ramifications of the dendritic tree. Remarkably the SERCA2b labeling in neuronal cells of the hypothalamic area and the substantia nigra was very weak. The possible physiological significance of these results is discussed.",
