     "AB": "The paper deals with the influence of synthetic vasopressin analogue--desglycine-arginine vasopressin (DG-AVP) on the content of RNA and fractional composition of chromatin proteins in the tissue of neocortex and hippocampus of intact white rats and after establishing of two-way avoidance reflex. Administration of the peptide alone significantly increased RNA content in hippocampal tissue, injection of the peptide 10 min before conditioning did not lead to significant changes in RNA quantity as compared to that in animals in which the conditioned reflex was established against the background of saline administration. In neocortical tissue neither learning itself nor administration of DG-AVP alone was accompanied by significant changes in RNA content, while learning against the background of peptide injection significantly increased RNA in that structure. In hippocampal and neocortical tissues quantitative changes were observed in certain fractions of chromatin proteins in all animal groups studied.",
