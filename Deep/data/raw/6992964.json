Six other members of her family in two generations have also died of progressive presenile dementing illnesses of Alzheimer type, lasting 5-10 years. Autopsies showed a post-viral temporal lobe encephalopathy in one and spongiform (C-J) lesions in another. Neuropathological studies in this family add weight to the idea that Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease represent different manifestations of a genetic predisposition to \"slow virus\" encephalopathies.",
