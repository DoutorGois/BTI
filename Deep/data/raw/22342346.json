     "AB": "T-817MA [1-{3-[2-(1-benzothiophen-5-yl)ethoxy]propyl}azetidin-3-ol maleate] is a newly synthesized neuroprotective agent for the treatment of psychiatric disorders characterized by cognitive disturbances, such as Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive impairment has also been suggested to be a cardinal feature of schizophrenia. We sought to determine whether T-817MA would ameliorate sensorimotor gating deficits and loss of parvalbumin (PV)-positive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons in the brain of rats transiently exposed to MK-801, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor blocker, in the neonatal stage, as an animal model of schizophrenia. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) was examined in rats treated neonatally with MK-801 (postnatal day; PD 7-10, 0.2 mg/kg/day, s.c.) or vehicle at PD 35 and PD 63. The number of PV-positive GABAergic neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus was measured after the behavioral assessments. T-817MA (10 or 20 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered for 14 days (on PD 49-62). Administration of T-817MA at 20 mg/kg, but not 10 mg/kg, ameliorated PPI deficits and completely reversed the decrease in the number of PV-positive GABAergic neurons in rats given MK-801. These results indicate that T-817MA may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of cognitive deficits of schizophrenia.",
