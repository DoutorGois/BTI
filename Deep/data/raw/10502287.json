     "AB": "Results from different experimental systems demonstrate that increased oxidative damage plays a role in normal aging and age-associated pathology. In the current study, long-term cultures of hippocampal neurons were examined as a model system. It was established that neuronal survival in long-term culture decreases according to the Gompertz law and that neuronal \"aging in the dish\" is associated with increased oxidative damage of cell proteins. The increase of protein carbonyl formation in aged neurons was demonstrated both by Western blot analysis for oxidized proteins and by in situ immunocytochemical method, which was developed to analyze protein oxidation in fixed cells. In aging neuronal cultures, a gradual increase in creatine kinase (CK) content but decreased activity of enzyme per immunoreactive protein was found, suggesting the accumulation of inactive CK molecules. The increase in CK content was not a result of generalized protein elevation, since analysis of beta-actin content showed a time-dependent loss, probably reflecting decreased number of cellular processes with aging. These findings, showing \"aging in a dish,\" consistent with the notion that aging is associated with increased protein oxidation, provide a system for study of age-related neurodegenerative disorders associated with oxidative stress.",
