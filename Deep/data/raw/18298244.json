     "AB": "An experiment was designed to evaluate effects of dorsal hippocampus, dorsal CA3a,b, dorsal CA1, and control lesions on performance of a temporal sequence task. Rats were trained on a sequential learning task involving six spatial locations on a radial 8-arm maze. After initial training followed by surgery, it was found that all lesioned animals were able to remember the sequence. To test temporal sequence completion, rats were started at different positions in the sequence and expected to complete the remainder of the sequence. The results indicate that control rats had no difficulty completing the sequence, regardless of starting point. In contrast, rats with dorsal hippocampus and dorsal CA3a,b lesions made errors by always returning to the first position in the sequence, regardless of which start position was used, whereas rats with dorsal CA1 lesions made random errors in the process of completing the sequence and did not appear to remember the serial order of the spatial sequence. This suggests that the dorsal hippocampus, and specifically the dorsal CA3 in conjunction with CA1, may be involved in temporal pattern completion processes.",
