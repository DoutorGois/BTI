     "AB": "Monkeys with unilateral ablations of the inferotemporal (IT) cortex were not impaired on learning or retention of single-pair object discriminations or visuovisual conditional tasks. Addition of an excitotoxic hippocampal lesion to the hemisphere opposite to the IT ablation impaired retention and acquisition of single-pair object discriminations and visuovisual conditional tasks. Histology revealed no areas of bilaterally symmetrical damage. Previous experiments have shown that bilateral excitotoxic hippocampal lesions do not impair single-pair object discriminations although they do produce a substantial impairment on visuovisual conditional tasks. Bilateral IT ablations produce impairment on single-pair object discrimination tasks. It is argued that the hippocampus in the hemisphere with the IT ablation is deprived of feed-forward visual input and that this, in addition to the contralateral hippocampal lesion, accounts for the impairment on the visuovisual conditional tasks. It is also argued that feed-back projections from the hippocampus to the IT cortex influence the learning of single-pair object discriminations. This influence may be difficult to demonstrate by the addition of hippocampal lesions to IT lesions because of the substantial effect of the IT lesion alone. It may be difficult to demonstrate by bilateral hippocampal lesions alone since the effect may be below that which generates an observable impairment. Nonetheless, an effect may be seen when a hippocampal lesion is made in monkeys with some IT damage, as in this experiment, as well as by the general observation that large lesions of the temporal lobes produce larger perceptuo-mnemonic impairments than lesions confined to the hippocampus or temporal neocortex in monkeys and man.",
