     "AB": "To test theories of explicit memory in amnesia, we examined the effect of hypoxia on memory performance in a group of 56 survivors of sudden cardiac arrest. Structural equation modeling revealed that a single-factor explanation of recall and recognition was insufficient to account for performance, thus contradicting single-process models of explicit memory. A dual-process model of recall in which two processes (e.g., declarative memory and controlled search) contribute to recall performance, whereas only one process (e.g., declarative memory) underlies recognition performance, also failed to explain the results adequately. In contrast, a dual-process model of recognition provided an acceptable account of the data. In this model, two processes--recollection and familiarity--underlie recognition memory, whereas only the recollection process contributes to free recall. The best-fitting model was one in which hypoxia and aging led to deficits in recollection, but left familiarity unaffected. Moreover, a controlled search process was correlated with recollection, but was not associated with familiarity or the severity of hypoxia. The results support models of explicit memory in which recollection depends on the hippocampus and frontal lobes, whereas familiarity-based recognition relies on other brain regions.",
