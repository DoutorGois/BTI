     "AB": "Animals were trained on an item recognition memory task for a list of 5 spatial locations. After reaching criterion performance the animals sustained small or medium-size dorsal hippocampal formation lesions, small or large medial septal lesions, or served as sham-operated or cortical controls. Following recovery from surgery, animals were retested for item recognition memory. Sham-operated and cortical control animals showed no deficits in performance. In contrast, animals with small dorsal hippocampal formation or medial septal lesions displayed a deficit for the early items, but had excellent memory for the last item of the list. Animals with medium-size dorsal hippocampal formation or large medial septal lesions displayed a deficit for both early and late items within the list. Because residual short-term memory capacity can be seen only with small hippocampal formation or medial septal lesions, it is suggested that the hippocampal formation and cholinergic input into the hippocampal formation via the medial septum code spatial information within a continuous extended time frame.",
