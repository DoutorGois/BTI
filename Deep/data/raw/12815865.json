     "AB": "The conditions for inducing the long-term potentiation in the hippocampus were analyzed using the mathematical model of a CA3 pyramidal cell. Their dependence on the physiological characteristics of the neuron, the basic biochemical processes, and inhibitory efficacy was considered. The role of additional membrane depolarization in the origination of the hysteresis of the number of phosphorylated receptors as the basis for the formation of an \"intermediate\" stage of long-term potentiation was studied.",
