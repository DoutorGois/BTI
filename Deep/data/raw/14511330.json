     "AB": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) are emerging as important modulators of brain physiopathology. Dramatic changes in the expression of MMPs and TIMPs occur during excitotoxic/neuroinflammatory processes. However, only the measurement of net protease activity is relevant physiologically, and the functional consequences of MMP/TIMP ratio modifications in the brain remain elusive. In order to assess MMP activity and effects in brain tissue, we combined in vivo and organotypic culture models of kainate (KA)-induced excitotoxicity to provoke selective neuronal death and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. Using in situ zymography, we show that KA-induced excitotoxic seizures in rats increase net MMP activity in hippocampal neurons 8 h after seizures, before their death, and that this increase is neuronal activity-dependent. Three days after KA, proteolytic activity increases in blood vessels and reactive glial cells of vulnerable areas, in relation with neuroinflammation. At 7 and 15 days, proteolysis remains high in blood vessels whereas it is reduced in glia. In organotypic hippocampal cultures, which lack blood cell-mediated inflammation and extrinsic connections, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of MMPs (MMPI), but also a selective MMP-9 inhibitor, protect hippocampal neurons against KA-induced excitotoxicity. Moreover, recombinant MMP-9, but not MMP-2, induces selective pyramidal cell death in these cultures and KA-induced neuronal activity exacerbates the neuronal death promoting effects of MMP-9. These data strongly implicate MMPs, and MMP-9 in particular, in both excitotoxic neuronal damage and subsequent neuroinflammatory processes, and suggest that selective MMPIs could be therapeutically relevant in related neurological disorders.",
