     "AB": "Microdialysis was employed to assess extracellular dopamine from medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, nucleus caudatus, and acetylcholine from the hippocampus of conscious rats during and after 120 min restraint stress. Restraint stress rapidly stimulated the release and the metabolism of dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex and in the nucleus accumbens, and acetylcholine release in the hippocampus. Fifty-sixty min later, although rats were still restrained, dopamine and acetylcholine release gradually returned to basal levels. When the animals were freed a considerable increase in the release of both neurotransmitters was observed. No changes in the striatum were observed throughout the experiments. The time-course of plasma corticosterone did not parallel that of dopamine and acetylcholine release, increasing during the whole stress procedure, and decreasing when the animals were released. Adrenalectomized rats responded to stress and liberation in much the same way as intact rats. The administration of exogenous corticosterone (0.5-1.5 mg/kg s.c.) did not change the release of dopamine from the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, and of acetylcholine from the hippocampus, while the dose of 3.0 mg/kg which stimulated them, raised plasma corticosterone to very high concentrations which had never been attained during stress. Moreover, RU 38486, an antagonist of brain glucocorticoid receptors, did not antagonize the stress-induced increase of neurotransmitter release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
