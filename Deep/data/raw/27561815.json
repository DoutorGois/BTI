     "AB": "More than half of children with epilepsy outgrow their seizures, yet the underlying mechanism is unknown. GABAergic inhibition increases at puberty in female mice due to expression of extrasynaptic alpha4betadelta GABAA receptors (GABARs). Therefore, we tested the role of these receptors in regulating seizure-like discharges in CA1 hippocampus using a high K(+) (8.5 mM) seizure model. Spontaneous field potentials were recorded from hippocampus of pre-pubertal (~28-32 PND) and pubertal (~35-44 PND) female wild-type or alpha4-/- mice. The coastline length, a measure of burst intensity, was assessed. 8.5 mM K(+) induced seizure-like discharges in over 60% of pre-pubertal slices, but only in 7% of pubertal slices, where the coastline length was reduced by 70% (P = 0.04). However, the pubertal decrease in seizure-like discharges was not seen in the alpha4-/-, implicating alpha4betadelta GABARs as the cause of the decreased seizure-like activity during puberty. Administration of THIP or DS2, to selectively increase alpha4betadelta current, reduced activity in 8.5 mM K(+) at puberty, while blockade of alpha5-GABARs had no effect. GABAergic current was depolarizing but inhibitory in 8.5 mM K(+), suggesting a mechanism for the effects of alpha4betadelta and alpha5-GABARs, which exhibit different polarity-dependent desensitization. These data suggest that alpha4betadelta GABARs are anti-convulsant during adolescence.",
