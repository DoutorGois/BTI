     "AB": "The neuronal distributions of somatostatin and neuropeptide Y and their respective mRNAs in hippocampal slice cultures were examined by immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization. For the in situ hybridization we used an alkaline phosphatase-labelled oligodeoxynucleotide probe for somatostatin mRNA and an 35S-labelled oligodeoxynucleotide probe for neuropeptide Y mRNA. For both neuropeptides the immunostained and hybridized neurons displayed a comparable, organotypic distribution. Most labelled neurons were located in the dentate hilus and stratum oriens of CA3 and CA1. Additional neurons were found in stratum radiatum and pyramidale of CA3, but very few in the corresponding layers of CA1. In all locations the density of somatostatin- and neuropeptide Y-reactive cells exceeded that observed in vivo. Also, the hybridization signal of the individual neurons appeared enhanced in the slice cultures. Methodologically it was noted that the non-radioactive alkaline phosphatase-labelled oligodeoxynucleotide probe gave excellent in situ hybridization results with detailed cellular resolution and no apparent problems of tissue penetration, even when used on whole-mount explants. These results demonstrate that somatostatin and neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive and mRNA containing neurons retain their organotypic distribution and basic morphological characteristics in the slice cultures. The supernormal density of these neurons and their hybridization signals indicate that a transient developmental increase in neuropeptide expression may persist in vitro.",
