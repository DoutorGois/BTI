     "AB": "Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) has been shown to act as a neuroprotectant both in in vitro studies and in in vivo animal models of ischemia, hypoxia, trauma in the brain or the spinal cord, multiple and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective potential of IGF-I in the \"kainic acid-induced degeneration of the hippocampus\" model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Increased cell death--as detected by FluoroJade B staining--and extensive cell loss--as determined by cresyl violet staining--were observed mainly in the CA3 and CA4 areas of the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus, 7 days following intrahippocampal administration of kainic acid. Kainic acid injection also resulted in intense astrogliosis--as assessed by the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunopositive cells--in both hemispheres, forming a clear astroglial scar ipsilaterally to the injection site. Heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) immunopositive cells were also observed in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus (DG) following kainic acid injection. When IGF-I was administered together with kainic acid, practically no signs of degeneration were detected in the contralateral hemisphere, while in the ipsilateral, there was a smaller degree of cell loss, reduced number of FluoroJade B-stained cells, decreased reactive gliosis and fewer Hsp70-positive cells. Our present results extend further the cases in which IGF-I is shown to exhibit neuroprotective properties in neurodegenerative processes in the CNS.",
