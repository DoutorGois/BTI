     "AB": "1. Temporary suppression of glycolysis by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG)-long enough to abolish CA1 population spikes (PSs) and reduce field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) by two-thirds-is followed by a sustained rebound of EPSPs and PSs (both up by 70-150%). 2. Post 2-DG long-term potentiation (2-DG-LTP) is prevented by block of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs). Though 2-DG-LTP is normally expressed by other receptors, in presence of picrotoxin 2-DG causes similar LTP of NMDAR-mediated EPSPs. 3. Stimulation at 1 s-1 fully depotentiates 2-DG-LTP. 4. Unlike tetanic LTP, 2-DG-LTP is not pathway-specific, is not occluded by a preceding tetanic LTP (or vice versa) and is insensitive to block of NO synthesis. 5. Hypoglycemic states may have long-lasting after-effects on cerebral synaptic function.",
