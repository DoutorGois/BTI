     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the pathogenesis of brain damage after chronic cerebral ischemia through analysis of the differences in proteins expression in hippocampus between chronic cerebral ischemia rats and normal rats. METHODS: The chronic cerebral ischemia model was established by ligating the bilateral common carotid arteries.Twenty rats were randomly divided into a model group (n=10)and a sham operation group(n=10). Four weeks later, the differences of proteins expression in hippocampus between model group and sham operation group were analyzed by two dimensional polyacryalmide gel electrophoresis and ultraflex TOF/TOF mass spectrograph. RESULTS: Compared to the sham operation group, the expressions of 4 proteins were up-regulated and that of 2 proteins were down-regulated in the model group. Six proteins were identified by ultraflex TOF/TOF, which were ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1; Dynamin-1; TMF regulated nuclear protein-like, partial; ATP synthase; rCG50513, isoform CRA_a; and expressed sequence AU016693, isoform CRA_b. CONCLUSION: Well-resolved and reproducible 2-DE patterns of chronic cerebral ischemia rats were established. Six proteins that correlate with nerve damage after chronic cerebral ischemia are identified.",
