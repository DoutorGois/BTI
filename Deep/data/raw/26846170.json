     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The production of inflammatory cytokines resulting from amyloid beta (Abeta) is associated with the initiation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Atorvastatin (ATV) has been reported to improve AD, however, it is unclear how the anti-inflammatory mechanism is linked with its protection against the impairment of spatial cognitive function in AD. The present study was designed to explore what mechanism was possibly involved in the anti-inflammatory pathway in regard to the ATV treatment of AD. METHODS: We used an AD model induced by the administration of Abeta(25-35) in male C57BL/6 mice and an in vitro culture system to study the protective effects of ATV on the spatial cognitive deficits, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment and inflammatory reaction. RESULTS: The intragastric administration of ATV (5 mg/kg) in Abeta(25-35)-treated mice significantly ameliorated the spatial cognitive deficits and prevented the LTP impairment in hippocampal CA1. The increased Iba-1 positive cells and inflammatory components in the hippocampus were reduced after the ATV treatment. The anti-inflammatory and LTP protection of ATV were abolished using the replenishment of farnesyl pyrophosphate by the administration of farnesol (FOH). The hippocampal slices culture showed Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity in the absence of the presence of ATV. Treatment with ATV (0.5, 1, 2.5 mumol/L) dose-dependently prevented the cell damage in hippocampus induced by Abeta25-35. CONCLUSION: The administration of ATV ameliorated the cognitive deficits, depressed the inflammatory responses, improved the LTP impairment, and prevents Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in cultured hippocampal neurons. These protective functions of ATV involved the pathway of reducing farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP).",
