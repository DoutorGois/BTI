     "AB": "The activities of the enzymes glutathione reductase (GRD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were studied in several rat brain areas following the aspirative transection of the septohippocampal pathway (fimbria fornix) and the administration of nerve growth factor (NGF) or cytochrome c. One group of animals remained untreated. This lesion resulted in a decreased hippocampal GRD and septal GST activities, as well as, in an increase in GPX activity from the frontal cortex, striatum, and septum. NGF prevented the lesion-induced changes in hippocampal GRD and septal GPX. These findings show that the insult resulting from the aspiration of the fimbria fornix bundle involves modifications in glutathione-related enzymes, and, therefore, in the antioxidant status of brain tissue. These changes in glutathione metabolism could be a consequence of the oxidative damage to GRD and GST proteins or represent a compensatory response of GPX to the oxidative threat The restoring effects of NGF on altered enzyme activities are possibly linked to its known neuroprotective action.",
