     "AB": "The expression of synaptophysin (vesicular protein) and mGluR5 (metabotropic glutamate receptor) genes was studied 3, 7, and 20 days after cainic acid injury of the dorsal hippocampal area in Wistar rats. The expression of both genes was characteristically reduced in the hippocampus. Twenty days after the exposure the expression of mGluR5 in this brain area reached the control level, while synaptophysin expression remained low. An opposite trend was observed in the frontal cortex: synaptophysin expression 20 days after exposure did not differ from the control, while mGluR5 expression was reduced. The peculiar time course of both genes' expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex indicates the involvement of the frontal cortex in mechanisms of functional recovery after hippocampal injuries.",
