     "AB": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and different NPY receptor (Y) subtype-selective agonists were tested for their effects on spontaneous epileptiform discharges which developed in rat cortical and hippocampal slices in Mg(2+)-free medium. Epileptiform activity, recorded extracellularly, was attenuated by NPY (0.5-1 microM) in both the frontal cortex and hippocampal CA3/CA1 pyramidal cell layers. In the cortex the Y1/5 selective agonist [Leu31 Pro34] NPY was more effective than the Y2 preferring agonist NPY13-36 and the Y2/5 preferring agonist NPY3-36. The suppression of epileptiform discharges induced by NPY in cortical slices was blocked by the selective Y1 receptor antagonist (R)-N2-(diphenylacetyl)-N-((4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl] argininamide (BIBP 3226). In the hippocampus, NPY13-36 and NPY3-36 were more effective than [Leu31 Pro34] NPY. In conclusion, the antiepileptic activity of NPY is mediated predominantly by the Y1 receptor subtype in the frontal cortex and by Y2 and probably Y5 receptors in the hippocampal CA3/CA1 areas.",
