     "AB": "The morphine distribution in human tissues was studied by immunohistochemical method. Four cases of opiate associated death were examined. Morphine was demonstrated not only in some neuronal cytoplasma of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum, but also found in some nervous fibers and some capillary walls in the central nervous system. Besides, it was also found in the capsule and mesenchyma of heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, adrenal gland, pancreas, thymus, thyroidea and testis. Morphine was not seen in the parenchyma of these organs. It was suggested that the postmortem redistribution was not in the central nervous system, but in other organs. We considered that immunohistochemical staining of morphine is useful in the diagnosis of death from opiate addiction.",
