     "AB": "Potassium channel dysfunction has been indicated in Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, spatial memory, the activity of cortical acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the expressions of inward rectifier potassium channels (Kir) were measured after ibotenic acid lesions of nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbm) in rats. Expressions of Kir (Kir2.1, Kir3.1, Kir6.1 and Kir6.2) at mRNA level were assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. At 28 days after ibotenic acid injection, the spatial memory of rats was significantly impaired accompanied by a 32% reduction of cortical AChE activity. Furthermore, the expression of Kir6.2 was increased by 79.3% in cortex, and that of Kir6.1 was increased by 172.1% in hippocampus, while no obvious changes in the mRNA expression of Kir2.1 and Kir3.1 were detected. This study indicated that the expression of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel was area and channel subtype specifically increased following nbm lesions.",
