     "AB": "1. Voltage and current clamp recordings were performed on CA1 rat hippocampal pyramidal cells using the patch clamp technique on \"in vitro\" slice preparations. 2. Hyperpolarizations from a holding potential of -35 mV elicited activation of the hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) starting at voltages near -50 mV. 3. Ih recorded in voltage clamp conditions was blocked by external caesium (5 mM). 4. Raising the external K concentration from 4.35 to 24.35 mM sensibly increased the slope of the current-voltage (I/V) curve. Decreasing the external Na concentration from 133.5 to 33.5 mM depressed Ih without grossly altering the I/V slope. 5. The Ih fully activated I/V relation measured in the range -140 to -45 mV was linear with an extrapolated reversal at -17.0 +/- -1.6 (SE) mV. The current activation curve comprised the range between about -50 and -140 mV with a half-maximal activation at about -98 mV. 6. Perfusion of unclamped neurons with Cs (2 mM) hyperpolarized their resting potential by 3.8 +/- 0.2 mV and decreased the membrane conductance, as expected if Ih were activated at rest. Firing caused by depolarizing current steps was prevented by Cs-induced hyperpolarization, and could be restored by returning the membrane voltage to resting level by constant current injection. 7. The Cd-insensitive (medium-duration) afterhyperpolarization (AHP) elicited by a train of action potentials at -60 mV had an amplitude of 3.9 +/- 0.3 mV and was nearly fully abolished by 2 mM Cs (82.7 +/- 7.4%). Cs removed the depolarizing part of the afterhyperpolarization as expected if Ih activation was responsible for this phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
