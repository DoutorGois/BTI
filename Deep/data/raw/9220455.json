     "AB": "An excessive neuronal stimulation through glutamate receptors is known to result in excitotoxic cell death of apoptotic (programmed) character. Granule cells of hippocampal dentate gyrus are believed to be particularly resistant to excitotoxic insults, despite the fact that pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus proper are apparently the most vulnerable brain cells. In this study, we report that neurons derived from the rat 5-day-old dentate gyrus, and maintained in vitro for 6 days, may undergo apoptosis after treatment with L-glutamate, in a dose-dependent manner-with up to 80% of neurons displaying features of programmed cell death after 24 h exposure to 0.5 mM glutamate. This conclusion is based on morphological evaluation of the cultures, nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258 and acridine orange revealing chromatin abnormalities, as well as terminal transferase labeling of DNA fragmentation. Since apoptosis is believed to be an active process involving gene expression, immunocytochemical of c-Fos and c-Jun transcription factor proteins was performed. Elevated expression of both proteins was found to follow quickly (within 1 h) after addition of glutamate. However, this effect was not dose-dependent, thus it does not provide clear correlations to the programmed cell death. In conclusion, this study reports on the establishment of a novel apoptotic model of excitotoxicity, and invites further efforts to investigate a basis for in vitro susceptibility and in vivo resistance of dentate gyrus granule cells to excitotoxic insult evoking apoptosis.",
