     "AB": "Tetraethylammonium (TEA) induces a form of long-term potentiation (LTP) that is independent on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation (LTP(K)). LTP(K) may be a suitable chemical model to study molecular mechanisms underlying LTP. We monitored the phosphorylation state of two identified neural-specific protein kinase C (PKC) substrates (the presynaptic protein GAP-43/B-50 and postsynaptic protein RC3) after different chemical depolarisations. TEA induced a long-lasting increase in synaptic efficacy in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and increased the phosphorylation of both GAP-43/B-50 and RC3 (51 and 56.1%, respectively). These effects were blocked by the voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonist nifedipine, but not by the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5. These data show that in LTP(K) the in situ phosphorylation of pre-and postsynaptic PKC substrates is increased, indicating that NMDA receptor-dependent and NMDA receptor-independent LTP share common Ca(2+)-dependent expression mechanisms, including activation of pre- and postsynaptic PKC.",
