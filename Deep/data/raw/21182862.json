     "AB": "Toxic lead (Pb) exposure poses serious risks to human health, especially to children at developmental stages, even at low exposure levels. Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is considered to be a potential early target in the neurotoxicity of Pb due to its role in cell adhesion, neuronal migration, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory. However, the effect of low-level Pb exposure on the specific expression of NCAM isoforms has not been reported. In the present study, we found that Pb could concentration-dependently (1-100 nM) inhibit the expression of three major NCAM isoforms (NCAM-180, -140, and -120) in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, it was verified that levels of all three major isoforms of NCAM were reduced by Pb exposure in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells transiently transfected with NCAM-120, -140, or -180 isoform cDNA constructs. In addition, low-level Pb exposure delayed the neurite outgrowth and reduced the survival rate of cultured hippocampal neurons at different time-points. Together, our results demonstrate that developmental low-level Pb exposure can attenuate the expression of all three major NCAM isoforms, which may contribute to the observed Pb-mediated neurotoxicity.",
