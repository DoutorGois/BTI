     "AB": "Electroconvulsive shock (ECS), an effective treatment for psychiatric diseases, has been reported to induce immediate-early genes (IEGs) and to activate p42 and p44 MAPKs (ERK-1 and ERK-2) in rat brain. In this study, we examined the activation of the other members of MAPK family, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and p38. Following ECS, the phosphorylation of p38 was substantially increased in both hippocampus and cerebellum, but the increase of JNK phosphorylation was observed only in hippocampus. We also investigated the phosphorylation of their upstream kinases, SEK-1, MKK6 and MKK3. In both hippocampus and cerebellum, the phosphorylation of MKK6 showed closer correlation with p38 phosphorylation than that of MKK3. However, SEK-1, known as upstream kinase of JNK and p38 in vitro, corresponded with none of MAPKs. These results, with previous reports on the activation of ERK, indicate that ECS activates three MAPKs differentially in rat hippocampus and cerebellum, and suggest the possibility that unknown MAPKK may be involved in the activation of JNK in rat brain after ECS.",
