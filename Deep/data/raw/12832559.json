     "AB": "We studied cellular mechanisms of synchronization of epileptiform activity induced by kainic acid in a novel preparation of superfused rat hippocampus in vivo. Under urethane anesthesia, kainate induced epileptic population spikes occurring at 30-40 Hz. Pyramidal cells fired exclusively during population spikes with an average probability of 0.34 on rebound of rhythmic GABA(A)-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic events. Excitatory synaptic events contributed little to seizure activity. Rhythmic epileptiform activity was suppressed by blocking GABA(A) receptors and was slowed by barbiturates. Thus, GABAergic inhibition is instrumental in synchronizing kainate-induced epileptiform rhythmic activity in the gamma frequency band in the intact hippocampus in vivo.",
