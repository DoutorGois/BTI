     "AB": "In the brain of aged rats high affinity choline uptake (HAChU) of the striatum, hippocampus, and frontal cortex is lower than in young rats, while choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity is lower in striatum and frontal cortex. Infusion into the lateral cerebral ventricle with nerve growth factor (NGF) enhances the low values of these cholinergic markers in a dose- and region-dependent manner. GM1 ganglioside infused into the lateral ventricle, at a dose that is ineffective alone, together with NGF synergistically enhances the effect of NGF on ChAT and HAChU activities in the brain of aged animals. The pharmacology of this GM1/NGF synergism suggests potentiation of response.",
