     "AB": "Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a rare, progressive movement disorder characterized neuropathologically by widespread neuronal and glial pathology including tau-immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI), oligodendroglial inclusions (GI), and astrocytic plaques (AP). However, beta -amyloid (A beta) deposits have been observed in the cerebral cortex and/or hippocampus in some cases of CBD. To clarify the role of Abeta deposition in CBD, the densities and spatial patterns of the Abeta deposits were studied in three cases. In two cases, expressing apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes 2/3 or 3/3, the densities of the Abeta deposits were similar to those in normal elderly brain. In the remaining case, expressing APOE genotype 3/4, Abeta deposition was observed throughout the cerebral cortex, sectors CA1 and CA2 of the hippocampus, and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. The densities of the Abeta deposits in this case were typical of those observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the three cases, clustering of Abeta deposits, with clusters ranging in size from 200 to >6400 microm in diameter, was evident in 25/27 (93%) of analyses. In addition, the clusters of Abeta deposits were regularly distributed parallel to the tissue boundary in 52% of analyses, a spatial pattern similar to that observed in AD. These results suggest: (1) in some CBD cases, Abeta pathology is age-related, (2) more extensive Abeta deposition is observed in some cases, the density and spatial patterns of the Abeta deposits being similar to AD, and (3) extensive deposition of Abeta in CBD may be associated with APOE allele e4.",
