     "AB": "The neurotrophic factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) have been shown to promote excitatory and inhibitory synapse development. However, a quantitative analysis of their influence on connectivity has proven in general difficult to achieve. In this work we use a novel experimental approach based on percolation concepts that provides a quantification of the average number of connections per neuron. In combination with electrophysiological measurements, we characterize the changes in network connectivity induced by BDNF and NT-3 in rat hippocampal cultures. We show that, on the one hand, BDNF and NT-3 accelerate the maturation of connectivity in the network by about 17 h. On the other hand, BDNF and NT-3 increase the number of excitatory input connections by a factor of about two, but without modifying the number of inhibitory input connections. This scenario of a dominant effect on the excitation is supported by the analysis of spontaneous population bursts in cultures treated with either BDNF or NT-3, which show burst amplitudes that are insensitive to the blockade of inhibition. A leaky integrate-and-fire model reproduces the experimental results well.",
