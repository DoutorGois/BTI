     "AB": "In an electrophysiological study, hyperosmolality damaged the central nervous system including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain reticular formation, pyramidal pathway, extrapyramidal pathway and anterior horn cells, and peripheral nervous system. In the experimental model in which acute changes were made, sodium ion concentration was related to the dysfunction of reticular formation. In the clinical setting, hyperosmolality with hyperglycemia is related to the individual's level of consciousness. In the clinical management of hyperosmolar syndromes, plasma osmolality should be kept below 320 mOsm/L.",
