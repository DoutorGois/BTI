     "AB": "Reductions in extracellular free Ca2+-concentration [( Ca2+]o) result from neuronal activation and can be induced by repetitive electrical stimulation or by application of excitatory amino acids. They reflect Ca2+-movements along its electrochemical gradient into pre- and postsynaptic elements. Amino acid-induced reductions in [Ca2+]o are predominantly caused by postsynaptic Ca2+ entry. Under conditions of blocked chemical synaptic transmission, a presynaptic component of extracellular Ca2+ loss becomes apparent during stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers system in stratum radiatum/moleculare. GABA, both iontophoretically and bath applied, always reduces pre- and postsynaptic components of [Ca2+]o changes. Baclofen regularly affects postsynaptic Ca2+ entry and has frequently also a suppressant action on presynaptic Ca2+ entry in area CA1.",
