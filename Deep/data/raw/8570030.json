     "AB": "Selective central benzodiazepine agonists, such as clonazepam, are known to modify serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic content in the brain. In order to further study the effect of this benzodiazepine on serotonin turnover rate, rats received clonazepam, 10 mg/kg for 10 days, and the concentrations of serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were determined in the hippocampus after inhibition of monoamineoxidase with pargyline. The results indicate a reduction in the turnover rate of the monoamine. In addition, the systemic administration of clonazepam produced a decrease in the Bmax of [3H]DPAT binding to 5-HT1A sites in the hippocampus. By contrast, this effect was not observed if clonazepam was delivered into the dorsal raphe nucleus by osmotic minipumps. The binding of [3H]paroxetine to 5-HT reuptake sites was increased by the treatment with clonazepam. The present observations indicate that clonazepam produces a reduction of serotonin turnover rate in the hippocampus of the rat concomitant with a down-regulation of 5-HT1A binding sites, probably by an effect at the forebrain projections. There is also an up-regulation of the serotonin transporter, which might contribute to a reduction in the synaptic availability of serotonin during clonazepam treatment.",
