We have investigated immunohistochemically the expression of TLN in human brain tissue from control subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In control brain, neuropil of the gray matter was stained diffusely with the anti-TLN antibody. TLN immunoreactivity was markedly decreased in the brain of AD patients, particularly in the hippocampal formation.",
