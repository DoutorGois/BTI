     "AB": "The genetic mechanisms underlying learning and memory remain mysterious, but many of the genes are likely to be expressed in the hippocampus, a region pivotal to this process. We used a 9,000 gene microarray to examine differences in hippocampal gene expression between two F1 hybrid mouse strains that perform well on the Morris water maze and two inbred strains that perform poorly. This resulted in identification of 27 differentially expressed genes, which could be used to place the F1 hybrid and inbred strains into separate clusters based on singular value decomposition. Most of the genes have unknown function, but those with known functions may provide clues to the molecular mechanisms of learning. Using multiple strains to narrow down the number of candidate genes should be a useful general approach to genome-wide studies of behavioral and other complex traits.",
