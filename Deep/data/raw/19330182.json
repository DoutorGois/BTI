We have reviewed the findings of single photon emission tomography, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), related to brain function and structure in AD and in post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is evidence that prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices dysfunction contributes to PTSD symptomatology. Similarities between the two different aforementioned diseases exist in the areas of (a) medial temporal lobe, (b) hippocampus and (c) cingulated cortex.",
