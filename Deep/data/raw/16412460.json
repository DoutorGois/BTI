     "AB": "RNA localization is an important means of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in many eukaryotic cell types. In neurons, select RNAs are delivered to postsynaptic dendritic microdomains, a mechanism that is considered a key underpinning in the administration of long-term synaptic plasticity. BC1 RNA is a small untranslated RNA that interacts with translation initiation factors and functions as a translational repressor by targeting assembly of 48S initiation complexes. BC1 RNA is specifically and rapidly transported to dendrites where it is found concentrated in postsynaptic microdomains. The cytoskeletal infrastructure underlying dendritic localization of BC1 RNA has not been investigated. We now report that the dendritic delivery of BC1 RNA is dependent on intact microtubules. In two neuronal cell types, hippocampal neurons and sympathetic neurons in primary culture, disruption of microtubules abolished dendritic localization of BC1 RNA. In contrast, disruption of actin filaments had no significant effect on the somatodendritic distribution of BC1 RNA. It is concluded that the long-range dendritic delivery of BC1 RNA is supported by microtubules. At the same time, a role for actin filaments, while unlikely for long-range BC1 delivery, is not ruled out for short-range local translocation and anchoring at dendritic destination sites.",
