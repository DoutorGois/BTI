     "AB": "Oxidative stress is involved in a number of neurological disorders, including the neurotoxic effects of ethanol. Recent studies have described a neuroprotective potential of alpha-lipoic acid (LC) in several models of neuronal cell death related to oxidative stress. We tested the hypothesis that LC could be effective in preventing ethanol-induced neurotoxicity employing the clonal hippocampa cell line HT22. A 24 h incubation with ethanol 100-600 mM caused a dose-dependent loss of cell viability and a significant increase of the overall intracellular protein oxidation. Coincubation with LC 0.1 mM resulted in a significant decrease of ethanol-related neurotoxicity and a complete prevention of the ethanol-induced intracellular protein oxidation. These results indicate that the radical scavenging properties of LC are effective to ameliorate ethanol-induced neurotoxicity.",
