     "AB": "Immediate-early genes (IEGs) are transiently and rapidly activated in response to various cellular stimuli. IEGs mediate diverse functions during pathophysiologic events by regulating cellular signal transduction. We investigated the temporal expression of several IEGs, including c-fos, early growth response protein-1 (Egr-1), and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), in trimethyltin (TMT)-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration. Mice (7 weeks old, C57BL/6) administered TMT (2.6mg/kg intraperitoneally) presented severe neurodegenerative lesions in the dentate gyrus (DG) and showed behavioral seizure activity on days 1-4 post-treatment, after which the lesions and behavior recovered spontaneously over time. c-fos, Egr-1, and Arc mRNA and protein levels significantly increased in the mouse hippocampus after TMT treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that nuclear c-fos expression increased mainly in the DG, whereas nuclear Egr-1 expression was increased extensively in cornu ammonis (CA) 1, CA3, and the DG after TMT treatment. Increased Arc levels were detected in the cellular somata/dendrites of the hippocampal subregions after TMT treatment. Therefore, we suggest that increased IEGs are associated with TMT-induced pathological events in mouse hippocampus.",
