     "AB": "Previous studies have shown that granule cells of the adult dentate gyrus require adrenal steroids for their survival. In order to investigate whether activation of type I or type II adrenal steroid receptors can mediate granule cell survival, we have analyzed the density of pyknotic cells in the granule cell, CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers in Nissl stained hippocampal sections from adult male rats which were either sham operated, adrenalectomized, or adrenalectomized and treated with aldosterone as a specific type I receptor agonist or RU28362 as a specific type II receptor agonist. Aldosterone treatment completely protected the dentate gyrus from adrenalectomy-induced cell death, while treatment with RU28362 resulted in only a partial protection against cell death in this region. These results indicate that type I adrenal steroid receptor activation is sufficient to protect against adrenalectomy-induced cell death.",
