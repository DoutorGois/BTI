     "AB": "The Protective effects of dizocilpine maleate (DM) against anoxia in mice and ischemic damage in rats of 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) were studied. DM 0.5 or 1.0 mg.kg-1 ip significantly prolonged the survival time of mice in closed containers. DM 0.5 and 1.0 mg.kg-1 ip 30 min prior to 4-VO obviously accelerated the electroencephalographic recovery, reduced the neuronal loss in the hippocampus, and increased the survival rate after 72-h reperfusion. These effects followed a dose-dependent manner. Our results indicate that selective non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blocker DM protects against anoxic and ischemic cerebral damage.",
