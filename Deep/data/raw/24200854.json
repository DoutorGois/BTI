     "AB": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of maternal lead exposure on expression of IGF1 and IGF2 in the hippocampus of mice offspring. Lead exposure initiated from beginning of gestation to weaning. Lead acetate administered in drinking solutions was dissolved in distilled deionized water at the concentrations of 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% groups respectively. On the 21st postnatal day, the learning and memory ability was tested by Water Maze test and the Pb levels were also determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The expression of IGF1 and IGF2 in hippocampus was examined by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. The lead levels in blood and hippocampus of all lead exposure groups were significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). In Water Maze test, the performances of 0.5% and 1% lead exposure groupswere worse than that of the control group (P<0.05). The expression of IGF1 and IGF2 was decreased in lead exposed groups than that of the control group (P<0.05). The low expression of IGF1 and IGF2 in the hippocampus of pups may contribute to the impairment of learning and memory associated with maternal Pb exposure.",
