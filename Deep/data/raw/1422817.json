     "AB": "To elucidate the relation of genetically induced variations in two-way active avoidance performance and the extent of the hippocampal infra/intrapyramidal mossy fiber system (IIP-Mf) in inbred mouse strains DBA/2 (high performance, small IIP-Mf) and C3H (low performance, large IIP-Mf) we investigated a backcross line containing the DBA/2-derived genetic determinants for high avoidance performance in a C3H background. In the seventh backcross generation variations in performance analogous to the original strains were observed whereas the extent of mossy fibers was nearly homogeneous. This result suggests that both variables are determined by separate genetic factors at least in these strains and that differences in mossy fiber distribution are not an essential prerequisite for different active avoidance performance.",
