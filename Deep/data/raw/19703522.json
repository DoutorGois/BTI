     "AB": "The purposes of the present work were to verify lipid peroxidation level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and monoamines (dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT)), and their metabolites (3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)) contents in rat hippocampus after lipoic acid (LA) administration. Wistar rats were treated with 0.9% saline (i.p., control group) and LA (10, 20 or 30 mg/kg, i.p., LA10, LA20 and LA30 groups, respectively). After the treatments all groups were observed for 24h. In LA20 group only there was a significant decrease in lipid peroxidation level. However, no alteration was observed in SOD activity in groups treated with LA. The NE and DA levels were increased only in 20mg/kg dose of LA in rat hippocampus. Serotonin content and their metabolite 5-HIAA levels was decreased in same dose of LA. On the other hand, DOPAC and HVA levels did not show any significant change. The reduction in lipid peroxidation level and alterations in hippocampal monoamines can be suggested as a possible brain mechanism from this antioxidant. The outcome of the study may have therapeutic implications in the neurodegenerative diseases.",
