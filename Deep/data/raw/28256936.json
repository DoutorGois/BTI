     "AB": "Gelidium amansii is an edible and economically important red alga consumed in South Eastern Asia. In previous studies, we reported that the ethanol extracts of G. amansii (GAE) has promising modulatory activity with respect to the morphological and functional maturation of hippocampal neurons in culture. In this study, we show that the chloroform (CHCl3) subfraction of GAE and the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction dose-dependently promoted neurite outgrowth, and their effects were comparable with that of GAE. We further assessed in cultured cortical neurons, proteins differentially expressed in the presence/absence of the GAE, CHCl3 subfraction, and the EtOAc fraction by 2D-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Proteomic data revealed that a number of proteins responsible for multiple cellular and biochemical functions vital for neuronal development and maturation were significantly upregulated in neurons treated with the GAE, CHCl3 subfraction, and the EtOAc fraction. Of the identified proteins, profilin 2a, septin 7, cdc42, protein phosphatase 2A, DA11, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A-1, and gamma-enolase are known to play important roles in neuritogenesis and dendritic arborization. Immunofluorescence data demonstrate that GAE-treated hippocampal neurons showed greater intensity ratios in the expressions of the septin 7 and cdc42 compared to vehicle control, validating their proteomic profiles. Together these results suggest that the GAE/CHCl3 subfraction and EtOAc fraction promote neurite development by up or downregulating several key proteins.",
