     "AB": "Receptors for excitatory amino acid, L-glutamate, have been classified into three subtypes named as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), quisqualate (QA) and kainate receptors. In the present study, an effect of age on binding sites of [3H]alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (3H-AMPA), a QA agonist, was studied in the rat brain through quantitative in vitro autoradiography. 3H-AMPA binding sites were most concentrated in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex where glutamate receptors have been demonstrated to play a role in synaptic transmission. In aged rats, 3H-AMPA binding sites in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were not significantly changed. In our previous studies, it was noticed that strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors, which functionally coupled with NMDA receptors, showed marked age-dependent decreases in telencephalic regions. It has been shown that the glutamatergic neuronal system is involved in learning and memory. Nevertheless, it is considered that AMPA binding sites are not involved in the decline of neuronal functions, especially impairment of learning and memory, accompanying with aging process.",
