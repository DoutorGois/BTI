     "AB": "Because the contribution of inflammatory mediators to seizure disorders is unclear, we investigated the changes in the expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-beta) and its receptor - IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the rat hippocampus at different stages of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling. The occurrence and progressive development of seizures were induced by repeated systemic administration of PTZ, a non-competitive antagonist of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor at a subconvulsive dose of 30 mg/kg. We also examined the effects of continuous intracerebroventricular administration of IL-1beta and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in this model of epilepsy using subcutaneously implanted osmotic mini-pumps. We observed enhanced IL-1R1 expression in the dentate gyrus (DG) at different stages of kindling, whereas the elevated IL-1beta level was distinctive to fully kindled seizures. We did not detect significant changes in the concentration of IL-6 or TNF-alpha throughout the kindling process. LPS accelerated transiently the process of kindling, while IL-1beta showed a predisposition to delay kindling acquisition. Our study supports the concept of seizure-related modifications in brain cytokine production during epileptogenesis. Although some evidence indicates a proconvulsant property of IL-1beta activity, it cannot be ruled out that the alterations in IL-1 system reflect the activation of endogenous protective mechanisms with respect to the kindling of seizures.",
