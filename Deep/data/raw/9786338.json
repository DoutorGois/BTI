     "AB": "Lesion studies have been of historical importance in establishing the brain systems involved in memory processes. Many of those studies, however, have been overinterpreted in terms of the actual role of each system and of connections between systems. The more recent molecular pharmacological approach has produced major advances in these two areas. The main biochemical steps of memory formation in the CAI region of the hippocampus have been established by localized microinfusions of drugs acting on specific enzymes of receptors, by subcellular measurements of the activity or function of those enzymes and receptors at definite times, and by transgenic deletions or changes of those proteins. The biochemical steps of long-term memory formation in CAI have been found to be quite similar to those of long-term potentiation in the same region, and of other forms of plasticity. Connections between the hippocampus and the entorhinal and parietal cortices in the formation and modulation of short- and long-term memory have also been elucidated using these techniques. Lesion studies, coupled with imaging studies, still have a role to play; with regard to human memory, this role is in many ways unique. But these methods by themselves are not informative as to the mechanisms of memory processing, storage or modulation.",
