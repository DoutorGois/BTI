     "AB": "In this study, we challenged pyridoxine to mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and investigated the effects of pyridoxine on HFD-induced phenotypes such as blood glucose, reduction of cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus using Ki67 and doublecortin (DCX), respectively. Mice were fed a commercially available low-fat diet (LFD) as control diet or HFD (60% fat) for 8 weeks. After 5 weeks of LFD or HFD treatment, 350 mg/kg pyridoxine was administered for 3 weeks. The administration of pyridoxine significantly decreased body weight in the HFD-treated group. In addition, there were no significant differences in hepatic histology and pancreatic insulin-immunoreactive (-ir) and glucagon-ir cells of the HFD-treated group after pyridoxine treatment. In the HFD-fed group, Ki67-positive nuclei and DCX-ir neuroblasts were significantly decreased in the dentate gyrus compared with those in the LFD-fed mice. However, the administration of pyridoxine significantly increased Ki67-positive nuclei and DCX-ir neuroblasts in the dentate gyrus in both LFD- and HFD-fed mice. In addition, the administration of pyridoxine significantly increased the protein levels of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the immunoreactivity of phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element binding protein (pCREB) compared with the vehicle-treated LFD- and HFD-fed mice. In contrast, the administration of pyridoxine significantly decreased HFD-induced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the hippocampus. These results showed that pyridoxine supplement reduced the HFD-induced reduction of cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus via controlling the levels of GAD67, pCREB, BDNF, and MDA.",
