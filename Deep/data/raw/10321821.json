In this study we recorded the magnetic fields from the brain in response to two tastants, 1 M NaCl and 3 mM saccharin. We estimated the location of areas activated sequentially after the onset of stimulation with magnetic source imaging. We investigated the primary gustatory area (area G) precisely, and found it at the transition between the parietal operculum and the insular cortex. The central sulcus was activated less frequently than area G but with almost the same latency in cases of NaCl stimulation. Following area G, we found activation in several cortical regions, e.g. both the frontal operculum and the anterior part of the insula, the hippocampus, the parahippocampal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus.",
