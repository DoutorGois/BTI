     "AB": "In the present study, the effect of melatonin on oxidative DNA damage induced by kainic acid (KA) treatment was investigated. 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) is a main product of oxidatively damaged DNA and was used as the endpoint in these studies. The levels of 8-OH-dG were found to be elevated in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of rats treated with KA. These elevated levels were significantly reduced in animals that were co-treated with melatonin. Thus, there was no difference in 8-OH-dG levels in the brain of control rats compared to those treated with KA (10 mg/kg) plus melatonin (10 mg/kg). The levels of 8-OH-dG also increased in the liver of rats treated with KA. This rise in oxidatively damaged DNA was also prevented by melatonin administration. Melatonin's ability to reduce KA-induced increases in neural and hepatic 8-OH-dG levels presumably relates to its direct free radical scavenging ability and possibly to other antioxidative actions of melatonin.",
