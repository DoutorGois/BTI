     "AB": "Being supportive cells for neurons in the central nervous system, astrocytes have recently found to be associated with neurogenesis. Ventral mesencephalon (VM) astrocytes were also detected being instructive for VM dopaminergic (DA) neurogenesis, but the underling mechanisms are still unclear. This research is to figure out whether VM astrocytes are more efficient than those from other brain regions in inducing VM DA neurons from their precursors and whether transforming growth factor-betas (TGF-betas) are the underlying molecules. We found that, compared with astrocytes preparations from striatum and hippocampus, VM astrocytes preparations displayed markedly higher efficacy in inducing DA neurogenesis. Besides, they also expressed higher level of TGF-beta3 than those of two other regions. When TGF-beta3 gene expression in astrocytes preparations was inhibited by its antisense oligonucleotide, the induction of DA neurons decreased to a similar level among these three astrocytes preparations. Thus, our experiment indicates that VM astrocytes preparations which contained highly purified astrocytes are more efficient in inducing DA neurogenesis than those from other regions. Furthermore, it also suggests that the regional differences are regulated by different expression levels of TGF-beta3 in those astrocytes preparations from different derivations.",
