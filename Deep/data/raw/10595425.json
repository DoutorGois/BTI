     "AB": "Using a within-subjects design, rats were trained on two place-memory problems and five object-discrimination problems at different intervals prior to receiving either ibotenate lesions of the hippocampal formation or sham surgery. Places # 1 and 2 were fixed-platform water-maze tasks that were run in different rooms and they were learned during the 14th and 2nd week before surgery, respectively. Object-discrimination problems # 1-5 were learned during the 13th, 10th, 7th, 4th, and 1st week before surgery, respectively. Rats with hippocampal lesions displayed impaired retention of both Place problems with no evidence of a temporal gradient to the impairment. In contrast to their retrograde place-memory deficits, the hippocampal rats displayed normal retention of the five object-discriminations that were learned before surgery. Hippocampal lesions had similar consequences for anterograde learning, as the lesioned rats were impaired in acquisition of a new water-maze problem that was run in a third room (Place #3), whereas they showed normal acquisition of two new object-discriminations. The findings indicate that the hippocampal formation is not required for long-term consolidation of information underlying accurate performance of object-discriminations, and that its critical role in memory for places persists for at least 14 weeks, and probably for as long as those memories exist.",
