     "AB": "Evolution, progression and recovery of neural damage during and following cerebral ischemia were investigated in the gerbil after occlusion of a posterior communicating artery and by using the immunohistochemical reaction for tubulin and creatine kinase BB-isoenzyme which are enriched in the neuronal structure and the reaction for astroprotein which is specific for astrocytes. The transcardiac perfusion study with India ink revealed marked hypoperfusion diffusely in the hippocampus and moderately in the thalamus on the occluded side. The earliest immunohistochemical lesion, manifested as loss of the reaction for tubulin and creatine kinase BB-isoenzyme in dendrites and nerve cell bodies, was found in the CA1 and CA2 region of the hippocampus after ischemia for 4 min, while it took 10 min before the earliest lesion became visible in the ventral nucleus of the thalamus and it took over 1 h before scattered lesions evolved in granular cells of the dentate gyrus. The staining with hematoxylin-eosin was much less sensitive in detection of early ischemic lesions. After re-establishment of blood flow to the posterior communicating artery, the ischemic lesions which were visualized with the reaction for tubulin or creatine kinase BB-isoenzyme disappeared or reduced the size, if the ischemic period was brief. Beyond a certain ischemic period, the lesion expanded further during the early postischemic period. The reaction for astroprotein visualized reactive astrocytes even in the area without any abnormalities with other reactions, an evidence of subtle ischemic insults.",
