     "AB": "The volumes of the components of the left and right hippocampal regions were compared in male, adult specimens of the two closely related species of wild mice, Apodemus flavicollis (yellow-necked wood mice) and Apodemus sylvaticus (long-tailed wood mice). In one of the species, Apodemus flavicollis, the component containing the deep layers of the subiculum was found to be significantly larger in the hippocampal region of the left side than it was in that of the right side. No other significant asymmetries were found in the hippocampal components of the two species. These findings indicate that significant asymmetries in localized brain regions can arise during a single speciation event.",
