     "AB": "The relation between changes in the concentrations of some of the neuroactive extracellular amino acids (glutamate, aspartate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glycine and taurine) and epileptic seizures has been tested in a new experimental model of seizures induced by picrotoxin microdialysis in chronic freely moving rats. During ictal discharges (paroxysmal electroencephalographic discharges associated with behavioral seizures), a significant decrease in the levels of extracellular aspartate and glutamate was observed. However, no changes were found during the interictal discharges (paroxysmal electroencephalographic discharges, without concomitant seizures). Our results suggest that modifications in extracellular aspartate and glutamate may be related to neuronal synchronization rather than to paroxysmal activity, supporting the neurophysiological differences between non-ictal and ictal paroxysmal activity.",
