     "AB": "Steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR)-related lipid transfer (START) domain 6 (StarD6) is known to be exclusively expressed in germ cells of testis. As little is known about StarD6 expression in the nervous system, we investigated the distribution of StarD6 in rat neural tissues. Immunoreactivity of StarD6 was detected in the brain, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia; particularly cerebral cortex (layer V and VI), hippocampus, substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. We provided compelling evidence that multiple neuronal and glial populations were immunolabelled with anti-StarD6 antibody throughout the nervous system. We postulate that StarD6 might play an important role in lipid sensing of the nervous system based on its immunolocalization in this study.",
