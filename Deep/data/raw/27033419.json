     "AB": "The aim of this study was to use n-3 fatty acid-deficient pregnant mice to assess maternal behavior in the perinatal period. Female mice were fed either an n-3 fatty acid-deficient (n-3 Def) or -adequate (n-3 Adq) diet for two generations. The nest score and volume of the n-3 Def dams were lower than those of the n-3 Adq dams. In the observation of the post-delivery conditions, 40% of the n-3 Def dams attacked their newborns or did not nurse them. The brain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels of the n-3 Def dams were lower than those of the n-3 Adq dams. In the hippocampus, moreover, positive correlations were observed between the DHA and the 5-HT or 5-HIAA, and a negative correlation was observed between the DHA and the DA. These results suggest that dietary n-3 fatty acids may normalize the development of maternal behavior and prevent postpartum depression.",
