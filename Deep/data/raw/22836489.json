     "AB": "Liver X receptor (LXR) alpha and beta are nuclear receptors that are crucial for the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Activation of LXRs in the brain facilitates cholesterol clearance and improves cognitive deficits, thus they are considered as promising drug targets to treat diseases such as atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, little is known about the function and localization of LXRs in the brain. Here, we studied the expression of LXR in the brains of rats that received free access to 10% (w/v) fructose group (FG) in their beverages or water control drinks (control group (CG)). After 6 weeks rats in the FG presented with hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, and became glucose intolerant, suggesting a progression toward type 2 diabetes. We found that hypothalamic LXR expression was altered in fructose-fed rats. Rats in the FG presented with a decrease in LXRbeta levels while showing an increase in LXRalpha expression in the hypothalamus but not in the hippocampus, cerebellum, or neocortex. Moreover, both LXRalpha and beta expression correlated negatively with insulin and triglyceride levels. Interestingly, LXRbeta showed a negative correlation with the area under the curve during the glucose tolerance test in the CG and a positive correlation in the FG. Immunocytochemistry revealed that the paraventricular and ventromedial nuclei express mainly LXRalpha whereas the arcuate nucleus expresses LXRbeta. Both LXR immunosignals were found in the median preoptic area. This is the first study showing a relationship between glucose and lipid homeostasis and the expression of LXRs in the hypothalamus, suggesting that LXRs may trigger neurochemical and neurophysiological responses for the control of food intake and energy expenditure through these receptors.",
