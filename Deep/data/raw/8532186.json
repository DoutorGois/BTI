     "AB": "The in vitro and in vivo pharmacology of a structurally novel competitive antagonist for the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) subtype of excitatory amino acid receptors is described. LY215490, (+/-)(6-(2-(1-H-tetrazol-5-yl)ethyl) decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid), was shown to displace selectively 3H-AMPA and 3H-6-cyano-7-nitro- quinoxaline-2,3-dione (3H-CNQX) binding to rat brain membranes. LY215490 potently antagonized quisqualate-and AMPA-induced depolarizations of rat cortical slices in a competitive manner, while requiring higher concentrations to antagonize the effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainate. In slices of rat hippocampus, LY215490 also selectively antagonized AMPA-evoked release of 3H-norepinephrine. These AMPA receptor activities were due to the (-) isomer of the compound. (3S,4aR,6R, 8aR)-6-[2-(1(2)H-tetrazole-5-yl)ethyl] decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (LY293558). LY215490 was centrally active following parenteral administration in mice as demonstrated by protection versus maximal electroshock seizures and decreases in spontaneous motor activity. LY215490 (its active isomer being LY293558) represents a novel pharmacological agent for in vitro and in vivo studies of AMPA receptor function in the CNS.",
