     "AB": "In the experiments carried out on Albino-Swiss mice it was found, that bilateral clamping of carotid arteries (BCCA) for 30 min produce the increase of GABA content in hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex and decrease of the seizures susceptibility to bicuculline, investigated 7 days after surgery. Moreover, BCCA modulates the action of aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA): potentiates anticonvulsive effect of low doses of AOAA (33 mg/kg) and inhibits the convulsive action of high doses. Also the potentiation of the anticonvulsive effect of diazepam, phenobarbital and valproic acid (VPA) was observed in BCCA and AOAA (CD97, 150 mg/kg) treated animals. Observed effects suggests that enhanced GABA-ergic activity and decrease of excitatory amino acid (EAA) system could be involved in these processes.",
