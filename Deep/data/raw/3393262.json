     "AB": "The effect of L- and D-stereoisomers of 2-(4-phenylpiperidino) cyclohexanol (AH 5183) on the spontaneous release of acetylcholine (ACh) from rat hippocampal tissue was studied. L-AH 5183 was approximately 100 times more potent than was D-AH 5183 in reducing spontaneous ACh release. Spontaneous ACh release was also temperature dependent. These results may suggest that the spontaneous release of ACh from brain tissue is carrier-mediated.",
