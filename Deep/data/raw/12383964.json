     "AB": "We investigated the effect of ovariectomy (OVX) and hormonal treatment for 10 weeks by estradiol and progesterone on muscarinic M(4) receptor subtype in different brain areas of female rats. Moreover, motor activity of OVX and hormone-treated rats was measured by automated open field exploration boxes. Receptor quantification in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, parietal cortex, amygdala and hypothalamus was done by receptor autoradiography using a selective ligand for muscarinic M(4) receptors. Ovariectomy up-regulated M(4) receptors in the dentate gyrus, CA1, CA3, frontal cortex and hypothalamus whereas the estrogen treatment restored M(4) binding to that of the sham group. Progesterone treatment had no effect on the ovariectomy-induced up-regulation of M(4) receptors. Ovariectomy significantly decreased the exploratory activity of the rats compared to the sham group. Estrogen treatment restored the exploratory behavior of the ovariectomized rats to that of the sham group whereas the progesterone-treated rats were less alert to the surrounding when compared to the sham and estrogen supplemented rats. The effect of estrogen on the hippocampal muscarinic M(4) receptor subtype is a novel finding and may have functional significance for cholinergic receptors especially in relation to postmenopausal memory problems and neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's disease.",
