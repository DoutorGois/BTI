     "AB": "Dementia associated with cortical and subcortical Lewy bodies (LB's) is a distinct entity with variable clinico-pathological presentation. We present the case of a 49-year-old male with progressive dementia. At autopsy, the brain showed diffuse cortical atrophy and ubiquitin-positive LB's in the dentate gyrus, deep layers of the neocortex, basal ganglia, nucleus basalis and substantia nigra. Thioflavine S stains of the neocortex and hippocampus were negative for the presence of plaques and tangles. Anti-ubiquitin immunostaining revealed abundant dystrophic neurites, torpedo-like axons and abnormal neuritic processes in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, pyramidal cell layer in CA1, subiculum, deep layers of the neocortex, claustrum, caudate, putamen and globus pallidus. Relatively mild neuritic alterations were observed in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) and locus ceruleus. The presence of this unique type of axonal damage associated with Lewy body disease, in the absence of plaques and tangles, might suggest a divergent mechanism of neuritic injury in the wide spectrum of this disorder.",
