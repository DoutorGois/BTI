     "AB": "The hippocampus has a critical role in certain kinds of spatial memory processes. Hippocampal \"place\" cells, fire selectively when an animal is in a particular location within the environment. It is thought that this activity underlies a representation of the environment that can be used for memory-based spatial navigation. But how is this representation constructed and how is it \"read\"? A simple mechanism, based on place field density across an environment, is described that could allow hippocampal representations to be \"read\" by other brain regions for the purpose of navigation. The possible influence of activity in neighboring brain regions such as the perirhinal cortex, and pre- and para-subiculum on the construction of the hippocampal spatial representation is then discussed.",
