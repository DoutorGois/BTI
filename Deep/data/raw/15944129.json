     "AB": "Increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) mediated by NMDA-sensitive glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are important for synaptic plasticity. We studied a wide variety of dendritic spines on rat CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices. Two-photon uncaging and Ca2+ imaging revealed that NMDAR-mediated currents increased with spine-head volume and that even the smallest spines contained a significant number of NMDARs. The fate of Ca2+ that entered spine heads through NMDARs was governed by the shape (length and radius) of the spine neck. Larger spines had necks that permitted greater efflux of Ca2+ into the dendritic shaft, whereas smaller spines manifested a larger increase in [Ca2+]i within the spine compartment as a result of a smaller Ca2+ flux through the neck. Spine-neck geometry is thus an important determinant of spine Ca2+ signaling, allowing small spines to be the preferential sites for isolated induction of long-term potentiation.",
