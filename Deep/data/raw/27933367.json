     "AB": "Hypothermia and hypometabolism (hypometabothermia) normally observed during natural hibernation and torpor, allow animals to protect their body and brain against the damaging effects of adverse environment. A similar state of hypothermia can be achieved under artificial conditions through physical cooling or pharmacological effects directed at suppression of metabolism and the processes of thermoregulation. In these conditions called torpor-like states, the mammalian ability to recover from stroke, heart attack, and traumatic injuries greatly increases. Therefore, the development of therapeutic methods for different pathologies is a matter of great concern. With the discovery of the antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine in the 1950s of the last century, the first attempts to create a pharmacologically induced state of hibernation for therapeutic purposes were made. That was the beginning of numerous studies in animals and the broad use of therapeutic hypothermia in medicine. Over the last years, many new agents have been discovered which were capable of lowering the body temperature and inhibiting the metabolism. The psychotropic agents occupy a significant place among them, which, in our opinion, is not sufficiently recognized in the contemporary literature. In this review, we summarized the latest achievements related to the ability of modern antipsychotics to target specific receptors in the brain, responsible for the initiation of hypometabothermia.",
