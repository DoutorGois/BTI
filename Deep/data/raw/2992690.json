     "AB": "Electrophysiological studies using rats were performed to examine the influence of locus coeruleus (LC) on nucleus accumbens (Acc) neurons. Spike generation by hippocampal stimulation was inhibited by both LC conditioning stimulation and iontophoretic application of noradrenaline, but spikes elicited by stimulation of parafascicular nucleus of thalamus were rarely affected by LC conditioning stimulation or noradrenaline. The LC-induced inhibition was antagonized by iontophoretic sotalol, but not by phentolamine, suggesting that noradrenaline derived from the LC inhibits the Acc neurons receiving input from the hippocampus, probably acting on a beta-adrenergic receptor.",
