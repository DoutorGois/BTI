     "AB": "This study investigated whether memantine, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist is neuroprotective after traumatic brain injury (TBI) induced in adult rats with a controlled cortical impact device. TBI led to significant neuronal death in the hippocampal CA2 and CA3 regions (by 50 and 59%, respectively), by 7 days after the injury. Treatment of rats with memantine (10 and 20 mg/Kg, i.p.) immediately after the injury significantly prevented the neuronal loss in both CA2 and CA3 regions. This is the first study showing the neuroprotective potential of memantine to prevent the TBI-induced neuronal damage.",
