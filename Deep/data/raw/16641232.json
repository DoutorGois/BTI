     "AB": "The ability of synchronous population activity in layered networks to transmit a rate code is a focus of recent debate. We investigate these issues using a patterned unidimensional hippocampal culture. The network exhibits population bursts that travel its full length, with the advantage that signals propagate along a clearly defined path. The amplitudes of activity are measured using calcium imaging, a good approximate of population rate code, and the distortion of the signal as it travels is analyzed. We demonstrate that propagation along the line is precisely described by information theory as a chain of Gaussian communication channels. The balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses is crucial for this transmission. However, amplitude information carried along this layered neuronal structure fails within 3 mm, approximately 10 mean axon lengths, and is limited by noise in the synaptic transmission. We conclude that rate codes cannot be reliably transmitted through long layered networks.",
