     "AB": "We have used in situ hybridization to determine the distribution of pre-pro-neurotensin/neuromedin N (NT/N) mRNA in the brain of mice and rats. In rats and mice, expression was observed in the lateral septal nucleus, nucleus accumbens, medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral hypothalamus, central amygdaloid nucleus and the subicilum. However, several differences in the NT/N mRNA distribution were observed between rats and mice in other brain areas. In mice, NT/N expression was detected in the subthalamic nucleus and geniculate nucleus, whereas expression was not observed in these brain areas in rats. Surprisingly, expression was not observed in mouse mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) neurons and the CA1 area of the hippocampus, areas known to contain NT/N mRNA in the rat brain. Taken together, these results show that although the brain NT/N mRNA distribution largely overlaps in mice and rats, species differences exist in specific brain areas in rodents. Moreover, these data indicate that the distribution in mice resembles most that of primates than rats.",
