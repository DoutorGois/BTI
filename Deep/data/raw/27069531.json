     "AB": "Using a simulated oxidative stress model of hippocampus-derived immortalized cell line (HT22), we report that prooxidant buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, 1 mM, 14 h), without adversely affecting cell viability or morphology, induced oxidative stress by inhibiting glutathione synthesis. BSO treatment also significantly reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (p < 0.05) and significantly lowered total antioxidant capacity (p < 0.001) in HT22 cells when compared to vehicle treated control cells. Antioxidant tempol, a piperidine nitroxide considered a SOD mimetic, reversed BSO-induced decline in SOD activity (p < 0.01) and also increased BSO-induced decline in total antioxidant capacity (p < 0.05). Interestingly, BSO treatment significantly reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption (p < 0.05), decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (p < 0.05), and lowered ATP production (p < 0.05) when compared to vehicle treated control cells, collectively indicative of mitochondrial impairment. Antioxidant tempol treatment mitigated all three indicators of mitochondrial impairment. We postulate that BSO-induced oxidative stress in HT22 cells caused mitochondrial impairment, and tempol by increasing SOD activity and improving antioxidant capacity presumably protected the cells from BSO-induced mitochondrial impairment. In conclusion, present study provides an interesting simulation of oxidative stress in hippocampal cells, which will serve as an excellent model to study mitochondrial functions.",
