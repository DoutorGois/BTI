     "AB": "In rats, chronically implanted for measurements of both voltammetric and polygraphic parameters, variations of the electrochemical signal corresponding to extracellular 5-hydroxyindole compounds (peak 3) were measured during the sleep-waking cycle. The higher amplitude of this signal is always measured during waking. It decreases during slow-wave sleep (20 to 30%) and reaches its lower value during paradoxical sleep (30 to 40%). This phenomenon has been found in all structures investigated, cerebral cortex, caudate nuclei, dorsal hippocampus, suprachiasmatic nuclei, cerebellum, nuclei raphe dorsalis, centralis, pontis and magnus.",
