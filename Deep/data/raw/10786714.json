     "AB": "The excessive increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration is associated with events linking cerebral blood flow reduction to neuronal cell damage. We have investigated the possible effect of ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ transport. Two different models of ischemia as well as two different anesthetics were used. 5 min and 15 min of global forebrain ischemia caused significant depression of the rate of microsomal Ca2+ accumulation in pentobarbital anesthetised gerbils. The Ca2+ uptake activity recovered partially after 1 hour of reperfusion. Unlike pentobarbital anesthetised gerbils, no significant changes were detected in the active microsomal Ca(2+)-transport after 10 min of global forebrain ischemia in gerbil forebrain and hippocampus under halothane anesthesia. In addition, using the model of decapitation ischemia, we observed significant changes of the Ca2+ uptake in both halothane and pentobarbital anesthetised gerbils. These findings indicate that ischemic insult alters the brain microsomal Ca2+ transport which is not due to inhibition of the Ca(2+)-ATPase activity. However, the effect of ischemia on this transport system is dependent on the model of ischemia and on the type of anesthetics.",
