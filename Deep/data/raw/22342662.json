     "AB": "Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the etiology of chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. INM-176 is a standardized ethanolic extract of Angelica gigas, which has been traditionally used as a tonic to treat anemia. In the present study, we investigated whether INM-176 exhibits neuroprotective activities against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuronal damage in vitro and in vivo. In primary microglial cells, INM-176 significantly inhibited LPS-induced nitric oxide release and expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta. The expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cylcooxygenase-2 in BV2 microglial cells were markedly upregulated by LPS, but this increased expression was counteracted by INM-176. LPS-mediated neuronal damage in an organotypic hippocampal slice culture was also attenuated by the administration of INM-176. In addition, LPS (1 mug/2 mul, i.c.v.)-induced cognitive dysfunction in mice, as determined by passive avoidance and Y-maze tasks, was significantly attenuated by the administration of INM-176. Furthermore, the activation of microglia or astrocytes by LPS in the hippocampal regions of mice was suppressed by INM-176. These results suggest that the neuroprotective and cognition ameliorating effects of INM-176 against LPS-induced damage are mediated, in part, by its anti-inflammatory activities.",
