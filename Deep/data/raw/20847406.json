     "AB": "The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) is a verbal episodic memory test used to identify patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study investigates the relationships between performance on FCSRT and grey matter atrophy assessed with structural MRI in patients with AD. Three complementary MRI-based analyses (VBM analysis, ROI-based analysis, and three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis) were performed in 35 patients with AD to analyze correlations between regional atrophy and their scores for episodic memory using the FCSRT. With VBM analysis, the total score on the FCSRT was correlated with left medial temporal lobe atrophy including the left hippocampus but also the thalami. In addition, using ROI-based analysis, the total recall score on the FCSRT was correlated with the left hippocampal volume. With three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis, both free recall and total recall scores were correlated with regions corresponding approximately to the CA1 field. No correlation was found with short term memory scores using any of these methods of analysis. In AD, the FCSRT may be considered as a useful clinical marker of memory disorders due to medial temporal damage, specially the CA1 field of the hippocampus.",
