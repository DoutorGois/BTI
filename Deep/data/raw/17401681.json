     "AB": "Increased levels of iron in specific brain regions have been reported in neurodegenerative disorders. It has been postulated that iron exerts its deleterious effects on the nervous system by inducing oxidative damage. In a previous study, we have shown that iron administered during a particular period of the neonatal life induces oxidative damage in brain regions in adult rats. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible protective effect of selegiline, a monoamino-oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor used in pharmacotherapy of Parkinson's disease, against iron-induced oxidative stress in the brain. Results have shown that selegiline (1.0 and 10.0 mg/kg), when administered early in life was able to protect the substantia nigra as well as the hippocampus against iron-induced oxidative stress, without affecting striatum. When selegiline (10.0 mg/kg) was administered in the adult life to iron-treated rats, oxidative stress was reduced only in the substantia nigra.",
