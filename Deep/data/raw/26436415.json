     "AB": "The transient receptor potential subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) belongs to the diverse transient receptor potential (TRP) family of cation channels. It was first characterized in primary afferent fibres as a receptor for capsaicin. Peripheral TRPV1 has a very well-described role in nociception. However, TRPV1 is now recognized to have a broader distribution and function, with supraspinal/brain TRPV1 known to modulate pain processing. Recently, studies employing histological, genetic and pharmacological approaches have provided evidence that supraspinal TRPV1 also modulates brain neurobiology and behaviours related to anxiety, depression and schizophrenia. Key brain regions involved in TRPV1-mediated modulation of pain and affect include the periaqueductal grey, hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. Thus, TRPV1 in the brain is emerging as an important molecular substrate which is dually implicated in both pain and psychiatric disorders, and represents a novel therapeutic target for these conditions and their comorbidity.",
