     "AB": "We investigated localization of Phospholipase C beta (PLCbeta1 and PLCbeta4) in laminaes of dorsal hippocampus and different subtypes of hippocampal interneurons in normal Kunming mouse, and their progressive changes during pilocarpine induced status epilepticus (SE) by quantitative immunohistochemistry and real time PCR. PLCbeta1 was observed in the pyramidal layer of CA1-3 area, hilus of the dentate gyrus, whereas PLCbeta4 was mainly expressed in calcium binding protein positive interneurons, i.e. calbindin, calretinin, parvalbumin positive interneurons in the strata oriens, radiatum of the CA area and hilus of the dentate gyrus. During pilocarpine induced SE, a temporary down-regulation of PLCbeta4 in the interneurons of CA area at SE 30min, and a progressive reduction of PLCbeta1/PLCbeta4 in dentate hilar cells were demonstrated. These findings confirm and extend the regional specific distribution of PLCbeta1 and PLCbeta4 immunoreactivity in mouse hippocampus, and suggest that PLCbeta1 and PLCbeta4 may play an important role in maintenance of the status epilepticus.",
