     "AB": "The cellular uptake of D-aspartic acid (D-Asp) as a model compound for glutamic acid transport was studied in rat hippocampal slices. D-Asp is accumulated by both Na(+)-dependent and Na(+)-independent processes in hippocampal slices, and both processes are dependent on temperature. The Na(+)-dependent uptake is assumed to be high in affinity (apparent Km = 0.17 mM), but low in capacity, whereas the Na(+)-independent uptake is much lower in affinity (Km = 2.86 mM), but higher in capacity. L-Aspartic acid, L-glutamic acid, dihydrokainic acid, and threo-3-hydroxy-DL-aspartic acid markedly inhibited the uptake of D-Asp with Na+ in the medium, whereas D-glutamic acid, glycine, and L-lysine had no significant effect. The Na(+)-dependent uptake of D-Asp was significantly reduced under \"hypoglycemic,\" \"anoxic,\" and \"ischemic\" conditions, whereas the Na(+)-independent uptake was unaffected. Metabolic inhibitors such as NaCN and ICH2COOH significantly inhibited the Na(+)-dependent uptake, but not the Na(+)-independent uptake. These results suggest that the Na(+)-dependent component of D-Asp transport in rat hippocampal cells is inactivated under ischemic conditions, whereas the Na(+)-independent component is unaffected.",
