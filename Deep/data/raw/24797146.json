     "AB": "The expression pattern and functional roles for calcium-activated potassium channels of the KCa2.x family and KCa1.1 have been extensively examined in central neurons. Recent work indicates that intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (KCa3.1) are also expressed in central neurons of the cerebellum and spinal cord. The current study used immunocytochemistry and GFP linked to KCNN4 promoter activity in a transgenic mouse to determine the expression pattern of KCa3.1 channels in rat or mouse neocortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. KCa3.1 immunolabel and GFP expression were closely matched and detected in both excitatory and inhibitory cells of all regions examined. KCa3.1 immunolabel was localized primarily to the somatic region of excitatory cells in cortical structures but at the soma and over longer segments of dendrites of cells in deep cerebellar nuclei. More extensive labeling was apparent for inhibitory cells at the somatic and dendritic level with no detectable label associated with axon tracts or regions of intense synaptic innervation. The data indicate that KCa3.1 channels are expressed in the CNS with a differential pattern of distribution between cells, suggesting important functional roles for these calcium-activated potassium channels in regulating the excitability of central neurons.",
