     "AB": "Fibroblast growth factors are important regulators of neuronal development. In this study, we observed fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) immunoreactivity and its protein levels in the hippocampus proper (CA1-3 regions) of the gerbil at various time points after ischemia/reperfusion. In the sham-operated group, FGFR1 immunoreaction was not detected in the hippocampus proper. FGFR1 immunoreaction was first detected in non-pyramidal neurons in the CA1-3 region at 12h and 1day after ischemia/reperfusion. From 2days after ischemia/reperfusion, FGFR1 immunoreaction was found in astrocytes, not in microglial cells, in the CA1 region: FGFR1 immunoreactivity and the number of astrocytes were significantly increased at 5days post-ischemia. Western blot analysis revealed that FGFR1 protein levels were also increased from 1day after ischemia/reperfusion. These results indicate that increase of FGFR1 in astrocytes of the ischemic CA1 region may be associated with gliosis followed by delayed neuronal death.",
