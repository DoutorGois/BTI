     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Danggui-Jakyak-San (DJS), a traditional herbal prescription, has been used to treat insufficient blood supplies. Recently, regenerative medication for the treatment of cerebral ischemia has drawn the attention of many researchers. METHODS: In this study, we examined whether DJS exerts a neuronal regenerative effect in the hippocampus of a transient forebrain ischemia mice model. Transient forebrain ischemia was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). Animals were divided into three groups (sham, BCCAO + vehicle, and BCCAO + DJS). To test the effect of DJS on learning and memory, Morris water maze or passive avoidance test was conducted. To test neuroprotective and neurogenic effect, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were used. Statistical significance was analyzed with Student t-test, one-way or two-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: We found that the administration of DJS ameliorated ischemia-induced spatial memory impairment in the Morris water maze task. Moreover, Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta)/beta-catenin signaling was increased by DJS, which would be one possible mechanism of DJS for neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that DJS is a possible candidate for the treatment of ischemia-induced neuronal degeneration.",
