     "AB": "Combination therapies are a promising therapeutic option for traumatic brain injury (TBI) owing to the clinical failure of monotherapy treatments, such as progesterone. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) from Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to an in vitro TBI, and the neuroprotective effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) or memantine (MEM) monotherapies were quantified. Several combination treatments at different concentrations of both drugs were tested, with 100 pM of E2 and 10 muM of MEM statistically and significantly reducing cell death over either monotherapy when administered immediately after injury. This combination was also significantly neuroprotective when administered 1 h postinjury, possibly supporting future in vivo studies. Further, we hypothesized that this synergy could be the result of MEM blocking a potentially deleterious effect of E2, specifically E2 enhancement of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) currents. Evoked electrophysiological responses in OHSCs were potentiated by E2 treatment, whereas this potentiation was significantly reduced by MEM. In conclusion, a combination therapy of E2 and memantine was significantly more neuroprotective than both monotherapy treatments, and this synergy may be the result of MEM blocking a deleterious E2-mediated enhancement of NMDA receptors.",
