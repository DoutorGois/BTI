     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Energy metabolism is emerging as a driving force for cellular events underlying cognitive processing. The hypothalamus integrates metabolic signals with the function of centers related to cognitive processing such as the hippocampus. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: Hypothalamic activity can influence molecular systems important for processing synaptic plasticity underlying cognition in the hippocampus. The neurotrophin BDNF may act as a mediator for the effects of energy metabolism on synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. METHODS: The hypothalamus of rats confined to a respiratory chamber was electrically stimulated, and energy expenditure (EE) was assessed via indirect calorimetry. MRNA levels for BDNF and molecules related to synaptic plasticity and control of cellular energy metabolism were assessed in the hippocampus. RESULTS: Electrical stimulation of the rat hypothalamus elevates mRNA levels of hippocampal BDNF. BDNF mRNA levels increased according to the metabolic rate of the animals, and in proportion to the mRNA of molecules involved in control of cellular energy metabolism such as ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase (uMtCK). CONCLUSIONS: Results show a potential mechanism by which cellular energy metabolism impacts the substrates of cognitive processing, and may provide molecular basis for therapeutic treatments based on stimulation of deep brain structures.",
