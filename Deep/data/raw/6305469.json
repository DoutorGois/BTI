     "AB": "The effects of (-) trans-delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its metabolite cannabidiol (CBD) were investigated on evoked responses in the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the guinea pig transverse hippocampal slice. In both areas orthodromically evoked responses were enhanced by 10(-7) M THC, while 10(-6) M THC caused depression. Antidromic responses were not significantly affected. Antidromically-evoked inhibition in the CA1 region was decreased at low doses and unaffected at higher doses, while the facilitation by orthodromic interaction was unaffected at both dose ranges. The early part of the orthodromic field potential corresponding to the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) was enhanced at 10(-7) M in both areas. CBD (10(-6) M) decreased facilitation in CA1, and caused delayed excitation in the dentate granule layer. This study supports the conclusion that the biphasic effects of THC are dose dependent.",
