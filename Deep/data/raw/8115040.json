     "AB": "N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptors are implicated in several neuropathological conditions including epilepsy. As a model of complex partial seizures, rapid hippocampal kindling was chosen to investigate changes in the expression of messenger RNAs encoding the N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor subunits NR1, NR2A and NR2B both during and in the period immediately following the induction of the kindled state. The study demonstrates a cell-specific, time-dependent modulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor subunit messenger RNAs almost entirely restricted to the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. In partially kindled animals (10 stimulations), while the NR1 subunit messenger RNA remained unaltered after a period of 2 h, the NR2A and NR2B subunit messenger RNAs were bilaterally reduced in dentate gyrus granule cells by around 50% below control values. In fully kindled animals (40 stimulations), a progressive reduction in NR1 subunit messenger RNA levels in the dentate gyrus was observed, being maximal after 4 h (-67%). At the same time point, NR2A and NR2B transcript levels were transiently increased by 102% and 46% above control values, respectively. These data point to a differential regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor subunit messenger RNAs. No alterations were detected in pyramidal cells. Long-term maintenance of the kindled state was not associated with alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor subunit messenger RNAs since control levels of messenger RNA were attained by 12 h and persisted for at least five days. The early changes in messenger RNAs described in this study indicate that the expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor subunits is under independent regulatory control. This phenomenon may contribute to epileptogenesis and to kindling-associated plasticity by mediating a structural reorganization of N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptors, leading to an altered excitability of dentate gyrus granule cells.",
