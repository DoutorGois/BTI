     "AB": "Neuronal circuitries in the hippocampus are involved in navigation and memory and are controlled by major networks of GABAergic interneurons. Parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) are identified as fast-spiking cells, playing a crucial role in network oscillation and synchrony. The inhibitory modulation of these interneurons is thought to be mediated mainly through GABAA receptors, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. Here we show that all PV-positive interneurons in the granular/subgranular layer (GL/SGL) of the mouse DG express high levels of the GABAA receptor delta subunit. PV-containing interneurons in the hilus and the molecular layer, however, express the delta subunit to a lower extent. Only 8% of the somatostatin-containing interneurons express the delta subunit, whereas calbindin- or calretinin-containing interneurons in the DG seem not to express the GABAA receptor delta subunit at all. Hence, these cells receive a GABAergic control different from that of PV-containing interneurons in the GL/SGL. Experiments investigating a possible co-expression of GABAA receptor alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha4, alpha5, beta1, beta2, beta3, or gamma2 subunits with PV and delta subunits indicated that alpha1 and beta2 subunits are co-expressed with delta subunits along the extrasynaptic membranes of PV-interneurons. These results suggest a robust tonic GABAergic control of PV-containing interneurons in the GL/SGL of the DG via delta subunit-containing receptors. Our data are important for better understanding of the neuronal circuitries in the DG and the role of specific cell types under pathological conditions.",
