     "AB": "High pressures of helium affect the physiology of the central nervous system in animals and humans. We examined these effects in rat hippocampal slices. The in vitro preparation displayed a reversible reduction in postsynaptic and antidromic field potentials of CA1 pyramidal cells, but no significant change in the amplitude of the afferent volley. Although the subliminal synaptic response of CA1 neurons was depressed, the ability of these cells to produce population spikes was enhanced. These changes resembled those previously found in vivo in the rat hippocampus. The present results support the hypothesis of a helium pressure-induced depolarization of hippocampal neurons. Other possible mechanisms are discussed.",
