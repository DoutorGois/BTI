     "AB": "Intraperitoneal injection of ethanol (2 g/kg) produced significant motor impairment in rats, as measured by performance on the tilting plane. Administration of 3 mg/kg 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) antagonized the depressant effect of ethanol on motor performance. Using slices of hippocampus, in vitro, 4-aminopyridine (10-100 microM) also antagonized the ethanol-induced depressant effect on orthodromically-elicited population spikes in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. This antagonism appears to result from the ability of 4-aminopyridine to enhance release of transmitter in both excitatory and inhibitory neurones. Due to a number of unwanted side effects, further evaluation of 4-aminopyridine and its analogues needs to be done before it can be considered useful in the management of acute intoxication with ethanol.",
