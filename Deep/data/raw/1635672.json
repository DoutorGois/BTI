     "AB": "The mouse strain ddN from Japan was crossed with three other inbred strains prone to absence of the corpus callosum (BALB/cWah1, I/LnJ and 129/ReJ), and at least one brain with abnormally small corpus callosum was observed in offspring from each F1 hybrid cross. Data for several polymorphic protein markers revealed that the four strains are not closely related genetically. Nevertheless, they share common genetic causes of an absent corpus callosum, which helps to understand why anatomical studies of ddN and BALB/c have yielded similar results. The hippocampal commissure is abnormally small in I/LnJ mice and the anterior commissure is often malformed in BALB/c mice, but both commissures in hybrids were normal, which suggests a different genetic basis for these defects and the absent corpus callosum.",
