     "AB": "Reserpine injection (1 mg/kg i.p.) could not only significantly reduce cAMP levels in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus in naive WC1 mice, but also potentiate the degree of seizures elicited by CL. Reserpine injection could significantly shorten CL-seizures latency and decrease its threshold, too. Reserpine pretreatment could also diminish CL seizure-induced accumulation of cAMP. These results indicated the cAMP level elevated by seizure activity was associated with monoamine neurotransmitter activity, and the seizure-induced accumulation of cAMP might take part in the process which eliminated the spread of seizure discharges and speeded up the termination of seizures.",
