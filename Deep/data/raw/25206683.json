     "AB": "In vitro studies have shown that estrogen receptor beta can attenuate the cytotoxic effect of amyloid beta protein on PC12 cells through the Akt pathway without estrogen stimulation. In this study, we aimed to observe the effect of estrogen receptor beta in Alzheimer's disease rat models established by intraventricular injection of amyloid beta protein. Estrogen receptor beta lentiviral particles delivered via intraventricular injection increased Akt content in the hippocampus, decreased interleukin-1beta mRNA, tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA and amyloid beta protein levels in the hippocampus, and improved the learning and memory capacities in Alzheimer's disease rats. Estrogen receptor beta short hairpin RNA lentiviral particles delivered via intraventricular injection had none of the above impacts on Alzheimer's disease rats. These experimental findings indicate that estrogen receptor beta, independent from estrogen, can reduce inflammatory reactions and amyloid beta deposition in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease rats, and improve learning and memory capacities. This effect may be mediated through activation of the Akt pathway.",
