     "PG": "388-404",
     "AB": "Receptor binding and gene expression of several members of the IGF gene family were examined in the rat brain following lesion of the hippocampal dentate gyrus granular cells by intradentate colchicine injection. Dentate granular cell loss was accompanied by extensive reactive gliosis in the lesioned hippocampus and damaged overlying cortex, as verified by the increase in GFAP mRNA and BS-1 lectin binding. At 4 days post-lesion, 125I-IGF-2 binding was dramatically increased within the lesioned dentate gyrus and damaged overlying cortex, and corresponded temporally and anatomically with increased IGF-BP2 gene expression following the lesion. Increased IGF-BP3 gene expression was only observed in the overlying cortex at 10 days post-lesion, and corresponded with an increase in 125I-IGF-1 binding at the injured surface of the cortex. Type-2 IGF receptor mRNA expression was reduced to background levels in the lesioned dentate gyrus, suggesting that IGF-BP2 was a major component of the observed increase in 125I-IGF-2 binding. In situ hybridization also revealed a prominent increase in IGF-1 mRNA expression by 4 days post-lesion, which was localized within the lesioned dentate gyrus and damaged cortical areas, and was shown to be expressed by microglia. While no IGF-2 mRNA expression was observed within the CNS, either prior to, or following the lesion, IGF-2 mRNA expression was observed in the choroid plexus, meningeal membranes, and in blood vessel endothelium, providing a potential source for the transport of IGF-2 into the CNS. In the injured CNS, increased IGF-BP2 expression may act to maintain or transport IGF-1 or IGF-2, as well as modulate the local autocrine and paracrine actions of the IGFs. Increased microglial IGF-1 expression following colchicine treatment correlates with the timing of a number of post-traumatic events within the CNS, suggesting that IGF-1 may have a role as a neuroprotectant for surviving neurons and signal for local neuronal sprouting, as well as a role in reactive astrogliosis.",
