     "AB": "We report the case of a patient who had an important experience with painful events, allowing the investigation of brain concomitants to painful (P) memories in fMRI. The patient had to recall P events that were contrasted with non-painful (NP) memories. Painful memories of the right lower limb activated the left paracentral lobule,fronto-insular operculum and superior parietal cortex. Additionally, whilst the recall of non-painful events activated the hippocampus, the recall of painful events did not enhance the hippocampal signal to significant levels. These suggest that brain activations differ for the autobiographical recall of painful and non-painful memories.",
