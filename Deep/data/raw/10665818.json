     "AB": "Taurine induces a long-lasting potentiation of excitatory synaptic potentials due to the enhancement of both synaptic efficacy and axon excitability in the CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices. In this study, we characterized the role of Ca2+ in the generation of these long-lasting taurine effects. Taurine perfusion in a free-Ca2+ medium did not induce changes in either field excitatory synaptic potentials (fEPSP) slope or fiber volley (FV) amplitude. Intracellular recordings with a micropipette filled with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA, prevented the EPSP potentiation induced by taurine in the impaled cell, whereas a long-lasting potentiation of the simultaneously recorded fEPSP was obtained. The depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin (1 microM), an inhibitor of endosomal Ca2+-ATPase, transformed the taurine-induced potentiation into a transitory process that declined to basal values after taurine withdrawal. Taurine-induced potentiation was not significantly affected by kynurenate (glutamate receptor antagonist), or nifedipine (high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channel antagonist). But, the presence of nickel (50 microM), an antagonist of low-voltage-activated Ca2+ channel, inhibited the taurine-induced potentiation, indicating that Ca2+ influx through this type of Ca2+ channels could account for the Ca2+ requirement of the taurine-induced potentiation. Occlusion experiments between tetanus-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) and taurine-induced potentiation indicate that both processes share some common mechanisms during the maintenance period.",
