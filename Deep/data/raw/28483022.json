     "AB": "Objective To establish a postpartum depression animal model induced by pre-pregnancy stress,assess abnormal maternal depressive-like behavior,observe the expression of disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) in the hippocampus,and detect serum estradiol and corticosterone.Methods A total of 32 female Balb/c were assigned to two groups using random number table:the control group and the pre-pregnancy stressed group(model group),and the model group was subjected to 3 weeks of chronic restraint stress. After the last stressor,the control group and the model group were housed with a male. About 4 weeks later,the mice gave birth to pups. Then at 3 weeks postpartum,open field test,tail suspension test,and sucrose preference test were carried out. The expressions of DISC1 mRNA and protein of hippocampus were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot,respectively. The serum levels of estradiol and corticosterone were detected with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results After 3 weeks of postpartum,the model mice showed depression-like behaviors. In the open field test,there was no effect on the total distance moved or time spent in the center field (P>0.05). Immobility in tail suspension test was significantly increased (t=-4.950,P<0.001) and sucrose preference was significantly reduced in model group (t=2.475,P<0.05). There was significant statistical difference between control and model group on the expression of DISC1 mRNA (t=-8.915,P<0.001) and protein (t=-5.004,P<0.01) in hippocampus. There was no significant statistical difference on estradiol and corticosterone between two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion Chronic pre-pregnancy stress can induce dams into postpartum depression.The pathogenesis of postpartum depression may be related to the regulation of DISC1 in the hippocampus.",
