     "AB": "The presence and pattern of iron accumulation in subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment (svMCI) and their effects on cognition have rarely been investigated. We aimed to examine brain iron deposition in svMCI subjects using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Moreover, we aimed to investigate the correlation between brain iron deposition and the severity of cognitive impairment as indicated by z-scores. We recruited 20 subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) patients who fulfilled the criteria for svMCI. The control group comprised 19 SIVD patients without cognitive impairment. The SIVD and control groups were matched based on age, gender, and years of education. Both groups underwent QSM using a 3.0T MRI system. Susceptibility maps were reconstructed from in vivo data, which were acquired with a three-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled sequence. Then, regions of interest were drawn manually on the map of each subject. The inter-group differences of susceptibility values were explored in deep gray matter nuclei, including the bilateral pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, head of caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and red nucleus. The correlations between regional iron deposition and composite z-score, memory z-score, language z-score, attention-executive z-score and visuospatial z-score were assessed using partial correlation analysis, with patient age and gender as covariates. Compared with the control, the svMCI group had elevated susceptibility values within the bilateral hippocampus and right putamen. Furthermore, the susceptibility value in the right hippocampus was negatively correlated with memory z-score and positively correlated with language z-score. The susceptibility value in the right putamen was negatively correlated with attention-executive z-score in the svMCI group. However, composite z-score were unrelated to susceptibility values. Our results suggest that brain iron deposition has clinical relevance as a biomarker for cognition. In addition, our results highlight the importance of iron deposition in understanding svMCI-associated cognitive deficits in addition to conventional MRI markers.",
