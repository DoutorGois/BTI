     "AB": "An aim of the present study was a comparative investigation of a delta-sleep inducing peptide and the drug deltaran on the neural activity of the brain structures involved in emotional processing. Another goal was to analyze the possibility to prevent negative effects of emotional stress on brain ischemia using, along with deltaran, glycine and a delta-sleep inducing peptide. Deltaran and the delta-sleep inducing peptide exert in general similar effect on the burst activity of neurons in the dorsal hippocampus, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and ventral anterior thalamic nucleus, inducing amplification of the majority of recorded units. The activation of neuronal activity was seen mostly after the delta-sleep inducing peptide microiontophoresis in the dorsal hippocampus and after the deltaran application in the hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei. The index characterizing blood supply was significantly higher in all rats receiving deltaran as compared to the controls. Animals receiving deltaran survived experimental brain ischemia in 100% cases versus 38% in those not exposed to this drug.",
