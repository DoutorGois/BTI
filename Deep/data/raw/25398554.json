     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Brain atrophy after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been detected in humans and might serve as a functional read-out parameter for neuropsychological deficits. To determine whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide information on brain atrophy in animals as well, mice that had undergone experimental SAH were scanned repeatedly after the bleeding. METHODS: Using a 7-T rodent MRI, six mice were evaluated for total hemispheric, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and hippocampal volumes on days 1, 2, 4, 21, 28, 42 and 60 after experimental SAH or sham operation, respectively. RESULTS: Repeated MRI scanning demonstrated a very high reproducibility with minimum standard deviation. Nevertheless, no significant differences were found between the two groups concerning hemispherical volumes or hippocampal volumes. A transient but significant increase in CSF volume was detected on days 2 and 60 after SAH. Compared with the existing method, no MRI data on brain atrophy in mice after experimental SAH have been published. CONCLUSION: Repeated brain MRI in mice after experimental SAH did not provide additional information on brain atrophy. Our data suggest that this is not due to a lack of sensitivity of the method. Despite all promising details about MRI, our results should initiate careful consideration (additional sequences/other questions) before its further use in this certain area, especially since it is expensive and associated with demanding logistics.",
