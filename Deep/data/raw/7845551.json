     "AB": "Glutamate (Glu), the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system, is toxic to neurons when it accumulates at high concentrations in the extracellular space. Even though Glu is a mixed agonist, capable of activating N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and non-NMDA receptors, in many preparations Glu neurotoxicity is prevented by selective blockade of NMDA receptors. In cultures of hippocampal neurons, treatment with 500 microM Glu for 30 min killed more than 90% of the neurons. The simultaneous addition of the selective NMDA agonist methyl-10,11-dihydro-5-H-dibenzocyclo-hepten-5,10-imine (MK-801) reduced the cell loss to less than 30%. However, when Glu was combined with either diazoxide or cyclothiazide, two thiazides which dramatically diminish rapid Glu desensitization, MK-801 was no longer very protective and neuronal loss exceeded 80%. However, the non-NMDA antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), in combination with MK-801, was able to prevent most Glu neurotoxicity in the presence of these thiazides. These experiments show that there are circumstances under which Glu neurotoxicity is produced by overactivation of non-NMDA receptors. Our observations offer a possible explanation for the recent finding that blockade of non-NMDA receptors is much more beneficial than NMDA receptor blockade in protecting the brain in some in vivo models of global ischemia.",
