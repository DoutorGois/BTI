     "AB": "The effect of recurrent seizures in developing rats on subsequent long-term behavior was studied. Fifteen day old rats received a convulsant dosage of flurothyl three times daily for five consecutive days. When the rats were fully mature, they underwent behavioral testing using the water maze and auditory quality or location discrimination. With serial flurothyl administration seizure duration increased progressively but latency to seizure onset did not change. Compared to controls, flurothyl-treated rats had impaired performance in the water maze and on auditory location, but not on quality discrimination. Histological examination showed no gross cell loss in the hippocampus. This study demonstrates that serial seizures in the developing brain cause detrimental effects on visual and auditory spatial learning.",
