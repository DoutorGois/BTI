     "AB": "Although pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is the major pathway of glucose metabolism and source for energy production, pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) account for a significant fraction of glucose oxidation in the mature central nervous system. Flux through the PDH pathway has been reported to be reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients as well as in animal models of AD. However, fluxes through the PPP and PC pathways have not been explored under conditions of AD. The present study investigates the fluxes of PC and PPP in a 20-month-old AbetaPP-PS1 mouse model of AD using 13C NMR spectroscopy together with an infusion of [2-13C]glucose. Mice were also administered [1,6-13C2]glucose or [1-13C]glucose for 10 or 90 min, respectively, to investigate PDH flux. AbetaPP-PS1 mice exhibit a significant reduction in the level of NAA and increase in level of myo-inositol. The flux through PDH was found to be significantly lower in the cerebral cortex (AbetaPP-PS1 0.39 +/- 0.08; control 0.77 +/- 0.08 mumol/g/min), hippocampus (AbetaPP-PS1 0.31 +/- 0.04; control 0.64 +/- 0.12 mumol/g/min), and striatum (AbetaPP-PS1 0.34 +/- 0.06; control 0.56 +/- 0.03 mumol/g/min) of AbetaPP-PS1 as compared with control mice. The fluxes through PC (AbetaPP-PS1 0.037 +/- 0.006, control 0.079 +/- 0.013 mumol/g/min) and PPP (AbetaPP-PS1 0.024 +/- 0.005; control 0.062 +/- 0.022 mumol/g/min) were found to be significantly reduced in AbetaPP-PS1 mice when compared with age-matched controls. The reduction in the fluxes of PC and PPP may lead to a weakened neural defense system of ammonia detoxification and antioxidant reserve in AbetaPP-PS1 mice, which may be responsible for the compromised neuronal viability and functions in AD.",
