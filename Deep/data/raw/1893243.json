     "AB": "While excitatory amino acids (EAAs) are known to evoke the release of taurine in the hippocampus, we have found that taurine is localized primarily in dendrites and only to a lesser extent in terminals in this region. To determine whether taurine is released as a neurotransmitter by non-toxic concentrations of EAAs, or exclusively as a neuroprotectant in response to excitotoxicity, we monitored the release of amino acids from hippocampal slices during simultaneous electrophysiological recording in the CA1 region to assess tissue viability. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) was the most potent of the EAA agonists tested for stimulating release of taurine. Exposure of slices to 120 microM NMDA increased the concentration of taurine in the perfusate to 1325% of its basal value. Kainate (KA) at a concentration of 128 microM increased taurine to 543% of baseline while quisqualate (Quis) at a concentration of 120 microM increase taurine to only 202% of its baseline value. Release of taurine in response to NMDA and KA peaked during the period when the concentration of the agonist was declining in the bath and did not return to its baseline value until 20 min after removal of the agonist. Increases in release of taurine were associated with concentrations of NMDA, KA, and Quis that caused an incomplete recovery of the CA1 field potential. These results suggest that taurine is primarily released by concentrations of glutamate receptor agonists that exhibit evidence of excitotoxicity in the CA1 region.",
