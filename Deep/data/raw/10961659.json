     "AB": "The effects varying the concentration of Ca2+ in perfused artificial cerebrospinal fluid ([Ca2+]csf) on basal acetylcholine (ACh) efflux from the hippocampus of freely moving rats, in the presence and absence of the cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitor physostigmine, were investigated using in vivo microdialysis and a highly specific radioimmunoassay for ACh. In the absence of physostigmine, basal ACh efflux was 3.4+/-0.7 pg/30 min (mean +/- SEM) at [Ca2+]csf = 1.26 mM. Stepwise increases in [Ca2+]csf elicited a gradual increase in ACh efflux that was significant at [Ca2+]csf = 5.04 mM. Inhibition of ChE by addition of 10 microM physostigmine to the perfusate increased the efflux of ACh to 103.2+/-21.1 pg/30 min ([Ca2+]csf = 1.26 mM), and the efflux was augmented still further by increasing [Ca2+]csf, a change that became significant at [Ca2+]csf = 3.78. These results illustrate the sensitivity of basal ACh efflux from the hippocampus to changes in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration, and suggest that a more accurate picture of hippocampal cholinergic activity is obtained by microdialysis using normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid, under physiological conditions, rather than in the presence of a ChE inhibitor.",
