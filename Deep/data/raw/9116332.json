     "AB": "Involvement of histamine receptors and hypothalamic and hippocampal histamine in stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by vasopressin (AVP) was investigated in conscious rats. The HPA activity was assessed by measuring serum corticosterone levels. One hour after administration AVP, (5 micrograms/kg) given i.p. significantly raised the serum corticosterone and hippocampal histamine levels, while the hypothalamic histamine content was not affected. Pretreatment with the inhibitor of the brain histamine synthesis alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (alpha-FMH) (50 mg/kg i.p.) considerably reduced both the AVP-elicited serum corticosterone response and the hypothalamic and hippocampal histamine levels. The histamine H1- and H2-receptor-antagonists mepyramine (0.01 mg/kg) and ranitidine (0.1 mg/kg), given ip 15 min prior to AVP, significantly impaired the AVP-induced rise in the serum corticosterone level and totally abolished the AVP-elicited increase in the histamine content in the hippocampus; moreover mepyramine significantly lowered this content in hypothalamus. Pretreatment with the histamine H3-receptor antagonist thioperamide (5 mg/kg i.p.) also significantly decreased the AVP-elicited corticosterone response, but did not alter the histamine content in either brain structure examined. These results indicate that central histamine H1-, H20 and H3-receptors significantly mediate the stimulatory action of AVP on the pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Hippocampal histamine may be involved in mediation of the AVP-induced effect via H1- and H2-receptors. The inhibitory effect of thioperamide seems to be located directly at non H3-intracellular sites of the pituitary-adrenocortical axis.",
