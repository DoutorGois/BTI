     "AB": "The effects of the scrapie agent on the levels of monoamines and their metabolites, and on choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity have been investigated in discrete brain areas in the rat. Two strains of scrapie (8745 from sheep brain and C506 M3 from mice brain) were inoculated. Scrapie-infected rats showed a reduction in the levels of serotonin (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum) and dopamine (striatum) and an elevation of 5-HIAA levels (cerebral cortex, striatum, thalamus). Noradrenaline levels were decreased only in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of rats infected with the scrapie strain C506 M3. CAT activity remained unchanged. These data suggest that the scrapie agent causes a derangement of noradrenergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic systems in the rat brain.",
