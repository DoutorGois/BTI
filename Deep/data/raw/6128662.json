     "AB": "Binding to several receptors was compared in brain regions of 3 and 21-23 month-old rats. In crude membrane preparations of aged rats the number of dopamine antagonist receptors in striatum was much reduced (-53%). beta-Noradrenergic receptors (cortex) and benzodiazepine receptors (hippocampus and cerebellum) were less but significantly reduced and serotonergic receptors, alpha 1 noradrenergic receptors (both in cortex) and dopamine agonist receptors (striatum) were unchanged. For each receptor binding the KD values were the same in young and old animals. GABA receptor binding (hippocampus and cerebellum) evaluated at only one 3H-GABA concentration (8 nM) was similar in both groups when expressed per protein content but significantly reduced in aged rats when expressed per tissue wet weight because of the partial purification of the synaptic membranes used for 3H-GABA binding. In our experimental conditions age-related changes of specific binding sites in the central nervous system were selective for some receptors studied and did not seem to be due to general non-specific modification of brain tissue composition.",
