     "AB": "The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Alzheimer's disease has on the functional integrity of several signal transduction proteins. The relative levels of the G-protein alpha subunits Gs alpha-L, Gs alpha-S, Gi alpha-2 and G(o) alpha were measured by western blotting and found to be unchanged in membranes prepared from Alzheimer-diseased frontal cortex or hippocampus compared to control brains. However the activity of the G-protein associated enzyme, high affinity GTPase, was found to be reduced in the frontal cortex (reduced by 25%) and by a similar magnitude in the hippocampus (reduced by 27%) of Alzheimer subjects. The same membrane preparations were also assayed for the activity of adenylate cyclase. Basal enzyme activity was not significantly altered in Alzheimer diseased hippocampus, but was markedly reduced (by 45%) in the frontal cortex. The ability of fluoride and aluminium ions to stimulate adenylate cyclase was not significantly changed in either brain region. This suggests that G-proteins, especially Gs, are still able to interact with this enzyme. These results indicate that although the presence of Alzheimer's disease does not significantly alter G-protein levels, changes have taken place in the overall activity of these proteins. However this alteration does not affect their ability to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity.",
