     "AB": "Rats were exposed to toluene (1500 ppm for 4 h per day) for 7 days. After toluene inhalation, only granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were slightly shrunken. In the cerebellum, several Purkinje cells were shrunken and lost, and the white matter was thinner than in controls. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-immunopositive filaments of neuronal processes were slightly disarrayed in the radial layer of the hippocampus, and were fragmented in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. It was considered that toluene induced neuronal changes both in the cerebellum and the hippocampus. To elucidate the effect of neurotrophic factors on those neuronal changes, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), transforming growth factor (TGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in rat brain were examined immunohistochemically. In control rats, TNF-alpha was not stained in either the hippocampus or the cerebellum, while TGF-beta1 was scarcely expressed in the cerebellum. GDNF was minimally expressed in the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. After toluene-treatment, TGF-beta1 was over-expressed in the endothelium of the capillary vessel walls in both regions. In the cerebellum, TNF-alpha was induced only in the granule cells, while GDNF expression was enhanced in the Purkinje cells. These data suggest that toluene induces astrocyte activation through TGF-beta1 upregulation, which then induces GDNF in the Purkinje cells and TNF-alpha in the granule cells of the cerebellum. The differences in the expression of the neurotrophic factors may account for neurobehavioral changes after toluene exposure.",
