     "AB": "Tyrosine protein kinases are likely to play an important role in the maintenance and/or development of the nervous system. In this study we have used the PCR cloning technique to isolate sequences derived from tyrosine kinase genes expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons obtained from 17.5-day-old rat embryos. Nucleotide sequence analysis of 209 independent clones revealed sequences derived from 25 tyrosine kinases, of which two corresponded to previously unreported genes. One of the PCR clones, ptk-2, belongs to the Jak family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. The second clone, ptk-3, was derived from a gene encoding an additional class of tyrosine kinase receptors whose extracellular domains contain regions of homology with coagulation factors V and VIII and complement component C1. Transcripts encoding the Ptk-3 receptor are present in a variety of embryonic and adult tissues with highest levels observed in brain. During development, ptk-3 transcripts are most abundant in the proliferative neuroepithelial cells of the ventricular zone, raising the possibility that this receptor may play an important role in the generation of the mammalian nervous system.",
