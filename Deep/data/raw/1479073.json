     "AB": "The course of the fiber pathways to pons from parasensory association areas in the rhesus monkey was investigated by injection of tritiated amino acids and the technique of autoradiography. Results confirm the projection to pons from parasensory association areas in the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes and extend these observations to include the posterior parahippocampal gyrus. The findings reveal that the white matter of the posterior limb of the internal capsule above the midpoint of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and at the medial aspect of the lateral geniculate nucleus, comprise common regions through which these corticopontine fibers lead to the basis pontis. The fibers demonstrate a certain degree of topographic organization in the posterior limb of the capsule above the lateral geniculate nucleus and also in the cerebral peduncle. Taken together with previous observations concerning the termination patterns of these associative corticopontine projections, it would appear that the corticopontine system consists of segregated and partially overlapping pathways, which are to some extent distinguishable anatomically at each stage of their trajectory from origin to destination. Furthermore, the existence of a common area through which all parasensory associative input to pons is transmitted suggests that a precisely located lesion in this part of the corticopontocerebellar circuit may disrupt the cerebellar access to higher order information derived from the parasensory associative regions.",
