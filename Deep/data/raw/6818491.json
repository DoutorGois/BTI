     "AB": "Efferent projections from the hippocampal formation to the cat's cortex were traced with the retrograde horseradish peroxidase technique. Different areas of the cortex of 31 cats were injected with small amounts of horseradish peroxidase. All subregions of the hippocampal formation were screened for labeled cells. It was found that, with the exception of the entorhinal injections, only subicular areas of the hippocampal formation contain labeled neurons. When HRP was injected into the entorhinal cortex, labeled cells are also found in the hippocampus proper. The most dense projection from the subicular cortex is directed to the medial part of the cortical hemisphere. Here, cingulate, retrosplenial and medial prefrontal fields receive a substantial number of subicular efferents. Furthermore, the entorhinal cortex is reached by a number of axons originating in the subicular area. Scarce projections from the subicular cortex terminate in the dorsal prefrontal, temporal, parietal and prepiriform cortex. It is suggested that the projection from the subicular cortex to the neocortical areas of the frontal pole (medial prefrontal cortex) is of special importance as it may constitute a link between the association areas of the neocortex and those regions of the limbic system thought to play a role in memory (subicular cortex, mamillary bodies, anterior thalamus, cingulate gyrus).",
