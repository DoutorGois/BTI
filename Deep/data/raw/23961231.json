     "AB": "Status epilepticus (SE), one of the most severe forms of epilepsy is regarded a medical emergency with considerable morbidity and mortality. Due to the limited efficacy and enormous side effects of currently available drugs, a search for new safe and effective therapeutic agents is critical using experimentally induced SE in animals. The lithium-pilocarpine (Li-Pc) model of SE is most suitable and frequently used for pathophysiological and management strategies of SE. Recent studies have shown significant potential of pharmacological, prophylactic or therapeutic use of curcumin (Cur) in many beneficial activities in the body including neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases and antioxidant properties. The present study describes anticonvulsive effects of Cur in Li-Pc induced SE in young rats. The effect of Cur was examined on the intensity and frequency of SE, cognitive behavior in water maze as well as on oxidative stress related enzymes in the brain. Besides its anticonvulsant effect, Cur significantly ameliorates SE-induced cognitive dysfunction and oxidative damages in the hippocampus and striatum areas of the brain. Possible therapeutic application of Cur as an anticonvulsant and as an antioxidant for the treatment of SE has a great potential and warrants further studies.",
