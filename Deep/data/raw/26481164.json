     "AB": "The effect of chronic administration of sodium salicylate (NaSal) on the excitability and synaptic plasticity of the rodent hippocampus was investigated. Repeated systemic treatment with NaSal reliably induced tolerance to the anti-nociceptive effect of NaSal (one i.p. injection per day for 6 consecutive days). Following chronic NaSal or vehicle treatment, a series of electrophysiological experiments on acute hippocampal slices (focusing on the CA1 circuitry) were tested whether tolerance to NaSal would augment pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) and /or epileptic activity, and whether the augmentation was the same after priming activity with a natural stimulus pattern prior to PTZ. We noted an altered synaptic input-to-spike transformation, such that neuronal firing increased after a given synaptic drive. Population spike-LTP (PS-LTP) was increased in the NaSal-tolerant animals, but only when it was induced via a combination of electrical stimulation (theta pattern primed-burst stimulation) and the transient application of PTZ. Identifying and understanding these changes in neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity following chronic salicylate treatment could prove useful in the clinical diagnosis or treatment of chronic aspirin-induced, or even idiopathic, seizure activity.",
