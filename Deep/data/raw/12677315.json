     "AB": "One reason the electrophysiological correlates of hippocampal neurons are of interest is the possibility that they reflect their representational properties, presumably spatial/relational ones. Stable spatial representations, based on activity of ensembles of hippocampal place cells, initially develop through a series of short-episodic spatial tunings. Hence these short-episodic spatial tunings are important for understanding the establishment of stable place fields. Studies of age-related changes in place cell activities traditionally focus on place fields. In the present study, we characterized the short-episodic spatial tunings (1-min bins) of hippocampal CA1 place cells of freely moving mice in a familiar cylinder arena, and compared these functions in young and old mice. Spatial tuning was expressed by spatial selectivity, which we found fluctuated across a 16-min recording session in both young and old mice. High spatial selectivity, which is mainly due to the low firing of a place cell out of the place field in young mice, was significantly higher in old mice. The high firing rate out of the place field was the main factor contributing to significantly lower spatial selectivity in old mice. In addition, young mice showed a broad peak in the spatial selectivity between 4 and 10 min. In contrast old mice showed no peak in the spatial selectivity during this time period. The stability of place fields after a 24-h interval was also lower in old mice than in young mice. The low spatial tuning and unstable place fields suggest that a hippocampal-based spatial representation was impaired in the old mice. Furthermore, we speculate that the age-related impairment in hippocampal inhibition system may be involved in the impaired spatial representation of hippocampal CA1 place cells in old mice.",
