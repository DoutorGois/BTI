     "AB": "We report here on the type II glucocorticoid receptor concentration in the hippocampal cytosol of two inbred strains of mice, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, aged 2 and 24 months. Glucocorticoid receptors are usually considered as mediating cytotoxic effects of glucocorticoids on hippocampal neurons and modulating hippocampus-dependent behaviors. Either a decrease in glucocorticoid receptors with aging or no effect of aging have been reported previously. In order to test whether strain differences may explain these conflicting results, we have measured, using [3H]RU 28362, the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor concentrations in two inbred strains of mice showing differential modifications of some hippocampus-dependent behaviors with aging. Our results show that there is neither a strain nor an age effect.",
