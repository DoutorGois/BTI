     "AB": "A study was made of the influence of microinjections of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and glutamic acid into the dorsal hippocampus on the food-procuring conditioned reaction of rats. All the examined drugs lengthen the latency of the conditioned alimentary reaction. However, the number of pushes of the door leading to the feeding through and the magnitude of the reflex are increased by catecholamines and glutamic acid, but reduced by serotonin. The dopamine effects are achieved through archicortex neurones receptors, sensitive to haloperidol, the noradrenaline effects, through alpha-adrenoreactive, and of serotonin, through M-serotoninsensitive structures of the hippocampal neuronal systems. The modulating influence of glutamic acid on the food-procuring conditioned reaction is not connected with the active on dopamine-, adreno or serotonin neuronal receptors of the rat dorsal hippocampus.",
