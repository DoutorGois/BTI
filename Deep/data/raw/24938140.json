     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used to assess brain integrity and maturation with age. OBJECTIVE: To compare regional cerebral magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite ratios in extremely low birth weight and healthy term control infants measured at term-equivalent age and to evaluate association between magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolites and cognitive and language development at 18-22 months' corrected age. METHODS: Single-voxel point-resolved spectroscopy sequence was performed in a prospective cohort of 43 infants. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite ratios of N-acetylaspartate to choline-containing compounds and N-acetylaspartate to myo-inositiol in the hippocampus, cortex, and subventricular zone were associated with Bayley mental, cognitive, and language scores at 18-22 months' corrected age. RESULTS: The mean (+/-S.D.) gestation of the 31 extremely low birth weight population was 25 (+/-1.1) weeks and mean (+/-S.D.) birth weight was 749 (+/-133.9) g. Compared with healthy term control infants, extremely low birth weight infants exhibited consistently lower N-acetylaspartate-to-choline-containing compounds ratios in our three regions of interest, with differences reaching statistical significance for the subventricular zone and cortex regions. In multiple linear regression analyses, N-acetylaspartate-to-choline-containing compounds ratio in the subventricular zone, N-acetylaspartate-to-choline-containing compounds ratio in the cortex, and N-acetylaspartate-to-myo-inositiol ratio in the subventricular zone were significantly associated with Bayley mental scores at 18-22 months' corrected age. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite abnormalities at term-equivalent age appear to be significantly associated with cognitive and language development in extremely low birth weight infants.",
