     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of propofol on the low-voltage-activated calcium currents [ICa(LVA)] in rat hippocampal neurons. METHODS: Hippocampal neurons were prepared from Wistar rats and cultured. ICa(LVA) was recorded using whole cell patch clamp technique. Different concentrations of propofol were added to the culture. The effect of propofol on ICa(LVA) was evaluated. RESULTS: ICa(LVA) was inhibited by propofol in a concentration-dependent manner. Propofol 3 mumol /L had no effect on ICa(LVA). Propofol 10, 30, 100 and 300 mumol/L reduced peak ICa(LVA) by (12.6 +/- 4.1)%, (29.2 +/- 5.7)%, (36.6 +/- 5.3)%, (31.6 +/- 2.6)% respectively with a mean IC50 of 16.8 mumol/L and Hill coefficient of 0.15. The V1/2 of activation curve was shifted from (-10 +/- 1 )mV to (-11 +/- 2 )mV. K was 12 +/- 1 and 8 +/- 1. The V1/2 of inactivation curve was shifted from (-25 +/- 1) mV to (-25 +/- 5) mV. K was 15 +/- 1 and 16 +/- 3. CONCLUSION: Propofol produces significant inhibition of ICa (LVA) calcium currents in the central neurons which may partly explain the anesthefic action of propofol on the central nervous system.",
