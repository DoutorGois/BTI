     "AB": "To characterize the role of nitric oxide (NO) in stroke, NO was measured using an in vivo microdialysis technique and electron spin resonance spectrometry in malignant stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (M-SHRSP), stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The brain dialysate NO level was higher in SHRSP than in WKY. NO was not detected in M-SHRSP hippocampus microdialysate after stroke except after the administration of N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN). In addition, very little NO was generated in M-SHRSP brain tissue with hemorrhage. These data demonstrate an association between NO and stroke in M-SHRSP. Further, PBN administration results in maintenance of NO levels after stroke in M-SHRSP.",
