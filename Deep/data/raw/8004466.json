     "AB": "Antibodies to the lysosomal hydrolases, cathepsins B and D and beta-hexosaminidase A, revealed alterations of the endosomal-lysosomal system in neurons of the Alzheimer disease brain, which preceded evident degenerative changes and became marked as atrophy, neurofibrillary pathology, or chromatolysis developed. At the earliest stages of cell atrophy, hydrolase-positive lysosomes accumulated at the basal pole and then massively throughout the perikarya and proximal and proximal dendrites of affected pyramidal neurons in Alzheimer prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, far exceeding the changes of normal aging. Secondary lysosomes as well as tertiary residual bodies (lysosomes/lipofuscin) increased implying stimulated, autophagocytosis and lysosomal system activation. Less affected brain regions, such as the thalamus, displayed similar though less extensive alterations. Certain thalamic neurons exhibited a distinctive lysosome-related abnormality characterized by the presence of cell surface blebs of varying size and number filled with intense hydrolase immunoreactivity. At more advanced stages of degeneration in still intact neurons, hydrolase-positive lipofuscin, particularly in the form of abnormally large aggregates, nearly filled the cytoplasm. Similar lipofuscin aggregates were observed in abundance in the extracellular space following cell lysis and were usually associated with deposits of the beta-amyloid protein. Degenerating neurons and their processes were the major source of these aggregates within senile plaques which contained high concentrations of acid hydrolases. We have shown in previous studies that these lysosomal hydrolases in plaques are enzymatically-active. The persistence of lysosomal structures in the brain parenchyma after neurons have degenerated is a striking and potentially diagnostic feature of Alzheimer disease which has not been observed, to our knowledge, in other degenerative diseases. The lysosomal response in degenerating Alzheimer neurons represents a probable link between an early activation of the lysosomal system in at-risk, normal-appearing neurons and the end-stage contribution of lysosomes to senile plaque formation and emphasizes a slowly progressive disturbance of the lysosomal system throughout the development of Alzheimer disease.",
