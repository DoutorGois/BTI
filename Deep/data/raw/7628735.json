     "AB": "Several indices of free radical generation were determined in limbic structures after kainate (KA)-induced seizure activity in adult and postnatal day (PND) 12 and 17 rats. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities were measured in piriform cortex and hippocampal subfields at 8, 16, 48 h, and 5 days after KA injection in adults and pups, and also at 3 weeks postinjection in adults. KA-induced seizure activity had no significant effect on enzyme activities in PND 12 and 17 rats. In adults, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were significantly increased at 5 days after KA administration, and returned to preinjection levels by 3 weeks. Glutathione peroxidase activity was also increased significantly at 5 days postinjection, but remained elevated at 3 weeks. Lipid peroxidation, as indicated by malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, exhibited an early significant increase at 8 and 16 h, followed at 48 h and 5 days by a significant decrease. At 3 weeks postinjection, MDA levels were still significantly decreased in CA3 and dentate gyrus. KA administration in PND 12 and 17 rats had no significant effect on MDA content. KA-induced seizure activity in adults also resulted in a large and sustained increase in protein oxidation in piriform cortex and hippocampus. The early increase in MDA and protein oxidation in adult rats strongly suggests the involvement of oxygen free radicals in the initial phases of KA-induced pathology, whereas the changes in scavenging enzyme activities and MDA content at 5 days and 3 weeks post KA injection possibly reflect glial proliferation subsequent to neuronal death.",
