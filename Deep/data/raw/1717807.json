     "AB": "This study examined the effect of adrenalectomy (ADX) and corticosterone (CORT) replacement on the levels of two astrocyte mRNAs during responses to unilateral entorhinal cortex lesions (ECL) to identify molecular mechanisms involved in glucocorticoid modulation of astrocyte activation following deafferentation. Both glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and sulfated glycoprotein-2 (SGP-2) mRNA were increased in the ipsilateral hippocampus 4 days following unilateral ECL. In unlesioned ADX rats CORT replacement decreased both messages in the hippocampus. CORT replacement suppressed the ECL-induced increase of GFAP mRNA in the contralateral, but not ipsilateral hippocampus of ADX rats. In contrast, CORT decreased SGP-2 mRNA both ipsi- and contralaterally. It is clear that several regulatory mechanisms are responsible for maintaining a physiological balance of astrocyte activity in the adult brain, and that changes in circuit integrity and the endocrine milieu can alter this balance.",
