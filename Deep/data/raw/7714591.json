     "AB": "1. The mechanisms of Zn2+ modulation of transient outward current (TOC) were studied in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, using the voltage-clamp technique. In the presence of micromolar concentrations of external Zn2+, the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation was shifted to more positive membrane potentials. The gating of TOC was unaltered by internal application of Zn2+. The effect of Zn2+ were not mimicked by external Ca2+, except at very high concentrations (> 10 mM). 2. The modulatory effects of external Zn2+ on TOC gating were not reproduced, antagonized, nor enhanced by lowering external ionic strength, indicating that modulation by Zn2+ does not occur via screening of bulk surface negative charge. 3. A range of other divalent and trivalent metal ions also was studied, and several were found to modulate the transient outward current when added to the extracellular medium. In particular, Pb2+, La3+, and Gd3+ were potent modulators, showing activity in the low micromolar range. Other metal ions were weaker modulators (e.g., Cd2+) or were without activity at the concentrations tested (Fe3+, Cu2+, Ni2+). 4. The same range of ions also was tested on the delayed rectifier K+ current in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. None of the ions studied had significant effects on delayed rectifier gating, although high (> or = 100 microM) concentrations of Pb2+ and La3+ reduced maximal current amplitude, suggesting the possibility of channel block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
