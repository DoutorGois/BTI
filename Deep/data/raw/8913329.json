     "AB": "To evaluate the effect of FK506 on delayed neuronal death in gerbils after forebrain ischemia, 84 adult Mongolian gerbils were used in this study. Transient forebrain ischemia was induced by clipping common carotid arteries bilaterally for 5 minutes. One hour after reperfusion we intraperitoneally injected FK506 (1.0 mg/kg), cyclosporin A (CsA) (10.0 mg/kg) or the vehicle solution into each gerbil. In one group, each agent was additionally administered daily 3 more times at 24, 48 and 72 hours after ischemia. The gerbils were killed 4 days or 10 days after transient ischemia, and damage to their hippocampal pyramidal cells was histologically assessed. Additionally, the body temperature was measured following administration of each drug to investigate drug-induced hypothermia. Post-ischemic repeated treatment with FK506 significantly (p < 0.01) reduced degeneration of hippocampal neurons. However, partial treatment did not modify neuronal degeneration. CsA did not show a neuroprotective effect in this study. Drug-induced mild hypothermia (35-37 C) was observed following administration of FK506 or CsA. There was no significant difference in the time course of the body temperature between the FK506 and CsA group. We demonstrated that the repeated FK506 treatment, but not the CsA treatment, reduced ischemia-induced degeneration of hippocampal neurons in gerbils. Although FK506-induced hypothermia might have modified neuronal degeneration, a comparison with CsA indicated that the neuroprotective effect of FK506 was not solely due to hypothermia per se.",
