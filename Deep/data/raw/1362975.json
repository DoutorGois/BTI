     "AB": "The new technique has been used to realize paired short-term application of glutamate to whole dialyzed neuron. Desensitization of receptors via first application of glutamate resulted in incomplete recovery of the current evoked by the second application if interval between both applications was less than 160 ms. The recovery time constant of the current was found to be 44 ms at single exponential approximation. It is close to the mean desensitization time constant of the current evoked by single prolonged application of glutamate. Rhythmic application of glutamate resulted in a rapid fall of the mean current amplitude at frequencies over 10 Hz. Data obtained by the authors confirm the known concept of desensitization of non-NMDA receptors as a relatively slow conformation of the receptor-channel complex.",
