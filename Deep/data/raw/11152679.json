     "AB": "Recent data suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be effective in epilepsy, cardiovascular disorders, arthritis, and as mood stabilizers for bipolar disorder; however, the mechanism of action of these compounds is unknown. Based on earlier studies implicating omega-3 fatty acids as inhibitors of protein kinase C activity in intact cells, we hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acids may act through direct inhibition of second messenger-regulated kinases and sought to determine whether the omega-3 double bond might uniquely confer pharmacologic efficacy and potency for fatty acids of this type. In our studies we observed that omega-3 fatty acids inhibited the in vitro activities of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Our results with a series of long-chain fatty acid structural homologs suggest an important role for the omega-3 double bond in conferring inhibitory efficacy. To assess whether omega-3 fatty acids were capable of inhibiting protein kinases in living neurons, we evaluated their effect on signal transduction pathways in the hippocampus. We found that omega-3 fatty acids could prevent serotonin receptor-induced MAPK activation in hippocampal slice preparations. In addition, we evaluated the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on hippocampal long-term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity known to be dependent on protein kinase activation. We observed that omega-3 fatty acids blocked long-term potentiation induction without inhibiting basal synaptic transmission. Overall, our results from both in vitro and live cell preparations suggest that inhibition of second messenger-regulated protein kinases is one locus of action of omega-3 fatty acids.",
