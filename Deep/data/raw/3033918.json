The ACTH secretion in temporal lobe epilepsy is independent of anticonvulsant drug effect and seizure frequency. Electrical stimulation of medial temporal lobe structures in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy affected ACTH secretion in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that ACTH secretion is regulated by tonic inhibition. A defect in the excitatory and/or inhibitory components of this regulatory process appears to exist in temporal lobe epilepsy.",
