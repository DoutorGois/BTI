     "AB": "A protective effect of bifemelane hydrochloride (BF) on hippocampal CA1 neuronal death in gerbils was investigated following transient forebrain ischemia in relation to the induction of 70-kd heat shock protein (HSP70) and its mRNA. Histological examination showed that the neuronal density of the hippocampal CA1 sector treated with 10 and 30 mg/kg of BF (i.p.) was higher than that of the vehicle (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively) at 7 days after ischemia. Immunohistochemistry against HSP70 protein and in situ hybridization for the mRNA revealed that the inductions of immunoreactive HSP70 and the mRNA were remarkably reduced and limited in the brain hippocampi treated with BF (30 mg/kg) as compared with vehicle-treated animals. These data indicate that BF possesses a protective effect against ischemic injury to the vulnerable CA1 neurons. The possible mechanisms of the protection are discussed.",
