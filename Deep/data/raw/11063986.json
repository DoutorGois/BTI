     "AB": "It has recently been shown that 5-HT(1A) receptor stimulation reduced the infarct volume after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats. Since there is increasing evidence that apoptosis is involved in neurodegenerative diseases and stroke, we investigated whether the 5-HT(1A) agonist Bay x 3702 could protect neurons against apoptotic damage in a rat model of transient forebrain cerebral ischemia. Bay x 3702 (4 microg/kg i.v.) caused a 10% reduction of neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA1 subfield. Higher doses of Bay x 3702 (40 and 12 microg/kg i.v.) did not cause any neuroprotective effect, most likely because of the strong reduction of mean arterial blood pressure during the period of Bay x 3702 infusion. Bay x 3702 (4 microg/kg i.v.) diminished DNA laddering in the hippocampus and striatum 4 days after 10 min forebrain ischemia. These results were confirmed by TUNEL-staining. The anti-apoptotic effect was abolished by additional treatment with the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY 100635 (1 mg/kg). Taken together, the results suggest that Bay x 3702 can rescue hippocampal as well as striatal neurons from apoptotic cell death in vivo via stimulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors.",
