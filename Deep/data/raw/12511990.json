     "AB": "We studied properties of cloned BACE mRNA (beta-site of the enzyme cleaving amyloid precursor protein) and evaluated the possibility of using this clone for identification and/or prediction of neurodegenerative disorders associated with cholinergic deficiency. Wistar rats subjected to immunohistochemical destruction of the basal forebrain cholinergic system were used as the experimental model. Nonradioactive in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical visualization of the astroglia revealed strong hybridization signal of BACE mRNA in neurons of the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. Astrocytes remained unstained. Immunohistochemical destruction of the basal forebrain produced no significant changes in the distribution of BACE mRNA.",
