     "AB": "In the present study the influence of the dopaminergic system(s) of the amygdala on the anxiolytic-like effect of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist, arachydonilcyclopropylamide (ACPA), in male Wistar rats was investigated. An elevated plus-maze test of anxiety was used to assess anxiety-like behaviors. The results showed that bilateral intra-amygdala injections of ACPA (0.125, 1.25 and 5 ng/rat) and the mixed dopamine D1/D2 receptor agonist, apomorphine, at different doses (0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 microg/rat) increased percentage open arm time (%OAT) and percentage open arm entries (%OAE), indicating an anxiolytic-like effect for both of the drugs. In contrast, intra-amygdala administration of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (0.5 and 1 microg/rat) and the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride (2 and 3 microg/rat) decreased %OAT and %OAE, suggesting an anxiogenic-like effect for both of the drugs. Interestingly, pretreatment with a sub-effective dose of apomorphine (0.0005 microg/rat) increased, while SCH23390 (0.25 microg/rat) and sulpiride (1.5 microg/rat) decreased the anxiolytic-like effect of ACPA. It can be concluded that the dopaminergic system of the amygdala may be involved, at least partly, in the anxiolytic-like effects induced by ACPA in the rat amygdala.",
