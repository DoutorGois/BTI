     "AB": "The notion that changes in synaptic efficacy underlie learning and memory processes is now widely accepted, although definitive proof of the synaptic plasticity and memory hypothesis is still lacking. This article reviews recent evidence relevant to the hypothesis, with particular emphasis on studies of experience-dependent plasticity in the neocortex and hippocampus. In our view, there is now compelling evidence that changes in synaptic strength occur as a consequence of certain forms of learning. A major challenge will be to determine whether such changes constitute the memory trace itself or play a less specific supporting role in the information processing that accompanies memory formation.",
