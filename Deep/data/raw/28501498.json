     "AB": "The central olfactory system mediates a variety of odor-guided behaviors crucial for maintenance of animal life. The olfactory neural circuit must be highly plastic to ensure that it responds appropriately to changing odor circumstances. Recent studies have revealed that the processing of odor information changes drastically during waking and sleep and that neural activity during sleep plays pivotal roles in the structural reorganization and functional plasticity of the olfactory system. While olfactory information from the external world is efficiently transferred to the olfactory cortex (OC) via the olfactory bulb (OB) during waking, this information flow is attenuated during slow-wave sleep: during slow-wave sleep, the OC neurons exhibit synchronous discharges without odor input under the entrainment of sharp waves in the local field potential recording. Top-down transfer of sharp-wave activity to the OB during slow-wave sleep promotes structural reorganization of the OB neural circuit. Further, the activity of the OC during sleep is affected by the olfactory experience during prior waking period, and perturbation of the sleep activity disrupts proper olfactory memory. Thus, as is seen also in the hippocampus and neocortex, the neural activities of the olfactory system during sleep likely play essential roles in circuit reorganization and memory consolidation.",
