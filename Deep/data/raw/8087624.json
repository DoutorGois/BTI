     "AB": "A remarkable feature of the early development of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is the precise and rapid generation of large numbers of many different neuronal types [1]. We have identified the major neuronal precursor cell and shown that this cell can be immortalized by oncogenes. The immortal precursor cell can be grown in culture and can differentiate when transplanted into the developing brain. The implanted neurons are integrated into the synaptic circuitry of the host brain. These results suggest that implanting cultured precursor cells will provide a powerful strategy to uncover the signals that control the differentiation of this multipotential cell into the many cell types of the adult brain.",
