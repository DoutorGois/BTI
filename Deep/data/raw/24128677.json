     "AB": "Despite the strong association between epilepsy and psychiatric comorbidities, data on clinicopathologic correlations are scant. We previously reported differential mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients with psychosis (MTLE + P) and major depression (MTLE + D). Because neurotrophins (NTs) can promote MFS, here, we investigated MFS, neuronal density and immunoreactivity for the NT nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin 3 (NT3) in hippocampi of 14 MTLE patients without a psychiatric history, 13 MTLE + D, 13 MTLE + P, and 10 control necropsies. Mossy fiber sprouting correlated with granular layer NGF immunoreactivity and seizure frequency. Patients with secondarily generalized seizures exhibited less NGF immunoreactivity versus patients with complex partial seizures. There was greater NT immunoreactivity in MTLE versus control groups but lesser NT immunoreactivity in MTLE + P versus MTLE patients; these findings correlated with neuropsychologic scores. Patients with MTLE + D taking fluoxetine showed greater BDNF immunoreactivity than those not taking fluoxetine; MTLE + P patients taking haloperidol had decreased neuronal density and immunoreactivity for NGF and BDNF in specific subfields versus those not taking haloperidol. There were no differences in NT3 immunoreactivity among the groups. These findings support a close association between MFS and NT expression in the hippocampi of MTLE patients and suggest that distinct structural and neurochemical milieu may contribute to the genesis or maintenance of psychiatric comorbidities in MTLE.",
