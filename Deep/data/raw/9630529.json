     "AB": "In mouse hippocampal slices, long-term potentiation (LTP) at Schaffer collateral fiber synapses onto CA1 pyramidal cells could be induced by brief trains of 5-Hz synaptic stimulation (30 s) or by longer trains of 5-Hz stimulation (3 min) delivered during beta-adrenergic receptor activation. In contrast, 5-Hz stimulation, either alone or in the presence of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol, failed to induce LTP at associational-commissural (assoc-com) fiber synapses onto CA3 pyramidal cells. Our results suggest that although CA3 pyramidal cells give rise to both the Schaffer collateral fiber synapses in CA1 and the assoc-com fiber synapses in CA3, the induction of LTP at these synapses may be regulated by different activity- and modulatory neurotransmitter-dependent processes.",
