     "AB": "PURPOSE: Cortical dysplasia (CD) is a frequent cause of medically intractable focal epilepsy. The mechanisms of CD-induced epileptogenicity remain unknown. The difficulty in obtaining and testing human tissue warrants the identification and characterization of animal model(s) of CD that share most of the clinical, electroencephalographic (EEG), and histopathologic characteristics of human CD. In this study, we report on the in vivo EEG characterization of the radiation-induced model of CD. METHODS: Timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were irradiated on E17 using a single dose of 145 cGy or left untreated. Their litters were identified and implanted with bifrontal epidural and hippocampal depth electrodes for prolonged continuous EEG recordings. After prolonged EEG monitoring, animals were killed and their brains sectioned and stained for histologic studies. RESULTS: In utero-irradiated rats showed frequent spontaneous interictal epileptiform spikes and spontaneous seizures arising independently from the hippocampal or the frontal neocortical structures. No epileptiform or seizure activities were recorded from age-matched control rats. Histologic studies showed the presence of multiple cortical areas of neuronal clustering and disorganization. Moreover, pyramidal cell dispersion was seen in the CA1>CA3 areas of the hippocampal formations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results further characterize the in vivo EEG characteristics of the in utero radiation model of CD using long-term EEG monitoring. This model may be used to study the molecular and cellular changes in epileptogenic CD and to test the efficacy of newer antiepileptic medications.",
