To examine the distribution of viral antigens within this infected central nervous system (CNS) tissue, we used the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method to detect monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies bound to JHM structural proteins; in addition we used the Western blot technique to detect viral proteins. Our study demonstrated the following characteristics: Infected neuronal and glial cells produced viral nucleocapsid and E2 glycoprotein. The synthesis of these viral structural proteins was not restricted to cells in any particular part of the central nervous system. While JHM E2 proteins could be detected in individual cells of JHM-infected CNS tissue, the relative level of detectable E2 protein in the total CNS tissue of infected rats was reduced by more than 13-fold compared with JHM-infected tissue culture cells. Hippocampus neuronal cells provided a sensitive indication of JHM infection. These cells invariably contained antigens in both acutely and chronically infected animals. The distribution of cells containing viral antigens differed markedly for JHM-induced acute encephalitis and chronic demyelinating disease. Acutely infected brains had large lesions containing low levels of viral antigen scattered throughout the brain. One percent to ten percent of histologically normal cells in many parts of the brain contained viral antigens; in addition, more neuronal cells than glial cells were observed to be antigen-positive. The hippocampus appeared normal with hematoxylin-eosin staining; however, a scattered infection of neuronal cells was apparent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
