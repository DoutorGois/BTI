     "AB": "AIM: To investigate the effect of nicotine on beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1-AR) in the hippocampal slice of rat. METHODS: Hippocampal slices (400 microm thick) were incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) previously saturated with 95 % O2 and 5 % CO2 at 28 degree for 120 min, and then incubated with nicotine 10 micromol/L for 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. mRNA of the beta1-adrenergic receptor was examined with semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the protein level was measured by Western blot and RIA. RESULTS: The mRNA gene expression and the protein level of beta1-adrenergic receptor in hippocampal slices were increased after nicotine treatment. The peak of protein occurred later but higher than that of mRNA level. CONCLUSION: Both expression of beta1- adrenergic receptor gene transcription and post-transcriptional protein level in rat hippocampus were altered by nicotine.",
