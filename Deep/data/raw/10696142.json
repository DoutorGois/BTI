     "AB": "Patch-clamp recordings were obtained in brain slices from 283 rat astrocytes. The expression of voltage-activated whole-cell currents was compared in four different CNS regions (hippocampus, cerebral cortex, spinal cord, and cerebellum). Our data show that CNS astrocytes do not show significant regional differences in their ion channel complement. With the exception of cerebellar Bergmann glial cells, essentially all astrocytes express a combination of delayed rectifying outward K(+) currents, transient A-type K(+) currents, and small Na(+) currents. Developmentally, an increasing percentage of astrocytes and Bergmann glial cells express inwardly rectifying K(+) currents. We did not observe cells that were passive, i.e., lacking voltage-activated currents. A few cells that appeared \"passive\" in initial recordings showed voltage-activated K(+) currents after off-line leak subtraction. The heterogeneity observed in the ion channel complement was found to be identical when cell-to-cell variations observed within a given CNS region and between various CNS regions were compared, suggesting a common and fairly stereotypical complement of ion channels in CNS astrocytes. Ion channel expression in Bergmann glial cells differed from that of all other CNS regions studied. These cells typically showed very low input resistances attributable to a significant time- and voltage-independent resting K(+) conductance. However, as with electrophysiologically \"passive\"-appearing astrocytes, Bergmann glial cells showed expression of delayed rectifying K(+) currents after off-line leak subtraction. Inwardly rectifying K(+) currents were observed in Bergmann glial cells after postnatal day 17. Collectively, our data suggest that all astrocytes contain voltage-gated ion channels that display a common pattern of expression during development.",
