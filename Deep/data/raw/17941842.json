     "AB": "PURPOSE: New treatments are needed for status epilepticus (SE) that is refractory to drugs modulating GABA(A) receptors, and NMDA receptor antagonists are candidate drugs. METHODS: Clinically available NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine was tested for effectiveness in terminating prolonged SE induced by a combination of lithium and pilocarpine. Animals were treated 10 min after first grade 5 behavioral seizure (Racine scoring scale) by intraperitoneal administration of ketamine, diazepam, or saline. Seizure termination was determined by electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from the hippocampus and the cortex. RESULTS: Animals treated with normal saline or either 20 mg/kg diazepam, or 50 mg/kg ketamine continued in SE for the next 300 min. However, combined treatment with diazepam and ketamine rapidly terminated prolonged cholinergic stimulation-induced SE. Detailed study of dose response relationships demonstrated that diazepam enhanced efficacy and potency of ketamine in terminating SE. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated synergistic action of diazepam and ketamine in terminating SE. It suggests that a ketamine-diazepam combination might be a clinically useful therapeutic option for the treatment of refractory SE.",
