     "AB": "Somatostatin has a modulatory role in regulating the membrane conductance in hippocampal neurons. To examine the signal transducing molecules involved in this process, we isolated the cDNA encoding the dominant rat hippocampal somatostatin receptor, SSTR4. Distribution of SSTR4 in the adult central nervous system was restricted to the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and thalamus, as determined by Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization. In SSTR4-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells, SSTR4 was functionally coupled not only to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, but also to activation of both arachidonate release and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade, with similar ED50 values. All of these pathways, including both MAP kinase kinase and MAP kinase activation, were completely blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. On the other hand, neither inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate synthesis nor intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was induced upon SSTR4 stimulation. These data indicate that the hippocampal functions of somatostatin might be mediated through diverse but selective second messenger systems activated via SSTR4 and reveal an unsuspected coupling of a neuronal SSTR subtype to a mitogenic signaling pathway. SSTR4, in addition, provides a useful system to study the Ca(2+)-independent, Gi-dependent (pertussis toxin-sensitive) pathway of MAP kinase activation.",
