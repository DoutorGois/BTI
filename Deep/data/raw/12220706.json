     "AB": "In previous work we showed that phosphorylation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte marker, is increased by glutamate in hippocampal slices from immature rats via a type II metabotropic receptor. In the present work we show that glutamate also stimulates GFAP phosphorylation in microslices prepared from immature cerebellar cortex, but by a different receptor mechanism from that observed in the hippocampus. Thus, in cerebellar microslices, NMDA consistently stimulated GFAP phosphorylation, whereas no effect of metabotropic or non-NMDA ionotropic agonists was observed. Glutamate and NMDA also stimulated GFAP phosphorylation in mixed neuronal/glial cell cultures from the cerebellum, although no effect of these agonists was observed in primary cultures of cerebellar astrocytes. In both models, the effects of glutamate and NMDA were dependent on external Ca(2+), were reversed by the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 and were not blocked by tetrodotoxin. In the slice study the effect of NMDA was confined to a period starting with the first detectable expression of GFAP at 10 days and finishing at 16 days postnatal, as previously observed with metabotropic agonists in hippocampal slices. This period in the rat corresponds to the start of synaptogenesis when astrocyte hypertrophy is occurring. The results are discussed in the light of information in the literature on the occurrence of functional NMDA receptor subunits in glia.",
