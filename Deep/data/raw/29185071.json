     "AB": "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is the process by which new functional neurons are added to the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Animal studies have shown that the degree of adult hippocampal neurogenesis is regulated by local environmental cues as well as neural network activities. Furthermore, accumulating evidence has suggested that adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays prominent roles in hippocampus-dependent brain functions. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms underlying the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis at various developmental stages and propose how adult-born neurons contribute to structural and functional hippocampal plasticity.",
