     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Animal models provide opportunity to study neurobiological aspects of human alcoholism. Changes in gene expression have been implicated in mediating brain functions, including reward system and addiction. The current study aimed to identify genes that may underlie differential ethanol preference in Warsaw High Preferring (WHP) and Warsaw Low Preferring (WLP) rats. METHODS: Microarray analysis comparing gene expression in nucleus accumbens (NAc), hippocampus (HP) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was performed in male WHP and WLP rats bred for differences in ethanol preference. RESULTS: Differential and stable between biological repeats expression of 345, 254 and 129 transcripts in NAc, HP and mPFC was detected. Identified genes and processes included known mediators of ethanol response (Mx2, Fam111a, Itpr1, Gabra4, Agtr1a, LTP/LTD, renin-angiotensin signaling pathway), toxicity (Sult1c2a, Ces1, inflammatory response), as well as genes involved in regulation of important addiction-related brain systems such as dopamine, tachykinin or acetylcholine (Gng7, Tac4, Slc5a7). CONCLUSIONS: The identified candidate genes may underlie differential ethanol preference in an animal model of alcoholism. COMMENT: Names of genes are written in italics, while names of proteins are written in standard font. Names of human genes/proteins are written in all capital letters. Names of rodent genes/proteins are written in capital letter followed by small letters.",
