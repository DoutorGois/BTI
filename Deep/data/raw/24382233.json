     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the temporal and spatial distribution of growth-associated protein 43(GAP-43)and phosphorylated growth-associated protein 43(p-GAP-43)in the dentate gyrus of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy(MTLE)mouse model. METHODS: MTLE mouse model was established by using the kainic acid(KA)induction. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were applied to detect the expressions of GAP-43 and p-GAP-43 in different stages of epileptogenesis. RESULTS: Both in the epileptic and control mice, high GAP-43 expression level was detected in the dentate gyrus, hilus, and inner molecular layer of hippocampus. Decreased p-GAP-43 expression was detected 5 days, 2 weeks, and 5 weeks after KA-induced seizures. CONCLUSION: The decreased p-GAP-43 expression in the duration of seizure may play an important role in the synaptic reorganization of the sclerotic hippocampus.",
