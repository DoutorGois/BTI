     "AB": "Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) increases the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) through several biologically plausible pathways, but the relationship between CCH and the development of AD remains uncertain. To investigate expression of APP, BACE1 and A beta in the hippocampus of BCCAO rats and study pathophysiological mechanism of AD from CCH. CCH rat model was established by chronic bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). Behavior was evaluated after BCCAO with Morris water maze and open-field task. Expression of A beta was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). beta-Amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) and beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) were tested by ELISA, Western blotting and RT-PCR. Cognitive impairment occurred with CCH by Morris water maze test and open-field task. The BACE1 and A beta level in BCCAO rats was more increased than sham-operation control rats (P < 0.01) but APP had no difference(P > 0.05). The expression of BACE1 and A beta has no inter-group difference in BCCAO rats (P > 0.05). The level of BACE1 and A beta had positive correlation with cognitive impairment (P < 0.01) while no correlation was observed between APP and cognitive impairment. Chronic cerebral ischemia contributes to cognitive impairment and vascular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion increases BACE1 and A beta level in brain.",
