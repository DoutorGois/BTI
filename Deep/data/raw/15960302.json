     "AB": "It has been recently proposed that NG2 proteoglycan expressing cells may stand for a unique class of glia in adult CNS referred to as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). These NG2 positive cells can give rise to mature oligodendrocytes, however a large number of them persists in immature stage throughout a lifetime and responds to various types of injury. In order to investigate OPCs reactivity in vitro, a model of trimethyltin evoked neurodegeneration was used. The results demonstrate that NG2 expressing cells survive treatment with the neurotoxin in a concentration that injures most of neurons in the culture. Moreover, progenitors change their morphology when treated with trimethyltin, upregulate the NG2 proteoglycan expression and retain the ability to divide.",
