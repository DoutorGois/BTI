     "AB": "This study examined the release of endogenous amino acids from acute hippocampal slices, upon stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural fibres. One-minute samples of superfusate were collected via a cannula placed over the CA1 stratum radiatum, and were analysed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Evoked potentials were recorded to ascertain stimulation efficacy. Four minutes of continuous 50 Hz stimulation produced a tetrodotoxin-sensitive release of aspartate and glycine in the second minute of stimulation, as well as a tetrodotoxin-sensitive release of cysteine sulphinic acid, during stimulation and of homocysteic acid, following stimulation. Such 50 Hz stimulation also produced a tetrodotoxin-insensitive decrease in methionine levels, but no significant changes in any of the other 15 amino acids measured. Four minutes of continuous 1 Hz stimulation produced no changes in the levels of any of the amino acids measured, but four 600-ms trains of 100 Hz stimulation, which, unlike the 1 Hz stimulation, produced long-term potentiation, resulted in significant increases in levels of cysteine sulphinic acid and homocysteic acid, but not of any of the other amino acids measured. These results suggest that aspartate, glycine, homocysteic acid, and cysteine sulphinic acid play a role in synaptic transmission in the Schaffer collateral-commissural fibres, and that cysteine sulphinic acid and homocysteic acid may be released specifically by high-frequency stimulation.",
