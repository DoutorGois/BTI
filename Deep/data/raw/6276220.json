     "AB": "The binding of 3H-diazepam to membrane benzodiazepine receptors was examined in 2 psychogenetically selected lines of rats, which differ according to the selection criterion in avoidance behaviour (RHA/Verh greater than RLA/Verh) and, in addition, in emotionality (RHA/Verh less than RLA/Verh). RHA/Verh rats tended to show higher specific diazepam binding in all CNS-subregions when compared with RLA/Verh animals. Significant differences were found in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamic region and pons-medulla. These results reinforce the contention that a system involving benzodiazepine receptors may play a role in emotional behaviour.",
