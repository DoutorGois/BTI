     "AB": "The effects of a novel prolyl endopeptidase inhibitor (PEP), (S)-2-[[(S)-2-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl]carbonyl]-N-(phenylmethyl)- 1-pyrrolidinecar-boxamide (JTP-4819), on performance of the Morris water maze task and on central cholinergic function were investigated in aged rats. Spatial memory (escape latency, path length, and swimming speed to the platform) was impaired in aged rats performing the Morris water maze task when compared to young rats. Administration of JTP-4819 (1 mg/kg, p.o.) for 14 days improved this memory deficit in aged rats, as shown by the decrease in escape latency and path length. In addition, when JTP-4819 (at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered for 3 wk, it reversed the age-related increase of ChAT activity in the cerebral cortex and the decrease of 3H-choline uptake in the hippocampus. These data suggest that JTP-4819 ameliorates age-related impairment of spatial memory and partly reverses central cholinergic dysfunction, possibly due to the enhancement of neuropeptide function by inhibition of PEP mediated degradation of substance P, arginine-vasopressin, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone.",
