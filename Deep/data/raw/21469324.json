     "AB": "We analyzed the results of experimental research of features of processing sensory information in the hippocampus and neocortex available in literature and results of modelling the perception of information in the neocortex. It is noted that \"place\" fields of neurons become wider, and overlapping of receptive fields increases during upward moving in trisynaptic hippocampal pathway. These effects specify the generalization of the information processed. The results of our analysis allow us to put forward a hypothesis that a hierarchical complication of\"object - place\" associations occurs during upward propagation of signals through all hippocampal subfields. Complexity of neural representations of \"object - place\" associations that are formed and permanently stored in the hippocampal areas increases in process of propagation of signals from the entorhinal cortex to the hierarchically higher dentate gyrus, area CA3 and area CA1. Therefore, with the aim to extract information about \"object - place\" associations with certain details it is necessary to access that hippocampal area in which associations were processed and stored with the required degree of elaboration. By analogy with the neocortex, it is proposed that such processing of information in the hippocampus makes it possible to avoid the combinatorial explosion and provides storing (memory) the associations accumulated during the life. The proposed mechanism can serve as an addition to the known multiple trace theory, which states that the hippocampus is an integrating part of memory trace and is always involved in recall of long-delayed episodes.",
