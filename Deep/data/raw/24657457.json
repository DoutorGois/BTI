     "AB": "Deficient reelin signaling leads to characteristic layering malformations in the cerebral cortex and causes polarity defects of cortical neurons. Since the discovery of reelin much has been learned about the molecular mechanisms that underlie the characteristic defects of layering defects in the reeler mutant. More recent studies provided insights in the crosstalk between reelin signaling and molecular pathways that control polarity development of radially migrating neurons. The present review summarizes and discusses recent findings on the role of reelin in modulating polarization and process orientation of neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus.",
