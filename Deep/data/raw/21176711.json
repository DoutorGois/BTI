     "AB": "Mutations in the microtubule-associated tau (MAPT) gene are associated clinically with frontotemporal dementia with or without supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome or parkinsonism. Here we present clinical, neuropathological, genetic and biochemical data on a patient with an A152T variation in exon 7 of MAPT. A 63-year-old man presented with memory disturbance and later speech disorder, followed by progressive dementia and terminally myoclonus together with periodic sharp waves in EEG. Duration of illness was 5 years. Similar neuropsychiatric symptoms were reported in the patient's father. Neuropathological evaluation revealed neuronal loss mainly in the frontal and temporal cortices and substantia nigra. Abundant phospho-tau immunoreactive thread-like structures and diffuse staining of neuronal cytoplasm predominated in the frontal and temporal cortex, and hippocampus. There was a lack of astrocytic plaques and tufted astrocytes, and only a moderate number of oligodendroglial coiled bodies were seen. Tau pathology was characterized by the 4R tau isoform; immunoblot revealed bands at 64 and 68 kDa, and ultrastructure of filaments was compatible with twisted ribbons. Pathogenic mutations have not been reported in exon 7. Our observation of an apparently familial disorder with a novel neuropathological phenotype suggests a possible pathogenic role of this MAPT gene variation, which might be different from mutations affecting the microtubule binding.",
