     "AB": "We used a double isotope procedure and starved and normal littermate rats to compare relative protein synthesis in the cerebellar nuclear, myelin, synaptosomal, mitochondrial, and microsomal subfractions of postnatally starved animals. The remaining brain tissue was dissected into 6 additional regions (cerebral cortex, medulla oblongata, midbrain, hippocampus, striatum, and hypothalamus) and these were frozen for similar subcellular fractionation and analysis at a later date. The microsomal fraction derived from frozen tissues was discarded. The results show that early postnatal starvation specifically depresses myelin synthesis to about the same extent in all major brain regions at 18 and 21 days of age.",
