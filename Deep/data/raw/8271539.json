     "AB": "We investigated the localizing and lateralizing value of principal seizure manifestations in temporal lobe epilepsies (signal symptoms, oroalimentary automatisms, somatomotor manifestations, unilateral dystonic posturing, ictal speech, motionless stare) of 223 complex partial seizures in 50 patients. All the patients had invasive long-term monitoring with the combined implantation of intracerebral electrodes in and subdural electrodes on the bilateral temporal lobes. Postoperative freedom from seizures was ascertained for longer than one year. We found that 35 patients had amygdalohippocampal seizures and 15 had lateral temporal seizures. The value of the manifestations was established in relation to the site and side of seizure origin and to the progression of seizure discharges within the unilateral temporal lobe or to the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. Several signs among the manifestations were found to be reliable in predicting the site or side of the temporal lobe seizure focus. We emphasized the importance of investigating sequential changes of seizure manifestations in relation to ictal EEG findings by means of simultaneous recording.",
