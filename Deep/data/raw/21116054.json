     "AB": "The objective of this study was to investigate the association between structural cerebral changes and neuropsychological deficits in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sixty patients with MCI, 34 patients with mild to moderate AD, and 32 healthy controls underwent both extensive neuropsychological assessment (CERAD test battery) and high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging. We used optimized voxel based morphometry to investigate (i) differences in gray matter density between the three aforementioned groups and (ii) the putative relations of CERAD test performance with atrophic brain changes. When compared to the healthy controls, the AD patients and, to a lesser extent, patients with MCI showed significant density losses predominantly in the medial temporal lobe. Deficits in verbal fluency and word finding were significantly correlated with left fronto-temporal and left temporal (including hippocampal) changes, respectively. Decreased scores in immediate and delayed recall and in delayed recognition were associated with several cortical and subcortical sites including the parahippocampal and posterior cinguli gyri, the right thalamus, and the right hippocampus, whereas deficits in constructional praxis and constructional praxis recall referred to sites in the left thalamus and cerebellum, and the temporal cortices (bilaterally), respectively. Our findings lend further support for medial temporal lobe degeneration in MCI and AD and demonstrate that cognitive deficits as assessed on the CERAD do not simply refer to specific changes in discrete cerebral sites but rather reflect morphological alterations in widespread networks.",
