     "AB": "Although recent studies have suggested the role of microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 4 in some neuron-specific events, there are no reports that directly observed its neuronal localization. Here we show the detailed expression of MAP4 in the mammalian brain. Immunoblotting revealed the presence of MAP4 in all neuronal tissues. The site-specific localization of MAP4 was observed in sagittal brain sections: MAP4 was rich in brain-specific cells, cerebellum Purkinje cells and hippocampus pyramidal cells. When primary cultures of cortical neurons were immunostained, MAP4 was detected in the cell bodies and processes with patchy staining pattern. These results suggested that MAP4 play some roles in the central nervous system, such as the dynamic cytoskeletal reorganization and regulation of the microtubule-dependent long-range transport.",
