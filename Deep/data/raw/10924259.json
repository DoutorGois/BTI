     "AB": "Huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1) binds more tightly to mutant huntingtin, but its function and distribution in neurites are not clear. Using PC12 cells and cultured hippocampal neurons, we found that two HAP1 isoforms, HAP1-A and HAP1-B, have different subcellular localizations. While most HAP1-B is diffusely distributed within the cytoplasm, HAP1-A is enriched in the growth cones and neuritic puncta of developing neurons. In mature neurons and adult brain neurons, however, HAP1-A is concentrated in axon terminals and associated with synaptic vesicles. Transfection of HAP1-A in PC12 cells significantly promotes neurite extension, with HAP1-A distributed in the distal regions of the growing neurites. Cotransfection of mutant huntingtin with HAP1-A in PC12 cells results in the accumulation of HAP1-A on huntingtin aggregates and the inhibition of neurite promotion by HAP1-A. This study suggests that HAP1-A has a function in neuritic development and synaptic function and that mutant huntingtin may alter this function.",
