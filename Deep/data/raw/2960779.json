     "AB": "In an attempt to find an marker for nerve cell death in vivo, the ATP content was measured in the rat dorsal hippocampus within hours or days following in the local injection of the excitotoxins quinolinic or kainic acid. Beginning or completed neuronal degeneration is accompanied by significant decreases in ATP levels. Selective blockade of the quinolinic acid-induced decrement in ATP content by D-(-) 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid indicates that ATP measurements may of value for the rapid in vivo screening of the anti-neurotoxic properties of pharmacologically distinct excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists.",
