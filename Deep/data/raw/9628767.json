     "AB": "Conventional electrophysiological intracellular recording techniques were used to test the hypothesis that enhanced calcium entry via voltage-gated calcium channels or the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor-channel complex may be a primary pathological mechanism triggering neurodegeneration in scrapie and related diseases. This study was carried out at a time when cell loss is known to occur and when hippocampal pyramidal cells in area CA1 are rendered hyperexcitable following scrapie infection. There was no change to the NMDA receptor-mediated component of the Schaffer collateral evoked excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) or the level of spontaneous firing activity of CA1 cells following addition of the specific NMDA receptor antagonist, 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV, 20 microM), to the perfusate in scrapie-infected mice, indicating that the NMDA receptor-channel complex is not compromised by scrapie. There was also no change seen in the non-NMDA mediated component of the EPSP. The calcium spike of CA1 pyramidal cells was not significantly altered by scrapie infection, indicating that high threshold voltage-gated Ca2+ channel function is not compromised by scrapie. By contrast, cells from scrapie-infected mice fired calcium spikes repetitively and the long, slow AHP, which in control cells inhibited repetitive firing, was absent. Cells from scrapie-infected mice showed more depolarized membrane potentials than controls but this difference in potential was no longer observed after exposure to TEA. These data indicate a loss of TEA-insensitive and TEA-sensitive potassium conductances. We suggest that altered potassium currents rather than increased calcium entry via voltage-sensitive calcium channels or the NMDA receptor complex may be the primary pathological mechanism triggering neurodegeneration in scrapie and related diseases.",
