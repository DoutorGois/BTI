     "AB": "Hypertrophic and dysmorphic neurons have been identified in the hippocampal end folium of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). No data are available regarding the correlation between these cellular alterations and the severity of hippocampal sclerosis (HS), and the significance of this phenomenon has been unclear. We evaluated both the perikaryon and nuclear areas of residual neurons in the hippocampal end folium of 47 patients with mTLE, seven with lesional neocortical temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE), and 10 controls without seizure episodes. According to the severity of neuron loss in the end folium, we defined mTLE cases showing slight (<10%) or no, moderate (10-50%) and severe (>50%) loss as groups A, B and C, respectively. We also performed immunohistochemistry with antibodies against heat shock protein 70 and the phosphorylated epitope of neurofilament. In both mTLE and LTLE cases, the perikaryon and nuclear areas of the end folium neurons were significantly greater than those in the controls (P < 0.0001), and those in mTLE were significantly greater than those in LTLE. There were no differences in areas between groups A and B, but the areas in group C were significantly greater than those of both groups A and B. Neurons with large, bizarre morphology were labeled with both antibodies. Neuronal hypertrophy is evident in patients with epilepsy, and appears to advance gradually as the hippocampal sclerosis becomes more severe. This alteration may be a consequence of cellular stress incurred by neurons.",
