     "AB": "Studies on blast neurotrauma have focused on investigating the effects of exposure to free-field blast representing the simplest form of blast threat scenario without considering any reflecting surfaces. However, in reality personnel are often located within enclosures or nearby reflecting walls causing a complex blast environment, that is, involving shock reflections and/or compound waves from different directions. The purpose of this study was to design a complex wave testing system and perform a preliminary investigation of the intracranial pressure (ICP) response of rats exposed to a complex blast wave environment (CBWE). The effects of head orientation in the same environment were also explored. Furthermore, since it is hypothesized that exposure to a CBWE would be more injurious as compared to a free-field blast wave environment (FFBWE), a histological comparison of hippocampal injury (cleaved caspase-3 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)) was conducted in both environments. Results demonstrated that, regardless of orientation, peak ICP values were significantly elevated over the peak static air overpressure. Qualitative differences could be noticed compared to the ICP response in rats exposed to simulated FFBWE. In the CBWE scenario, after the initial loading the skull/brain system was not allowed to return to rest and was loaded again reaching high ICP values. Furthermore, results indicated consistent and distinct ICP-time profiles according to orientation, as well as distinctive values of impulse associated with each orientation. Histologically, cleaved caspase-3 positive cells were significantly increased in the CBWE as compared to the FFBWE. Overall, these findings suggest that the geometry of the skull and the way sutures are distributed in the rats are responsible for the difference in the stresses observed. Moreover, this increase stress contributes to correlation of increased injury in the CBWE.",
