     "AB": "Messenger RNA differential display is conducted to search for genes that are expressed in a region-specific pattern in the rodent brain. Eleven novel gene fragments are isolated. One of these genes which we call pancortin, based on its predominant mRNA expression in the cerebral cortex of the adult, is studied. These pancortin cDNA clones are grouped into four different types of cDNA, designated as pancortin-1 to -4. All pancortin cDNAs share a common sequence in the middle of their structure, having two alternative sequences at both 5'- and 3'-ends, respectively. Deduced amino acid sequence shows that all pancortins have sequences of hydrophobic amino acids at N-terminus and no obvious membrane spanning regions. In situ hybridization histochemistry using oligonucleotide probes specific for 5'- and 3'-end variable parts has revealed that these four pancortin mRNAs are expressed differentially in the adult rodent brain. Robust expression of pancortin-1 and -2 mRNA is observed in the cerebral cortex (including the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb). However, little of pancortin-3 and -4 mRNA is observed there. In the cortex, some neurons are stained by an antibody raised against Pancortin. Immuno-electron microscopic study has revealed that Pancortin-like immunoreactive products are localized mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum and not in the Golgi apparatus indicating that Pancortins are the endoplasmic reticulum-anchored proteins. Our results suggest that each Pancortin is differentially regulated and may perform different functions in the brain.",
