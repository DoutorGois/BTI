     "AB": "This study examined the accumulation of the cytotoxic lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) after lateral fluid percussion (FP) brain injury in rats. A diffuse distribution of HNE-immunoreactivity (HNE-ir) was observed in the cortex and hippocampus of the ipsilateral, but not of the contralateral, hemisphere at 30 min, 6 h, 24 h, and 48 h after brain injury. The HNE-ir was well-localized in cell bodies of the ipsilateral cortex and the CA3 pyramidal layer in the ipsilateral hippocampus. Because HNE's interaction with certain proteins causes protein dysfunction and HNE, in vitro, causes neuronal cell damage, the present results suggest that HNE's interaction with neuronal proteins may contribute to neuronal damage in the ipsilateral cortex and hippocampus after brain injury.",
