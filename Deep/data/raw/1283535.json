     "AB": "beta-Amyloid peptide and spantide have previously been described to have trophic effects on hippocampal neurones in vitro. We report here that bombesin and [Pro9]-substance P also show a neurotrophic effect on cultured hippocampal neurones. The neurotrophic effect of spantide or a beta-amyloid fragment containing amino acids 25 to 35 was not blocked by addition of the NK1 receptor agonist, substance P or the nonpeptide NK1 antagonist, RP 67580. For the bombesin-related peptides, the antagonist [Tyr4-DPhe12]-bombesin also provokes a trophic response, but the agonist alytesin and the antagonist [Leu13-psi-(CH2NH) Leu14]-bombesin have no effect on neurite growth. These results suggest that the observed trophic responses are unlikely to be mediated by a classical NK1 or bombesin receptor.",
