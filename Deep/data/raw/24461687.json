     "AB": "A 5-year-old dog was referred with a history of anorexia and apathy for 3 weeks and acute status epilepticus. Ten weeks later the animal was humanely destroyed due to refractory epilepsy despite anti-epileptic medical treatment. Microscopical examination of the brain revealed bilateral malformation of the dentate gyrus with abnormal gyration. Cornu ammonis segments comprised of sparse pyramidal cells accompanied by marked gliosis. Additionally, there was severe generalized disseminated granulomatous meningoencephalitis, mainly localized to the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. This is the first description of bilateral hippocampal malformation in a dog.",
