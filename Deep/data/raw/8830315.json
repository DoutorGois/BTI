     "AB": "alpha-Melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is a proopiomelanocortin-derived peptide involved in such behavioural activities as arousal, grooming, memory, learning and attention. Because of these effects, alpha-MSH can be considered the 'adaptation neuropeptide'. Two alpha-MSH major forms were described: acetyl alpha-MSH and des-acetyl alpha-MSH. Since the acetylated form of alpha-MSH is biologically significantly more effective than des-acetyl alpha-MSH, we studied the activity of N-acetyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for MSH acetylation, during ageing in rat hippocampus and pituitary. We observed a substantial decrease of enzyme activity during lifetime, suggesting that the lower synthesis of the more efficient acetylated alpha-MSH form can be related to the reduced adaptive capabilities of aged subjects.",
