They are important to solutions of drugs for tests in vitro. At the beginning of the cultivation aethanol in vitro influenced the regeneration of nerve fibers from explants and cells. A significant increase of the index of growth was observed. After a long term influence of tween 80, DMF and DMSO an inhibition of differentiation of neurons in vitro was observed.",
