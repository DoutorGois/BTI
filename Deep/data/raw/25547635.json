     "AB": "Pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-beta (Abeta) at amino acid position three (Abeta(pE3-42)) is gaining considerable attention as a potential key player in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta(pE3-42) is abundant in AD brain and has a high aggregation propensity, stability, and cellular toxicity. The aim of the present work was to study the effect of Abeta(pE3-42) expression on neuron loss and associated behavioral deficits using the TBA42 transgenic mouse model. Expression of pyroglutamate Abeta(3-42) triggers hippocampal CA1 neuron loss and behavioral deficits in the TBA42 mouse model. Mice elicited significant neuron death (-35% at the age of 12 months), deficits in the spatial reference memory, working memory, loss of anxiety, and severe motor deficits in an age-dependent manner. These results support a major pathological function of pyroglutamate Abeta in AD.",
