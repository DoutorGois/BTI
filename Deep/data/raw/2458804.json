     "AB": "The effects of predictable and unpredictable shock on concentrations of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), tryptophan (TP) and noradrenaline (NA) have been studied in 7 regions of rat brain. Two separate experiments have been carried out determining these substances both at 30 min and 2 h after the stress session. Unpredictable shock depleted NA levels in all brain regions except the striatum. However, at 2 h poststress NA in these regions increased significantly in comparison with both controls and predictably shocked rats. Predictable shock also decreased NA in locus coeruleus, brainstem and hypothalamus, which was not observed 2 h later. Both predictable and unpredictable shock decreased 5-HT in brainstem and hypothalamus. At 2 h poststress, 5-HT levels in these regions were still decreased in predictably shocked rats, but had attained control values in unpredictably shocked rats. 5-HT metabolism expressed as the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio, was significantly increased 30 min after predictable shock in all regions except the locus coeruleus and hippocampus. Unpredictable shock produced a much more marked increase in 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio. At 2 h poststress 5-HT metabolism returned to control values in most of the brain regions of predictably shocked animals, but it remained high after unpredictable shock. The activation of serotonergic metabolism following each type of shock is different according to the nucleus in which the 5-HT nerve endings originate. Only slight increases in tryptophan were observed after both types of shock. Our results suggest that unpredictable shock is perceived as a more anxiogenic situation and that under this condition both 5-HT and NA levels are more effectively normalized with time.",
