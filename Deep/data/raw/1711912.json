     "AB": "Olfactory receptor neurons are a CNS entry point for a wide variety of airborne substances. Therefore, it is probable that detoxification mechanisms are present in these neurons to neutralize such agents. Glutathione (GSH) is an essential component of several detoxification schemes, and in this study we examined the distribution and levels of GSH in the olfactory epithelium, olfactory bulb, cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum in neonatal, weanling, adult and aged rats. We report that GSH is primarily localized to the olfactory receptor neurons and their oxons within the olfactory epithelium. It is also localized within the glomerular neuropil and granule cells of the olfactory bulb. Levels of GSH in the olfactory epithelium and hippocampus do not change as a function of age, although GSH levels decrease in several brain regions, including the olfactory bulb, cerebellum and cortex.",
