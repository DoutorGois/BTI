     "AB": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) describe neurodevelopmental deficits in children exposed to alcohol in utero. We hypothesized that gestational alcohol significantly alters fetal brain regional protein signature. Pregnant rats were binge-treated with alcohol or pair-fed and nutritionally-controlled. Mass spectrometry identified 1806, 2077, and 1456 quantifiable proteins in the fetal hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum, respectively. A stronger effect of alcohol exposure on the hippocampal proteome was noted: over 600 hippocampal proteins were significantly (P<.05) altered, including annexin A2, nucleobindin-1, and glypican-4, regulators of cellular growth and developmental morphogenesis. In the cerebellum, cadherin-13, reticulocalbin-2, and ankyrin-2 (axonal growth regulators) were significantly (P<.05) altered; altered cortical proteins were involved in autophagy (endophilin-B1, synaptotagmin-1). Ingenuity analysis identified proteins involved in protein homeostasis, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and mTOR as major pathways in the cortex and hippocampus significantly (P<.05) affected by alcohol. Thus, neurodevelopmental protein changes may directly relate to FASD neuropathology.",
