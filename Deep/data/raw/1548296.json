     "AB": "Light microscopic neuronal changes were studied in rats subjected to 10 min of global ischemia produced by compression of the major cardiac vessels. Observations of cresyl violet-stained sections revealed early changes involving predominantly GABAergic neurons in various locations. In rats killed 15 min after recirculation, the changes were characterized by the appearance of a clear peripheral zone with condensation of the remaining neuronal cytoplasm. After 1 h, these zones appeared to be compartmentalized into individual pearl-like vacuoles, especially prominent in the nucleus reticularis thalami. After 3 h, the cytoplasmic vacuoles disappeared and the neuronal changes, particularly in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, consisted mainly of hyperchromasia or loss of Nissl substance. After 2 days, the cerebral cortex and thalamus contained occasional neurons with conspicuously large nucleoli. After 7 days, the hippocampus revealed an approximately 50% loss of CA1 pyramidal neurons, associated with intense microglial reactivity in the stratum radiatum, whereas the neuronal destruction was more complete in the nucleus reticularis thalami. Our observations suggest a possibility that early changes in GABAergic neurons may provide a period of neuronal disinhibition and thus contribute to an excitatory ischemic damage in regions connected by GABAergic circuitry.",
