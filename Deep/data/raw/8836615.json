     "AB": "This report describes the in vivo effects of the uptake carrier blockers 1-(4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl)-3-piperidine carboxylic acid hydrochloride (SK & F 89976-A) and L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (L-trans-PDC) on basal and K(+)-evoked extracellular levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, aspartate and taurine in the hippocampus of anaesthetised rats, using the microdialysis technique. SK & F 89976-A increased extracellular GABA levels under K(+)-depolarised conditions and did not affect extracellular glutamate, aspartate and taurine levels, indicating its selective effect on GABA uptake L-trans-PDC dose dependently increased basal and K(+)-evoked extracellular glutamate levels, and did not affect extracellular GABA levels, but increased basal aspartate and taurine levels. The K(+)-evoked release of GABA and glutamate, measured in the presence of both SK & F 89976-A and L-trans-PDC, was Ca(2+)-dependent for about 50% and 65%, respectively. In contrast, the release of the putative amino acid transmitters aspartate and taurine was not Ca(2+)-dependent. These results indicate that (1) in rat hippocampus uptake carriers actively regulate extracellular GABA and glutamate levels, (2) the GABA and glutamate released by K+ was derived from both Ca(2+)-dependent (presumably vesicular) and Ca(2+)-independent (presumably cytosolic) pools, whereas aspartate and taurine release was exclusively from Ca(2+)-independent pools.",
