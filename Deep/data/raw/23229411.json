     "AB": "GM-1 ganglioside (GM-1) has been proposed as a new therapeutic agent against Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate the effects of GM1 on memory deficits and oxidative stress in the hippocampus of rat model of AD. Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 15): control group, model group, and treatment group, which were injected with vehicle, Abeta1-40, and Abeta1-40 together with GM-1, respectively. Morris water maze test was performed to evaluate spatial learning and memory of the rats. Brain malondialdehyde (MDA) content was detected by biochemical assay, and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) level in the hippocampus was examined by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that learning and memory deficits were improved in treatment group compared to model group. Brain MDA content and 4-HNE level in hippocampus CA1 were much lower in treatment group than in model group. In summary, we demonstrate that GM-1 could improve spatial learning and memory deficits in rat model of AD, and this may be mediated by the inhibition of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in the neurons. These data suggest that GM-1 is a potential agent for AD treatment.",
