     "AB": "There is now considerable evidence that both schizophrenia and affective disorders have their origin at least in part in events that occur during early pre- and post-natal development. In the case of schizophrenia, many observations, for example, increased risk for schizophrenia in the offspring of mothers who had influenza A during their second trimester of pregnancy and evidence for abnormal neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex of post mortem tissue from schizophrenic patients, suggest that a second trimester insult may have occurred and that this insult may have increased the risk for the development of schizophrenia in late adolescence or early adulthood. Animal studies have found that rats that undergo exocitotoxic damage to the ventral hippocampus on postnatal day 7 develop exaggerated sensitivity to dopamine-stimulating drugs or to stressful stimuli that becomes apparent after sexual maturity but not before, providing a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia. Similarly, post-weaning social isolation leads to enhanced responses to dopaminergic drugs and to stress that emerges after sexual maturity. These animal models are proving to be valuable tools to study the neurobiological mechanisms mediating the influence of early insults to the nervous system on later behavioural functions. In the case of affective disorders, although the evidence is not as strong, a number of the same observations have been made suggesting that an insult during early ontogeny may lead to the development of affective disorders later in life. For example, retrospective studies of people with affective disorders showed that they were more likely to have attained motor milestones at a later age and to have had poorer academic performance as children. There is a wealth of evidence suggesting hyperfunctioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in affective disorders. Animal studies have shown that early maternal deprivation can lead to lasting changes in the reactivity of the HPA axis to stressful stimuli, providing another link from early experience to adult psychopathology. Continued studies of the effects of pre- and early post-natal events on the development of the nervous system and the relationships of these events to schizophrenia or affective disorder will provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying these common neuropsychiatric illnesses.",
