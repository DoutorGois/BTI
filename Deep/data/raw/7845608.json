     "AB": "Bcl-2 proto-oncogene encodes a protein which may cancel the cell death programme in normal development and experimentally induced conditions. Strong bcl-2 immunoreactivity occurs in the neocortex and hippocampus of the developing rat during the 1st postnatal week. Bcl-2 immunoreactivity rapidly decreases from this age onwards to steady very low levels in adulthood. Since increased expression of bcl-2 immunoreactivity during cortical neurogenesis is coincidental in time with a special vulnerability of cortical neurons to naturally occurring cell death, it is suggested that bcl-2 may have a role in regulating cell death and survival during cortical morphogenesis.",
