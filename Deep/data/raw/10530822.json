     "AB": "In order to study the role of metabotropic glutamate 1 (mGlu1) receptors in ischemic neuronal death, we examined the effects of the recently characterized and relatively selective mGlu1 receptor antagonists 1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA) and (S)-(+)-2-(3'-carboxybicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl)-glycine (CBPG) in murine cortical cell cultures and rat organotypic hippocampal slices exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) and in vivo, following transient global ischemia in gerbils. AIDA and CBPG significantly reduced neuronal death when added to the incubation medium during the OGD insult and the subsequent recovery period. Neuroprotection was observed even when these compounds were added up to 60 min (in cortical neurons) or 30 min (in hippocampal slices) after OGD. In vivo, i.c.v. administration of AIDA and CBPG reduced hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell injury following transient global ischemia. Neuroprotection was also observed when AIDA was added to the hippocampal perfusion fluid in microdialysis experiments, and this effect was associated with an increase in the basal output of GABA. These findings demonstrate that AIDA and CBPG are neuroprotective when administered during the maturation of ischemic damage and that different mechanisms are likely to be involved in mediating their effects following blockade of mGlu1 receptors in cortical and hippocampal neurons.",
