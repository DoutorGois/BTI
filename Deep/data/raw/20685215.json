     "AB": "Agomelatine, a novel melatonin analogue and anti-depressant that acts as an agonist on melatonin receptors 1 and 2 and as an antagonist at the 5HT2C receptor, was tested for its effects on cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of the adult rat hippocampus under intact and flattened corticosterone rhythm conditions. Agomelatine stimulated mitosis rates in the intact male rat. Flattening the daily corticosterone rhythm by inserting a subcutaneous pellet of this steroid prevented the action of agomelatine. However, adding a daily injection of corticosterone at CT1200 to rats with implanted corticosterone pellets failed to restore agomelatine's efficacy on cell proliferation. The 5HT2C receptor antagonist SB242084 stimulated progenitor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus, while a 5HT2C agonist (RO600175) had no effect on cell proliferation alone, but counteracted that of agomelatine. These results suggest that agomelatine, a new anti-depressant, can stimulate progenitor cell mitosis in the dentate gyrus. Its action requires an intact diurnal corticosterone rhythm. The action of agomelatine on neurogenesis is likely to reside in its antagonism of the 5HT2C receptor, and suggests a mechanism distinct from that of fluoxetine, another anti-depressant, which, as previous work shows, acts through the 5HT1A receptor, but whose action is also blocked by a flattened corticosterone rhythm.",
