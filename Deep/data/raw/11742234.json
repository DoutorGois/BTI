     "AB": "The role of cytoplasmic calcium level (Ca(i)) in regulation of Ca channel activity during hypoxia was studied in hippocampal neurones from rats. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings in combination with measurements of O(2) partial pressure (pO(2)) were used. Lowering of pO(2) induced a potentiation of HVA Ca channel activity by 25.7% at Ca(i) = 75 nM in comparison with Ca(2+)-free solution. Increase of Ca(i) up to 410 nM slightly increased the effect and significantly slowed the Ca(2+) current run-down. On the other hand, hypoxia increased a steady-state channel inactivation and speeded up the kinetics of Ca(2+) current decay by about 30%. We conclude that moderate hypoxia induces dual action on Ca channels: intracellularly mediated augmentation of Ca influx via Ca channels and their Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation.",
