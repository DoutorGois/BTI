     "AB": "Canagliflozin (CAN) is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is a little information about its effect on the cholinergic system that proposed mechanism for memory improvement occurring by SGLT2 drugs. This study aimed to estimate the effect of CAN as compared to galantamine (GAL) treatments for two weeks on scopolamine hydrobromide (SCO)-induced memory dysfunction in experimental rats. Animals divided into six groups; control (CON), CAN, GAL, SCO, SCO + CAN and SCO + GAL. Results indicated significant decrease in body weights of the CAN groups as compared to control values. Moreover, in the SCO + CAN and SCO + GAL the number of arm entry and number of correct alternation in Y maze task increased and showed improvement in the water maze task, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities decreased significantly, while monoamines levels significantly increased compared with the SCO group values. Results also recorded acetylcholine M1 receptor (M1 mAChR) in SCO + CAN or SCO + GAL groups in comparison with the SCO group. The study suggested that canagliflozin might improve memory dysfunction induced by scopolamine hydrobromide via cholinergic and monoamines system.",
