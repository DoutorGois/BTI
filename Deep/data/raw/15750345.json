     "AB": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in reperfusion injury after transient focal cerebral ischemia. The antioxidant enzyme, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), is one of the major means by which cells counteract the deleterious effects of ROS after ischemia. Recently, we reported that when Tat-SOD fusion protein is transduced into pancreatic beta cells it protects the beta cells from destruction by relieving oxidative stress in ROS-implicated diabetes (Eum et al., 2004). In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of Tat-SOD fusion protein against neuronal cell death and ischemic insults. When Tat-SOD was added to the culture medium of neuronal cells, it rapidly entered the cells and protected them against paraquat-induced cell death. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Tat-SOD injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into mice has access to various tissues including brain neurons. When i.p. injected into gerbils, Tat-SOD prevented neuronal cell death in the hippocampus in response to transient fore-brain ischemia. These results suggest that Tat-SOD provides a strategy for therapeutic delivery in various hu-man diseases, including stroke, related to this anti-oxidant enzyme or to ROS.",
