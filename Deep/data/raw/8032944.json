     "AB": "Place-specific discharge of hippocampal cells was monitored while rats performed daily 15 trials of a spatial memory task. During the intertrial interval between trials 5 and 6, the lateral dorsal nucleus of the thalamus (LDN) was reversibly inactivated. Choice accuracy on the maze became impaired, and many hippocampal place fields became disrupted. These data support the proposition that the LDN passes onto hippocampus important (spatial) information that is used for accurate maze navigation.",
