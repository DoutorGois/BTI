     "AB": "Hippocampal brain slices are valuable models for studying brain function but are compromised by several artifacts, including significant water gain and histologic injury, which occur under certain incubation conditions. Addition of colloid to Krebs-Ringer buffer (K-R) has been shown to eliminate water gain but has not achieved widespread acceptance. We confirm prior observations that dextran and PEG lessen the increase in slice mass during incubation in a dose-dependent manner with no water gain occurring at 4% concentrations. However, we also observe that addition of colloid to standard K-R induces severe neuronal pyknosis. Fortunately, the pyknosis can be eliminated by reduction in buffer osmolarity through adjustment of NaCl, producing markedly improved slice histology in dextran buffer, especially in the CA3 and CA4 regions of the hippocampus which are severely injured when incubated submerged in K-R at 37 degrees C. Extracellular space markers are not affected by either colloid. The volume of distribution for 45Ca is much larger in dextran buffers than in K-R and variability of 45Ca kinetics is also reduced. In the presence of dextran, hypoxia induces significant slice water gain, a relatively selective histologic injury and an alteration of tissue Ca2+ kinetics. Use of dextran buffers may eliminate many troubling brain slice artifacts.",
