     "AB": "We investigated in vivo the expression of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) in the rat CNS after kainate (KA)-induced excitotoxic seizures. In situ hybridization revealed that TIMP-1 mRNA is induced rapidly and massively in most regions of the adult forebrain after KA treatment. Neuronal activity seems to be necessary but not sufficient to trigger TIMP-1 induction, because it is not observed in seizing 10-d-old pups, unlike what is observed in 21- and 35-d-old animals after seizures. The rapid induction of TIMP-1 is not prevented by the inhibitor of protein synthesis cycloheximide, suggesting that, after seizures, TIMP-1 is induced in neurons as an immediate early gene (IEG). The initial neuronal upregulation is followed by enhanced expression in astrocytes, as assessed by double-labeling experiments. In the hippocampus rapid increases in mRNA are followed by relatively delayed (8 hr after KA) increases in TIMP-1 immunoreactivity in the perisomatic and dendro-axonic areas, suggesting secretion of the protein. At 3 d after KA treatment, strong immunoreactivity is found in astrocytes and in the cell bodies and dendro-axonic projections of resistant neurons such as the dentate granule cells. Taken together, the results suggest that TIMP-1 may be instrumental for neurons and astrocytes in coupling early cellular events triggered by seizures with the regulation of long-lasting changes involved in tissue reorganization and/or neuroprotection.",
