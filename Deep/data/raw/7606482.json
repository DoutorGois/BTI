     "AB": "We previously reported lesions confined specifically to the hippocampus when produced by occluding eight vessels (the bilateral vertebral, common, internal, and external carotid arteries), which supply blood to the brain. However, histopathological changes in the primate brain, caused by ischemic injury, have not previously been thoroughly investigated. In the present study, macaque monkeys were subjected to 5-18-min ischemia by occluding the eight vessels. After the brains were perfused and fixed 5 days after the occlusion, all regions were histologically investigated for ischemic cell changes. Ischemia for 5 min produced no ischemic cell change. Ischemia for 10-15 min produced cell death limited to the deeper portion of the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 subfield in the hippocampus. In most monkeys, no cell death was observed in any brain region outside of the hippocampus after ischemia for up to 15 min. Ischemia for 18 min produced more widespread cell death in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus, and cell death was no longer confined to the hippocampus, but was observed in layers III, V, and VI of the neocortices, the striatum, and some other regions. Brains that were perfused and fixed 1 year after 15-min ischemic insult revealed no ischemic cell morphological change in any region, but the number of pyramidal cells in the CA1 subfield was decreased to about half. The results indicate that the CA1 subfield of the monkey hippocampus is the precise region of the brain most susceptible to ischemic insult in the primate forebrain, and after a critical time (15-min ischemia in this procedure) ischemic cell changes occur suddenly and extensively. Ischemia due to occlusion of eight arteries for 10-15 min could produce a model of human amnesia caused by transient ischemic insult.",
