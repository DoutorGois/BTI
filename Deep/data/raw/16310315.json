     "AB": "Hippocampal pyramidal neurons and granule neurons of adult male rats are equipped with a complete machinery for the synthesis of pregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and 17beta-estradiol. Both estrogens and androgens are synthesized in male hippocampus. These brain steroids are synthesized by cytochrome P450s (P450scc, P45017alpha and P450arom), hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and reductases from endogenous cholesterol. The expression levels of enzymes are as low as 1/300-1/1000 of those in endocrine organs. Synthesis is dependent on the acute Ca(2+) influx upon neuron-neuron communication via NMDA receptors. Estradiol is particularly important because estradiol rapidly modulates neuronal synaptic transmission such as long-term potentiation via synaptic estrogen receptors. Xenoestrogens may also act via estrogen-driven signaling pathways.",
