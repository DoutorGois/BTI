     "AB": "Assimilated evidence indicates that the neurotoxic potential of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide and an alteration in the level of growth factor(s) may possibly be involved in the loss of neurons observed in the brain of patients suffering from Alzheimer disease (AD), the prevalent cause of dementia in the elderly. In the present study, using receptor binding assays and immunocytochemistry, we evaluated the pharmacological profile of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors and the distribution of IGF-I immunoreactivity in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of AD and age-matched control brains. In control brains, [(125)I]IGF-I binding was inhibited more potently by IGF-I than by Des(1-3)IGF-I, IGF-II or insulin. The IC(50) values for IGF-I in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of the normal brain did not differ significantly from the corresponding regions of the AD brain. Additionally, neither K(D) nor B(max) values were found to differ in the hippocampus of AD brains from the controls. At the regional levels, [(125)I]IGF-I binding sites in the AD brain also remained unaltered compared to the controls. As for the peptide itself, IGF-I immunoreactivity, in normal control brains, was evident primarily in a subpopulation of astrocytes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, and in certain Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. In AD brains, a subset of Abeta-containing neuritic plaques, apart from astrocytes, exhibit IGF-I immunoreactivity. These results, taken together, suggest a role for IGF-I in compensatory plasticity and/or survival of the susceptible neurons in AD brains.",
