     "AB": "Glutamate is the primary neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. One of the classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors is kainate receptors. Recent developments in the pharmacology of kainate receptors have resulted in the emergence of several selective agonists and antagonists. These compounds have allowed scientists to begin to probe the functional properties of these receptors in neurons and gain a better understanding of the role of these receptors in the nervous system.",
