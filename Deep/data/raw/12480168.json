In this study, the effects of different extracellular potassium concentrations ([K(+)](o)) were investigated on the modulatory effect of the L-type transmembranous calcium currents on epileptiform discharges. The in vitro brain slice technique was used to examine the effects of calcium channel blockers, verapamil and nifedipine, on the repetition rate, amplitude, and duration of epileptiform field potentials (EFP) in the presence of low, physiological, and high background [K(+)](o) in guinea pig hippocampal slices. Epileptiform activity was induced by omission of Mg(2+) from artificial cerebrospinal fluid contained 2, 4, and 8 mM [K(+)](o). Both verapamil and nifedipine suppressed EFP after a transient increase in repetition rate. The extent of EFP frequency rate acceleration significantly increased with reduction of [K(+)](o). The increase in EFP frequency rate induced by application of verapamil and nifedipine was accompanied by a reduction in the EFP amplitude and a reversible increase in the burst discharge duration. The extent of burst discharge prolongation was also significantly higher with decreasing [K(+)](o). Further application of verapamil and nifedipine suppressed the epileptiform burst activity in the presence of different [K(+)](o). The latency of EFP depression was significantly diminished both with increased and decreased background potassium concentrations. The data indicate the importance of the effect of the L-type transmembranous calcium currents on the regulatory effect of background [K(+)](o) on epileptiform burst discharge frequency and duration.",
