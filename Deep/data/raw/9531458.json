     "AB": "Methods were recently developed for culturing neurons from adult rat hippocampus using the serum-free medium Neurobasal with B27 supplement. To determine whether adult cultured neurons have normal electrical properties, we studied cultures from rats of three age groups: (1) embryonic; (2) 10-11 months old and (3) 35-36 months old. Neurons had a polarized morphology with a large branching apical dendrite and small basal dendrites. Mean resting potentials were similar in the three age groups. All neurons had nonlinear current-voltage relationships, indicating the presence of voltage-sensitive ion channels. Most neurons had a voltage-sensitive inward current followed by a sustained voltage-sensitive outward current. Tetrodotoxin blocked the inward current, which is likely to be a sodium current. The sustained outward current, which is likely to be a potassium current, reversed at -71 mV. Most neurons exhibited anomalous rectification. Calcium currents were present in both embryonic and adult neurons. Embryonic neurons would sometimes fire multiple action potentials but adult neurons fired only single action potentials. Our results indicate that both embryonic and adult cultured neurons retain a clearly neuronal electrophysiological phenotype in Neurobasal/B27 serum-free medium.",
