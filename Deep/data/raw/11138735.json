     "AB": "Hyperexcitation of glutamatergic neurons may play a key role in ischemia-related neurodegeneration. Recent studies have suggested that the zinc ion (Zn2+), which is present in the central nervous system, has a modulatory role in glutamatergic neuron activity. Zinc ions block glutamate-induced depolarizing currents and neuronal damage by binding with zinc sites on the NMDA subtypes. Therefore, we examined the usefulness of zinc as a therapeutic agent for the prevention of ischemic neuronal damage in the brain. In our previous study, 2,3-butanedione bis(N4-dimethylthiosemicarbazonato) zinc complex (Zn-ATSM2), with high brain uptake, showed significant neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia in rats when administered systemically. In this study, to elucidate the mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of Zn-ATSM2, we first examined its in vitro protective effects against glutamate-, NMDA- and kainite-induced neurotoxicity in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. Zn-ATSM2 elicited protective effects against this glutamate- and NMDA-induced neurotoxicity, but did not affect kainite-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, we studied the effects of Zn-ATSM2 on influx of Ca2+, which undergoes modification subsequent to NMDA activation. Zn-ATSM2 significantly decreased glutamate-induced 45Ca2+ uptake. Thus, Zn-ATSM2 protected against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity and its protective effect was, at least in part, due to the blockage of NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx.",
