     "AB": "Fyn tyrosine kinase deficient mice are known to show increased fearfulness. We investigated the fear response of these mice using the light-potentiation of the acoustic startle response (ASR) and examined its neurochemical correlates using in vivo microdialysis. Female homozygous Fyn-deficient mice showed an enhancement of the startle amplitude under a bright light while heterozygotes and wild-types did not show such a change. Along with these behavioral findings, the homozygous Fyn-deficient mice showed an increase in extracellular serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in the prefrontal cortex and 5-HT in the hippocampus when they were exposed to bright light, while heterozygous and wild-type mice did not show such changes. These results suggest that the increased fearfulness of Fyn-deficient mice is related to enhanced serotonergic and dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system.",
