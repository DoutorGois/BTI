     "AB": "A portion of zinc concentrates in the synaptic vesicles in the brain and is released from glutamatergic (zincergic) neuron terminals. It serves as a signaling factor (in a form of free Zn(2+)). Both extracellular Zn(2+) signaling, which predominantly originates in Zn(2+) release from zincergic neuron terminals, and intracellular Zn(2+) signaling, which is often linked to extracellular Zn(2+) signaling, are involved in hippocampus-dependent memory. At mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses and Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapses, which are zincergic, extracellular Zn(2+) signaling leads to intracellular Zn(2+) signaling and is involved in learning and memory. At medial perforant pathway-dentate granule cell synapses, which are non-zincergic, intracellular Zn(2+) signaling, which originates in the internal stores containing Zn(2+), is involved in learning and memory. The blockade of Zn(2+) signaling with Zn(2+) chelators induces memory deficit, while the optimal amount range of Zn(2+) signaling is unknown. It is possible that the degree and frequency of Zn(2+) signaling, which determine the increased Zn(2+) levels, modulates learning and memory as well as intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. To understand the precise role of synaptic Zn(2+) signaling in the hippocampus, the present paper summarizes the current knowledge on Zn(2+) signaling at zincergic and non-zincergic synapses in the hippocampus in cognition and involvement of zinc transporters and zinc-binding proteins in synaptic Zn(2+) signaling.",
