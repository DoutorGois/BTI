     "AB": "The stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors in the raphe or their blockade in the hippocampus can reduce cognitive deficits induced by blockade of muscarinic receptors in the hippocampus. We investigated the effects of MDL 73005 (8-[2-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-2-ylmethylamino) ethyl]-8-azaspiro[4,5] decane-7,9-dione methyl sulphonate), an agonist at 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors and an antagonist at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in rats treated systemically with scopolamine. Spatial memory was assessed in a water maze using protocols testing reference and working memory. Home cage locomotor activity was also determined. Working memory and locomotor activity were evaluated before and after para-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA) treatment. Scopolamine produced a weak impairment of reference memory at 0.5 mg/kg, and a more pronounced impairment of working memory at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg. MDL 73005 alone (2 mg/kg, i.p.) had no effect, but prevented the memory impairments induced by 0.25 mg/kg of scopolamine. Scopolamine induced hyperlocomotion. MDL 73005 alone did not affect locomotor activity, but exacerbated the hyperlocomotion induced by 0.5 mg/kg of scopolamine. pCPA did not abolish the effects of MDL 73005, suggesting that these effects were not due to an action at presynaptic receptors, or even that they involved receptors other than serotonergic ones (e.g., D2). In conclusion, MDL 73005 is able to antagonise moderate spatial memory dysfunctions induced by systemic muscarinic blockade.",
