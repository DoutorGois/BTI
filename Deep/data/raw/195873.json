     "AB": "Studies were performed on the activity of several enzymes in Ammon's horn of rat during an individual postembryonal development. For the studies rats of Wistar strain were used that were killed on the 1st, 3rd, 8th, 17th, 40th and 60th day after birth. In the experiment the brains were removed, cut, and the activity of dehydrogenases, phosphatases and esterases was revealed. During the performed studies some considerable differences were shown in the activity of several dehydrogenases, in each particular field of Ammon's horn, undergoing changes in the periods of ontogenetic development under study. Furthermore, some distinct differences in the phosphatases and esterases activity were revealed in each area of the Ammon's horn. Attention was drawn to a comparatively late histo-enzymatic maturation of Ammon's horn in comparison with other structures of the limbic system.",
