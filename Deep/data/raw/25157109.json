     "AB": "DTNBP1 (dystrobrevin-binding protein 1), which encodes dysbindin-1, is one of the leading susceptibility genes for schizophrenia. Both dysbindin-1B and -1C isoforms are decreased, but the dysbindin-1A isoform is unchanged in schizophrenic hippocampal formation, suggesting dysbindin-1 isoforms may have distinct roles in schizophrenia. We found that mouse dysbindin-1C, but not dysbindin-1A, is localized in the hilar glutamatergic mossy cells of the dentate gyrus. The maturation rate of newborn neurons in sandy (sdy) mice, in which both dysbindin-1A and -1C are deleted, is significantly delayed when compared with that in wild-type mice or with that in muted (mu) mice in which dysbindin-1A is destabilized but dysbindin-1C is unaltered. Dysbindin-1C deficiency leads to a decrease in mossy cells, which causes the delayed maturation of newborn neurons. This suggests that dysbindin-1C, rather than dysbindin-1A, regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a non-cell autonomous manner.",
