     "AB": "The gene expression of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaM kinase I) in the brain of developing and adult rats was examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry. During the development, CaM kinase I showed two chronological expression patterns; the persistent and relative high expression as observed in the olfactory bulb and cerebellar cortex, and the gradual decrease in the expression during the postnatal development as observed in most other brain regions. The gene expression was not detected in the germinal ventricular zone and cerebellar external granular layer. In the mature brain, CaM kinase I mRNA was expressed widely, though weakly in general, in almost all neurons, except for the olfactory bulb, cerebellum and hippocampus expressing at high intensity. These findings suggest that CaM kinase I may play a variety of neuronal Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated signaling processes in the developing and mature brains.",
