     "AB": "The ventral hippocampus (VH) may have an important role in spatial memory processes and emotional behaviors through connections with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and amygdala. Although the mPFC and amygdala receive afferent projections from the VH, it has not been determined whether the individual VH neurons project to both the mPFC and the amygdala. In this study, antidromic responses to the mPFC and amygdala stimulation were evoked in single VH neurons. In addition, VH neurons were retrogradely double-labeled with fluorescent tracers injected in the mPFC and amygdala. VH neurons projecting to both the mPFC and amygdala were predominantly located in the subiculum and CA1 and bifurcated near or at the soma. Our anatomical and electrophysiological evidence for the presence of VH neurons projecting to both the mPFC and amygdala provides a previously unrecognized pathway from the hippocampus that simultaneously activates the mPFC and amygdala.",
