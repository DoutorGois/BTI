     "AB": "A previous study showed that 1 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment did not lead to the any neuronal death/degeneration in the mouse hippocampus. In the present study, we examined the time-dependent changes of calbindin D-28k (CB) protein expression in the mouse hippocampus after a systemic administration of 1 mg/kg LPS. CB immunoreactivity was markedly increased in pyramidal cells of the hippocampal CA1/2 regions and in granule cells of the dentate gyrus from 3 hr to 48 hr after LPS treatment. At this point in time, CB protein level was also significantly increased in the mouse hippocampus. Thereafter, CB protein expression was decreased at 96 hr after LPS treatment. These results indicate that changes of CB protein expression may be associated with no neuronal death in the model of neuroinflammation with systemic administration of 1 mg/kg LPS.",
