     "AB": "Members of the striatin family are scaffolding proteins involved in numerous signaling pathways principally in neurons. Zinedin is the only member of this protein family for which the brain distribution has not been determined so far. Here, we have validated a specific antibody against zinedin and used this tool to study the localization of zinedin at cellular and sub-cellular levels in the rat brain. Zinedin is primarily expressed in neurons of the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb and caudate putamen nucleus. Like other members of the striatin family, zinedin displays a polarized distribution in the somato-dendritic compartment of neurons and is enriched in dendritic spines. The rostral expression of zinedin as well as its compartmented distribution in dendritic spines may have important implications not only for zinedin function but also in the physiology of dendritic spines of a particular subset of neurons.",
