     "AB": "Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) is known to influence a wide range of behaviors and physiological processes, but relatively little is known about events that trigger 5-HT release. To address this issue, we recorded from neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in rats performing an odor-guided spatial decision task. A large fraction of DRN neurons showed transient firing time locked to behavioral events on timescales as little as 20 ms. DRN transients were sometimes correlated with reward parameters, but also encoded specific sensorimotor events, including stimulus identity and response direction. These behavioral correlates were diverse but showed no apparent relationship with waveform or other firing properties indicative of neurochemical identity. These results suggest that the 5-HT system does not encode a unitary signal and that it will broadcast specific information to the forebrain with speed and precision sufficient not only to modulate but also to dynamically sculpt ongoing information processing.",
