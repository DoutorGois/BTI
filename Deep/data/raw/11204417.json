     "AB": "This study examined the cognitive effects of chronic in vivo exposure to beta-amyloid(1-40) via the intracerebroventricular route on two distinct paradigms. The first test evaluated a form of early attentional control referred to as sensorimotor gating in which an antecedent weak prepulse stimulus modulates the reactivity to a subsequent startle-eliciting stimulus. The second test utilized the spontaneous preference for a novel object over that of a familiar one in rats as a measure of object recognition memory. We found that beta-amyloid exposure leads to a severe deficit in the object memory test but spares sensorimotor gating. Moreover, unlike the water maze deficit induced by beta-amyloid (Nag et al., in preparation), the deficit on object recognition was resistant to amelioration by systemic physostigmine treatment at a dose of 0.06 mg/kg per day intraperitoneally. The present results add to previous reports that beta-amyloid exposure can lead to deficits on hippocampal lesion sensitive tasks, suggesting that dysfunction of the rhinal cortices in addition to that of the septohippocampal system is implicated in beta-amyloid-induced behavioral impairments. It therefore lends support to the hypothesis that beta-amyloid exposure can lead to severe impairment across multiple memory systems.",
