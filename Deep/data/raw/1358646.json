     "AB": "Slices of hippocampal area CA1 were employed to test the hypothesis that release of excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate is regulated by ethanol. K(+)-evoked release of glutamate and aspartate was inhibited by ethanol (25-100 mM) in a dose-dependent manner. Ethanol (100 mM) also inhibited K(+)-evoked gamma-aminobutyric acid release. This selective inhibition of excitatory amino acid release by ethanol may contribute to some of the learning and memory deficits associated with ethanol abuse, since excitatory amino acid receptors play an important role in synaptic plasticity processes.",
