ET-like immunoreactivity as a gold particles was localized in all compartments of the blood-brain barrier e.g. in endothelial cells, in pericytes, in periendothelial space including basement membrane, and in astroglial processes. In control animal the density of labelling in all elements of BBB in CA1 area of hippocampus was moderate. ET-like immunoreactivity (ET-like IR) was estimated 1 week-12 months after ischemia. Intense ET-like IR in all elements of BBB was noted 2 and 6 months after ischemia. A potential pathophysiological role of endothelin in cerebral vasospasm in long-time after ischemia is well documented.",
