     "AB": "Based on anatomical and biochemical observations a role of glutamate in schizophrenia has been postulated. In the present work we have investigated the gene expression for two families of NMDA receptor subunits (NR-1 and NR-2) following acute and chronic treatment with typical (haloperidol) and atypical (clozapine) antipsychotic drug (APD) in rats. A single injection of the two drugs elicited a significant increase in the mRNA levels of NR-2B in the nucleus accumbens, whereas only haloperidol was able to elevate NR-2A and NR-2B in the hippocampus. Following a 21 day treatment, significant differences in the regulatory pattern of NMDA-R subunits were observed. Haloperidol increased their mRNA levels in striatum whereas clozapine, consistent with its relatively weaker influence on nigro-striatal dopamine function, did not change the expression of NR subunits in this region. Both APD's were able to decrease the expression of NR-2 subunits in the hypothalamus, but only clozapine was capable of reducing NR-2C in frontal cortex and accumbens. The regulation of NMDA-R subunits in specific brain regions may represent a novel and important mechanism through which APD's exert some of their effects on brain function.",
