     "AB": "Activity-mediated gene expression is thought to play an important role in many forms of neuronal plasticities. We have used pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure that produces synchronous and sustained neuronal activity as a model to examine the mechanism(s) of gene activation. The transcription factor CREB (Ca2+/cAMP response element-binding protein) is thought to be necessary for long-term memory formation both in invertebrates and vertebrates. When phosphorylated on Ser133 either by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and/or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, CREB increases transcription of genes containing the CRE (cAMP response element) sequence. Using an antibody that detects Ser133-phosphorylated CREB protein, we show that CREB phosphorylation is maximal between 3 and 8 min after the onset of seizure activity and declines slowly both in the hippocampus and the cortex. The total amount of CREB protein did not change at the time points examined. The increased phosphorylation of CREB protein is preceded by an increase in the amount of cAMP, suggestive of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation, in the hippocampus and activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases in the cortex. Subsequent to CREB phosphorylation, the expression of the CRE-containing gene, c-fos, and the AP-1 complexes (heterodimers of Fos and Jun family members) is increased. These findings support the role of CREB-mediated gene expression in activity-dependent neuronal plasticities.",
