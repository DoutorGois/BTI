     "AB": "Gephyrin is a scaffold protein essential for stabilizing glycine and GABA(A) receptors at inhibitory synapses. Here, recombinant intrabodies against gephyrin (scFv-gephyrin) were used to assess whether this protein exerts a transynaptic action on GABA and glutamate release. Pair recordings from interconnected hippocampal cells in culture revealed a reduced probability of GABA release in scFv-gephyrin-transfected neurons compared with controls. This effect was associated with a significant decrease in VGAT, the vesicular GABA transporter, and in neuroligin 2 (NLG2), a protein that, interacting with neurexins, ensures the cross-talk between the post- and presynaptic sites. Interestingly, hampering gephyrin function also produced a significant reduction in VGLUT, the vesicular glutamate transporter, an effect accompanied by a significant decrease in frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. Overexpressing NLG2 in gephyrin-deprived neurons rescued GABAergic but not glutamatergic innervation, suggesting that the observed changes in the latter were not due to a homeostatic compensatory mechanism. Pulldown experiments demonstrated that gephyrin interacts not only with NLG2 but also with NLG1, the isoform enriched at excitatory synapses. These results suggest a key role of gephyrin in regulating transynaptic signaling at both inhibitory and excitatory synapses.",
