     "AB": "The extent of the infrapyramidal mossy fiber projection in CA3 (IIP-MF) at the midseptotemporal level correlates negatively with two-way avoidance learning and positively with performance in the radial maze, both tasks known to be sensitive to hippocampal lesions. If hippocampal structural variations are causing behavioral variations, one must predict positive correlations between the extent of the IIP-MF and performance in swimming navigation. Thus, the authors studied learning and reversal learning of swimming navigation in mice in which the size of the IIP-MF had been randomized by means of systematic crosses and in 2 mouse strains known for differential infrapyramidal projections (C57BL/6 and DBA/2). In 19 random-bred mice (9 male, 10 female), the extent of the IIP-MF showed negative correlations with swimming time after platform reversal (day 4: r = -0.50, P < .03; day 5 r = -0.73, P < .001), but none during acquisition of the task. In addition, statistical analysis suggested an influence of asymmetrically distributed mossy fiber projections during reversal learning. The strain comparison between 18 DBA/2 and 16 C57BL/6 male mice confirmed these results: no strain difference during days 1-3, and a significantly faster swimming time in the strain C57BL/6 (with large IIP-MF) at day 5 (second day of reversal), associated with significantly more crossings of the former platform location during the early phases of reversal learning. This latter measure was also negatively correlated with asymmetry of the IIP-MF in both strains. Finally, variations of the IIP-MF were correlated partially with adjustment of swimming speed that appeared to depend on size and asymmetry of CA4 as well. Thus, natural variations in the size of the IIP-MF distribution, and, perhaps, of CA4, appear to linearly influence processes directly involved in complex spatial learning.",
