     "AB": "Acute noise stress decreased [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine ([3H]5-HT) uptake in synaptosomes from rat hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The decrease was due to the maximum rate of [3H]5-HT uptake, which peaked 30 min after stress and partly returned to resting values within 4 h, with no changes in affinity (Km values). No changes in [3H]paroxetine binding and basal [3H]5-HT release were found in stressed rats. Tianeptine, given at the dose of 10 mg/kg 1 h before stress, counteracted the noise-induced decrease of 5-HT uptake, since it increased [3H]5-HT uptake in both resting and stressed animals, but did not prevent the rise in plasma corticosterone of stressed rats. Buspirone pretreatment had no effect on [3H]5-HT uptake in resting rats but prevented the noise-induced decrease in [3H]-HT uptake. Diazepam did not modify either the basal or the noise-induced reduction in [3H]5-HT uptake. The evidence that treatments reducing extrasynaptic 5-HT, by increasing its reuptake (tianeptine) or reducing its release (buspirone) in innervated regions are able to modify the stress-induced decrease in 5-HT uptake, further confirms the importance of serotonin in the mechanisms mediating neurochemical responses to stress.",
