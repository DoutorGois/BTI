     "PG": "35-48",
     "AB": "Spatial learning but not memory performance in the radial maze is disrupted by low doses of MK801 (0.0625 mg/kg ip), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channel blocker (M. L. Shapiro & C. O'Connor, 1992). The effect of this low dose of MK801 on hippocampal physiology and synaptic plasticity was assessed in 16 behaving female Sprague-Dawley rats. The drug increased the frequency (0.5 Hz), marginally reduced the amplitude of hippocampal rhythmical slow wave activity (RSA), did not alter non-RSA slow wave activity, and reduced normal synaptic transmission from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus by approximately 8%. Independent of these effects on normal physiology. MK-801 also reduced primed burst potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity produced by physiologically patterned stimulation, by approximately 20% in the same pathway. Thus, low doses of MK801 may impair spatial learning by reducing, directly or indirectly, the likelihood of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.",
