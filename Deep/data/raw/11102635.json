     "AB": "This manuscript delineates the territory of the anterior choroidal artery (AChA) in rats, as defined by the induction of an AChA infarction. By advancing a 0.24-mm surgical suture up the internal carotid artery (ICA) to a point 0.5-2 mm proximal to the middle cerebral artery (MCA) origin, the AChA could be occluded and a reliable AChA distribution infarction was produced in 62% (23/37) of animals. The infarct volume, as defined by TTC staining, was 55+/-7 mm(3). Maps of the infarction, generated by measuring the entire area of overlapping coronal slices, demonstrated that the internal capsule was always damaged. Other areas that might be affected included the hippocampus, thalamus, amygdaloid complex, piriform cortex, dorsal caudatoputamen, and lateral ventricular wall. Positioning the coated suture proximal to the AChA produced a much smaller infarct involving the medial and lateral hypothalamus, preoptic region, optic chiasm, and marginal region of the internal capsule near to the lateral hypothalamus exempt from AChA territory damage. A causative relationship between AChA occlusion and a deep cerebral infarct centered on the internal capsule was further established by: (1) identifying the AChA on the non-ischemic side with colored silicone perfusion, and subsequent similar delineation on the ischemic side, and (2) delineating infarction in the silicone perfused AChA region using hematoxylin and eosin staining and the TUNEL method. The AChA usually originated from the ICA (91% of cases), 1.75+/-0.12 mm proximal to the MCA bifurcation. Approximately 27% of the AChAs had periamygdaloid branch(es) on its initial segment.",
