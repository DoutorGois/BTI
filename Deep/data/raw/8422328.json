Complications and rates of incidence are discussed, and compared with the existing literature regarding children, adolescents and adults. No deaths or permanent disabling complications were incurred. Minor morbidity was minimal: 2 (4.2%) sustained permanent but nondisabling complications while an additional 3 (6.4%) incurred transient neurologic deficits which resolved rapidly. Epilepsy surgery in children and adolescents is safe, highly effective, and underutilized.",
