Predominant activation of the right hippocampus and right amygdala during perception and memorizing of visual picturesque images and solving the tasks provoking emotional stress, apparently, concerns the functional specialization of the right hemisphere in general. The leading role of the left hypothalamus in provocation of food, sexual, and defensive responses was experimentally verified. This finding is in line with the functional role of the left hemisphere in genesis of motivational states.",
