     "AB": "The tissue distribution of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) was investigated in rats at 1 month of age using a newly established, sensitive two-site enzyme immunoassay system for NT-3, as well as the immunocytochemical localization of this protein. The immunoassay for NT-3 enabled us to quantify NT-3 at levels > 3 pg per assay. In the rat brain, NT-3 was detectable only in the olfactory bulb (0.54 ng/g wet weight), cerebellum (0.71 ng/g), septum (0.91 ng/g), and hippocampus (6.3 ng/g). By contrast, NT-3 was widely distributed in peripheral tissues. Appreciable levels of NT-3 were also found in the thymus (31 ng/g), heart (38 ng/g), diaphragm (21 ng/g), liver (45 ng/g), pancreas (892 ng/g), spleen (133 ng/g), kidney (40 ng/g), and adrenal gland (46 ng/g). An antibody specific for NT-3 bound to pyramidal cells in the CA2-CA4 regions of the hippocampus, to A cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, to unidentified cells in the red pulp of the spleen, to liver cells, and to muscle fibers in the diaphragm from rats at 1 month of age. Molecular masses of NT-3-immunoreactive proteins in the hippocampus and pancreas were 14 and 12 kDa, respectively. Thus, in rats, NT-3 was detected in restricted regions of the brain and in the visceral targets of the nodose ganglia at high concentrations. Our present results suggest that NT-3 not only functions as a classical target-derived neurotrophic factor but also can play other roles.",
