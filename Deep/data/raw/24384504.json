     "AB": "Protein phosphorylation is known to regulate synaptic plasticity and memory. Protein kinases including protein kinase A and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) play important roles in these processes. Forskolin, a protein kinase A activator, induces long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. Forskolin also induces ERK activation, which plays important roles in LTP. However, the mechanisms of forskolin-induced ERK activation are not clearly understood. Here we show that forskolin induces sustained ERK activation in the hippocampal slices. Further, blockade of protein synthesis or transcription inhibits forskolin-induced sustained ERK activation. In contrast, forskolin-induced immediate ERK activation is unaffected by inhibition of protein synthesis or transcription. Sustained ERK activation may contribute to forskolin-induced LTP in the hippocampus.",
