     "AB": "We have recently cloned a novel Doublecortin CaMK-like kinase (rDCAMKL) cDNA, and a related cDNA called CaMK-related peptide (CARP) from the rat hippocampus. These genes are structurally highly similar to the human DCAMKL-1 gene and doublecortin, a gene associated with X-linked lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia. Here we report on the genomic organization of the murine DCAMKL gene and its products. Our results show that DCAMKL and CARP are alternative splice products of the same gene. The DCAMKL gene also generates three alternatively-spliced rDCAMKL transcripts of which we have cloned the corresponding cDNAs and which potentially generate different DCAMKL proteins. In situ hybridization experiments show that the different rDCAMKL transcripts are all expressed in the adult rat hippocampus. We conclude that alternative splicing of the DCAMKL gene may generate different but similar proteins in the adult rat hippocampus thereby regulating different but overlapping aspects of DCAMKL controlled neuronal plasticity.",
