     "AB": "The acquisition of a water maze based task requiring egocentric spatial orientation in the absence of distal cues was studied in four groups of rats: animals in which the fimbria-fornix had been transected, rats that received bilateral ablations of the anteromedial prefrontal cortex, animals in which both of these structures had been lesioned, and a sham-operated control group. Isolated lesions of both the anteromedial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus were associated with a significantly impaired task acquisition. Both of these individually lesioned groups did, however, eventually demonstrate full functional recovery by reaching the task proficiency of the sham-operated control group. In contrast, the group in which both of these structures had been lesioned failed to demonstrate full functional recovery and was severely and long-lastingly impaired when compared to all other groups. Behavioural challenges in the form of a no-platform session and two reversals of platform position demonstrated that while the sham-operated control group and the group subjected to fimbria-fornix transections in isolation utilized rather pure egocentric orientation strategies, the two prefrontally lesioned groups (and especially the combined lesion group) employed a different set of solution strategies which at least partly relied on a \"circling\" method. Even in the behaviour of the prefrontally lesioned groups, however, indications of a certain level of cognitive representations of the platform positions were seen. It is concluded that both the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus contribute to the mediation of egocentric spatial orientation. Furthermore, the hippocampus is a significant and potentially irreplaceable part of the neural substrate of functional recovery of the presently studied task after prefrontal lesions--while the prefrontal cortex may play a similar role with respect to hippocampal lesions.",
