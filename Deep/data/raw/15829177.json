     "AB": "Adenosine's role in the nervous system is multifaceted. As the core molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine exists in equilibrium with the adenine nucleotide pool and contributes to cellular energy charge, a quantification of relative amounts of available ATP, ADP, AMP and adenosine. Beyond participating in overall energy balance and thus in maintaining cellular homeostasis, adenosine critically influences dynamic signaling in the nervous system. In particular, adenosine has an effect on and is affected by excitatory synaptic transmission. This report describes the ubiquitous nature of adenosine's influence, outlines specific scenarios of clinical import and highlights emerging knowledge about the regulation of adenosine.",
