     "AB": "PURPOSE: To analyze the characteristics of neuropsychological profiles and gray matter volume in de novo, drug-naive Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). METHODS: Fifty-two newly diagnosed PD patients were assessed with neuropsychological testing, and PD-MCI was defined in patients with at least one or more abnormal cognitive test domains. PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) did not meet the criteria for PD-MCI or PD with dementia. Brain MRI scans was acquired from the patients and healthy controls (HC). The imaging processing and analysis of the gray matter (GM) volume were performed platform to determine the difference between PD-MCI and PD-NC. RESULTS: There were no differences of motor subscores between PD-MCI and PD-NC. The clinical dementia rating, global deterioration scale, and verbal memory were significantly worse in PD-MCI than in PD-NC. GM volume loss was observed in the right hippocampus, right cuneus, and right precuneus in PD-NC compared to in the HC. PD-MCI had significantly decreased GM volume in the bilateral temporal and frontal areas compared with that of the HC. The GM volume was significantly decreased in the right temporal pole, left precuneus, medial frontal and posterior cingulated gyrus in PD-MCI compared with PD-NC. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical dementia ratings and global deterioration scales could differentiate PD-MCI from PD-NC. Verbal memory impairment is characterized as a cognitive deficit of de novo PD-MCI and is associated with the posterior cortical area.",
