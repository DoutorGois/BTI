     "AB": "pGlu-Asn-Cys (Cys)-Pro-Arg-Gly-NH(2) (AVP(4-9)), a major metabolite C-terminal fragment of Arginine(8)-vasopressin (AVP), improves the disruption of the learning and memory, and is a far more potent in the mnemonic function than AVP. In this study, we pharmacologically characterized its putative binding site and mechanism of intracellular signaling. Radioligand binding assay showed that [35S]AVP(4-9) could detect specific binding sites in the rat hippocampus membrane preparations, and the binding site was specifically displaced by AVP(4-9) but not by either V(1) or V(2) antagonists. Furthermore, [35S]AVP(4-9) could not detect the cloned rat V(1a), V(1b) and V(2) vasopressin receptors. Even at a low doses (10-100 pM), AVP(4-9) caused an increase in both inositol(1,4, 5)-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P(3)) and intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) in rat hippocampal cells. The AVP(4-9)-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase was partially inhibited by the absence of Ca(2+) or by Ca(2+)-channel blocker, suggesting that AVP(4-9) caused the [Ca(2+)](i) increase via release from intracellular calcium store as well as influx from extracellular calcium. For the first time, this study provides evidence to show that AVP(4-9) activates Ins(1,4,5)P(3)/[Ca(2+)](i) pathway through a novel type of receptor in rat hippocampus, which might be potentially important in improving the mnemonic function.",
