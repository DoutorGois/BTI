     "AB": "Protein synthesis at synaptic terminals contributes to LTP in hippocampus and to the formation of new synaptic connections by sensory neurons (SNs) of Aplysia. Here we report that after removal of the SN cell body, isolated SN synapses of Aplysia in culture express protein-synthesis dependent long-term facilitation (LTF) produced by 5-HT that decays rapidly. Changes in expression of a SN-specific neuropeptide sensorin in isolated SN varicosities parallel the changes in synaptic efficacy. At 24 h after 5-HT the magnitude of LTF produced at isolated SN synapses was significantly greater than that produced when SN cell bodies were present. LTF was maintained at 48 h at connections with SN cell bodies, but not at isolated SN synapses. The increase in synaptic efficacy at isolated SN synapses at 24 h was blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. LTF was accompanied by changes in expression of sensorin. The increase in sensorin level at isolated SN varicosities with 5-HT was blocked by anisomycin or was reversed 48 h after 5-HT treatment alone. The results suggest that, as is the case for initial synapse formation between SNs and L7, changes in protein synthesis at synaptic terminals may contribute directly to LTF of stable synapses. Changes in expression within the cell body provide additional contributions for long-term maintenance of the new level of synaptic efficacy that was initiated directly by local changes in protein synthesis at or near synaptic terminals.",
