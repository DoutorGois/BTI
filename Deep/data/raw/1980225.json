     "AB": "A selective loss of somatostatin (SS)-containing neurons in the hilar region has been reported in patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy. Conversely, neurons containing calcium-binding proteins such as parvalbumin (PARV) are known to be very resistant under experimental seizure conditions. In this study, we analyzed the coexistence of SS and PARV in neurons of the rat fascia dentata by using serial semi-thin cryostat sections for pre-embedding immunocytochemistry. Our results show that only 5.7% of the SS-immunoreactive hilar neurons contain PARV. The data suggest that SS-containing hilar neurons are less protected against seizure-induced calcium overload than other neurons containing calcium-binding proteins.",
