     "AB": "Quantitative in situ hybridization analysis of catalytic (trkB TK+) and non-catalytic (trkB TK-) trkB mRNAs in the postnatal rat brain demonstrated regional differences in expression and revealed transient increases in trkB TK+ expression. Hybridization of trkB TK+ mRNA was observed in thalamic nuclei between P4 and P8, but not in the adult. In hippocampal structures, transient elevations of trkB TK+ mRNA were apparent between P13 and P17. In contrast, there was a gradual developmental increase in trkB TK- mRNA expression in the hippocampus.",
