     "AB": "Progressive increases in the worldwide number of cases of brain diseases accompanied by cognitive impairments continually reinforce the relevance of the need for further investigation and pharmacotherapy of this type of neuromental pathology, particularly as this problem has great significance, not only in the medical sphere, but also in the social. This explains the currently extensive interest of investigators of different specialties in studies of the role of the hippocampus (HPO) in the genesis of these disorders and the possibility that nootropic substances have influences on it.",
