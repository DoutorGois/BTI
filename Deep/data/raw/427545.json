     "AB": "The ontogenic development of hemicholinium-sensitive, high affinity choline uptake and the synthesis of acetylcholine from exogenous choline have been studied in particulate preparations of the rat fascia dentata. Between 6 days of age and adulthood the rate of high affinity choline uptake increases 3-fold, when expressed with respect to protein, and 125-fold, when expressed independently of protein. This process develops most rapidly during the period around 16-17 days of age, similar to the ontogenesis of choline acetyltransferase activity. This observation supports the idea that cholinergic septohippocampal boutons develop mainly at this time. Unlike choline acetyltransferase activity, the velocity of high affinity choline uptake increases to as much as 161% of the adult value at about 30 days of age. It is suggested that at 25-31 days of age a relatively high endogenous septohippocampal firing rate increases the rate of choline uptake. At 6 days of age we detected no synthesis of acetylcholine from the accumulated choline. Uptake-synthesis coupling develops mainly between 6 and 13 days of age, earlier than any other presynaptic cholinergic property. Acetylcholine synthesis from exogenous choline develops in paralled with high affinity choline uptake, but developmental increases in uptake velocity result in comparable increases in synthesis rate only after a delay of several days. Some limiting factor other than choline acetyltransferase activity appears to link the accumulation of exogenous choline to acetylcholine synthesis during development.",
