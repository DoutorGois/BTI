     "AB": "AIM: To study the protective effects of phenolic alkaloids from Menispermum dauricum (PAMd) on inflammatory injury following focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats. METHODS: The right middle cerebral artery of the rat was occluded by inserting a nylon suture through the internal carotid artery for 2 h, followed by reperfusion by withdrawing the suture. The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was observed by immunohistochemistry staining. The adhesiveness and infiltration of leucocytes were observed by HE staining. The activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the content of nitric oxide (NO) in the cortex and hippocampus were measured. RESULTS: PAMd was shown to markedly inhibit ICAM-1 expression, alleviate the adhesiveness and infiltration of leucocytes, and decrease the MPO activity and the NO content in ischemic cortex and hippocampus. CONCLUSION: PAMd has protective effects on inflammatory injury following focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion by inhibiting ICAM-1 expression, alleviating the adhesiveness and infiltration of leucocytes and decreasing the generation of NO.",
