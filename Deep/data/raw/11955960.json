     "AB": "The finding of pyramidal cell disarray in the hippocampus of patients with schizophrenia has been disputed by several groups. Conflicting results have been attributed to differences in the subtype of patients used, staining method, the side of the hippocampus studied and the way cellular disarray has been measured. In the present study, we correct for these confounds by using a well-defined population of schizophrenic patients (n = 14) and controls (n = 10) in which Golgi impregnated material was available. Measurements were performed manually according to the method of Kovelman and Scheibel (1984). Pyramidal cell disarray for the CA1/prosubicular interface indicated significant differences between patients and controls (p = 0.0183). The findings were attributed to a bias accrued to referencing measurements in schizophrenics to the distorted circumventricular surface of the temporal horn.",
