The use of a new antagonist (LY341495) that blocks all known metabotropic L-glutamate receptors in the brain, together with subtype-selective antagonists, has identified multiple roles both for cloned and novel metabotropic L-glutamate receptors in hippocampal long-term potentiation and long-term depression.",
