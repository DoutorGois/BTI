     "AB": "For more than 30 years, a growing number of researchers have been attracted to the challenge of understanding the neurobiological organization of the avian hippocampal formation (HF) and its relationship to the remarkable spatial cognitive abilities of birds. In this selective review, we highlight recent anatomical and developmental findings that reveal a HF design that defies any simple comparison to the mammalian hippocampus and leaves unanswered the seemingly enduring question of whether a dentate gyrus homologue is to be found in HF. From a functional perspective, we highlight the recent discoveries that implicate HF in the use of space for memory pattern segregation and continued interest in the role HF neurogenesis may play in supporting memory function and its relationship to memory decline in aging birds. We also summarize data that nurture a fundamental reinterpretation of the role of HF in spatial cognition by suggesting HF involvement in spatial perception antecedent to any memory formation. Given the disproportionate adaptive significance of space for birds, which has led to the evolution of their exceptional navigational and memory abilities, there is little doubt that the avian HF will continue to provide important and unexpected insights into the neural basis of spatial cognition.",
