     "AB": "The two beta-adrenoceptor agonists salbutamol and clenbuterol have been shown to be effective antidepressant drugs. Flerobuterol, a new beta-adrenoceptor agonist, exhibits antidepressant activity in animal models. Given the long-standing notion that the serotonergic (5-HT) system might be involved in the etiology and/or the therapeutics of affective disorders and that this class of adrenergic agents can alter factors regulating 5-HT transmission, the effects of acute and repeated administrations of flerobuterol on the 5-HT system were studied. Acute administration of flerobuterol (up to 2 mg/kg, IV) did not modify the firing rate of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons. However, the sustained administration of flerobuterol for two days (0.5 mg/kg/day, SC. delivered by an osmotic minipump) produced a marked decrease of the firing rate of 5-HT neurons. The reversal of this effect of flerobuterol by the somatodendritic 5-HT autoreceptor antagonist spiperone suggests that this decrease in the firing activity of 5-HT neurons in rats treated for 2 days with flerobuterol resulted from an enhanced synaptic availability of 5-HT. This initial decrease in firing activity of 5-HT neurons was followed by a progressive recovery to normal after 14 days of treatment with flerobuterol. At this point in time, the effect of intravenous lysergic acid diethylamide on the firing of 5-HT neurons was attenuated, indicating that the somatodendritic 5-HT autoreceptors had desensitized. The effectiveness of the electrical stimulation of the ascending 5-HT pathway in suppressing the firing activity of dorsal hippocampus pyramidal neurons was markedly enhanced in rats treated with flerobuterol for 14 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
