     "AB": "To evaluate the significance of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated active efflux on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of cyclosporin A (CsA) in vivo, we investigated the effects of ATP depletion in the brain and of a multidrug-resistant (MDR) reversing agent on the transport of CsA across the BBB. Using transient brain ischemia obtained by 4-vessel occlusion of vertebral and common carotid arteries in rats to deplete ATP content in the brain, the estimated permeability surface area product (PS) value of [3H]CsA was increased 2.7-fold compared with that in normal rats, whereas the PS value of [14C]sucrose was not altered. Additionally, when quinidine hydrochloride (QND) was infused into the brain through a microdialysis probe implanted in the rat hippocampus, the extravascular extraction of CsA was increased to approximately 2.5-fold of the control, whereas no difference in the extravascular extraction between control and normal rats having no implanted dialysis probe was observed. Furthermore, the efflux rate from brain to blood of CsA was decreased remarkably to 5% of control at steady-state by co-administration of CsA with QND directly into the brain through the dialysis probe. The ATP-dependent and QND-sensitive efflux of CsA from the brain strongly indicates that P-gp in the brain capillary endothelial cells functions as an efflux pump under the physiological state, and that P-gp-mediated efflux of CsA is a major mechanism of the restricted transfer from blood into the brain.",
