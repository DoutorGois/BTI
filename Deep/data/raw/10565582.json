     "AB": "PURPOSE: Gamma knife radiosurgery (GK) allows precise and complete destruction of chosen target structures containing healthy and/or pathologic cells, without significant concomitant or late radiation damage to adjacent tissues. All the well-documented radiosurgery of epilepsy cases are epilepsies associated with tumors or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Results prompted the idea to test radiosurgery as a new way of treating epilepsy without space-occupying lesions. METHODS: To evaluate this new method, we selected seven patients with drug-resistant \"mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\" (MTLE). The preoperative evaluation program was the one we usually perform for patients selected for microsurgery of TLE [video-EEG analysis of seizures, foramen ovale electrode recording, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) positron emission tomography (PET) scan, neuropsychological testing]. In lieu of microsurgery, the amygdalohippocampectomy was performed by using GK radiosurgery. RESULTS: Morphologic (MRI) signs of destruction of the target took place at 9 months after GK surgery. Since the treatment day, the first patient has been seizure free. Seizure improvement came more gradually for the following patients, and complete cessation of seizures occurred around the tenth month (range, 8-15 months). MRI shows that the amygdaloentorhinohippocampal target was selectively injured. No significant side effect (except one case of homologous quadrantanopia) or morbidity and no mortality was observed. The current follow-up is 24-61 months, and all (but one) patients are seizure free. CONCLUSIONS: This initial experience proves clearly the short-to middle-term efficiency and safety of GK for MTLE surgery. These results need further confirmation of long-term efficiency, but the introduction of GK surgery into epilepsy surgery can reduce dramatically its invasiveness and morbidity.",
