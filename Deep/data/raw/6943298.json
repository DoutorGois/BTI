     "AB": "Estrone sulphatase, arylsulphatase C and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphatase were measured in the pituitary, hypothalamus-preoptic area, amygdala, hippocampus, midbrain, septum, frontal cortex and occipital cortex of monkey (Macaca radiata) brain. All the regions showed measurable activities of all three enzymes. In all the animals tested, either the midbrain or hypothalamus-preoptic area showed the greatest activity of all three enzymes. In particular, estrone sulphatase showed the highest specific activity in either of the above two regions in all animals. Subcellular distribution studies in the hypothalamus preoptic area showed a similarity in the distribution profile between arylsulphatase C and estrone sulphatase and a significant difference of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphatase from the others.",
