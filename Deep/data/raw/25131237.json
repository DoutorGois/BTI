     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Replacement of spiral ganglion neurons would be one prioritized step in an attempt to restore sensory neuronal hearing loss. However, the possibility that transplanted neurons could regenerate new synaptic connections to hair cells has not been explored. The objective of this study was to test whether neural stem cell (NSC)-derived neurons can form synaptic connections with hair cells in vitro. METHODS: NSCs were mechanically separated from the hippocampus in SD rat embryos (E12-E14) and cultured in a serum-free medium containing basic fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor. Rat NSCs were co-cultured with explants of cochlea sensory epithelia obtained from postnatal Day 3 rats under transway filter membrane. RESULTS: At Day 3, the NSCs began to show chemotactic differentiation and grew toward cochlea sensory epithelia. After 9-day co-culture, neurites of NSC-derived neurons predominantly elongated toward hair cells. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed the fibers overlapped with synapsin and hair cells, indicating the formation of new synaptic connections. After 14-day culture, triple staining revealed the fibers overlapped with PSD95 (postsynaptic density) which is juxtaposed with CtBP2 (presynaptic vesicle), indicating the formation of new ribbon synapse. CONCLUSIONS: NSC-derived neurons can make synaptic connections with hair cells and provide a model for studying synaptic plasticity and regeneration. Whether the newly forming synapse is functional merits further electrophysiological study.",
