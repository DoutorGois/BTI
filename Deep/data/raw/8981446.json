     "AB": "Using an in situ patch clamp in hippocampal CA1 mini-slices, we measured excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) by varying the strength of the stimulus applied to the axons of CA3 neurones. The kinetics of the EPSC was initially independent of the stimulus strength. Post-ischaemic potentiation of the EPSC was observed 60-80 min after brief periods (10 min) of anoxia/aglycaemia. The decay of the EPSC slowed significantly in most of the examined neurones. In 11 of 17 cells the EPSC kinetics became dependent on stimulus strength: a slower decay corresponded to a stronger stimulus. This effect was not abolished by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or a non-NMDA receptor blocker (D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid or 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione respectively) indicating the polysynaptic nature of the modified EPSC: transient ischaemia led to the long-term recruitment of previously inactive, possibly latent NMDA synapses between CA1 neurones.",
