     "AB": "p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that regulates many cellular processes including the cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis. It also serves as a critical regulator of neuronal apoptosis in the central nervous system (CNS). To elucidate the role of p53 in the CNS, brain proteins of p53 knock-out mice (p53-/-) were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and compared with those from p53 wild type (p53+/+) mice. Six types of brain tissue (temporal cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, olfactory bulb, and cervical spinal cord) and other control tissues (lung and blood) from 18-week-old non-stress-induced mice were analyzed. The morphology of brains from p53-/- mice appeared to be normal and identical to that of p53+/+ mice, although lungs showed diffuse tumors that may have been caused by p53 deficiency. Comparative 2-D gel analysis showed that, on average, 7 of 886 spots from brain tissue were p53-/- specific, whereas 12 of 1008 spots from lung tissue were p53-/- specific. N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined for p53-/- specific proteins. In all brain tissues from p53-/- mice, a newly identified mouse mitochondrial NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 24 kDa subunit showed decreased expression, and apolipoprotein A1 acidic forms showed increased expression. In addition, brain-type creatine kinase B chain and tubulin beta-5 N-terminal fragment were increased in the p53-/- cerebellum, and a new protein in mouse, hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase (glyoxalase II) was decreased in the temporal cortex of p53-/- mice. The alterations in protein expression identified in this study may imply a p53-related brain function. This is the first proteomic analysis on the p53-/- mouse brain, and further information based on this study will provide new insights into the p53 function in the CNS.",
