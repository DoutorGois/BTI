     "AB": "Astrocytes are known to express several growth factors in response to injury and neurological disease. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) induces astrocytes to divide in vitro and is expressed by developing, but not adult astrocytes both in vivo and in vitro. We tested whether IGF-I is re-expressed by reactive astrocytes in response to injury. We found that astrocytes surrounding the lesioned parenchyma after introduction of a cannula through the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and midbrain contain high levels of immunoreactive IGF-I, as determined by immunocytochemistry using a highly sensitive and specific anti-IGF-I monoclonal antibody. Interestingly, the contralateral hippocampus also contained IGF-I positive astrocytes although in substantial lower numbers. Intact animals showed no detectable IGF-I immunoreactivity in astrocytes. IGF-I was detected at the first time point tested after the lesion was made, 1 week, and for at least 1 month thereafter. Reactive astrocytes expressing high levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein were found in a much wider distribution all along the lesioned area and beyond. We conclude that mechanical injury of the brain induces a specific pattern of expression of IGF-I by a subpopulation of astrocytes. These findings suggest that IGF-I is participating in the response of astrocytes to injury.",
