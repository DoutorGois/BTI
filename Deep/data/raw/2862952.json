     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease or senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized pathologically by two types of microscopic lesions in the neocortex: the neurofibrillary tangle and neuritic plaque. The concentration of neuritic plaques is correlated with significant reductions in the level of specific neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems in autopsied brains of patients with SDAT, including decreased amounts of the tetradecapeptide, somatostatin. The clinical effects of reduced cortical somatostatin activity in patients with SDAT is unclear, nor is it known whether somatostatinergic neurons participate in either lesion. In the present study we employed light microscopic immunocytochemistry to determine whether somatostatin-containing neurons participate in the formation of neuritic plaques. Examination of selected cortical regions from autopsied brains revealed 20-50% of all neuritic plaques contained somatostatin-positive profiles indicating that processes of somatostatinergic neurons are associated with neuritic plaque formation.",
