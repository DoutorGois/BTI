     "AB": "Flavonoids and monophenolic compounds have been well described in recent years as antioxidants and scavengers of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the effects of long-term administration of ferulic acid on the centrally administered beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta)(1-42)-induced activation of microglial cells in mice. Abeta(1-42) increased the immunoreactivity of OX-42, a microglial marker, and interferon-gamma in the hippocampus at 8 h after the intracerebroventricular injection. The effects were suppressed by long-term (4-week) pretreatment with ferulic acid. This inhibition of microglial cell activation may underlie the beneficial effects of long-term administration of ferulic acid on Abeta(1-42)-induced toxicity in vivo.",
