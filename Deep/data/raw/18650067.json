     "AB": "PURPOSE: Anatomical localization of the cortical effect of lamotrigine (LTG) in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). METHODS: 19 patients with untreated IGE were investigated. EEG was recorded in the untreated condition and 3 months later when LTG treatment abolished the seizures. 19-channel EEG was recorded, and a total of 2min artifact-free, waking EEG was processed to low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) analysis. Activity (that is, current source density, A/m(2)) was computed in four frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta), for 2394 voxels that represented the cortical gray matter and the hippocampi. Group differences between the untreated and treated conditions were computed for the four bands and all voxels by multiple t-tests for interdependent datasets. The results were presented in terms of anatomical distribution and statistical significance. RESULTS: p<0.01 (uncorrected) changes (decrease of activity) emerged in the theta and the alpha bands. Theta activity decreased in a large cluster of voxels including parts of the temporal, parietal, occipital cortex bilaterally, and in the transverse temporal gyri, insula, hippocampus, and uncus on the right side. Alpha activity decreased in a relatively smaller cortical area involving the right temporo-parietal junction and surrounding parts of the cortex, and part of the insula on the right side. CONCLUSIONS: LTG decreased theta activity in several cortical areas where abnormally increased theta activity had been found in a prior study in another cohort of untreated IGE patients [Clemens, B., Bessenyei, M., Piros, P., Toth, M., Seress, L., Kondakor, I., 2007b. Characteristic distribution of interictal brain electrical activity in idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Epilepsia 48, 941-949]. These LTG-related changes might be related to the decrease of seizure propensity in IGE.",
