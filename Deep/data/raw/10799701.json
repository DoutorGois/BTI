     "AB": "The transient property of the dipyridamole-induced depression of excitatory synaptic transmission was analyzed using field EPSPs (fEPSPs) recorded from the CA1 region in rat hippocampal slices. The fEPSPs were depressed by 1 microM dipyridamole and then gradually recovered to the control level. The depression was antagonized by aminophylline or DPCPX, although it was not significantly affected by DMPX. The results suggest that the fEPSP depression is induced by a mechanism through the A(1) receptor.",
