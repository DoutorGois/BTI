     "AB": "Tianeptine is an atypical tricyclic antidepressant that facilitates serotonin (5-HT) reuptake. Tianeptine (10 mg/kg) or saline was administered intraperitoneally to male rats daily for 4 days. Monoamine levels were measured in micropunches of discrete brain nuclei that are implicated in mood and cognition. In addition, the rates of 5-HT and norepinephrine (NE) accumulation were determined by the pargyline method. Few changes were noted in the 5-HT system. 5-HT levels were increased by short-term tianeptine in the CA3 region of hippocampus, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was increased in the ventromedial nucleus of hypothalamus, while 5-HT turnover was decreased in preoptic area (POA). In addition, short-term tianeptine treatment increased NE levels in POA, parietal sensory cortex (SCTX) and dorsal raphe (DR), and decreased NE in dentate gyrus. NE turnover was also decreased in DR, SCTX and parietal motor cortex. These data suggest that the short-term neural and behavioral actions of tianeptine may be attributable, in part, to alterations of the norepinephrine system.",
