     "AB": "Lack of dystrophin in brain structures have been involved with impaired cognitive functions. Acethylcolinesterase (AChE) is implicated in many cognitive functions and probably plays important roles in neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, we investigated AChE activity in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cortex of mdx mice. To this aim, brain tissues from male dystrophic mdx and normal control mice were used. We observed that mdx mice display a reduction in AChE activity of 40-60% in all brain structures evaluated. In conclusion, dystrophin deficiency may be affecting AChE activity and contributing negatively, in part, to memory storage and restoring.",
