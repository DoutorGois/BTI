     "AB": "The ability of increases in extracellular potassium ([K+]o) and/or decreases in extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]o) to induce epileptiform activity in hippocampal slices was studied by systematically varying [K+]o and [Ca2+]o. Slices prepared from kindled rats, both 1 week and 1 month after the last kindled seizure, showed an increased sensitivity to perturbations of both ions. Stimulus-locked epileptiform discharges occurred with small displacements of [K+]o and/or [Ca2+]o. The ionic threshold for spontaneous epileptiform discharges was not significantly affected. This long-lasting change in sensitivity to the ionic environment produced by the kindling process had important implications for epileptogenesis in chronically epileptic tissue.",
