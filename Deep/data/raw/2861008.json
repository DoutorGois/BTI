     "AB": "A number of studies have found that the peri-natal exposure of rodents to diazepam alters their adult behaviour. Adult male mice, treated with diazepam or appropriate controls during pregnancy, were examined in terms of their ability to learn a radial maze. Those animals receiving diazepam prior, but not after birth, learnt the maze significantly more rapidly. The results are discussed in terms of the possible involvement of the hippocampus in this influence of diazepam.",
