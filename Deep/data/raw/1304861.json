Regional differences in NGF-like immunoreactivity were observed. Highest levels were found in hippocampus (148 pg/g) compared to putamen (76 pg/g) and frontal cortex (34 pg/g). In addition, these results suggest differences in the distribution of brain NGF between human and rodent, where relatively high levels of NGF are found in the cortex.",
