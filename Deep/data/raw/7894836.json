     "AB": "The immature central nervous system (CNS) is more susceptible to the development of seizures than its adult counterpart. Developmental studies of experimental seizures have suggested that young animals have unique behavioural seizure patterns, including the presence of bilateral, though asymmetric, convulsions. There are differences in the mechanisms responsible for the generation of seizures, propagation patterns and seizure arrest and recurrences. These differences are due to local factors as well as factors that affect neural systems consisting of long neuronal circuits. The substantia nigra, a site involved in the control of seizures, will be used as an example to demonstrate how evolving neurobiological processes modulates the suppression or exacerbation of seizures with age. Evidence will also be presented indicating that early in life, seizures may not produce hippocampal damage. An understanding of the age-related differences is important for the development of rational approaches to treating seizures and their consequences.",
