     "AB": "Age-related spatial memory deficits are correlated with septohippocampal cholinergic system degeneration. The present study examined the effect of intraseptal infusions of the cholinergic agonist, oxotremorine, on spatial reference memory in middle-aged rats using place discrimination in the water maze, and on cholinergic activity using choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity. Oxotremorine mildly improved the rate of place discrimination acquisition of middle-aged rats during initial sessions only, but did not affect asymptotic levels of performance achieved. Of the brain regions assayed, ChAT activity increased with age in the temporal cortex and dorsal CA2/3 region of the hippocampus. Oxotremorine significantly decreased ChAT activity in the dorsal hippocampus. In contrast to our previous results in aged rats indicating a more robust effect of oxotremorine on spatial working memory, the present results suggest a modest effect of intraseptal oxotremorine on the acquisition of a spatial reference memory task.",
