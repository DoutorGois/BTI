     "AB": "We previously reported that a cyclic octapeptide amide, c[D-Cys29, Cys-34]NPY Ac-29-36 (YM-42454) showed a high affinity for Y1-receptors in SK-N-MC cells (Ki=0.047,microM) but not for Y2-receptors in the porcine hippocampus membranes (Ki>10microM). To explore the critical residues of this unique cyclic peptide for Y1-binding activity, the structure-affinity relationships were investigated by means of amino acid replacement. The results indicated that the hydrophobic side-chains of Leu30 and Ile31, the guanidinium groups of Arg33 and Arg33, and the C-terminal amide are critical for the binding affinity of YM-42454 to the Y1-receptor. On the other hand, Thr32 in YM-42454 might not be critical for the Y1-binding affinity. 1H-NMR studies for YM-42454 and its derivatives have suggested that the critical residues are involved in the direct interaction with a Y1-receptor rather than in maintaining the bioactive conformation.",
