She states she 'feels weird' before each episode. Her partner describes that she becomes verbally unresponsive, licks her lips, and makes other strange movements with her mouth. They usually last several minutes, after which she appears quite drowsy for half an hour. She recalls nothing of the event itself. Examination findings are normal. You take blood tests and arrange for an electroencephalogram.",
