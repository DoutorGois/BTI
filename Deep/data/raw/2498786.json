     "AB": "Both caudate nucleus (CN) and substantia nigra (SN) appear to be involved in the control of epileptogenic events. Previous investigations had demonstrated that both CN and SN stimulations are able to induce hippocampal theta (theta) rhythm and an inhibition of epileptiform spikes. Since the two structures are reciprocally linked by fibre pathways, experiments were carried out to test the possibility that CN influences the hippocampus via SN or vice versa. To this end, changes in penicillin-induced hippocampal spikes by CN or SN stimulation were studied before and after destruction of SN and CN respectively. Steady interictal activity was induced in the hippocampus of encephale isole cats by local injection of penicillin. Stimulations of both CN and SN induced statistically significant reduction of hippocampal spike frequency, and in some cases a clear and regular theta-rhythm. These effects were unchanged by the destruction of either CN or SN. The results add further information to the role played by the basal ganglia and SN in the control of epilepsy, and underline the possibility that caudate and nigral influences on the hippocampus are mediated by different pathways.",
