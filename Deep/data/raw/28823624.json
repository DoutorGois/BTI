     "AB": "Mechanical brain injury (MBI) is a common neurotrosis disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which has a higher mortality and disability. In the case of MBI, neurons death leads to loss of nerve function. To date, there was no satisfactory way to restore neural deficits caused by MBI. Endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) can proliferate, differentiate and migrate to the lesions after brain injury, to replace and repair the damaged neural cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ), hippocampus and the regions of brain injury. In the present study, we first prepared a mouse model of cortical stab wound brain injury. Using the immunohistochemical and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining method, we demonstrated that osthole (Ost), a natural coumarin derivative, was capable of promoting the proliferation of endogenous NSCs and improving neuronal restoration. Then, using the Morris water maze (MWM) test, we revealed that Ost significantly improved the learning and memory function in the MBI mice, increased the number of neurons in the regions of brain injury, hippocampus DG and CA3 regions. Additionally, we found that Ost up-regulated the expression of self-renewal genes Notch 1 and Hes 1. However, when Notch activity was blocked by the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT, the expression of Notch 1 and Hes 1 mRNA was down-regulated, augmentation of NICD and Hes 1 protein was ameliorated, the proliferation-inducing effect of Ost was abolished. These results suggested that the effects of Ost were at least in part mediated by activation of Notch signaling pathway. Our findings support that Ost is a potential drug for treating MBI due to its neuronal restoration.",
