     "AB": "To study the CNS effects of domoic acid (D.A.), 6 adult Cynomolgus monkeys (M. fascicularis) were dosed intraperitoneally (4 mg/kg) or intravenously (0.025-0.5 mg/kg) with D.A. obtained from cultured mussels contaminated with this neurotoxin. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity were preceded by a short presymptomatic period (2-3 min) and an even shorter prodromal period (0.5-1 min). The symptomatic period proper was characterized by persistent chewing with frothing, varying degrees of gagging, and vomit. Monkeys in the higher dose regimen exhibited additional signs including abnormal head and body positions, rigidity of movements and loss of balance, and tremors. The duration of the symptomatic period was dose dependent. Excitotoxic lesions consisting of vacuolation of the neuropil, astrocytic swelling, and neuronal shrinkage and hyperchromasia were detected in the area postrema, the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, and the inner layers of the retina in monkeys given D.A. at 0.5 mg/kg intravenously and 4 mg/kg intraperitoneally. It was concluded that D.A., administered intravenously, is neuroexcitatory and a powerful emetic at doses of 0.025 to 0.2 mg/kg. At higher doses (0.5 mg/kg intravenously and 4 mg/kg intraperitoneally), D.A. is strongly excitotoxic.",
