     "AB": "We have previously demonstrated that psychological stress (PS) can cause iron to accumulate in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of rats. However, why iron accumulates and in what oxidation state iron it accumulates in the brain of PS-exposed rats has not been well elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the influence of PS on the low molecular weight iron pool (LMWIP) in the rat brain. The results showed that: (1) PS significantly expanded LMWIP in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum in rats; (2) PS caused derangement of pyramidal cells and reduced the layers of pyramidal CA1 and CA2 neurons; (3) PS exposure greatly lowered the expression of ferritin (Fn) and hephaestin (HP) in the rat cortex and hippocampus; and (4) PS decreased superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione level and increased malondialdehyde level in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum in rats. These results indicated that PS could expand LMWIP significantly, which may be attributed to PS-induced decrease in Fn, HP expression, and the subsequent reduction in iron storage and utilization, and expansion of LMWIP could in turn lead to aggravation of oxidative damage.",
