     "AB": "A new remote-controlled interface-type chamber was designed in order to conduct experiments in brain slices involving gas, fluid, and temperature changes with as little tissue manipulation as possible. The chamber allows for extremely quick changes between different fluid and/or gaseous phases and for active cooling as well as heating by using a set of electromechanical valves and Peltier elements. The design drawings are complemented by exemplary tests of temperature and gas changes, and electrophysiological recordings of slices manipulated with gas and fluid alterations were used to test the efficacy and accuracy of the design. Changing between normoxia and anoxia needs less than 30 s, while the readjustment of the chamber to a new, preset temperature is accomplished in about 1 min. Supplementary data provide a proposal for the electronic circuit diagram. This chamber design should simplify data acquisition in interface environments.",
