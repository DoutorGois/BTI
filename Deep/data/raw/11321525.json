     "AB": "Lesions to the hippocampal system in rats result in a profound impairment of place or locale spatial learning although other learning strategies remain unaltered. The main objective of the present study was to investigate whether the spatial knowledge preserved in the hippocampal animals can be expressed flexibly under conditions different from those of the acquisition period. Rats with neurotoxic lesions to the dorsal hippocampus and sham-operated subjects were trained to reach the goal arm in a four-arm plus-shaped maze using a constant starting arm. During the training a transparent plexiglas barrier divided the maze in two equal halves in such a way that the animals could only travel from the starting arm to the goal arm, not having access to the remaining 50% of the maze. After seven days of training, a transfer test was used in which the starting arms were the two arms from which the animals had not started during the training phase. Results indicated that the lesioned rats made significantly more errors than the control subjects. But the most interesting results revealed that the kind of error made by the lesioned animals was congruent with the turn that they had to make during the acquisition phase in order to access the goal arm (reinforced). These results suggest that when the hippocampus is damaged a preserved highly inflexible egocentric strategy is employed to solve the spatial problem.",
