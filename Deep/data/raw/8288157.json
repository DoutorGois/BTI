     "AB": "Changes in the brain lactate concentration in cerebral extracellular fluid (ECF) during intravenous infusion of glucose and local administration of glucose were investigated in adult, conscious, unrestrained rats, with a microdialysis probe in the posterior hippocampus. The rats were infused intravenously with either 25% sucrose solution or 25% glucose solution at a rate of 16.6 microliters.min-1.100 g-1 for three hours. The blood glucose concentration reached 17.0 +/- 2.6 mM at the end of the glucose infusion, and brain ECF glucose showed a parallel change with the blood glucose concentration and increased to 2.37 +/- 0.30 mM. However, blood and brain ECF glucose concentrations did not change in animals infused with the sucrose solution. On the other hand, the blood lactate concentration in the glucose-infused group also increased from 0.93 +/- 0.18 mM to 2.85 +/- 0.39 mM at the end of the glucose infusion, which was significantly higher than that measured in the sucrose-infused group. The blood lactate level in the glucose-infused group returned to the basal level by the end of the experiment. Brain ECF lactate concentrations increased from 1.21 +/- 0.06 mM to 1.69 +/- 0.11 mM in glucose-infused animals, but did not change in the sucrose-infused animals. The brain ECF lactate concentration showed a positive correlation with the brain ECF glucose concentration in glucose-infused animals. Another group of rats was administered glucose locally for 90 min after substitution of artificial cerebrospinal fluid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
