     "AB": "Pica is the developmentally and culturally inappropriate eating of nonnutritive substances for at least 1 month. Herein, we present the case of a male patient that suddenly showed behavioral changes including aggressiveness, withdrawal, and perceptional disturbances at the age of 12. About 7 years later, pica symptoms emerged additionally. Neither pharmacotherapy nor electroconvulsive therapy led to success. Magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral sclerosis of the hippocampus. The therapy with carbamazepine, clozapine, diazepam, and zinc finally improved the symptoms including the pica symptoms.",
