     "AB": "This study examined the acute effects of intraperitoneal administration of ethanol on the extracellular levels of serotonin (5-HT) in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) of adult, male alcohol-preferring P and -nonpreferring NP rats. Using in vivo microdialysis coupled with HPLC and electrochemical detection, the effects of acute administration of saline or 1.0, 1.75, or 2.5 g/kg ethanol on the extracellular levels of 5-HT in the vHIP were examined. Saline and 1.0 g/kg ethanol did not alter the extracellular levels of 5-HT. However, the 1.75-g/kg dose resulted in a transient increase in 5-HT levels in the vHIP of P rats only. Administration of 2.5 g/kg ethanol increased 5-HT levels to 180% of baseline in P rats (P<.05), but was without effect on NP rats. The 2.5-g/kg dose also significantly increased the extracellular levels of 5-HT in the vHIP of P rats, which had been pretreated with the same dose of ethanol 18-24 h earlier (P<.05). Comparison of the response of ethanol pretreated P rats with animals that had been pretreated with saline 24 h earlier did not reveal any significant differences in ethanol-stimulated increases in 5-HT levels between the groups. These data suggest that ethanol may activate terminals of the median raphe 5-HT system in P rats because the vHIP receives its 5-HT inputs primarily from the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Rapid tolerance does not develop to this activation of the system in the vHIP of P rats. In addition, the data suggest that the 5-HT system in the vHIP of NP rats may be relatively insensitive to the stimulating effect of acute ethanol of 5-HT release.",
