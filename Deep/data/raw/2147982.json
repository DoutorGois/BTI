     "AB": "Effects of MK-801, a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, were observed on the 'burst responses' elicited in the dentate gyrus by single shocks to the perforant path after kindling to the pathway in acutely prepared rabbits. The intracortical injection of 10 microM of an MK-801-containing solution almost completely blocked the previously induced burst responses, suggesting that activation of the NMDA receptor or the receptor-linked ion channel greatly contributes to the manifestation of the burst responses.",
