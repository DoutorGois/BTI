     "AB": "The present study investigated whether dantrolene, which inhibits the Ca(2+) release from the intracellular Ca(2+) store sites, reduced nuclear DNA fragmentation and produced neuronal protection in a model of global forebrain ischemia. Male Wistar rats were subjected to four-vessel occlusion (4VO) for 5 min and then infused continuously with dantrolene or vehicle into the cerebral ventricle for 3 days. The intact rats did not undergo any intervention. The number of viable and DNA nick-end-labeled neurons in the hippocampal CA1 were evaluated 4 days after the ischemia. The number of viable neurons in the dantrolene-treated rats was significantly higher than that in the vehicle-treated rats and lower than that in the intact animals (P<0.01 and <0.05, respectively). The number of DNA nick-end-labeled nuclei was significantly lower in dantrolene-treated rats compared with the vehicle-treated animals (P<0.0001). No nick-end labeling was observed in the intact animals. A linear correlation was found between the number of viable cells and nick-end labeled nuclei in the CA1 (r=0.91, P<0.0001). These results suggest that the postischemic intraventricular dantrolene is effective in precluding neuronal death and concomitant nuclear DNA fragmentation following transient global ischemia.",
