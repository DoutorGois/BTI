     "AB": "There are currently no clinically efficacious drug therapies to treat brain damage secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this proof-of-concept study, we used a controlled cortical impact model of TBI in young adult rats to explore a novel promising approach that utilizes PNU-120596, a previously reported highly selective Type-II positive allosteric modulator (alpha7-PAM) of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). alpha7-PAMs enhance and prolong alpha7 nAChR activation, but do not activate alpha7 nAChRs when administered without an agonist. The rational basis for the use of an alpha7-PAM as a post-TBI treatment is tripartite and arises from: (1) the intrinsic ability of brain injury to elevate extracellular levels of choline (a ubiquitous cell membrane-building material and a selective endogenous agonist of alpha7 nAChRs) due to the breakdown of cell membranes near the site and time of injury; (2) the ubiquitous expression of functional alpha7 nAChRs in neuronal and glial/immune brain cells; and (3) the potent neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of alpha7 nAChR activation. Therefore, both neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects can be achieved post-TBI by targeting only a single player (i.e., the alpha7 nAChR) using alpha7-PAMs to enhance the activation of alpha7 nAChRs by injury-elevated extracellular choline. Our data support this hypothesis and demonstrate that subcutaneous administration of PNU-120596 post-TBI in young adult rats significantly reduces both brain cell damage and reactive gliosis. Therefore, our results introduce post-TBI systemic administration of alpha7-PAMs as a promising therapeutic intervention that could significantly restrict brain injury post-TBI and facilitate recovery of TBI patients.",
