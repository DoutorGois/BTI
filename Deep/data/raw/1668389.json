     "AB": "Among the various molecular events that have been proposed to contribute to the mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP), one of the most cited possibilities has been the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Here we review various aspects of the cellular actions of PKC activation and inhibition, with special emphasis on the effects of the kinase on synaptic transmission and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptor-mediated components of synaptic responses. We discuss the implications of these effects for interpretations of the role of PKC in the mechanisms of LTP induction and maintenance.",
