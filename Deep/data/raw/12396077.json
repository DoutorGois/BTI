     "AB": "In this study, the effect of bilobalide, a purified terpene lactone component of the Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761), and EGb 761 against ischemic injury and against glutamate-induced excitotoxic neuronal death was compared. In the case of ischemic injury, neuronal loss and the levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded cytochrome oxidase (COX) subunit III mRNA in the hippocampal regions of gerbils was measured. A significant increase in neuronal death and a significant decrease in COX III mRNA were observed in the hippocampal CA1 neurons at 7-days of reperfusion after 5 min of transient global forebrain ischemia. Oral administration of EGb 761 at 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day and bilobalide at 3 and 6 mg/kg/day for 7 days before ischemia progressively protected hippocampal CA1 neurons against ischemia-induced neuronal death and reductions in COX III mRNA. In rat cerebellar neuronal cultures, addition of bilobalide or EGb 761 protected in a dose-dependent manner against glutamate-induced excitotoxic neuronal death [effective concentration (EC50) = 5 microg/ml (12 microM) forbilobalide and 100 microg/ml for EGb 761]. These results suggest thatboth EGb 761 and bilobalide protect against ischemia-induced neuronal death in vivo and glutamate-induced neuronal death in vitro by synergistic mechanisms involving anti-excitotoxicity, inhibition of free radical generation, scavenging of reactive oxygen species, and regulation of mitochondrial gene expression.",
