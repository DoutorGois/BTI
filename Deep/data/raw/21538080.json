     "AB": "Mammalian MTH1 protein, a MutT-related protein, catalyzes the hydrolysis of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine triphosphate (8-oxoGTP) to monophosphate, thereby preventing incorporation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoguanine) into RNA. In this study, we applied immunohistochemistry to follow the expression of MTH1 and the amount of 8-oxoguanine in RNA during aging. There were increased amounts of 8-oxoguanine in RNA in the CAl and CA3 subregions of hippocampi of 8- and 12-month-old SAMP8 mice, which exhibited early aging syndromes and declining learning and memory abilities compared to those of age-matched control SAMR1 mice. The expression levels of MTH1 in the hippocampi of 8- and 12-month-old SAMP8 mice were significantly lower than those of control mice. Therefore, in this mouse model, age-related accumulation of 8-oxoguanine in RNA is correlated with decreased expression of MTH1. Increased amounts of 8-oxoguanine in the RNA, and decreased expression of MTH1 were also observed in the hippocampi of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. These results suggest that MTH1 deficiency might be a causative factor for aging and age-related disorders.",
