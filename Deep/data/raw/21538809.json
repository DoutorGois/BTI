     "AB": "The hippocampus is crucial for higher brain functions, such as learning, memory, and emotion. Many diseases like epilepsy and Down's syndrome are associated with abnormalities in early hippocampal development. In addition, adult dentate neurogenesis is thought to be defective in several classes of psychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms regulating hippocampal development and adult neurogenesis remain unclear. One of the limitations to studying these processes is the scarcity of available specific mouse tools. Here, we report an inducible transgenic Cre mouse line, Frizzled 9-CreER, in which tamoxifen administration induces Cre recombinant. Our data show that Cre is expressed in the developing hippocampal primordium, confined to the granule cell layer at P20 and further limited to the subgranular zone in the adult dentate gyrus. Cre recombinase shows very high activity in all of these regions. Thus, this transgenic line will be a powerful tool in understanding the mechanisms of hippocampal development, adult neurogenesis, and associated diseases.",
