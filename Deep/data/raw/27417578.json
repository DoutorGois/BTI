     "AB": "PKMzeta is an autonomously active PKC isoform that is thought to maintain both LTP and long-term memory. Whereas persistent increases in PKMzeta protein sustain the kinase's action in LTP, the molecular mechanism for the persistent action of PKMzeta during long-term memory has not been characterized. PKMzeta inhibitors disrupt spatial memory when introduced into the dorsal hippocampus from 1day to 1month after training. Therefore, if the mechanisms of PKMzeta's persistent action in LTP maintenance and long-term memory were similar, persistent increases in PKMzeta would last for the duration of the memory, far longer than most other learning-induced gene products. Here we find that spatial conditioning by aversive active place avoidance or appetitive radial arm maze induces PKMzeta increases in dorsal hippocampus that persist from 1day to 1month, coinciding with the strength and duration of memory retention. Suppressing the increase by intrahippocampal injections of PKMzeta-antisense oligodeoxynucleotides prevents the formation of long-term memory. Thus, similar to LTP maintenance, the persistent increase in the amount of autonomously active PKMzeta sustains the kinase's action during long-term and remote spatial memory maintenance.",
