     "AB": "Testosterone (T) may be associated with enhanced spatial navigation in a number of rodent species, although the nature of the relation is equivocal. Similarly, numerous studies in humans generally have found that T is associated with enhanced spatial ability on a variety of paper and pencil tasks that may relate to navigational ability. However, relatively few studies have reported effects of T on navigational ability in humans. We investigated the relationship between endogenous T and performance on a virtual water maze (vWM) and mental rotations test (MROT). ELISA for T was performed on salivary samples that were obtained from participants before and after completion of both spatial tasks. Results indicated that women with low T required more time to locate the hidden platform in the vWM than either group of men or women with high T. Significant negative correlations were found for the entire sample between vWM performance and T, and between vWM latency to escape and MROT. Similar significant correlations were found in women but not men. Thus, our data support the position that T improves performance in the vWM in a linear fashion, most strongly in women. However, further work is needed to confirm this hypothesis in humans.",
