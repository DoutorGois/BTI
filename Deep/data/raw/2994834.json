     "AB": "The anatomical localization of phencyclidine (PCP)/sigma-opiate receptors in rat brain was determined by quantitative light microscopy autoradiography using the new ligand N-(1-[2-thienyl]cyclohexyl) [3H]piperidine ([3H]TCP). TCP is a potent analog of PCP which possesses a higher affinity for PCP/sigma-opiate receptor than does PCP itself. The highest level of [3H]TCP binding was detected in the hippocampus. Intermediate levels were found in frontal cortex, striatum, amygdala and cerebellum. Specific [3H]TCP binding was undetectable in anterior commissure and corpus callosum. The distribution pattern of [3H]TCP binding sites is similar to the pattern obtained with [3H]PCP but more sharply defined. On the basis of its greater potency and specificity, [3H]TCP may prove superior to [3H]PCP as a molecular probe for the study of brain sigma opiate/phencyclidine receptors.",
