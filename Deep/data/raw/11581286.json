     "AB": "MAP1B and MAP2 are major members of neuronal microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). To gain insights into the function of MAP2 in vivo, we generated MAP2-deficient (map2(-/-)) mice. They developed without any apparent abnormalities, which indicates that MAP2 is dispensable in mouse survival. Because previous reports suggest a functional redundancy among MAPs, we next generated mice lacking both MAP2 and MAP1B to test their possible synergistic functions in vivo. Map2(-/-)map1b(-/-) mice died in their perinatal period. They showed not only fiber tract malformations but also disrupted cortical patterning caused by retarded neuronal migration. In spite of this, their cortical layer maintained an \"inside-out\" pattern. Detailed observation of primary cultures of hippocampal neurons from map2(-/-)map1b(-/-) mice revealed inhibited microtubule bundling and neurite elongation. In these neurons, synergistic effects caused by the loss of MAP2 and MAP1B were more apparent in dendrites than in axons. The spacing of microtubules was reduced significantly in map2(-/-)map1b(-/-) mice in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that MAP2 and MAP1B have overlapping functions in neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth by organizing microtubules in developing neurons both for axonal and dendritic morphogenesis but more dominantly for dendritic morphogenesis.",
