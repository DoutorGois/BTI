     "AB": "PURPOSE: Because oral, buccal, and sometimes oral-pharyngeal manifestations in epilepsy are linked to the central-temporal region, we studied 3 patients with childhood-onset partial seizures that consistently began with pharyngeal dysesthesias, described as either throat tingling or burning, to localize seizure onset. METHODS: Because of an intractable clinical course, each patient underwent invasive video-EEG monitoring, which localized the epileptogenic zone to the mesial temporal lobe. The 3 patients underwent temporal lobe resections. RESULTS: All 3 patients achieved remission of the pharyngeal auras and a 90-100% reduction in the frequency of their seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Pharyngeal dysesthesias can be the initial manifestation of complex partial seizures (CPS) of temporal lobe origin.",
