     "AB": "Neuropeptide Y appears to modulate epileptic seizures differentially according to the receptor subtypes involved. In the hippocampus, neuropeptide Y expression and release are enhanced in different models of epileptogenesis. On the contrary, the expression of Y1 receptors is decreased and it has been shown that activation of these receptors has pro-convulsant effects. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of Y1 receptors during hippocampal kindling epileptogenesis using (i) knock-out mice lacking Y1 receptors and (ii) intrahippocampal infusion of Y1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide in rats. Y1 knock-out mice showed similar susceptibility to seizure induction and presented no difference in kindling development as compared with their control littermates. Conversely, local hippocampal down-regulation of Y1 receptors during the first week of hippocampal kindling, induced by a local infusion of a Y1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, significantly increased seizure threshold intensity and decreased afterdischarge duration. A reverse effect was observed during the week following the infusion period, which was confirmed by a significant decrease in the number of hippocampal stimulations necessary to evoke generalized seizures. At the end of this second week, an up-regulation of Y1 receptors was observed in kindled rats infused with the antisense as compared with the mismatch-treated controls. Our results in the rat suggest that the down-regulation of Y1 receptors in the hippocampus participates in the control of the initiation of epileptogenesis. The lack of an effect of the deficiency of Y1 receptors in the control of kindling development in Y1 knock-out mice could be due to compensatory mechanisms.",
