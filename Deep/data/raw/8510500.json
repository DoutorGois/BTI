     "AB": "The pattern of expression of fos and jun family immediate early genes following the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) was investigated in the dentate gyrus of awake rats. Rapid, transient increases in the levels of c-jun and jun-B mRNA and protein, and in the levels of Fos-related proteins (FRAs), occurred in the dentate gyrus after LTP-inducing tetanization of the perforant path. A delayed, and more prolonged induction occurred for jun-D mRNA and protein. The induction of c-Jun, Jun-B, Jun-D and Fos-related proteins was prevented by administration of an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, which also blocked LTP induction, and by pentobarbital, which reduced but did not block LTP. These findings show that differential expression of fos and jun gene family members occurs in a distinct pattern following LTP in awake rats. The responsive genes may participate in the biochemical cascade leading to the long-term stabilization of synaptic modifications.",
