     "AB": "B/K protein is a newly identified member of double C2-like domain protein family. We examined the expression of B/K protein in the hippocampus of kainate-induced rat seizure model. Intraperitoneal injection of kainate increased the immunoreactivity to B/K protein in the CA1 to CA3 of the hippocampus. B/K protein expression began to increase at 6 h, reached the maximum at 12 h, and then returned nearly to the normal level at 72 h after the injection of kainate (12 mg/kg), and it was also dependent on the dose of kainate between 4 and 16 mg/kg. In electron microscopic and subcellular fractionation studies, B/K protein was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the hippocampus. Kainate also induced the expression of BiP, a typical ER stress marker protein, in the hippocampus and the cortex, and it was coexpressed with B/K protein. Moreover, thapsigargin-induced ER stress caused upregulation of B/K protein expression in PC12 cells. In conclusion, our data showing the induction of both B/K protein expression and ER stress response in the hippocampus of kainate seizure model, and ER-specific expression and ER stress-induced expression of B/K strongly suggest the possible role of B/K protein in epileptogenesis or epilepsy-induced neuronal damage.",
