     "AB": "Based on the use of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (Family Araliaceae) for the treatment of stroke in traditional Korean medicine, the present study was carried out to evaluate neuroprotective effects of P. ginseng after transient global cerebral ischemia using the four-vessel occlusion rat model. Nissl staining, lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde [MDA] formation), and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) of rat brain were assessed. Ethanolic P. ginseng extract (200 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly protected CA1 neurons against 10 minutes of transient forebrain ischemia as demonstrated by measuring the density of neuronal cells. P. ginseng also significantly decreased the level of MDA and increased the expression of GPx and SOD. These results suggest that P. ginseng might be neuroprotective against cerebral ischemia-induced injury in rat brain by decreasing lipid peroxides and increasing the expression of GPx and SOD.",
