     "AB": "Neurokinin binding sites are distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system and three neurokinin binding sites have been described until now. The endogenous tachykinins substance P, neurokinin A and eledoisin as well as the highly selective neurokinin ligands [Arg6, Sar9, Met(O2)11]SP6-11 and [Sar9, Met(O2)11]SP (for neurokinin-1), MEN 10,376 and [beta Ala8]NKA(4-10) (for neurokinin-2) and senktide and [MePhe7]NKB (for neurokinin-3) were used for displacement experiments. Neurokinin-1 and -3 binding sites were demonstrated in membrane preparations of rat striatum, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus and amygdala by displacing [125I]-BH-substance P and [125I]-BH-eledoisin, respectively. The highly selective neurokinin-2 ligand MEN 10,376 was iodinated to measure neurokinin-2 binding sites, but no specific binding was found in membranes of all brain regions, the spinal cord, the stomach, the urinary bladder or the guinea-pig lung, probably due to loss of binding properties. We conclude that neurokinin-1 and neurokinin-3 binding sites are distributed in several brain regions of the rat brain and selective neurokinin ligands are important tools to characterize neurokinin binding sites.",
