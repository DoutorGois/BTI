     "AB": "Using the epilepsy model obtained by systemic administration of pilocarpine in rats in the present study we investigated the changes caused by seizures on content and species of gangliosides and phospholipids, as well as on cholesterol concentration, glutathione reduced contents, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity and lipid peroxidation levels in rat hippocampus. Wistar rats received pilocarpine hydrochloride (400mg/kg, i.p., pilocarpine group), and other group received 0.9% saline (i.p., control group). Results showed that seizures significantly decreased the total content of lipids and glutathione reduced concentration in rat hippocampus. We also observed that seizures significantly reduced the absolute quantity of the major brain gangliosides (GM1, GD1a, GD1b and GT1b) and phospholipids (sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine). Our data also showed a decreased Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity and an increased TBARS levels in hippocampus of seized rats. If confirmed in human beings, these data could suggest that the alteration in lipid composition, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity, glutathione reduced content and TBARS levels caused by seizures might contribute to the neurophysiopathology of seizures observed in epileptic patients.",
