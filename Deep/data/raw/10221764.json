     "AB": "We have shown previously that activation of mGlu receptors using a group I specific mGlu receptor agonist, (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), can induce long-term depression (LTD) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Palmer et al., 1997). We now report that DHPG-induced LTD is facilitated by treatment with KN-62, an inhibitor of certain Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs), including CaMKII.",
