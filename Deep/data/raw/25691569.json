     "AB": "Signals that activate the G protein Galphas and promote neuronal differentiation evoke Galphas internalization in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. These agents also significantly increase Galphas association with microtubules, resulting in an increase in microtubule dynamics because of the activation of tubulin GTPase by Galphas. To determine the function of Galphas/microtubule association in neuronal development, we used real-time trafficking of a GFP-Galphas fusion protein. GFP-Galphas concentrates at the distal end of the neurites in differentiated living PC12 cells as well as in cultured hippocampal neurons. Galphas translocates to specialized membrane compartments at tips of growing neurites. A dominant-negative Galpha chimera that interferes with Galphas binding to tubulin and activation of tubulin GTPase attenuates neurite elongation and neurite number both in PC12 cells and primary hippocampal neurons. This effect is greatest on differentiation induced by activated Galphas. Together, these data suggest that activated Galphas translocates from the plasma membrane and, through interaction with tubulin/microtubules in the cytosol, is important for neurite formation, development, and outgrowth. Characterization of neuronal G protein dynamics and their contribution to microtubule dynamics is important for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which G protein-coupled receptor signaling orchestrates neuronal growth and differentiation.",
