     "AB": "Previous experiments have shown that long-term potentiation (LTP) generally lasts for only a few days or weeks. The LTP phenomenon would be more attractive as a memory model if it were more enduring. The experiments reported in this paper were designed to test the effects of repeated induction of LTP on the duration of LTP. Three groups of animals received 5 LTP-inducing stimulation sessions. In one group of animals, the stimulation sessions were administered every 24 h. In the 2nd group, the sessions were administered after the LTP effects had decayed to 50% of the peak values. In the 3rd group, the sessions were administered only after the response amplitudes had completely returned to pre-LTP baseline levels. None of the LTP measures were altered, in any group, as a result of repeated induction of LTP. The thresholds, the asymptotic levels of potentiation, and the decay rates were the same after each session. Other treatments may alter the duration of LTP effects, but repeated induction of LTP does not appear to have any lasting effects.",
