     "AB": "We used Northern blot analysis, ribonuclease protection assay (RPA), reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and in situ hybridization to investigate the hypothesis that the CNG1 isoform of the cyclic nucleotide-gated nonselective cation channel may be widely distributed in tissues of the rat. A cDNA encoding the CNG1 isoform was isolated from rat eye and human retina, and partial sequences were isolated from rat pineal gland and human kidney. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3.1-kilobase (kb) CNG1 transcript in rat eye, pineal gland, pituitary, adrenal gland, and spleen, and a larger transcript of 3.5 kb was found in testis. RPA confirmed the identity of CNG1 mRNA in rat eye, lung, spleen, and brain. Polymerase chain reaction-based detection of the mRNA for CNG1 indicates that the channel is expressed in lower abundance in many other tissues, including thymus, skeletal muscle, heart, and parathyroid gland. The cellular distribution of CNG1 was further studied by in situ hybridization, which demonstrated expression of mRNA in lung, thymus, pineal gland, hippocampus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex but not in heart or kidney.",
