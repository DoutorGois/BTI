     "AB": "We have shown previously that adult onset hypothyroidism impairs late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) and reduces the protein levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKp44/42 (ERK1/2)) in area CA1 of the hippocampus. In the present study, basal and stimulated levels of signaling molecules essential for the expression of L-LTP were determined in area CA1 of the hippocampus. L-LTP was evoked by multiple train high-frequency stimulation (MHFS) in area CA1 of the hippocampus of thyroidectomized and sham control anesthetized adult rats. Immunoblot analysis showed reduction in the basal protein levels of adenylyl cyclase I (ACI), calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV), and cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB; phosphorylated (P-) and total) in hypothyroid rats. A significant increase in the levels of P-CREB, P-MAPKp44 and P-MAPKp42 was seen 4 h after MHFS in sham-operated control animals, but not in hypothyroid animals. The levels of total CREB, total MAPKp44, total MAPKp42 and CaMKIV were elevated in both groups 4 h after MHFS. Our results suggest that in adult hypothyroid rats, the reduced basal level of CaMKIV, MAPKp44/42 and CREB along with the failure of MHFS to induce MAPKp44/42 and CREB phosphorylation may be responsible for L-LTP impairment in the CA1 area during hypothyroidism.",
