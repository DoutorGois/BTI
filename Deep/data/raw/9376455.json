     "AB": "Neuropsychological measures of recent and remote memory as well as general attention were administered to two groups of DSM-III-R schizophrenic patients in a within-subject repeated measures design across a 3-week interval. One group of patients (n = 12) was maintained on haloperidol for both test sessions, whereas a second group (n = 9) was tested first on haloperidol and again 3-weeks drug free. Patients received no adjunctive anticholinergic medication during the study. No differences were observed between the patient groups in level of psychotic symptomatology or general attention across the two test sessions. Patients withdrawn from haloperidol showed significant decreases in recent verbal memory function, while at the same time demonstrating significant increases in remote verbal memory. We speculate that the observed pattern of results is consistent with medial temporal lobe dysfunction particularly prominent in the left hemisphere as patients become drug free, and provides support for the existence of state-dependent cognitive changes in schizophrenia.",
