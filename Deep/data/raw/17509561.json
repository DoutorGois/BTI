     "AB": "In the present study, involvement of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors of the CA1 region of dorsal hippocampus (intra-CA1) in the acquisition or expression of morphine-induced conditioned place preference in rats was studied. Male Wistar rats were used in these experiments. NMDA-receptor agonist (NMDA) and antagonist (MK-801) were injected into the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus (intra-CA1) and morphine was injected subcutaneously. An unbiased conditioned place preference paradigm was used to study the effect of these agents. In the first set of experiments, the drugs were used during the development of conditioned place preference by morphine or they were used alone in order to see if they induce conditioned place preference or conditioned place aversion. Our data showed that subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of morphine sulphate (2.5-10 mg/kg) induced conditioned place preference in rat. NMDA (0.1-1 microg/rat) or MK-801 (1-4 microg/rat) did not induce conditioned place preference or conditioned place aversion. Intra-CA1 administration of different doses of NMDA (0.1-1 microg/rat) increased, while MK-801 (1-4 microg/rat) decreased morphine-induced place preference. MK-801 reversed the effect of NMDA on morphine response. In the second set of experiments, when the drugs were used before testing on Day 5, in order to test their effects on the expression of morphine (7.5 mg/kg)-induced place preference, intra-CA1 administration of NMDA or MK-801 did not alter the morphine response. None of the drugs influenced locomotion. It is concluded that NMDA receptor of the CA1 region of hippocampus are involved in the acquisition but not expression of morphine-induced place preference.",
