     "AB": "We have recently demonstrated that in resting conditions calpain 1, but not calpain 2, is specifically associated to the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) multiprotein complex. We are here reporting that in SKNBE neuroblastoma cells or in freshly isolated nerve terminals from adult rat hippocampus, the proteolytic activity of calpain 1 resident at the NMDAR is very low under basal conditions and greatly increases following NMDAR stimulation. Since the protease resides at the NMDAR in saturating amounts, variations in Ca2+ influx promote an increase in calpain 1 activity without affecting the amount of the protease originally associated to NMDAR. In all the conditions examined, resident calpain 1 specifically cleaves NR2B at the C-terminal region, leading to its internalization together with NR1 subunit. While in basal conditions intracellular membranes include small amounts of NMDAR containing the calpain-digested NR2B, upon NMDAR stimulation nearly all the receptor molecules are internalized. We here propose that resident calpain 1 is involved in NMDAR turnover, and following an increase in Ca2+ influx, the activated protease, by promoting the removal of NMDAR from the plasma membranes, can decrease Ca2+ entrance through this channel. Due to the absence of calpastatin in such cluster, the activity of resident calpain 1 may be under the control of HSP90, whose levels are directly related to the activation of this protease. Observations of different HSP90/calpain 1 ratios in different ultrasynaptic compartments support this conclusion.",
