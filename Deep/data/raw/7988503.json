     "AB": "Long-term electrocorticograms (ECoG), recorded by chronically implanted subdural electrodes during preoperative evaluation of 59 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) were analyzed retrospectively to assess the prognostic relevance of distribution of interictal epileptiform potentials (IEP) and seizure origin (SO) and to investigate factors affecting their lateralization. Subsequent to preoperative evaluation, a standardized two thirds anterotemporal lobectomy including subtotal hippocampectomy had been performed in all patients. The following results were obtained: (a) Only patients with 100% lateralization of SO and IEP had excellent seizure outcome (= 89% seizure-free); (b) patients with bitemporal SO were unlikely to benefit from surgical treatment (= 12.5% seizure-free); (c) 40-56% patients with unilateral temporal SO and bitemporal IEP, became seizure-free irrespective of the degree of lateralization of IEP; and (d) multidimensional analysis of variance showed that lateralization of SO, presence of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detectable lesion, presence of hippocampal sclerosis, presence of febrile seizures and seizures at age < or = 6 years are the five most important variables indicating abolition of seizures. Combined analysis of ECoG-recorded SO and IEP allows prediction of postoperative seizure control within close boundaries.",
