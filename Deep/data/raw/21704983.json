     "AB": "Previously, we have published that pharmacological induction of oxidative stress causes anxiety-like behavior in rats and also is associated with hypertension in these animals. Here, we report that sub-chronic induction of oxidative stress via pharmacological induction leads to i) reduction in glyoxalase (GLO)-1 and glutathione reductase (GSR)-1 expression; ii) calpain mediated reduction of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels; iii) NFkappaB mediated upregulation of proinflammatory factors interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and elevated angiotensin (AT)-1 receptor levels in hippocampus, amygdala and locus coeruleus regions of the brain. Acute oxidative stress has opposite effects. We speculate that regulation of GLO1, GSR1, BDNF, NFkappaB and AT-1 receptor may contribute to anxiety-like behavior and hypertension in rats.",
