     "AB": "TRH or its analog DN-1417 (gamma-butyrolactone-gamma-carbonyl-L-histidyl-L-proliamide) given 15 min after intravenous (i.v.) administration of pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) markedly shortened the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time in rats. This effect was almost completely abolished by intracerebroventricular pretreatment with atropine methylbromide (20 micrograms/rat), thereby suggesting the involvement of cholinergic mechanism. The action mechanism was investigated using rat brain slices. TRH (10(-6)-10(-4)M) or DN-1417 (10(-7)-10(-5)M) caused significant increases in the uptake of [3H]-choline into striatal slices. TRH(10(-4)M) or DN-1417(10(-5)M) also stimulated the conversion of [3H]-choline to [3H]-acetylcholine in striatal slices. A 30% reduction of acetylcholine synthesis from [3H]-choline in hippocampal slices and a 40% reduction of [3H]-choline uptake in slices of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus were observed in rats pretreated with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, i.v.). TRH or DN-1417 (20 mg/kg, i.v.) given 15 min after the administration of pentobarbital markedly reversed both of the pentobarbital effects. Direct application of pentobarbital (5 X 10(-4)M) to slices in vitro also caused a 20-40% reduction of [3H]-choline uptake of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and diencephalon. A concomitant application of TRH(10(-4)M) or DN-1417(10(-5)M) and pentobarbital abolished the pentobarbital effect. These results provide neurochemical evidence that the antagonistic effects of TRH and DN-1417 on pentobarbital-induced narcosis are closely related to alterations in the rat brain choline uptake and acetylcholine synthesis, which are considered to be measures of the activity of cholinergic neurons.",
