     "AB": "Cortistatin-14, a neuropeptide, is present primarily in the cortex and hippocampus. In the hippocampus, cortistatin-14 inhibits pyramidal cell firing and co-exists with GABA. To determine if cortistatin-14 would impair retention, saline or cortistatin-14 were injected intracerebroventricularly after footshock avoidance training in CD-1 mice. After 1 week, training was resumed to determine the effect of cortistatin-14 on retention. Cortistatin-14 was found to impair retention relative to the control group at doses of 0.5-5.0 micrograms.",
