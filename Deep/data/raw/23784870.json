     "AB": "Cadherins are cell adhesion molecules widely expressed in the nervous system, where they play various roles in neural patterning, nuclei formation, axon guidance, and synapse formation and function. Although many published articles have reported on cadherin expression in rodents and ferrets, there are limited data on their expression in primate brains. In this study, in situ hybridization analysis was performed for 10 cadherins [nine classic cadherins (Cdh4, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10, -11, -12, and -20) and T-cadherin (Cdh13)] in the developing postnatal telencephalon of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Each cadherin showed broad expression in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus, as previously shown in the rodent brain. However, detailed expression patterns differed between rodents and marmosets. In contrast to rodents, cadherin expression was reduced overall and localized to restricted areas of the brain during the developmental process, suggesting that cadherins are more crucially involved in developmental or maturation processes rather than in neural functioning. These results also highlight the possibility that restricted/less redundant cadherin expression allows primate brains to generate functional diversity among neurons, allowing morphological and functional differences between rodents and primates.",
