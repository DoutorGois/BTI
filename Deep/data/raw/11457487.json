     "AB": "In the aftermath of prolonged continuous seizure activity (status epilepticus, SE), neuronal cell death occurs in the brain regions through which the seizure propagates. The vulnerability to adrenalectomy-induced apoptotic neuronal death was recently reported to be reduced by prior exposure to repeated daily noninjurious electroconvulsive shock (ECS). The present studies identified apoptosis and apoptosis-associated gene products in the neurodegenerative response to experimentally controlled periods (1 or 2 h) of SE in the rat, and determined whether exposure to ECS can interrupt these apoptotic responses mechanisms. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and the presence of apoptotic-like neurons (as assessed by in situ double labeling technique) was detected in hippocampus and rhinal cortex at 24 h after SE. Under these conditions, levels of both mRNA and protein encoded by the 'death promoting' bcl-XS gene were increased in the same brain areas. Pretreatment of animals for 7 days with low intensity (minimal) ECS conferred resistance to SE-evoked neurodegeneration, as assessed histopathologically by silver staining. Associated with this neuroprotective action was a reduction in the incidence of apoptosis-like neuronal morphology and DNA fragmentation, and a prevention of the increase in Bcl-XS protein and mRNA in hippocampus and rhinal cortex. These data suggest that pre-exposure to controlled, brief noninjurious seizures decreases vulnerability to programmed neuronal cell death, that this neuroprotective action occurs upstream from Bcl-XS, and that increases in bcl-XS gene expression may serve as a sensitive indicator of neurodegeneration following SE.",
