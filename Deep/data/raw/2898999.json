     "AB": "1. The effects of lead on catecholaminergic neurotransmission have been investigated. 2. Using the rat as a model, animals were exposed both acutely and chronically to lead. The levels of catecholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine along with the activities of tyrosine hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase were measured in 5 brain regions--cerebral cortex, brainstem, hippocampus, anterior and posterior hypothalamus. 3. A lead related reduction in the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase was observed in association with alterations in steady-state levels of the catecholamines in the posterior and anterior hypothalamus. 4. Thus, lead exposure, known to result in behavioural changes, is associated with localised neurochemical effects on the hypothalamus.",
