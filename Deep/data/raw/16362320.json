     "AB": "An antibody against the 442 carboxy-terminal amino acids of the BK channel alpha-subunit detects high immunoreactivity within the telencephalon in cerebral cortices, olfactory bulb, basal ganglia and hippocampus, while lower levels are found in basal forebrain regions and amygdala. Within the diencephalon, high density was found in nuclei of the ventral and dorsal thalamus and the medial habenular nucleus, and low density in the hypothalamus. The fasciculus retroflexus and its termination in the mesencephalic interpeduncular nucleus are prominently stained. Other mesencephalic expression sites are periaquaeductal gray and raphe nuclei. In the rhombencephalon, BK channels are enriched in the cerebellar cortex and in the locus coeruleus. Strong immunoreactivity is also contained in the vestibular nuclei, but not in cranial nerves and their intramedullary course of their roots. On the cellular level, BK channels show pre- and postsynaptic localizations, i.e., in somata, dendrites, axons and synaptic terminals.",
