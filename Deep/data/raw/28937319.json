     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the characteristics of brain activation during unilateral premolar occlusion. METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was collected from 10 healthy volunteers during occlusion of the left first premolar (L1), left second premolar (L2), and right first premolar (R1). The brain activation patterns were analyzed, and the primary sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor area, insula, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex were chosen as regions of interest. RESULTS: Single premolar occlusion activated the precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, cerebellum, thalamus, frontal lobe, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, and parietal lobe. The brain areas showing activation during single premolar occlusion were similar to those activated by chewing. The activation pattern of L1 was more similar to that of L2 than R1. No significant left and right hemisphere differences in signal intensity were detected within the regions of interest. CONCLUSION: Brain activation patterns from two ipsilateral premolars were more similar than the pattern from a contralateral premolar.",
