     "AB": "Reactive gliosis was revealed by immunocytochemistry using antibodies against the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) after a stab or an electrolytic lesion administered to the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, striatum, or hippocampus of a 6-day-old rat. The intensity of the gliosis was about the same in the various structures injured and did not change with the delay of 3, 7, or 20 days between the injury and the sacrifice of the animals. When basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was injected in the lesion locus just after the lesion was performed, it resulted (as soon as 3 days after injury) in a strong astrogliosis that was enhanced after a delay of 7 days, the astrocytes in the lesion area exhibiting enlarged cell processes and intense GFAP-positive immunoreactivity. After a delay of 20 days, the astrocytes were not dispersed any more but packed in three or four layers along the borders of the lesion, thus reducing its extension. This suggests a possible role for bFGF in promoting scar formation following brain injury.",
