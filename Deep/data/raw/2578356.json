     "AB": "Hippocampal EEG signals derived from chronically implanted electrodes in the freely moving rat were recorded before and after administration of centrally acting drugs, and analyzed by power and coherence spectra. Eserine, ether or urethane induced a low frequency (3-6 c/sec) theta power and coherence peak in the immobile rat, which was sensitive to atropine or scopolamine. After phencyclidine, theta that occurred during walking (7-8 c/sec) was virtually abolished by atropine while in the normal rat, absolute theta power was not affected by atropine. The residue spectrum, defined as the EEG spectrum with the theta harmonics removed, was sensitive to centrally acting drugs. Ether, urethane and pentobarbital suppressed fast waves of 50-100 c/sec, and under some conditions, enhanced 15-50 c/sec waves. Eserine enhanced (30-60 c/sec) fast waves during walking while atropine suppressed fast waves and increased irregular slow activity (less than 30 c/sec). The main effects of drugs and behavior on the residue spectra and on the average evoked potentials following stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals could be explained by a previously proposed model (Leung 1982) which suggests a continuum of hippocampal 'activation' (tonic input) under the various conditions.",
