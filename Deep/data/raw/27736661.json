     "AB": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of epilepsy in adults. The pilocarpine (PILO) experimental model of TLE portrays behavioral and pathophysiological changes in rodents that are very similar to those found in humans with TLE. However, this model is associated with an unfortunate high mortality rate. Studies have shown that intrahippocampal injection of PILO, while having a much smaller mortality rate, induces status epilepticus (SE) that secondarily leads to TLE. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to evaluate the cognitive and histological alterations 72h after intrahippocampal microinjection of PILO in C57BL/6 mice. Seventy percent of mice developed status epilepticus (SE) after PILO administration, and all animals survived after SE. Seventy-two hours after SE, mice presented memory impairment in both Novel Object Recognition (recognition index - vehicle: 67.57+/-4.46% vs PILO: 52.33+/-3.29%) and Contextual Fear Conditioning (freezing time - vehicle: 203+/-20.43 vs PILO: 107.80+/-25.17s) tasks. Moreover, using Nissl and NeuN staining, we observed in PILO-treated mice a significant decrease in cell viability and an increase in neuronal loss in all three hippocampal regions analyzed, cornus ammonis (CA) 1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG), in comparison with the control group. Additionally, using Iba-1 staining, we observed in PILO-treated mice a significant increase in microglial proliferation in CA1, CA3, and DG of the hippocampus. Therefore, intrahippocampal PILO microinjection is an efficient route to induce SE and acute postictal epileptogenic-like alterations in C57BL/6 mice.",
