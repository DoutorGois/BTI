     "AB": "The present study deals with the detailed distribution of acid phosphatase (AcP) and simple esterase (SE) in different layers of the neocortex and hippocampal formation of the mouse brain. The neurons, in general, had moderate to intense enzyme activity for AcP and mild to moderate activity for SE. The AcP activity dominated in the neuronal population as compared to the neuropil; the neuropil stained mildly for SE. The large pyramidal cells in the neocortex and cornu ammonis, and the granular cell layer of the gyrus dentatus, demonstrated strong enzyme activity both in AcP and SE preparations. The role of AcP and SE has been discussed in relation to various structures of the neocortex and hippocampal formation.",
