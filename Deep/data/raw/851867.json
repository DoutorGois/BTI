     "AB": "The time course of the post-lesion proliferation of contralateral entorhinal afferents which occurs in response to ipsilateral entorhinal lesions was quanititatively analyzed with autoradiographic techniques. The extent of the crossed projection to the dentate granule cells was quantified on the basis of a contralateral/ipsilateral (C/I) ratio of grain density in the entorhinal terminal zones at 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and over 60 days post-lesion. C/I ratios of grain density indicate little if any change in the crossed projection at 6 days post-lesion. Between 8 and 12 days post-lesion, the extent of the crossed projection increases dramatically, on the basis of the C/I ratio of grain density. C/I ratios do not increase further between 12 and 14 days post-lesion, but are higher at 60 days post-lesion. These results suggest that the crossed pathway proliferates extensively within the denervated zones between 8 and 12 days post-lesion, and may continue to proliferate at a much slower rate after 12 days post-lesion.",
