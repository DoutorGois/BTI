     "AB": "The electrical impedance of trigeminal ganglion cells (in vivo) and hippocampal CA1 neurons (in vitro) of guinea pigs was measured in the frequency range of 5-1250 Hz using intracellular recording techniques with single microelectrodes and computerized methodology. The transfer functions of the electrode and the electrode-neuron system were computed from the ratio of fast Fourier transforms of the output voltage response from the neuron and input current composed of sine waves with rapidly increasing frequency which displaced membrane potential by 2-5 mV. We believe these to be the first measurements of complex impedance and transfer functions in peripheral and central neurons of vertebrates and the first use of such input current functions. The majority of trigeminal ganglion cells did not exhibit electrical behaviour ascribable to a simple resistance-capacitance (RC) circuit but showed a hump at low frequencies (5-250 Hz) in the computed transfer function, probably attributable to resonance. The transfer function in less than 20% of the trigeminal neurons could be fitted approximately to a theoretical transfer function (resistance in series with a parallel RC circuit model) providing values for electrode resistance, effective input resistance, and effective input capacitance. The transfer functions measured in hippocampal CA1 neurons were characterized by a rapid fall-off in the low frequency range (less than 200 Hz). Impedance locus plots approximate the locus corresponding to a series RC circuit in parallel with a parallel RC circuit.",
