     "AB": "We have found that the large intracellular loop of the gamma2 GABAA receptor (R) subunit (gamma2IL) interacts with RNF34 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), as shown by yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pulldown assays. In brain extracts, RNF34 co-immunoprecipitates with assembled GABAARs. In co-transfected HEK293 cells, RNF34 reduces the expression of the gamma2 GABAAR subunit by increasing the ratio of ubiquitinated/nonubiquitinated gamma2. Mutating several lysines of the gamma2IL into arginines makes the gamma2 subunit resistant to RNF34-induced degradation. RNF34 also reduces the expression of the gamma2 subunit when alpha1 and beta3 subunits are co-assembled with gamma2. This effect is partially reversed by leupeptin or MG132, indicating that both the lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways are involved. Immunofluorescence of cultured hippocampal neurons shows that RNF34 forms clusters and that a subset of these clusters is associated with GABAergic synapses. This association is also observed in the intact rat brain by electron microscopy immunocytochemistry. RNF34 is not expressed until the 2nd postnatal week of rat brain development, being highly expressed in some interneurons. Overexpression of RNF34 in hippocampal neurons decreases the density of gamma2 GABAAR clusters and the number of GABAergic contacts that these neurons receive. Knocking down endogenous RNF34 with shRNA leads to increased gamma2 GABAAR cluster density and GABAergic innervation. The results indicate that RNF34 regulates postsynaptic gamma2-GABAAR clustering and GABAergic synaptic innervation by interacting with and ubiquitinating the gamma2-GABAAR subunit promoting GABAAR degradation.",
