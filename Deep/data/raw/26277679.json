     "AB": "We compared cortical thickness between patients with late-life depression (LLD) and healthy controls and between patients with early-onset (EOD) and late-onset (LOD) depression. We also tested age effects on cortical thickness in LLD and controls and if cortical thickness and hippocampal volumes were associated with cognitive performance in LLD. Three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were obtained in 49 LLD and 49 matched hospital controls and processed using FreeSurfer. General linear model analysis was used as a statistical approach. LLD group had thinning in the left parahippocampal, fusiform, and inferior-parietal cortex compared with controls. Age correlated with cortical thinning in controls but not in LLD. Women in the LOD groups had extensive cortical thinning in the lateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally compared with EOD women. Absence of statistically significant changes observed in men should however be treated with caution because of the low number of men in the study. Mini-Mental Status Examination score correlated with lateral prefrontal cortical thickness bilaterally and hippocampal volume in the total group of LLD and in LOD but not EOD. LLD is associated with cortical thinning, which is associated with age at depression onset, gender, and level of cognitive functioning.",
