     "AB": "The binding of [3H]corticosterone and [3H]dexamethasone to soluble macromolecules in cytosol of the hippocampal region of the brain has been studied in adrenalectomized male rats. Unlabeled dexamethasone appears to be a less effective competitor than corticosterone in the binding of [3H]corticosterone, while both unlabeled steroids compete equally well for the binding or [3H]dexamethasone. Further investigation of macromolecular complexes with [3H]dexamethasone and [3H]corticosterone revealed that they differ from each other in their behavior during ammonium sulfate precipitation, BioRad A-5M gel permeation chromatography, DE-52 anion exchange chromatography and DNA-cellulose chromatography. (1) After exposure to a 33% ammonium sulfate solution relatively more [3H]dexamethasone complex than [3H]corticosterone complex is precipitated. (2) Treatment of the cytosol with 0.3 M KCl gives disaggregation of the supramolecular 3H-labeled corticoid complexes which are seen eluting with the void volume during gel permeation chromatography on Biorad A-5M at low ionic strength. In 0.3 M KCl, the [3H]dexamethasone complex has an elution volume somewhat smaller than that of bovine serum albumin, while the [3H]-corticosterone complex in 0.3 M KCl is too unstable to survive chromatography with A-5M. (3) Chromatography on DE-52 resolved the 3H-labeled corticoid complexes into three binding components. The complex with [3H]dexamethasone contains a higher percentage (85%) of a component less firmly attached (i.e. eluted by 0.15 M KCl) to the anion exchange resin than is observed for the complex with [3H]corticosterone (49%). (4) The complexes with 3H-labeled corticoids display an enhanced affinity for calf thymus DNA adsorbed to cellulose following \"activation\", warming to 25 degrees C for 15 min. Concurrently, a fraction of the [3H]dexamethasone complex becomes able to more firmly attach to the DE-52 anion exchange resin. These results with the binding of the cytosol hormone-receptor complexes to DNA-cellulose do not explain the marked in vivo preference of hippocampus for the cell nuclear uptake of [3H] corticosterone. However, the other differences in the properties of the complexes formed with the two labeled glucocorticoids support our previous inference that there may be more than one population of adrenal steroid \"receptors\" in brain tissue.",
