     "AB": "Glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), exerts neuromodulatory actions via the activation of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors. There are eight known mGlu receptor subtypes (mGlu1-8), which are widely expressed throughout the brain, and are divided into three groups (I-III), based on signalling pathways and pharmacological profiles. Group III mGlu receptors (mGlu4/6/7/8) are primarily, although not exclusively, localised on presynaptic terminals, where they act as both auto- and hetero-receptors, inhibiting the release of neurotransmitter. Until recently, our understanding of the role of individual group III mGlu receptor subtypes was hindered by a lack of subtype-selective pharmacological tools. Recent advances in the development of both orthosteric and allosteric group III-targeting compounds, however, have prompted detailed investigations into the possible functional role of these receptors within the CNS, and revealed their involvement in a number of pathological conditions, such as epilepsy, anxiety and Parkinson's disease. The heterogeneous expression of group III mGlu receptor subtypes throughout the brain, as well as their distinct distribution at glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, makes them ideal targets for therapeutic intervention. This review summarises the advances in subtype-selective pharmacology, and discusses the individual roles of group III mGlu receptors in physiology, and their potential involvement in disease.",
