     "AB": "The amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolytic processing is a key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The enzymes beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) and A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) play an important role in APP proteolysis. We measured by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction their mRNA levels in hippocampal and cerebellar sections from 13 AD and 12 control brains. BACE mRNA amounts were similar in patients and controls. In contrast, ADAM10 mRNA levels were twofold higher in AD samples, but without relationship to the severity of anatomical damage. The data do not support the hypothesis that alteration of BACE and ADAM10 expression are associated with development of late stages of AD.",
