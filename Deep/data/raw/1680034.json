     "AB": "Simulated ischemic conditions or a source of oxygen-derived free radicals, such as xanthine plus xanthine oxidase, released a significant amount of the excitotoxic amino acids Asp and Glu from adult rat hippocampal slices incubated in vitro. The concentrations of Asp and Glu in the incubation medium increased by 20 and 30 times respectively when such slices were exposed to simulated ischemia for a 10-min period. However, preparations obtained from 4- to 9-day-old rats did not release Asp or Glu either when exposed to ischemia or after K+ depolarization. This release appeared 10-15 days after birth and progressively increased up to 13 months of age. No further increase was observed in 25-month-old animals. The exposure of the slices to a source of oxygen-derived free radicals induced a release of excitotoxic amino acids independently from the age of the rats. The massive excitotoxic amino acid release from adult hippocampal slices and the formation of free radicals induced by ischemic insults has been previously associated with degeneration of hippocampal neurons. The lack of ischemia-induced excitotoxic amino acid release from the newborn hippocampus may help to explain why the newborn hippocampus is more resistant than the adult to hypoxic/ischemic insults.",
