     "AB": "Type 1 diabetes is associated with cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive processing, particularly memory acquisition, depends on the regulated enhancement of expression and function of glutamate receptor subtypes in the hippocampus. Impairment of memory was been detected in rodent models of type 1 diabetes induced by streptozotocin (STZ). This study examines the functional properties of synaptic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and the expression of synaptic molecules that regulate glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of STZ-diabetic rats. The AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and single-channel properties of synaptosomal AMPA receptors were examined after 4 weeks of diabetes induction. Results show that amplitude and frequency of mEPSCs recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons were decreased in diabetic rats. In addition, the single-channel properties of synaptic AMPA receptors from diabetic rat hippocampi were different from those of controls. These impairments in synaptic currents gated by AMPA receptors were accompanied by decreased protein levels of AMPA receptor subunit GluR1, the presynaptic protein synaptophysin, and the postsynaptic anchor protein postsynaptic density protein 95 in the hippocampus of diabetic rats. Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), an extracellular matrix molecule abundantly expressed in the brain, and the polysialic acid (PSA) attached to NCAM were also downregulated in the hippocampus of diabetic rats. Insulin treatment, when initiated at the onset of diabetes induction, reduced these effects. These findings suggest that STZ-induced diabetes may result in functional deteriorations in glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus of rats and that these effects may be reduced by insulin treatment.",
