The spontaneous activities, evoked synaptic responses, and membrane properties of CA3 pyramidal neurons and dentate granule cells in rat hippocampus were compared before ischemia and </=7 days after reperfusion with intracellular recording and staining techniques in vivo. A four-vessel occlusion method was used to induce approximately 14 min of ischemic depolarization. No significant change in spontaneous firing rate was observed in both cell types after reperfusion. The amplitude and slope of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in CA3 neurons decreased to 50% of control values during the first 12 h reperfusion and returned to preischemic levels 24 h after reperfusion. The amplitude and slope of EPSPs in granule cells slightly decreased 24-36 h after reperfusion. The amplitude of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in CA3 neurons transiently increased 24 h after reperfusion, whereas that in granule cells showed a transient decrease 24-36 h after reperfusion. The duration of spike width of CA3 and granule cells became longer than that of control values during the first 12 h reperfusion. The spike threshold of both cell types significantly increased 24-36 h after reperfusion, whereas the frequency of repetitive firing evoked by depolarizing current pulse was decreased during this period. No significant change in rheobase and input resistance was observed in CA3 neurons. A transient increase in rheobase and a transient decrease in input resistance were detected in granule cells 24-36 h after reperfusion. The amplitude of fast afterhyperpolarization in both cell types increased for 2 days after ischemia and returned to normal values 7 days after reperfusion. The results from this study indicate that the neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission in CA3 and granule cells are transiently suppressed after severe forebrain ischemia. The depression of synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability may provide protection for neurons after ischemic insult.",
