     "AB": "Certain anesthetics exhibit neurotoxicity in the brains of immature but not mature animals. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, is excitatory on immature neurons via its action at the GABAA receptor, due to a reversed transmembrane chloride gradient. GABAA receptor activation in immature neurons is sufficient to open L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. As propofol is a GABAA agonist, we hypothesized that it and more specific GABAA modulators would increase intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i), resulting in the death of neonatal rat hippocampal neurons. Neuronal [Ca2+]i was monitored using Fura2-AM fluorescence imaging. Cell death was assessed by double staining with propidium iodide and Hoechst 33258 at 1 hour (acute) and 48 hours (delayed) after 5 hours exposure of neurons to propofol or the GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol, in the presence and absence of the GABA receptor antagonist, bicuculline, or the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine. Fluorescent measurements of caspase-3,-7 activities were performed at 1 hour after exposure. Both muscimol and propofol induced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i in days in vitro (DIV) 4, but not in DIV 8 neurons, that was inhibited by nifedipine and bicuculline. Caspase-3,-7 activities and cell death increased significantly in DIV 4 but not DIV 8 hippocampal neuronal cultures 1 hour after 5 hours exposure to propofol, but not muscimol, and were inhibited by the presence of bicuculline or nifedipine. We conclude that an increase in [Ca2+]i, due to activation of GABAA receptors and opening of L-type calcium channels, is necessary for propofol-induced death of immature rat hippocampal neurons but that additional mechanisms not elicited by GABAA activation alone also contribute to cell death.",
