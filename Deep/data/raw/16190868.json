     "AB": "The present study explored possible physiological and molecular mechanisms of pontine-wave (P-wave) generator activation-dependent memory processing in the rat using a two-way active-avoidance learning paradigm. The results show that learning training increased rapid eye movement sleep and activated brainstem cells in the P-wave generator. During this period, there was a time-dependent increase in phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the dorsal hippocampus and amygdala and increased synthesis of activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc) in the dorsal hippocampus, amygdala, frontal cortex and occipital cortex. Learning training also increased synthesis of brain-derived nerve growth factor (BDNF) in the occipital cortex, amygdala and dorsal hippocampus at different time intervals. During this time, the levels of nerve growth factor did not change. The results also show that the increase in rapid eye movement sleep P-wave density during the post-training 3-h recording session is positively correlated with the increased levels of phosphorylated CREB, BDNF and Arc in the dorsal hippocampus. These results suggest that memory processing of two-way active-avoidance learning may involve excitation of P-wave-generating cells in the brainstem and increased expression of phosphorylated CREB, Arc and BDNF in a time-dependent manner in the forebrain. These dynamic changes in cellular and molecular features provide considerable insight into the mechanisms of the P-wave generator activation-dependent memory consolidation process.",
