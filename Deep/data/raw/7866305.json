     "AB": "The effect of alloxan-induced diabetes was studied on the activity of Na+, K(+)-ATPase enzyme which is involved in numerous reactions in the metabolism of the synaptic region, Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity was examined in brain areas such as septum, amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus, pons and medulla, and in hypothalamic areas such as medial preoptic and median eminence-arcuate region. In all these areas studied, diabetes caused a decrease in the activity of Na+, K(+)-ATPase, whereas, insulin administration reversed this effect. The present results may indicate the possible involvement of Na+, K(+)-ATPase in neuropathophysiology of diabetes.",
