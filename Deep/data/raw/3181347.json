     "AB": "Embryonic Day 16 or 17 rat tissue containing either hippocampus with some medial pallial anlage or cerebellar/alar plate anlage was transplanted to the site of the ablated hippocampus of otherwise normal adult rats or adult rats previously exposed to the neurotoxin trimethyltin. Ninety to one hundred five days later these rats were compared to control rats in acquisition of passive avoidance and in open field activity. Transplantation of both types of tissue produced behavioral recovery on both tasks in rats with hippocampal lesions that had not been exposed to trimethyltin. Only hippocampal transplants produced recovery of function in rats given trimethyltin. Although transplants of hippocampal tissue had an organotypic structure that was easily differentiated with cell and fiber stains from that of the cerebellar transplants, neither of these routine histological procedures nor immunocytochemical analysis revealed differences between transplants made into normal rats or toxicant-exposed rats. Either of two mechanisms may account for the ability of the transplants to produce behavioral recovery. These are reconstruction of damaged circuitry by the transplant and neurotrophic action of the developing transplant on the host brain. The second mechanism alone may be sufficient to restore function in brain-lesioned but otherwise normal rats. Therefore, either type of transplant is effective. Both mechanisms may be necessary for recovery in brain-lesioned, toxicant-exposed rats. Therefore, only transplants of tissue homotypic to the tissue removed from the brain are effective.",
