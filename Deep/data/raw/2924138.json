     "AB": "The effects of carbachol (CCh), a cholinergic agonist, were compared in voltage-clamped hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vitro, obtained from normal and fimbria-fornix-lesioned rats. A substantial increase in sensitivity to the effects of CCh was seen in denervated neurons. The supersensitivity was demonstrated on both the inward leak current and the calcium-dependent potassium current, IAHP. These findings provide convincing evidence for cholinergic denervation supersensitivity in the hippocampus.",
