     "AB": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether the previously reported effect of chronic restraint stress (CRS) on hippocampal neuron morphology and spine density is paralleled by a similar change in the expression levels of synaptic scaffolding proteins. Adult male Wistar rats were subjected either to CRS (6 h/day) for 21 days or to control conditions. The resulting brains were divided and one hemisphere was impregnated with Golgi-Cox before coronal sectioning and autometallographic development. Neurons from CA1, CA3b, CA3c, and dentate gyrus (DG) area were reconstructed and subjected to Sholl analysis and spine density estimation. The contralateral hippocampus was used for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and protein analysis of genes associated with spine density and morphology (the synaptic scaffolding proteins: Spinophilin, Homer1-3, and Shank1-3). In the CA3c area, CRS decreased the number of apical dendrites and their total length, whereas CA1 and DG spine density were significantly increased. Analysis of the contralateral hippocampal homogenate displayed an increased gene expression of Spinophilin, Homer1, Shank1, and Shank2 and increased protein expression of Spinophilin and Homer1 in the CRS animals. In conclusion, CRS influences hippocampal neuroplasticity by modulation of dendrite branching pattern and spine density paralleled by increased expression levels of synaptic scaffolding proteins.",
