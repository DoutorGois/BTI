     "AB": "Considerable excitement surrounds new initiatives to develop techniques for simultaneous recording of large populations of neurons in cortical structures. This chapter focuses on the potential value of large-scale simultaneous recording for advancing research on current issues in the function of cortical circuits, including the interaction of the hippocampus with cortical and subcortical structures. The review describes specific research questions that could be answered using large-scale population recording, including questions about the circuit dynamics underlying coding of dimensions of space and time for episodic memory, the role of GABAergic and cholinergic innervation from the medial septum, the functional role of spatial representations coded by grid cells, boundary cells, head direction cells, and place cells, and the fact that many models require cells coding movement direction.",
