     "AB": "CA1 neurones of the adult rat hippocampal slice preparation were voltage clamped at or near -40 mV membrane potential using a single electrode clamp method. Depolarizing voltage commands from a holding potential of -40 mV elicited voltage-dependent inward Ca2+ currents comprising a fast and a slow component. The latter one was investigated for its susceptibility to inactivation, which was maximally expressed at around 0 mV membrane potential. When extracellular Ca2+ was replaced by Ba2+, inward currents became much larger and were followed by long tail currents. Similar data were observed in neurones injected with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. It is suggested that inactivation of the slow Ca2+ current depends at least partly on the levels of intracellular free Ca2+ in hippocampal neurones.",
