     "AB": "Immunohistochemical techniques have been used to investigate microglial reaction in Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseased (CJD) brains. Autopsy cases of six patients with CJD and age-matched controls were studied. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded brain tissue samples were stained with antibodies against major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen (Ag), leukocyte common antigen (LCA), CDw75, CD68 and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Of the patients with CJD, two with a subacute spongiform encephalopathic type and short-survival periods after onset of the disease showed an increased number of reactive microglia labeled with anti-MHC class II Ag or LCA in the affected cerebral cortex. In advanced cases of the panencephalopathic type of CJD, in which both cerebral atrophy and astrocytosis were marked, the increase of reactive microglia was small. Some vacuoles developing in the neuropil of the CJD patients were surrounded by MHC class II Ag- or LCA-immunoreactive microglial cells. The number of ramified microglia in the affected lesions was decreased, although their number in the hippocampus was not affected. These results indicate that microglia can frequently be involved in the process of CJD and may be activated at the early stage of the disease.",
