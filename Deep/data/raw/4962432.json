     "AB": "Intracellular recordings of archicortical neurons in a primate have been made and the responses of these neurons in awake, sitting animals have been observed. Electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulbs elicits excitatory postsynaptic potentials in these neurons, which unlike those evoked by septal stimulation, are subliminal for generating spikes. The olfactory and septal pathways may be considered representative of inputs from exteroceptive and interoceptive systems. The findings are discussed in relation to a paradigm for archicortical conditioning.",
