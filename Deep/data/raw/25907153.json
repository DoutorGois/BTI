     "AB": "While stress is often associated with an increased risk to develop (psycho) pathology, the initial response after exposure to stressors is often highly beneficial and allows individuals to optimally cope with challenging situations. Various neurotransmitters and neuromodulators - such as catecholamines and glucocorticoids - are released upon exposure to stressors and regulate behavioural adaptation to stress and enhance the storage of salient information. Studies over the past years have revealed that catecholamines and glucocorticoids regulate synaptic function and synaptic plasticity - which underlie memory formation - in a highly dynamic manner. In this brief review we will summarise how catecholamines and glucocorticoids regulate synaptic function and discuss how these effects may contribute to acquisition and storage of emotional information.
