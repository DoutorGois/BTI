Dengue is the most common flavivirus infection in Singapore, and is transmitted between humans by the Aedes mosquito. We report a 25-year-old man with dengue fever complicated by selective hippocampal involvement manifesting as amnesia. This has not been described in the literature previously. Dengue polymerase chain reaction and serology were positive. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed bilateral hippocampal involvement.",
