     "AB": "Testican is a putative extracellular heparan/ chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan of unknown function that is expressed in a variety of human tissues at widely different levels but is most abundant in the brain. In mice, testican mRNA has been detected only in brain and it is therefore likely to have an important function in the central nervous system. RNA blot analysis reveals the relative intensity of testican in various regions of the human brain. Levels of testican message are most pronounced in the thalamus, hippocampus, occipital lobe, nucleus accumbens, temporal lobe, and caudate nucleus, with somewhat lower levels in the cerebral cortex, medulla oblongata, frontal lobe, amygdala, putamen, spinal cord, substantia nigra, and cerebellum. In situ hybridization reveals the cellular distribution of the mRNA within these areas to be highest in neurons and in choroid plexus epithelium, and moderately lower in ependymal cells lining the ventricles and in vascular endothelial cells. Testican mRNA is not detected in oligodendrocytes or in most astrocytes. However, astrocytes in regions of reactive gliosis do express testican mRNA. These findings, along with a cysteine-rich pattern similarity to neurocan, brevican, versican, and other proteoglycans found in brain, suggest that testican may be a part of the specialized extracellular matrix of the brain.",
