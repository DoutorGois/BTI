     "AB": "Adult rats, exposed to ethanol in utero exhibit aberrant mossy fiber-like Timm staining in the distal infrapyramidal region of the hippocampus at midtemporal levels. The present study utilized the anterograde transport of HRP to verify that the aberrant pattern of Timm staining represented a terminal field of the dentate granule cells. One or more HRP-labeled mossy fiber bundles were shown to cross to the infrapyramidal side of the pyramidal cell layer primarily, but not exclusively, at the same septotemporal level where the aberrant terminal field was located.",
