     "AB": "From embryonic development to adulthood, the EphA4 receptor and several of its ephrin-A or -B ligands are expressed in the hippocampus, where they presumably play distinct roles at different developmental stages. To help clarify these diverse roles in the assembly and function of the hippocampus, we examined the cellular and subcellular localization of EphA4 in postnatal rat hippocampus by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. On postnatal day (P) 1, the EphA4 immunostaining was robust in most layers of CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus and then decreased gradually, until P21, especially in the cell body layers. At the ultrastructural level, focal spots of EphA4 immunoreactivity were detected all over the plasma membrane of pyramidal and granule cells, between P1 and P14, from the perikarya to the dendritic and axonal extremities, including growth cones and filopodia. This cell surface immunoreactivity then became restricted to the synapse-associated dendritic spines and axon terminals by P21. In astrocytes, the EphA4 immunolabeling showed a similar cell surface redistribution, from the perikarya and large processes at P1-P7, to small perisynaptic processes at P14-P21. In both cell types, spots of EphA4 immunoreactivity were also detected, with an incidence decreasing with maturation, on the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and vesicles, organelles involved in protein synthesis, posttranslational modifications, and transport. The cell surface evolution of EphA4 localization in neuronal and glial cells is consistent with successive involvements in the developmental movements of cell bodies first, followed by process outgrowth and guidance, synaptogenesis, and finally synaptic maintenance and plasticity.",
