     "AB": "A variety of neurotransmitters elicit a phosphoinositide response in the CNS; however, their effects on prostaglandin (PG) formation in the brain are not well characterized. In the present study, we investigated the effect of acetylcholine (ACh) on the synthesis of PGs E and F in slices from various regions of guinea pig brain incubated in glucose-fortified Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate saline. Slices were prewashed in the presence of 1% albumin to reduce basal PG levels followed by incubation for 30 min at 37 degrees C in the presence or absence of ACh. Under these conditions, 5 mM ACh significantly increased the efflux of PGE and PGF from brain regions enriched in muscarinic cholinergic receptors, i.e., cerebral cortex, temporal cortex, corpus striatum, and hippocampus. Depolarization by 45 mM KCl also significantly enhanced PG synthesis, and the relative magnitude of the effect was similar to that of ACh. The stimulation of PG synthesis by ACh was inhibited by 20 microM atropine, whereas the K+-induced stimulation was not. The effects of potassium and ACh were additive at maximally effective ACh concentrations, an observation that suggests that ACh and K+ increase PG efflux through independent mechanisms. Norepinephrine, histamine, and serotonin, three other neurotransmitters that evoke a phosphoinositide response in the brain, were ineffective in stimulating PG release from brain cortex slices.",
