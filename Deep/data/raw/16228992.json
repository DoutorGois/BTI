     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by neuronal degeneration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and subcortical neuronal degeneration in such nuclei as the locus coeruleus (LC). Transgenic mice overexpressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein V717F, PDAPP mice, develop several Alzheimer's disease-like lesions. The present study sought to determine whether there is also loss of LC noradrenergic neurons or evidence of degenerative changes in these animals. PDAPP hemizygous and wild-type littermate control mice were examined at 23 months of age, at a time when there are numerous amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus. Tissue sections were stained immunohistochemically with an antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to identify LC neurons. Computer imaging procedures were used to count the TH-immunoreactive somata in sections through the rostral-caudal extent of the nucleus. There was no loss of LC neurons in the hemizygous mice. In a second experiment, homozygous PDAPP and wild-type mice were examined, at 2 months and 24 months of age. Again there was no age-related loss of neurons in the homozygous animals. In the portion of the LC where neurons reside that project to the cortex and hippocampus, however, the neurons were decreased in size selectively in the 24-month-old transgenic animals. These data indicate that overt LC cell loss does not occur following abundant overexpression of Abeta peptide. However, the selective size reduction of the LC neuronal population projecting to cortical and hippocampal regions containing Abeta-related neuropathology implies that these cells may be subjected to a retrograde-mediated stress.",
