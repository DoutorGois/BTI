     "AB": "Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common form of epilepsy in humans. Oxidative stress is a mechanism of cell death induced by seizures. Buspirone presents anxyolitic and antidepressant effects due to their ability to stimulate 5-HT(1A) receptor. We studied the buspirone effects on oxidative stress in rat hippocampus after seizures and status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine. In pilocarpine group there was a significant increase in lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels. However, no alteration was observed in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. Buspirone pretreatment produces significantly reduction of the lipid peroxidation level (60%) and nitrite content (44%) as well as increased the superoxide dismutase (47%) and catalase (40%) activities in rat hippocampus after seizures, when compared with the pilocarpine group. The intraperitoneal injection of buspirone prior to pilocarpine suppressed the behavioral seizure occurrence. According to our results, the oxidative stress is present during seizures. Buspirone exerted anticonvulsant effects associated with the inhibition of the development of oxidative stress. These results suggest a therapeutic use potential of buspirone in epilepsy treatment.",
