     "AB": "The quantitative autoradiographic [14C]2-deoxyglucose technique (2DG) was applied to measure the effects of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced status epilepticus (SE) on local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (LCMRglc) in 10 (P10)-, 14 (P14)-, 17 (P17)- and 21 (P21)-day-old rats. To produce long-lasting SE (55 min), the animals received repetitive, timed intraperitoneal injections of subconvulsive doses of PTZ until SE was reached. At P10 and P14, SE induced a marked increase in LCMRglc which affected 66 of the 76 structures studied. Increases were especially high (200-400%) in limbic and motor cortices at P10 and in some brainstem areas at these 2 ages. At P17 and P21, average brain glucose utilization was similar in seizing and control rats, but in PTZ-treated rats reflected a redistribution in local metabolic rates with increases in brainstem, midbrain, hypothalamus and septum, decreases in cortex, hippocampus, some sensory areas and white matter and no change in many motor and limbic structures. In a few cerebral regions, such as hippocampus, dentate gyrus and mammillary body, LCMRglc did not increase at P10 and P14 and decreased at P17 and P21 in PTZ- vs. saline-treated rats. The results of the present study show that the immature brain responds to sustained seizure activity in a specific way according to its maturational state. Moreover, these data allow the mapping of the vulnerability of cerebral structures to seizures, according to their metabolic response to convulsions.",
