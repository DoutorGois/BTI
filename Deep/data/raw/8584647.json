     "AB": "A series of aliphatic N-methylpropargylamine MAO-B inhibitors have been synthesized and their structural and functional relationships have been investigated. 2-Hexyl-N-methylpropargylamine (2-HxMP), for example, has been found to be a highly potent, irreversible, selective, MAO-B inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo. The R-(-)-enantiomers are much more active than the S-(+)-enantiomers at inhibiting MAO-B activity. Some of these compounds protect mouse nigrostriatal dopamine neurons against the neurotoxin MPTP and the mouse hippocampal noradrenergic system against the neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4). They rescue hippocampal neurons after damage induced by ischemia and kainic acid treatment, as well as motoneurons in young mice following facial nerve axotomy. Such rescue effects are, interestingly, unrelated to inhibition of MAO-B activity. Some of the aliphatic propargylamines enhance the survival of neuroblastoma cells co-cultured with astrocytes following serum depletion. They stimulate the expression of AADC mRNA and inhibit GFAP mRNA expression. They do not possess amphetamine-like properties and exhibit no effect on noradrenaline or dopamine uptake nor do they increase hypertensive effects in the tyramine pressor test. Unlike R(-)-deprenyl, 2-HxMP does not potentiate dopamine toxicity in vitro. These new MAO-B inhibitors may possess significant chemotherapeutic implications for certain psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.",
