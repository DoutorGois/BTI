     "AB": "The spatial patterns of Lewy bodies (LB), senile plaques (SP), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) were studied in ubiquitin-stained sections of the temporal lobe in cases of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which varied in the degree of associated Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In all patients, LB, SP, and NFT developed in clusters and in a significant proportion of brain areas, the clusters exhibited a regular periodicity parallel to the tissue boundary. In the lateral occipitotemporal gyrus (LOT) and parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), the clusters of LB were larger than those of the SP and NFT but in the hippocampus, clusters of the three lesions were of similar size. Mean cluster size of the LB, SP, and NFT was similar in cases of DLB with and without significant associated AD pathology. LB density was positively correlated with SP and NFT density in 42 and 17% of brain areas analyzed, respectively, while SP and NFT densities were positively correlated in 7% of brain areas. The data suggest that LB in DLB exhibit similar spatial patterns to SP and NFT in AD and that SP and NFT exhibit similar spatial patterns in DLB and AD. In addition, in some instances, clusters of LB appeared to be more closely related spatially to the clusters of SP than to NFT.",
