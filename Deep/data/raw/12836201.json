     "AB": "While intense negative events are vividly recalled, information learned during stressful situations is poorly remembered. These differential effects of emotions and stress on memory have been attributed to the physiological manifestations generated during those affective states. Intense emotional and stressful events trigger the secretion of catecholamines and of glucocorticoids, in particular. These hormones would be modulatory agents of memory functions. In the first part of this paper, we review the specific effects emotions and stress have on memory. We then summarize the psychological and biological determinants responsible for these effects. Finally, we discuss different methodological issues that could explain the discrepancy found between the impact of emotions and stress on memory. Defining more precisely the effects emotion and stress have on memory will lead to a better comprehension of the cognitive problems that characterize patients dealing with emotional turmoil, such as patients suffering from depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.",
