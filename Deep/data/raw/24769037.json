     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Glutamate excitotoxicity and cyclic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are both recognized as important mediators in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether oral or subcutaneous monosodium glutamate (MSG) neurotoxicity mimics some features of AD and whether these can be reversed by the AMPK activator Pioglitazone. METHODS: Male Wistar rats aged 5 weeks were administered oral or subcutaneous MSG for 10 days with or without daily oral Pioglitazone. Two additional groups given only saline orally or subcutaneously acted as controls. At age 10 weeks the rats were subjected to neurobehavioral testing, then sacrificed for measurement of AMPK, beta-amyloid and Fas ligand in the hippocampus. RESULTS: Oral and subcutaneous MSG both induced a lowering of hippocampal AMPK by 43% and 31% respectively (P<0.05 for both) and >2-fold increase in hippocampal Fas ligand, a mediator of apoptosis (P<0.001 for both). MSG treatment also induced a significant increase in beta-amyloid in the hippocampus by >4-fold and >5-fold in the oral and subcutaneous groups. This was associated with increased latency before crossing to the white half in the black-white alley and before the first rear in the holeboard test, suggesting increased anxiety. Pioglitazone decreased hippocampal beta-amyloid accumulation and Fas ligand, but did not ameliorate the neurobehavioural deficits induced by MSG. CONCLUSIONS: MSG treatment enhances beta-amyloid accumulation in the rat hippocampus. Our results suggest a role for AMPK reduction in mediating the neurotoxic effects of glutamate, including beta-amyloid accumulation.",
