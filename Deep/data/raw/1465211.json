     "AB": "We compared the concentration of mRNA encoding the m1 and m2 muscarinic receptors in several brain regions obtained from young (5-8 months) and aged (24-28 months) male Fischer 344 rats. DNA-excess solution hybridization was employed as a quantitative measure of mRNA concentration. The results indicate the absence of changes in the m1 receptor message with aging in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum. While there was no statistically significant aging-associated alteration in the concentration of the message encoding the m2 receptor in the thalamus, midbrain, cerebellum and brainstem, there was a decrease in the message level in the hypothalamus.",
