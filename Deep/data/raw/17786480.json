     "AB": "Ionizing irradiation is an effective treatment for intracranial tumors but is limited by the potential adverse effects induced in surrounding normal brain. These effects can include cognitive impairments, and whereas the pathogenesis of such injury has not yet been definitively established, it may involve injury to the neurogenic cell population that exists in the dentate subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus. Understanding the issues surrounding this topic could have a major impact in the management of specific sequelae associated with cranial irradiation. Although radiation is now becoming a useful tool in investigations into the biology of neurogenesis, the perspective of this review is directed more toward the potential relevance of studying radiation and the stem/precursor cell response.",
