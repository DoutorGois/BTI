     "AB": "When animals are preexposed to a stimulus without consequence they are subsequently slower to associate this stimulus with an important event, such as footshock. This retarding effect of stimulus preexposure is called latent inhibition and can be demonstrated in a variety of classical and instrumental paradigms and in a wide range of species, including man. Latent inhibition is disrupted in acute schizophrenics and by amphetamine treatment in both rat and man. The present study investigated the role of hippocampal 5HT terminals in latent inhibition using a conditioned suppression procedure with male Sprague-Dawley rats. Microinjections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine in the fornix-fimbria significantly reduced hippocampal indoleamine levels and attenuated latent inhibition of conditioned suppression. This finding supports the hypothesis that the destruction of mesolimbic 5-hydroxytryptamine terminals reduces latent inhibition. This result is discussed in terms of the possible involvement of reduced serotonergic function in schizophrenic attentional disorder. In addition to the predicted lesion effect, biochemical analyses indicated that experimental treatments in the latent inhibition procedure altered neurotransmitter turnover: utilization ratios for 5-hydroxytryptamine and/or dopamine were increased in preexposed relative to nonpreexposed animals in four of the six brain regions sampled.",
