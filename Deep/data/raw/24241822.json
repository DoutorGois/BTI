     "AB": "To investigate the expression of CP in Down syndrome (DS) mouse model, we especially observed the changes in neuronal CP. We systematically analyzed the level of CP in Ts65Dn mouse, including serum CP concentration and enzymatic activity, CP mRNA in brain, the expression of CP protein in brain. The applied technologies were ELISA, chemical colorimetry, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry. Compared with the control group, there were no differences of significance in the concentration, enzymatic activity and unit activity of serum ceruloplasmin. By RT-PCR, we also found there were no significant differences in the level of CP mRNA. The expression of CP was positive in the endochylema of neuronal cells of both the groups, and there were no significant difference between the two groups. Meanwhile, there were no differences in four regions of the brain (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and cerebella). Although the neurotoxic effects of CP related to some neurodegenerative diseases, but whether it does so in DS remains to be determined.",
