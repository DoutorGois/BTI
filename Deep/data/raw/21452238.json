     "AB": "\"Surface-associated astrocytes\" (SAAs) in posterior piriform cortex (PPC) are unique by virtue of a direct apposition to the cortical surface and large-caliber processes that descend into layer I. In this study additional unique and functionally relevant features of SAAs in PPC of the rat were identified by light and electron microscopy. Examination of sections cut parallel to the surface of PPC and stained for glial fibrillar acidic protein revealed that, in addition to descending processes, SAAs give rise to an extensive matrix of \"superficial processes.\" Electron microscopy revealed that these superficial processes, together with cell bodies, form a continuous sheet at the surface of PPC with features in common with the glia limitans that is formed by endfeet in other cortical areas. These include a glia limiting membrane with basal lamina and similar associated organelles, including a striking array of mitochondria. Of particular interest, SAAs lack the domain organization observed in neocortex and hippocampus. Rather, superficial processes overlap extensively with gap junctions between their proximal regions as well as between cell bodies. Study of the descending processes revealed thin extensions, many of which appose synaptic profiles. We conclude that SAAs provide a potential substrate for bidirectional signaling and transport between brain and the pial arteries and cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space. We postulate that the spatially distributed character of SAAs in PPC reflects and supports the spatially distributed circuitry and sensory representation that are also unique features of this area.",
