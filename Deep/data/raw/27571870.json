     "AB": "Propofol is widely used for the induction and maintenance of pediatric anesthesia. Previous studies have indicated that propofol can induce apoptosis, and damage cognitive and memory functions. Dexmedetomidine is a potent alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist with high selectivity. Previous observations have shown that dexmedetomidine exhibits antiapoptotic qualities. The present study evaluated the neuroprotective effects of dexmedetomidine pretreatment against propofolinduced neurotoxicity in immature hippocampal neurons. The viability and apoptotic rate of the neurons were detected using a Cell Counting Kit8 assay and flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expression levels of brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Bcell lymphoma2 (Bcl2) and phosphorylatedcyclicAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) were detected using semiquantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses, respectively. These results showed that propofol exposure (100 microM; 3 h) reduced neuronal viability, induced cell apoptosis and decreased the expression levels of BDNF, Bcl2 and pCREB. Dexmedetomidine treatment (0.001100 microM) of the neurons prior to propofol exposure attenuated the propofolinduced neuronal apoptosis and increased expression levels of BDNF, Bcl2 and pCREB compared with the propofol only group. In addition, dexmedetomidine at the highest concentration provided superior neuroprotection of neurons. These in vitro data indicated that dexmedetomidine exerted direct neuroprotective effects to prevent cultured hippocampal neuronal injury caused by propofol, accompanied by an increase in the levels of pCREB, Bcl2 and BDNF.",
