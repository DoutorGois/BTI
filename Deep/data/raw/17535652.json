     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of microwave radiation on synaptic structure, characteristic of synaptosome, the contents and release of neurotransmitters in hippocampus in Wistar rats. METHODS: Wistar rats were exposed to microwave radiation with average power density of 30 mW/cm(2). Electron telescope was used to study the change of the synaptic structure at 6 h after radiation and to identify synaptosome. Flow cytometry and electron spin resonance were used to study the change of the concentration of Ca(2+) in synapse and the fluidity of membrane proteins of synaptosome. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and spectrophotometer were used to study the changes of contents and release of amino acids and acetylcholine in hippocampus. RESULTS: Microwave radiation of 30 mW/cm(2) caused deposits of synapse vesicle, elongation of active zone, the increase of thickness of postsynaptic density (PSD) and curvature, and perforation of synapse. The concentration of Ca(2+) in synapse (P<0.01) and tc of membrane proteins (P<0.01) of synaptosome increased contents of glutamic acid and glycine (P<0.01) and release of GABA increased the increase of contents and release of acetylcholine, and activity of acetyl cholinesterase (P<0.01) increased. CONCLUSION: Microwave radiation can induce the injure of synaptic structure and function of hippocampus, and then induce the disorder of the ability of learning and memory in rats.",
