     "AB": "We analyzed the development of the hippocamposeptal projection and the morphology of the neurons giving rise to this projection. The fluorescent tracer Dil was injected into the septal region or the hippocampus in fixed brains of embryonic and early postnatal rats. Anterogradely labeled hippocampal axons first reached the septal region at E16. They ran along the midline of the brain, thereby approaching the medial septum. Axons to the lateral septum were first observed around E18/19. The lateral septum is partly innervated by collaterals of axons that travel to the medial septum. The projection to the lateral septal nuclei becomes more massive during early postnatal stages, whereas that to the medial septum becomes smaller. Cells in the medial septum retrogradely labeled by injection into the hippocampus were first observed at E18. Thus, the hippocamposeptal projection is established earlier than the septohippocampal projection. The first hippocampal projection neurons are nonpyramidal neurons that appear to pioneer the pathway to the septum. Pyramidal cell axons follow this first cohort of axons into the medial septum. Pyramidal cells could be retrogradely labeled from the medial septum during the perinatal period but then diminished in number. At P10, only nonpyramidal cells were labeled by medial septal injections. This indicates that the pyramidal component of this projection is transient and is removed shortly after birth. However, as is known from other studies, hippocampal pyramidal cells give rise to a powerful projection to the lateral septum in adult animals. Our results show that there is a considerable remodeling of the projection from the hippocampus to the septum during ontogenetic development.",
