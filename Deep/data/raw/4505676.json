     "AB": "Incorporation of [(3)H]leucine into protein of eight different brain areas in rats was determined during 1 month of intermittent training for reversal of handedness. The incorporation values of all areas of the trained animals were lower than those of the controls. This finding was corroborated by autoradiography. After initial training the relative specific activities of the sensory-motor and entorhinal cortex and reticular formation were low compared to those of the hippocampus. With more training and time, these values became inversed.",
