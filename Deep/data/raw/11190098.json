     "AB": "Statistical analysis of EEG spectra averaged over 10-min periods showed that inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase physostigmine induced the long-term (tens of minutes) characteristic changes in the electric activity of the dorsal hippocampus (CA1 field) and somatosensory cortex of unrestrained rats. With increasing the physostigmine dose from 0.05 to 0.5 or 1 mg/kg the averaged power of the theta-rhythm did not rise in the range of 3.6-4.9 Hz and was suppressed in the range of 5.7-11.9 Hz both in the hippocampus and neocortex. The maximal frequency shifted to the left (from 3.6-6.4 to 3.6-4.9 Hz). In contrast to this, the averaged power in the delta (1-1.5 Hz)-I and beta-2 ranges (20.3-26.5 Hz) significantly nonlinearly increased and that of the beta-1 substantially decreased. Scopolamine eliminated all extrema of the hippocampal and neocortical EEG spectra induced by physostigmine, which is indicative of the role of M-cholinoreceptors in these effects. The increased dose of physostigmine (1 mg/kg) produced inversion of the ratio between the averaged power of beta-2 in neocortex and hippocampus: it became significantly higher than in the neocortex. All these data suggest that the mechanisms of cholinergic modulation of the theta- and beta-rhythms are essentially different. We think that significant enhancement of the content of endogenous acetylcholine content produce a long-term tonic decay of the functional activity of the hippocampus and neocortex and play an important role in the mechanisms of dissociated states of memory and consciousness, contextual learning and conditioned switching.",
