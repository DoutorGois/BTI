     "AB": "Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) patients show impaired ventilatory responses and loss of breathlessness to hypercapnia, yet arouse from sleep to high CO2, suggesting intact chemoreceptor afferents. The syndrome provides a means to differentiate brain areas controlling aspects of breathing. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine brain structures responding to inspired 5% CO2-95% O2 in 14 CCHS patients and 14 controls. Global signal changes induced by the challenge were removed on a voxel-by-voxel basis. A priori-defined volume-of-interest time trends (assessed with repeated measures ANOVA) and cluster analysis based on modeling each subject to a step function (individual model parameter estimates evaluated with t-test, corrected for multiple comparisons) revealed three large response clusters to hypercapnia distinguishing the two groups, extending from the 1) posterior thalamus through the medial midbrain to the dorsolateral pons, 2) right caudate nucleus, ventrolaterally through the putamen and ventral insula to the mid-hippocampus, and 3) deep cerebellar nuclei to the dorsolateral cerebellar cortex bilaterally. Smaller clusters and defined areas of group signal differences in the midline dorsal medulla, amygdala bilaterally, right dorsal-posterior temporal cortex, and left anterior insula also emerged. In most sites, early transient or sustained responses developed in controls, with little, or inverse change in CCHS subjects. Limbic and medullary structures regulating responses to hypercapnia differed from those previously shown to mediate loaded breathing ventilatory response processing. The findings show the significant roles of cerebellar and basal ganglia sites in responding to hypercapnia and the thalamic and midbrain participation in breathing control.",
