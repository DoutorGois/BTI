     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Cannabinoids play an important role in the suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production in the periphery and brain. In this study, we explored whether endogenous activation of cannabinoid (CB) 1 receptors (CB1Rs) affects interleukin (IL)-1beta levels in the mouse hippocampus under basal conditions and following stimulation with in vivo bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 250 mug/kg i.p.). METHODS: IL-1beta levels were determined in the hippocampi of wild-type (WT), CB1R-/- and P2X(7) receptor (P2X(7)R)-/- mice using an ELISA kit. RESULTS: Basal but not LPS-induced IL-1beta levels were downregulated when CB1R function was abrogated by genetic deletion, suggesting that endocannabinoids contributed to basal IL-1beta content in the mouse hippocampus. AM251 (3 mg/kg i.p.), an antagonist of CB1Rs, also inhibited basal IL-1beta protein in WT but not in CB1R-/- mice. In the absence of P2X(7)R, LPS-induced IL-1beta production was lower, while the inhibitory effect of CB1R antagonists on basal IL-1beta was significantly attenuated. The LPS-induced elevation in IL-1beta production was decreased in the presence of AM251 and AM281, with no significant difference between WT and P2X(7)R-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: CB1Rs are responsible for the modulation of basal IL-1beta levels in the hippocampus, while the effects of CB1 antagonists on systemic LPS-induced IL-1beta concentrations are independent of CB1Rs.",
