     "AB": "Our previous studies have shown that a single injection of kainic acid into the dorsal hippocampus of adult mice resulted in hypertrophy of the dentate gyrus granule cells. This hypertrophy was correlated with a long-lasting increase of brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA, and prevented by anti-sense brain-derived neurotrophic factor oligonucleotide treatment. These results suggest that an increase of brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA may be a major trigger of granule cells enlargement. However, the level of messenger RNA of Trk B, the high-affinity receptor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, was not increased significantly, raising the question of whether increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA level leads actually to an increased protein production. The objective of the present study was to examine this; changes in contents of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and TrkB protein were monitored by immunohistochemistry during kainic acid-induced hypertrophy. Results show that immunoreactivities of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and Trk B were present in enlarged granule cells. These immunoreactivities increased from two to 16 weeks after kainic acid injection and were maintained up to 12 months. Simultaneous increases of brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA and protein, and of TrkB protein were coupled tightly to the chronology of granule cell enlargement, suggesting that the action of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the induction and maintenance of kainic acid-induced granule cells enlargement is likely to be mediated by TrkB. The discrepancy between the previously described lack of increase of TrkB messenger RNA and the herein observed increase of the protein further reveals the existence of translational regulations of the receptor messenger RNA.",
