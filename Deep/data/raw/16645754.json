     "AB": "Interest in studies of synaptic plasticity have led to the development of specific methods for analyzing evoked postsynaptic currents: quantum analysis, component analysis, non-stationary fluctuation analysis, etc. However, the use and interpretation of these methods are not always consistent, which leads to the acquisition of contradictory results from similar experiments. In the present study, simulations were used to analyze the influences of the heterogeneity of the shapes of postsynaptic currents on the results obtained by non-stationary fluctuation analysis. Assessment of postsynaptic channel conductivity was found to depend on the number of synapses involved in generating the response. It is hypothesized that the increase in the assessment of AMPA channel conductivity reported in the literature in conditions of long-term potentiation may be related to changes in the synaptic composition of postsynaptic currents. The hypothesis was tested using a new method for independent component analysis. Studies using the simulation showed that the joint application of this method and non-stationary fluctuation analysis avoids errors of this type. The procedures developed here were applied to data obtained from physiological experiments; the results of this exercise provided general support for the hypothesis.",
