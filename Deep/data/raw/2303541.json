     "AB": "During early postischemic reperfusion, the vulnerable brain regions (e.g., hippocampal CA1) show a relatively high deoxyglucose accumulation. To investigate if this accumulation is a marker for the later-occurring regional cell death and to determine its cellular localization, we studied the glucose metabolism in the CA1 region post ischemia after removal of its pre- or postsynaptic components. A 20-min period of cerebral ischemia was used for selective removal of the main postsynaptic component in CA1 pyramidal cells, and a bilateral intraventricular injection of kainic acid for removal of the majority of presynaptic axon terminals in this region (and postsynaptic terminals and cell bodies in CA3). The glucose metabolism was studied in these two lesion types and in sham-operated animals before and after a period of ischemia. There was a 60% reduction of metabolism after ischemia in the nonvulnerable regions, whereas CA1 and sometimes CA3 showed a columnar pattern of high and low metabolism. CA1 and CA3 devoid of the postsynaptic component showed increased postischemic metabolism. The latter was due to the presence of macrophages, as demonstrated by an enzyme histochemical stain for nonspecific esterase. CA1 with no presynaptic component showed a postischemic depression of the glucose metabolism similar to the rest of the brain. It is suggested that the level of the postischemic glucose metabolism in the ischemia-vulnerable regions is determined by the presence of both synaptic components. The presence of macrophages in a region gives rise to apparently normal values of glucose metabolism.",
