     "AB": "Recent work has demonstrated that specific patterns of synaptic stimulation can induce long-term depression (LTD) in area CA1 that depends on activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and rapid protein synthesis. Here we show that the same form of synaptic modification can be induced by brief application of the selective mGluR agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). DHPG-LTD 1) is a saturable form of synaptic plasticity, 2) requires mGluR5, 3) is mechanistically distinct from N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)--dependent LTD, and 4) shares a common expression mechanism with protein synthesis-dependent LTD evoked using synaptic stimulation. DHPG-LTD should be useful for biochemical analysis of mGluR5- and protein synthesis-dependent synaptic modification.",
