Outcome in terms of seizure control (highly satisfactory in five patients) and neuropsychological sequelae (all cases had poor functioning of the contralateral temporal lobe pre-operatively) are detailed. In addition the use of post-operative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is demonstrated and shown to be a valuable tool in providing the crucially accurate baseline that is required for more meaningful follow-up outcome studies.",
