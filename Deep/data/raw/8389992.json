     "AB": "This study describes, using electron spin resonance spectrometry/spin trapping technique, the increase superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fraction of the cortex, midbrain, pons-medulla oblongata and cerebellum, and in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus of the aged rats. The results show that corresponding to the increased life span and improved physical conditions observed after peroral long-term treatment with Bio-catalyzer, a commercial natural fermented health food supplement marketed in Japan and in the Philippines and earlier reported to be a hydroxyl radical scavenger with weaker scavenging activity on superoxide radical (O-2), SOD which is involved in the metabolic degradation of O-2 was further increased, whereas TBARS decreased. These findings suggest that the increased SOD activity in the brain as a defense mechanism against age-related accumulation of reactive oxygen species, in particular superoxide radicals, was enhanced with Bio-catalyzer treatment while age-related peroxidation of neuronal membrane, as measured by TBARS, was decreased.",
