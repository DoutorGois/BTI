     "AB": "The content of Synapsin I (Protein I) was examined in brain regions of adult rats exposed to trimethyltin (TMT), and in control animals. Long Evans hooded rats were intragastrically dosed with 4 mg TMT hydroxide/kg body weight for 4 days. No perturbations in Synapsin I levels were evident by 24 h following the fourth dose; however, by 36 h, a significant decrease of 28% in Synapsin I level was present in the hippocampus of TMT treated animals. This decrease was selective, no other brain region examined was affected. As determined by regional analysis of inorganic tin, this specificity was not due to a profound preferential accumulation of tin in the hippocampus. Despite the absence of an alteration in Synapsin I levels at 24 h, morphological examination revealed perturbation in the normal uniform arrangement of granule cell neurons, with dead neurons diffusely distributed throughout the facia dentata. At 36 h, these changes were only slightly more extensive. In contrast, examination of the terminal projection area of these cells, the mossy boutons, showed to be unaffected at 24 h after the 4th dose of TMT. However, by 36 h, many of the mossy boutons contained dense bodies and showed signs of degeneration. This result suggested that the loss of Synapsin I coincides with degeneration of the nerve terminal region. In order to better establish the temporal correlation, a less severe dosing regimen (only 3 days of exposure to 4 mg TMT/kg body wt) was utilized to attenuate the time course of necrosis. Again, necrotic changes were visible in the perikaryon by 1 day after termination of toxicant dosing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
