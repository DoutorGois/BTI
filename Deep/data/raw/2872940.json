     "AB": "Leumorphin, an opioid peptide whose functions are unknown, is found in mammalian brain and pituitary and stimulates lordosis behavior in estrogen-treated female rats. To elucidate the role of leumorphin in the physiological control of female sexual behavior, the levels of immunoreactive (ir) leumorphin as well as ir dynorphin (dynorphin A) were measured in the rat brain and pituitary during the estrous cycle. There was a clear variation of ir leumorphin in the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary during the estrous cycle. The levels of ir leumorphin in the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary on the afternoon of proestrus were significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than those on the afternoons of estrus and metestrus. The rise in the hypothalamic levels of ir leumorphin on the afternoon of proestrus was correlated with the receptivity of lordosis during the estrous cycle. Furthermore, there was a close correlation with ir dynorphin levels. These findings are in agreement with studies demonstrating a common precursor for leumorphin and dynorphin. Ir leumorphin in the hippocampus and neurointermediate pituitary did not change significantly during the estrous cycle. Because the leumorphin antiserum used recognizes rimorphin (dynorphin B) 1.78 times more than porcine leumorphin on a molar basis, high performance-gel permeation chromatography was done on pooled extracts of hypothalamus taken at proestrus and estrus. The peak in the leumorphin-like substance in the activation of sexual behavior is discussed.",
