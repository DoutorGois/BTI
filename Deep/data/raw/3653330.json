     "AB": "Forebrain-bisected cats underwent kindling at primary and secondary amygdala sites. The behavioral effect of amygdala kindling was then examined according to the extent of the surgical lesion in the forebrain commissures. Bisection of the corpus callosum with or without lesion of the hippocampal commissure modified both kindling and kindled symmetrical generalized seizure into a lateralized and asymmetrical form. Lesion of the hippocampal commissure was correlated with the loss of the expected positive transfer effect at the secondary amygdala site. These results suggest that whereas the corpus callosum plays a major role in patterning convulsive generalization and generalized convulsion, the hippocampal commissure is involved in mediation of the transhemispheric positive transfer effect. Evidence of a callosal inhibitory influence on amygdala kindling was not obtained.",
