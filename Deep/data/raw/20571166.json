The present study was aimed at counting total number of neurons in CA1-4 sectors and the subiculum of the dog hippocampus as well as investigating possible left /right and male/female asymmetry. METHODS: Adult mongrel dogs (8 female and 5 male) were assessed by the right and left pawedness and sacrificed by exsanguinations. In each hippocampus dissected, the total neuron numbers of CAs and subiculum were estimated by the physical fractioning method. RESULTS: Significant hemispheric asymmetries were found in the number of pyramidal cells of CA1, CA3/2, CA4 and the subiculum. Sex difference was also found in the subiculum, in favour of the males. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our study indicated a left dominant asymmetry in males and right dominancy in females as well as no functional asymmetry in specific regions of the dog hippocampus. Further investigations are necessary to verify the hypothesis that hippocampal morphological asymmetries in normal subjects are functionally related in memory or in cognitive skills.",
