     "AB": "Epileptic syndromes are highly prevalent neurological conditions and can often be disabling. In order to find an alternative for treatment, this study evaluated anticonvulsant effects of carvacryl acetate (CA), a derivative of monoterpene carvacrol, after seizures induced by pilocarpine (P400), picrotoxin (PIC) or pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). We also analyzed the CA effects on Na+, K+-ATPase and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (delta-ALA-D) activities in hippocampus mice after seizures induced by P400, PIC or PTZ. In addition, glutamate, delta-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamine and aspartate levels in mice hippocampus treated with CA after seizures induced by P400, PIC or PTZ were also measured. CA produced anticonvulsant effects against seizures induced by P400, PIC or PTZ, and its effects were reversed by flumazenil, suggesting that action mechanism can be mediated by GABAergic system. CA increased GABA levels, but did not alter glutamate and aspartate concentrations in mice hippocampus after seizures induced by P400, PIC or PTZ when compared with seizures induced by P400, PIC or PTZ (p<0.05), respectively, as well as decreased glutamine content in mice hippocampus after seizures induced by PIC when compared with seizures induced by PIC (p<0.05). In addition, CA also increased Na+, K+-ATPase and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activities after seizures induced by P400, PIC or PTZ when compared with seizures induced by P400, PIC or PTZ (p<0.05), respectively. This study demonstrated that CA could be a future therapeutic option for treatment of epilepsy, with a multifactorial brain action mechanism.",
