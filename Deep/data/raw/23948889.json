     "AB": "Immunohistochemical staining has been used to determine expression patterns of the angiogenic transcription factor, Ets-1, in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) individuals. Brain tissue from non-demented controls showed little expression of Ets-1 whereas in AD brain tissue, Ets-1 was ubiquitously expressed in cortex and hippocampus. Double immunostaining with von Willerbrand factor demonstrated prominent Ets-1 intravascular immunoreactivity (ir) in AD cortical microvessels. In addition, Ets-1 also exhibited extravascular expression characterized by a diffuse pattern of Ets-1 ir in AD brain. Double staining also showed Ets-1 colocalization in microvasculature with the potent angiogenic agent, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Cell-associated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a pro-inflammatory cytokine with pro-angiogenic activity, was primarily associated with diffuse extravascular Ets-1 ir. Clusters of HLA-DR positive microglia, resident immune cells of brain which release TNF-alpha, were also localized with diffuse Ets-1. Intravascular Ets-1 ir was maximally co-localized with soluble amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), Abeta1-40, in microvasculature whereas diffuse extravascular Ets-1 ir appeared in proximity to Abeta plaques in brain parenchyma. Similar overall results were obtained for patterns of Ets-1 staining in AD hippocampal tissue. This work provides novel findings on expression of the angiogenic transcription factor, Ets-1, in vascular remodeling and its association with pro-angiogenic factors, reactive microglia, and Abeta deposition in AD brain.",
