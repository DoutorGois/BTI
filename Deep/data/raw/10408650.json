     "AB": "Twelve neurologically normal right-handed subjects were asked to remember the locations of eight representational drawings, presented one at a time, together with two landmarks (white squares), on a computer screen. Subjects were then scanned using positron emission tomography (PET) while performing forced-choice recognition of object location in four conditions, using either the original landmarks or two of the other objects as cues. In two conditions, the absolute location of the objects was unchanged from the time of encoding (fixed-array conditions), whereas in the other two, the location of the objects was shifted, although the spatial relationship among the objects and landmarks was maintained (shifted-array conditions). Subjects were also scanned in a control condition that made the same perceptual and motor demands as the recognition tasks but that had no mnemonic component. Compared to the control condition, all of the recognition tasks activated both the dorsal and ventral visual pathways bilaterally, but with notable asymmetries. In particular, activation in the right, but not left, inferior temporal gyrus (area 37) was observed when both shifted-array conditions were compared to their respective cue-matched fixed-array conditions. The recognition conditions with landmark cues were associated with focal increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the region of the right parahippocampal gyrus. The results support previous reports of involvement of the right mesial temporal region in object-location memory tasks, and suggest that right inferotemporal cortex is involved in extracting the invariant relational features of a visual scene.",
