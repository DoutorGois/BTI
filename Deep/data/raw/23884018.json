     "AB": "The single-chain variable fragment, scFv-h3D6, has been shown to prevent in vitro toxicity induced by the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide in neuroblastoma cell cultures by withdrawing Abeta oligomers from the amyloid pathway. Present study examined the in vivo effects of scFv-h3D6 in the triple-transgenic 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer disease. Prior to the treatment, five-month-old female animals, corresponding to early stages of the disease, showed the first behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia -like behaviors. Cognitive deficits included long- and short-term learning and memory deficits and high swimming navigation speed. After a single intraperitoneal dose of scFv-h3D6, the swimming speed was reversed to normal levels and the learning and memory deficits were ameliorated. Brain tissues of these animals revealed a global decrease of Abeta oligomers in the cortex and olfactory bulb after treatment, but this was not seen in the hippocampus and cerebellum. In the untreated 3xTg-AD animals, we observed an increase of both apoJ and apoE concentrations in the cortex, as well as an increase of apoE in the hippocampus. Treatment significantly recovered the non-pathological levels of these apolipoproteins. Our results suggest that the benefit of scFv-h3D6 occurs at both behavioral and molecular levels.",
