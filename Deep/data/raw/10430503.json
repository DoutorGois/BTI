     "AB": "Semaphorins/collapsins, a family of genes with a semaphorin domain conserved from insects through to mammals, are believed to be involved in axon guidance during neuronal development. We report the expression patterns of mouse semaphorin messenger RNAs. Among secreted semaphorins, mouse semaphorin H is structurally most similar to semaphorin III/D, the first semaphorin identified as a collapsing factor for sensory axons. However, its expression patterns apparently differ from those of semaphorin III/D. The messenger RNAs are distributed in the brain widely but unevenly during development, in particular, in the main olfactory bulb, hippocampus and pontine nucleus. In the trunk, the expression level is high in mesodermal tissues surrounding the dorsal root ganglia, while it is low in the spinal cord. Moreover, we examined whether this molecule has activity to collapse growth cones of sensory neurons, as well as semaphorin III/D. Mouse semaphorin H collapsed growth cones of sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion in a dose-dependent manner, and anti-neuropilin antibodies inhibited this activity. Taken together, these results suggest that mouse semaphorin H can function as a chemorepellent to guide sensory peripheral nerves, most likely via neuropilin as a receptor.",
