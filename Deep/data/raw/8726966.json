     "AB": "Examination of HP 184, [N-n-propyl)-N-(3-fluoro-4-pyridinyl) -1H-3-methylindodel-1-amine hydrochloride], in a variety of tests for serotonergic activity revealed some unique properties of this compound. We report here that 100 microM HP 184 enhanced spontaneous release of [3H]serotonin (5-HT) from rat hippocampal slices. This release was independent of the uptake carrier. In vivo assays confirmed that HP 184 (20 mg/kg, i.p.) lacked significant interactions at the norepinephrine (NE) or 5-HT uptake carrier itself. Notably, HP 184 (15 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced drinking behavior in schedule-induced polydipsic (SIP) rats. We previously reported that some selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors decrease SIP 30-40% after a 14-21 day treatment. In the current study, HP 184 decreased SIP beginning with the first treatment, and this reduction (30%) was maintained for 28 days. We further investigated HP 184 and serotonin metabolite levels. One hour after i.p. administration of 30 mg/kg HP 184, the ratio of whole brain 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) to 5-HT was increased, suggesting serotonergic activation. Under these conditions, the brain:plasma ratio of HP 184 was approximately 2:1, with brain concentrations of 1.6 micrograms/gram. We speculate that the spontaneous release effects of HP 184 may be responsible for the behavioral effects observed.",
