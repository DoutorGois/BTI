     "AB": "Lipopolysaccharide is derived from the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria and is a potent endotoxin which causes the release of cytokines in the CNS. We examined the effect of lipopolysaccharide on synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal area CA1-subicular pathway in vivo. We found that lipopolysaccharide did not affect baseline synaptic transmission in this pathway; it did, however, reduce the magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation, a form of short-term plasticity thought to be primarily presynaptic in origin. We then examined the interaction between lipopolysaccharide and two common models for the biological basis of memory: high-frequency stimulation induced long-term potentiation and low-frequency stimulation induced long-term depression of synaptic transmission. We found that lipopolysaccharide blocked long-term potentiation following high-frequency stimulation and also induced potentiation of synaptic transmission after low-frequency stimulation. Lipolysaccharide blocked paired-pulse facilitation selectively at short rather than longer interstimulus intervals. Thus, lipopolysaccharide has different effects on synaptic transmission in this pathway depending on the frequency and length of stimulation. These results provide new insights into the action of lipopolysaccharide on various forms of plasticity in the hippocampus, an area known to play a vital role in learning and memory.",
