     "AB": "Sex hormones may exert neuroprotective effects in various models of brain lesions. Male and female Long-Evans rats were subjected to intracerebroventricular injections of 2 microg 192 IgG-saporin or vehicle. Starting 2 days before surgery, half the male rats were treated with estradiol for 7 days. Three weeks after surgery, they were sacrificed for histochemical staining of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and densitometric evaluations. The lesion induced a substantial to dramatic decrease of the AChE-positive fiber density in the cingulate, somatosensory, piriform, retrosplenial and perirhinal cortices, and in the hippocampus. Weak effects were found in the striatum. There was no significant decrease in the dorsal thalamus. Sex had no significant effect on AChE-positive staining in any brain area. In males, estradiol treatment did not alter the effects of 192 IgG-saporin. These results show that sex or estradiol treatment in male rats does not interfere with the immunotoxic effects of intracerebroventricular injections of 192 IgG-saporin on cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain.",
