     "AB": "Membrane currents activated by step changes in membrane potential were studied in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of region CA3 using the single microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. The transient outward current activated by depolarizing steps appeared to be composed of two transient currents that could be distinguished by differences in voltage sensitivity, time course, and pharmacological sensitivity. The more slowly decaying current was activated by voltage steps positive to -60 mV and declined exponentially with a time constant between 200 and 400 ms. This current inactivated as the holding potential was made more positive over the range of -75 to -45 mV and was 50% inactivated near -60 mV. The more slowly decaying transient current was selectively blocked by 0.5 mM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) but not by 5-10 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA) or 2-5 mM Mn2+. The second transient current had a much faster time course than the 4-AP-sensitive current, having a duration of 5-20 ms. This very fast transient current was observed during potential steps positive to -45 mV. The fast transient current was inactivated when the holding potential was made positive to -45 mV. The amplitude of the fast transient current was greatly reduced by the application of 4 mM Mn2+ or Ca2+-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The fast transient current appeared to be unaffected by 0.5 mM 4-AP but was greatly reduced by 10 mM TEA. These results suggest that the transient outward current observed during depolarizing steps is composed of at least two distinct transient currents. The more slowly decaying current resembles the A-current originally described in molluscan neurons (9, 32, 42) in voltage sensitivity, time course, and pharmacological sensitivity. The faster transient current resembles a fast, Ca2+-dependent transient current previously observed in bull-frog sympathetic neurons (5, 27).",
