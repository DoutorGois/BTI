     "AB": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is the 34 kDa catalytic subunit of a recently characterized neuronal cdc2-like protein kinase which appears to be involved in regulation of the neurocytoskeleton. Using the rat postdecapitative model, the effect of brain ischemia on histone H1 and tau protein CDK5 phosphorylating activity was examined. Histone H1 kinase activity increased in both cytosolic and particulate fractions of the hippocampus and neocortex after 5 min and 15 min of ischemia, then declined to control levels. CDK5 tau protein phosphorylating activity increased after 15 min ischemia; however, no electrophoretic shifts or changes in radiodensity of the tau bands were observed autoradiographically. On Western blot analysis, the CDK5 protein band did not change after 25 min ischemia, despite the increase and subsequent decline in enzyme activity. These data demonstrate a postischemic increase in CDK5 activity, an associated increase in CDK5 tau phosphorylating activity and a decline in activity in the absence of massive proteolysis. CDK5 appears to play a role in the events associated with neuronal response to ischemic injury.",
