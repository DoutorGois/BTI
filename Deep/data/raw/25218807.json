     "AB": "AMPA receptor GluA2 subunits are strongly implicated in cognition, and prior work suggests that these subunits may be regulated by atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoforms. The present study assessed whether hippocampal and cortical AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit regulation may be an underlying factor in known age-related differences to cognitive-impairing doses of ethanol, and if aPKC isoforms modulate such responses. Hippocampal AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit, protein kinase Mzeta (PKMzeta), and PKCiota/lambda expression were elevated during adolescence compared to adults. 1 h following a low-dose (1.0-g/kg) ethanol exposure, hippocampal AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit serine 880 phosphorylation was decreased in adolescents, but was increased in adults. Age-dependent changes in GluA2 subunit phosphorylation were paralleled by alterations in aPKC isoforms, and zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) administration prevented ethanol-induced increases in both in adults. Ethanol-induced changes in GluA2 subunit phosphorylation were associated with delayed regulation in synaptosomal GluA2 subunit expression 24 h later. A higher ethanol dose (3.5-g/kg) failed to elicit changes in most measures in the hippocampus at either age. Similar to the hippocampus, analysis of cerebral cortical tissue also revealed age-related declines. However, no demonstrable effects were found following a low-dose ethanol exposure at either age. High-dose ethanol exposure reduced adolescent GluA2 subunit phosphorylation and aPKC isoform expression that were again accompanied by delayed reductions in synaptosomal GluA2 subunit expression. Together, these results suggest that GluA2-containing AMPA receptor modulation by aPKC isoforms is age-, region- and dose-dependently regulated, and may potentially be involved in developmentally regulated ethanol-induced cognitive impairment and other ethanol behaviors.",
