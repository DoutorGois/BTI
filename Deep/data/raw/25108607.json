     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Electrical high frequency stimulation (HFS) has been shown to suppress seizures. However, the mechanisms of seizure suppression remain unclear and techniques for blocking specific neuronal populations are required. OBJECTIVE: The goal is to study the optical HFS protocol on seizures as well as the underlying mechanisms relevant to the HFS-mediated seizure suppression by using optogenetic methodology. METHODS: Thy1-ChR2 transgenic mice were used in both vivo and in vitro experiments. Optical stimulation with pulse trains at 20 and 50 Hz was applied on the focus to determine its effects on in vivo seizure activity induced by 4-AP and recorded in the bilateral and ipsilateral-temporal hippocampal CA3 regions. In vitro methodology was then used to study the mechanisms of the in vivo suppression. RESULTS: Optical HFS was able to generate 82.4% seizure suppression at 50 Hz with light power of 6.1 mW and 80.2% seizure suppression at 20 Hz with light power of 2.0 mW. The suppression percentage increased by increasing the light power and saturated when the power reached above-mentioned values. In vitro experimental results indicate that seizure suppression was mediated by activation of GABA receptors. Seizure suppression effect decreased with continued application but the suppression effect could be restored by intermittent stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that optical stimulation at high frequency targeting an excitatory opsin has potential therapeutic application for fast control of an epileptic focus. Furthermore, electrophysiological observations of extracellular and intracellular signals revealed that GABAergic neurotransmission activated by optical stimulation was responsible for the suppression.",
