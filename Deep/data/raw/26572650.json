     "AB": "During systems consolidation, memories are spontaneously replayed favoring information transfer from hippocampus to neocortex. However, at present no empirically supported mechanism to accomplish a transfer of memory from hippocampal to extra-hippocampal sites has been offered. We used cultured neuronal networks on multielectrode arrays and small-scale computational models to study the effect of memory replay on the formation of memory traces. We show that input-deprived networks develop an activity<-->connectivity balance where dominant activity patterns support current connectivity. Electrical stimulation at one electrode disturbs this balance and induces connectivity changes. Intrinsic forces in recurrent networks lead to a new equilibrium with activity patterns that include the stimulus response. The new connectivity is no longer disrupted by this stimulus, indicating that networks memorize it. A different stimulus again induces connectivity changes upon first application but not subsequently, demonstrating the formation of a second memory trace. Returning to the first stimulus does not affect connectivity, indicating parallel storage of both traces. A computer model robustly reproduced experimental results, suggesting that spike-timing-dependent plasticity and short time depression suffice to store parallel memory traces, even in networks without particular circuitry constraints.",
