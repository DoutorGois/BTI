     "AB": "The hippocampal CA1 neurons are selectively vulnerable to global ischemia, and neuronal death occurs in a delayed manner. The threshold of global ischemia duration that induces neuronal death has been studied, but the relationship between ischemia duration and glial death in the hippocampal CA1 area has not been fully studied. We examined neuronal/glial viability and morphological changes in the CA1 subregion after different durations of global ischemia. Global ischemia was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by 10, 5, and 3 min of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion and hypotension. At 1-56 days after ischemia, the morphological reactions of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia were immunohistochemically evaluated. Most of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons underwent delayed death at 3 days after 10/5 min of ischemia, but not after 3 min of ischemia. The number of astrocytes gradually declined after 10/5 min of ischemia, and viable astrocytes showed characteristic staged morphological reactions. Oligodendrocytes also showed morphological changes in their processes after 10/5 min of ischemia. Microglia transformed into a reactive form at 5 days only after 10/5 min of ischemia. These data suggest that some morphological changes in glial cells were not dependent on neuronal cell death, but their own reactions to the different severity of ischemia.",
