     "AB": "The relationship between the entorhinal cortex and prepulse inhibition (PPI) as well as dopaminergic participation in this relationship were examined. PPI is an operational measure of sensorimotor gating in which a robust response to a startling auditory pulse stimulus is inhibited when the stimulus is preceded by a weak prepulse. PPI can be measured in various species and is reduced in several neuropsychiatric disorders and in dopamine-activated rats. The entorhinal cortex was damaged bilaterally using ibotenic acid, and acoustic startle experiments were performed during treatment with haloperidol or saline on day 21 after the ibotenic acid injection. Neither this injection nor haloperidol affected the amplitude of the startle movement. Bilateral entorhinal cortex lesions reduced PPI, while haloperidol partially restored it. The entorhinal cortex and the sensorimotor gating system therefore may be related via dopaminergic circuits, possibly including the nucleus accumbens. Further, as the entorhinal cortex provides the major extrinsic synaptic input to the rat hippocampus, disease involvement of this region may severely affect cognition in various disorders including schizophrenia.",
