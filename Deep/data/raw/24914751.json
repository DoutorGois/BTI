     "AB": "The application of stereologic techniques to the analysis of the nervous system has greatly contributed to the evaluation of the normal and pathological anatomy of the aging brain. Currently, the hippocampus still holds secrets about the aging process. Experimental researches on hippocampus morphology may contribute to the future researches. This study presents the volume and weight of left hippocampus using a stereological technique on light microscope. The mean weight of the encephalon without cerebellum was 6.1 +/- 0.1 g. The mean weight and the volume of the hippocampus were (mean +/- SD) 0.28 +/- 0.02 g and 0.28 +/- 0.02 cm3, respectively. The mean coefficient of error for the stereological volume estimation of the hippocampus was 0.03. The individual volume estimation of the subjects may be achieved by the Cavalieri method. Investigators believed that the findings and the applied technique in this study may be useful for clinicians.",
