     "AB": "The direct analysis of drug distribution of rotigotine-loaded microspheres (RoMS) from tissue sections by liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was demonstrated. The RoMS distribution in rat tissues assessed by the ambient LESA-MS/MS approach without extensive or tedious sample pretreatment was compared with that obtained by a conventional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method in which organ excision and subsequent solvent extraction were commonly employed before analysis. Results obtained from the two were well correlated for a majority of the organs, such as muscle, liver, stomach, and hippocampus. The distribution of RoMS in the brain, however, was found to be mainly focused in the hippocampus and striatum regions as shown by the LESA-imaged profiles. The LESA approach we developed is sensitive enough, with an estimated LLOQ at 0.05 ng/mL of rotigotine in brain tissue, and information-rich with minimal sample preparation, suitable, and promising in assisting the development of new drug delivery systems for controlled drug release and protection. Graphical abstract Workflow for the LESA-MS/MS imaging of brain tissue section after intramuscular RoMS administration.",
