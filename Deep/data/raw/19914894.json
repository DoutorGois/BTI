     "AB": "Previous studies suggested that gamma oscillations in the brain are associated with higher order cognitive functions, including selective visual attention, motor task planning, sensory perception, working memory, and dreaming rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These oscillations are mainly observed in the cortical regions and also occur in neocortical and subcortical areas and hippocampus. These oscillations may occur under certain pathological conditions, such as epilepsy, and are mainly observed in the cortical regions and hippocampus. The previous studies have suggested that epilepsy may be associated with disturbances of autonomic nervous system(ANS) and with changes in autonomic cardioregulatory function. In this article, we investigate the influence of acute exposure to 2-aminoethoxy-diphenylborate (2-APB), a membrane-permeable inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP) receptor, and store-operated Ca(2+) channel (SOC) blocker on the complexity of hippocampal gamma oscillations. Our central hypothesis is that acute exposure to 2-APB significantly reduces the hippocampal gamma oscillations. To test this hypothesis, we use brain-slice recordings and the advanced nonlinear dynamical analysis method based on the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) estimator. Our nonlinear dynamical analysis results estimated from brain-slice recordings suggested that 2-APB exposure significantly reduces the hippocampal gamma oscillations.",
