     "AB": "A recent assertion that new neurons are continually added to the neocortex of adult macaque monkeys has profound implications for understanding the cellular mechanisms of higher cognitive functions. Here we searched for neurogenesis in adult macaques by using immunofluorescent triple labeling for the DNA-replication indicator, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and neuronal and glial cell markers. Although numerous BrdU-labeled cells were distributed throughout the cerebral wall, including the neocortex, these were identified as nonneuronal cells; evidence for newly generated neurons was limited to the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. Thus, our results do not substantiate the claim of neurogenesis in normal adult primate neocortex.",
