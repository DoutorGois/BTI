     "PG": "41-50",
     "AB": "Effects of budralazine, a new antihypertensive drug, on regional circulation in various sites of brain and extracranial skeletal muscle and skin in curarized, artificially respirated cats were studied using the thermoelectrical method. Budralazine produced an increase in blood flow in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Effects of the drug on blood flow in the hypothalamus and amygdala were inconsistent. Budralazine produced an apparent increase in muscular blood flow, whereas the drug did not consistently alter dermal blood flow. Budralazine produced a mild and sustained fall in blood pressure, particularly after the repeated administration. Thus, the action of budralazine seems to be mainly one of a smooth muscle relaxant effect. The mode of action of the drug seems to differ from that of papaverine or hydralazine.",
