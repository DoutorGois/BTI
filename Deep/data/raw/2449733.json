     "AB": "Abnormal functional activity induces long-lasting physiological alterations in neural pathways that may play a role in the development of epilepsy. The cellular mechanisms of these alterations are not well understood. One hypothesis is that abnormal activity causes structural reorganization of neural pathways and promotes epileptogenesis. This report provides morphological evidence that synchronous perforant path activation and kindling of limbic pathways induce axonal growth and synaptic reorganization in the hippocampus, in the absence of overt morphological damage. The results show a previously unrecognized anatomic plasticity associated with synchronous activity and development of epileptic seizures in neural pathways.",
