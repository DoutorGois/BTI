     "AB": "Measurement of cholinergic muscarinic receptor binding in various rat brain areas using the ligand [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate indicates that receptor binding is decreased in striatum and cerebellum of aged female rats (22 months old) as compared to younger rats (4 months old). Decreases were not observed in cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, or amygdala areas. Further examination o [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding in subcellular fractions of aged and young rat cerebellum and striatum indicated a decrease in binding in the crude nuclear and crude synaptosomal fractions. Binding data indicate the observed decrease in specific ligand binding is due to a decrease in number of binding sites while receptor affinity does not appear to change.",
