     "AB": "The effect of glutaurine (gamma-L-glutamyl-taurine, Litoralon) was studied on dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin turnover in the hypothalamus, mesencephalon, amygdala, septum, hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum following intracerebroventricular administration. Dopamine and norepinephrine turnover, measured by alpha-methyl-paratyrosine inhibition of catecholamine synthesis, increased in the cerebellum and the norepinephrine turnover in the hypothalamus. Serotonin turnover, measured by serotonin accumulation induced by the MAO inhibitor pargyline, decreased in the mesencephalon. There was no change in catecholamine or serotonin turnover in the amygdala, septum, hippocampus and cortex. The data suggested a highly selective action of glutaurine on brain transmitters in certain brain areas, especially in the cerebellum.",
