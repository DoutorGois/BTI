     "AB": "Mitochondrion, the primary source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is also the target of ROS. 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) is the major end-product of damaged DNA caused by ROS. In our previous studies, we showed that prenatal stress (PNS) preferentially caused cognitive dysfunction and increased ROS in the hippocampus of female offspring rats. The present study aimed to determine 8-OH-dG level of mitochondria in order to elucidate the mechanism of hippocampal pyramidal neuronal damage and cognitive dysfunction induced by PNS. Pregnant rats were divided into two groups: control group (undisturbed) and PNS group (exposed to a restraint stress for 7 days at the late stage of gestation). Offspring rats were divided into four groups: female-control group, male-control group, female-stress group, male-stress group and used at 30-day-old after their birth. The content of 8-OH-dG was determined by high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). The results showed that the contents of 8-OH-dG in female and male prenatal stressed offspring were significantly higher than that in their respective controls (P < 0.001). 8-OH-dG level was significantly higher in the female-stress group than in the male-stress group (P < 0.05), whereas there was no any gender-dependent difference in the control groups. These results suggest that accumulation of oxidative mitochondrial DNA damage may play an important role in PNS-induced cognitive dysfunction in female offspring rats.",
