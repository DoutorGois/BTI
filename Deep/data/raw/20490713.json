     "AB": "Bilobalide (BB), a sesquiterpene trilactone from Ginkgo biloba has been proposed to have protective effects on mitochondrial function. Using ovariectomized rats to mimic the post-menopausal pathophysiological changes in women, this study demonstrated that BB treatment could prevent estrogen withdrawal-induced decrease in mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate content, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COXI) mRNA and protein levels and COX activity in hippocampal tissues as effectively as estradiol benzoate. But neither ovariectomy nor BB treatment affected citrate synthase activity. These results suggested that BB was able to regulate COX activity via up-regulation of the gene and protein expression of its mitochondrial DNA-coded subunits, and modulation of COX activity by BB might contribute to its protective effects on mitochondrial function. Given that ovariectomy induces decrease in estrogen levels similar to that of menopause, BB may be useful in developing therapy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease in post-menopausal females.",
