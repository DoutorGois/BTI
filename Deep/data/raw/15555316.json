     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of deltamethrin on the apoptotic rate and the expression of caspase-3 in rat neural cells. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: control, 5 h, 24 h, 48 h and 5 d exposed groups. Apoptotic rate and the expression of caspase-3 were measured by FACS420 Flow Cytometer; Ac-DEVD-pNa was used as a substrate to detect the activity of caspase-3. RESULTS: Apoptotic rates in 24 h, 48 h and 5 d exposed groups in hippocampus and cerebral cortex [hippocampus: (8.45 +/- 1.02)%, (9.44 +/- 1.14)%, (7.58 +/- 0.75)%; cerebral cortex: (7.90 +/- 0.49)%, (8.01 +/- 0.87)%, (7.97 +/- 0.41)% respectively] were higher than those in the control [hippocampus: (2.97 +/- 0.36)%; cerebral cortex: (3.50 +/- 0.48)%] (P < 0.01); the activity of caspase-3 in 5 h, 24 h and 48 h exposed groups (A(405) nm in hippocampus: 0.389 +/- 0.038, 0.472 +/- 0.041, 0.295 +/- 0.049; A(405) nm in cerebral cortex: 0.321 +/- 0.068, 0.429 +/- 0.077, 0.344 +/- 0.047) and 5 d group of hippocampus (0.246 +/- 0.065) were all higher than those of the control (hippocampus: 0.184 +/- 0.054; cerebral cortex: 0.198 +/- 0.049) (P < 0.05, P < 0.01); the expression of caspase-3 in 5 h, 24 h and 48 h exposed groups increased apparently while 5 d group did not. CONCLUSION: Exposure to high dose of deltamethrin would affect the apoptosis, the activity and expression of caspase-3 in rat neural cells. The increase in caspase-3 activity and expression occurred before the rising of neuronal apoptotic rate may be the upstream event of apoptosis.",
