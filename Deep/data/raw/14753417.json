     "AB": "To explore effects of Immunosuppressant FK506 on signal transduction pathway. we studied changes in subcellular distribution of protein kinase Cgamma (PKCgamma), CaM kinase II (CaMKII), as well as changes of tyrosine phosphorylation levels after ischemia. Male Mongolian gerbils were divided into 3 groups; FK506 (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg) and vehicle. FK506 was administered intravenously after 5 min ischemia. At the designated time points (0 time, 5 min ischemia, 1 hour, or 24 hour recovery), heads were frozen and samples were taken from CAI subfield of hippocampus. Western blot analysis was carried out with specific antibodies for PKCgamma, CaMKII, and phosphotyrosine. FK506 administration significantly decreased translocation of PKCgamma and CaMKII at 24 h of recovery (p < 0.05, ANOVA followed by Student-Newman Keuls' test) in P2 fraction. The levels of tyrosine phosphorylated p160, p140, p100, p90, and p80 in P2 fraction were also significantly decreased with FK506 treatment at 24 h of recovery. The persistently elevated PKCgamma and CaMKII level in P2 fraction which may be related to cell death, are attenuated with FK506 treatment. FK506 may contribute to recover calcium homeostasis in the post ischemic phase and promote cell survival.",
