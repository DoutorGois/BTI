     "AB": "Perfusates from the brains of freely moving cats, obtained by means of a push-pull cannula, contain high concentrations of proteins. The levels vary in a cyclic fashion and are higher during rapid eye movement sleep than during the waking state. The proteins represent a distinctive class of tissue protein and their changing levels appear to reflect an alteration in the protein content of the extracellular space of brain related to behavioral state.",
