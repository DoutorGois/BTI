     "AB": "Historical aspects of neuroanatomical schizophrenia research and recent findings in limbic and basal ganglia structures of schizophrenia are briefly reviewed. Then, results of volume measurements of these brain regions from 26 schizophrenics and 28 controls belonging to our new brain collection are presented. Volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, stria terminalis and caudate were bilaterally significantly reduced, the internal pallidum showed a trend towards smaller volumes, while brain weight, putamen, nucleus accumbens and external pallidum were unchanged. The results give further evidence of subtle focal brain tissue reductions in schizophrenics. Finally, gaps in our present knowledge in the neuropathology of schizophrenia and some basic problems in this research field are discussed.",
