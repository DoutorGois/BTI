     "AB": "The potential to exhibit synaptic plasticity itself is modulated by previous synaptic activity, which has been termed as metaplasticity. In this paper, we demonstrated that the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 2B (NR2B) subunit in NNDA receptors was required for hippocampal metaplasticity at Schaffer collateral-commissural fiber-CA1 synapses. Brief 5 Hz priming stimulation did not cause long-term synaptic plasticity; however, it could result in the inhibition of subsequently evoked long-term potentiation (LTP). Meanwhile, the application of selective antagonists for NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors after delivering priming stimulation could block the metaplasticity. In contrast, LTP induction was not affected by NR2B antagonists in slices without pre-treatment of priming stimulation. These results indicated that the activation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors was required for metaplasticity.",
