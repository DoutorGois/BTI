     "AB": "During prolonged nonconvulsive unilateral left limbic status epilepticus, a natural model of functional hemispheric inhibition, we performed two tachistoscopic experiments, a lexical decision task associated with a RVF (left hemisphere) superiority and a facial matching task associated with a LVF (right hemisphere) superiority. We found that epileptic activity in the left hemisphere, especially rhythmic high-frequency \"tonic\" discharges, inhibited performance on the lexical task but not on the facial matching task. This suggests that only cognitive activity in the discharging hemisphere is inhibited. Strikingly, the best performance of the right hemisphere was obtained while the left hemisphere was most inhibited, suggesting a functional balance of inhibition and release.",
