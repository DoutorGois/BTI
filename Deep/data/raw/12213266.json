     "AB": "Selective antagonists of mGlu1 metabotropic glutamate receptors attenuate neuronal death in models of cerebral ischemia. Because GABAergic mechanisms have recently been proposed to contribute to these neuroprotective effects, we examined the effects of selective mGlu1 antagonists characterized in our laboratory on GABAergic transmission in three different models of neuropathology. In rat organotypic hippocampal slices exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation, the mGlu1 antagonists AIDA, CBPG and 3-MATIDA reduced CA1 pyramidal cell loss when added to the medium during the insult and the subsequent recovery period. This effect was mimicked by the GABA(A) and GABA(B) agonists muscimol and baclofen and partially prevented by the antagonists bicuculline and CGP 55845. In gerbils subjected to global ischemia, protection of CA1 pyramidal cells by transdialytic perfusion of AIDA and CBPG was associated with a significant increase in the basal and ischemic output of GABA and minor changes in the output of glutamate. In a mouse cortical wedge model, both muscimol and 3-MATIDA reduced the frequency of spontaneous bursts induced by 4-aminopyridine and this reduction was prevented by co-perfusion with bicuculline. Taken together, our results suggest that the release of GABA, and the subsequent activation of GABA receptors, may contribute to the attenuation of post-ischemic neuronal damage and epileptiform activity induced by mGlu1 receptor antagonists.",
