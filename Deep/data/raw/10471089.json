     "AB": "In order to better understand the mechanism(s) of action of carbamazepine (CBZ), we studied its effects on the increase in [Ca2+]i and [Na+]i stimulated by glutamate ionotropic receptor agonists, in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, as followed by indo- or SBFI fluorescence, respectively. CBZ inhibited the increase in [Ca2+]i stimulated either by glutamate, kainate, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA), or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), in a concentration-dependent manner. In order to discriminate the effects of CBZ on the activation of glutamate receptors from possible effects on Ca2+ channels, we determined the inhibitory effects of Ca2+ channel blockers on [Ca2+]i changes in the absence or in the presence of CBZ. The presence of 1 microM nitrendipine, 0.5 microM omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTx GVIA), or of both blockers, inhibited the kainate-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i by 51.6, 32.9 or 68.7%, respectively. In the presence of both 100 microM CBZ and nitrendipine, the inhibition was similar (54.1%) to that obtained with nitrendipine alone, but in the presence of both CBZ and omega-CgTx GVIA, the inhibition was greater (54%) than that caused by omega-CgTx GVIA alone. However, CBZ did not inhibit the increase in [Na+]i stimulated by the glutamate receptor agonists, but inhibited the increase in [Na+]i due to veratridine. Tetrodotoxin, or MK-801, did not inhibit the influx of Na+ stimulated by kainate, indicating that Na+ influx occurs mainly through the glutamate ionotropic non-NMDA receptors. Moreover, LY 303070, a specific AMPA receptor antagonist, inhibited the [Na+]i response to kainate or AMPA by about 70 or 80%, respectively, suggesting that AMPA receptors are mainly involved. Taken together, the results suggest that CBZ inhibits L-type Ca2+ channels and Na+ channels, but does not inhibit activation of glutamate ionotropic receptors.",
