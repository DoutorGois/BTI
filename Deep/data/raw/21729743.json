     "AB": "Curcumin has considerable neuro-protective and anti-cancer properties but is rapidly eliminated from the body. By optimizing the HPLC method for analysis of curcumin, this study evaluates how the ability of curcumin to penetrate organs and different regions of the brain is affected by nanoparticulation to increase curcumin circulation time in the body. Curcumin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (C-NPs) were prepared by the high-pressure emulsification-solvent evaporation method. The mean particle size and entrapment efficiency were 163nm and 46.9%, respectively. The release profile of C-NPs was an initial burst effect followed by sustained diffusion. In distribution studies, curcumin could be detected in the evaluated organs, including liver, heart, spleen, lung, kidney and brain. C-NPs were found mainly in the spleen, followed by the lung. Formulation significantly raised the curcumin concentration in these organs with increases in the AUC, t(1/2) and MRT of curcumin, though this was not apparent in the heart. Curcumin and C-NPs could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to enter brain tissue, where it was concentrated chiefly in the hippocampus. Nanoparticulation significantly prolonged retention time of curcumin in the cerebral cortex (increased by 96%) and hippocampus (increased by 83%). These findings provide further understanding for the possible therapeutic effects of curcumin and C-NPs in further pre-clinical and clinical research.",
