     "AB": "2-Carboxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline derivatives, derived from kynurenic acid, have been synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antagonist activity at the glycine site on the NMDA receptor. 2,3-Dihydrokynurenic acids show reduced potency relative to the parent lead compounds (Table I) possibly as a result of conformational effects. Removal of the 4-oxo group results in further reduced potency, but introduction of a cis-carboxymethyl group to the 4-position restores antagonist activity (Tables III and IV). Replacement of the keto group of 5,7-dichloro-2,3-dihydrokynurenic acid with other alternative H-bonding groups, for example cis- and trans-benzyloxycarbonyl and cis- and trans-carboxamido (Table V), gives comparable activity, but there is negligible stereoselectivity. A significant increase in potency and stereoselectivity is seen within the 4-acetate series (Table VI). The trans-4-acetic acid is significantly more potent than the corresponding lead kynurenic acid and has 100-fold greater affinity than the cis isomer. The results are consistent with a requirement in binding for a pseudoequatorially placed 2-carboxylate and clearly demonstrate the importance for binding of a correctly positioned hydrogen-bond-accepting group at the 4-position. The high-affinity binding of an anionic group in the 4-substituent binding pocket suggests that the glycine site and the neurotransmitter recognition (NMDA) site may have some features in common.",
