     "AB": "Mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) cause frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Clinical variability is seen not only among families with different mutations, but also among family members with the same mutation. We investigated a newly identified familial frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism family. The disease was of early onset and was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Clinically, parkinsonism was the prominent and often early feature, and it preceded dementia. Three autopsied cases shared involvement predominantly in the frontal and temporal lobes and also in the subcortical nuclei, including substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nucleus, that microscopically consisted of neuronal loss, microvacuolation, and astrocytic fibrosis. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated neuropil threads, ballooned cells, and glial fibrillary tangles. Sequencing analysis of the MAPT gene showed an alteration in one allele, resulting in a P301S substitution. These findings suggest that the MAPT P301S mutation can cause pathologically subcortical-predominant, neuropil thread-rich, tau-containing lesions, which could result in consistent parkinsonism. Our study confirms the notion that the phenotype observed in affected individuals from P301S MAPT mutation families is heterogeneous and is broader than the phenotypes seen to date in affected family members carrying other MAPT mutations.",
