     "AB": "Injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA, 7.5 micrograms) kainate (1 microgram) or quisqualate (2 micrograms) into the rat dorsal hippocampus induced wet-dog shakes and convulsions. As shown by an in situ immunohistochemical analysis, 3 h after the excitatory amino acids injections the rats displayed a bilateral profound elevation of the proenkephalin and prodynorphin mRNA levels in dentate gyrus granule cells (2-3 or 1.5-2 fold higher than control levels, respectively). Pretreatment of rats with D-amino-phosphonovalerate (D-APV, 10 micrograms), a selective antagonist of NMDA receptor, prevented the behavioral and biochemical changes evoked by NMDA. The changes in the behavior and gene expression evoked by kainate or quisqualate were diminished in rats which received 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dion (CNQX, 2 micrograms), a putative antagonist of quisqualate and kainate receptors. The study demonstrated that activation of NMDA, quisqualate or kainate receptors in the hippocampus induced seizures associated with a marked increase in the proenkephalin (PENK) and the prodynorphin (PDYN) gene expression in the rat dentate gyrus.",
