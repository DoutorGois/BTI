     "AB": "Compounds that reduce ion flux through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) coupled cation channels were evaluated for their effects on rat pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USV). Previous studies have demonstrated that rat pups emit ultrasonic calls during social isolation and that several classes of anxiolytics decrease, while putative anxiogenics increase, the number of these calls. The competitive NMDA antagonists 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (AP-7) and (+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid [+/-)-CPP) as well as a partial agonist at the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor, 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACPC), reduced USV at doses that did not affect either motor activity or core temperature. A dose of glycine sufficient to elevate hippocampal glycine concentrations by 85% antagonized the effects of ACPC, but not AP-7. Glycine alone did not alter USV, but NMDA when given by itself increased USV by almost 50% at subconvulsant doses. Moreover, a dose of NMDA that did not affect USV antagonized the effects of AP-7 but not ACPC. Taken together, these findings are consistent with previous studies using conflict procedures which indicate that agents which reduce activity at NMDA receptor coupled cation channels may constitute a new class of anxiolytic agents.",
