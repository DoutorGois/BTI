     "AB": "RATIONALE: Many actions of antidepressant drugs cannot yet be studied using positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging due to lack of suitable radioligands. We believe that mirtazapine, radiolabeled with C-11, might be suitable for PET neuroimaging of alpha2-adrenoceptors in selected regions of the living human brain. OBJECTIVE: To determine the regional central biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of [N-methyl-11C]mirtazapine in humans. METHODS: Five healthy volunteers received an intravenous injection of [N-methyl-11C]mirtazapine for evaluating its metabolism, biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: [N-methyl-11C]Mirtazapine entered the brain readily, with initial clearance from blood to tissue (K1) ranging from 0.31 ml/ml/min in amygdala to 0.54 ml/ml/min in thalamus. The rate of metabolism of [N-methyl-11C]mirtazapine in the bloodstream was relatively slow, with 20-40% of [11C]-derived radioactivity still present as parent compound at 60 min post-injection. The clearance of [N-methyl-11C]mirtazapine from the tissue compartment (k2') ranged from a low of 0.03 min(-1) in amygdala to a high of 0.06-0.07 min(-1) in thalamus and cerebellum. The volume of distribution (Ve') of [N-methyl-11C]mirtazapine was markedly greater in hippocampus and amygdala (11.3-12.0) than in cerebellum (6.7), with intermediate levels in the thalamus (9.4). CONCLUSIONS: [N-methyl-11C]Mirtazapine has suitable properties for PET neuroimaging. We envision [N-methyl-11C]mirtazapine as a molecular probe for PET imaging of antidepressant actions at sites such as alpha2-adrenoceptors in the living human brain.",
