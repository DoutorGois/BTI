     "AB": "A 66-year-old man with no medically remarkable past or family history gradually showed personality changes, memory disturbance, sleeplessness and abnormal behavior. Neurologic examination showed no focal signs and neither parkinsonism nor cerebellar ataxia was recognized. He died 4 years after the onset of dementia due to chronic renal failure. Neuropathologic examination revealed neuronal loss and gliosis in the temporal cortex, particularly in the subiculum, parahippocampal gyrus and entorhinal cortex, and insular cortex. NFTs were observed to be widespread in the cerebral cortex, especially the temporal cortex and brainstem, while senile plaques were not observed. Gallyas-Braak silver staining revealed the presence of numerous NFTs, glial inclusions and neuropil threads throughout the cerebral neocortex, limbic system, hippocampus and brainstem. The subiculum showed the most severe involvement; severe atrophy, severe neuron loss, and numerous ghost tangles (extracellular NFTs) were apparent. Although NFTs contained both monoclonal anti-3repeat-tau antibody (RD3) and RD4 immunoreactivity, this differed between the intracellular NFTs and ghost tangles. RD3 immunoreactivity was mainly observed in ghost tangles and neuropil threads, whereas RD4 immunoreactivity was mainly observed in intracellular NFTs and glial inclusions. Calcification was also found to be widespread in the cerebral cortex and white matter, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellar cortex, white matter and dentate nucleus. These characteristic neuropathologic findings lead to the pathologic diagnosis of diffuse neurofibrillary tangles with calcification (DNTC). It is argued that this patient showed early stage pathologic signs of DNTC due to a short disease duration, which may provide clues regarding the progression of this rare disease.",
