     "AB": "PURPOSE: We studied gene expression differences in brain homogenate, hippocampus, somatosensory cortex and cerebellum of rats suffering from sepsis-associated delirium and analyzed the effects of norepinephrine and 1,400 W (specific inhibitor of the inducible nitric-oxide synthase). METHODS: We applied microarray screenings to rat brain homogenate 1, 3 and 4.5 h after lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 mg/kg) or 0.9% NaCl treatment. Therapy groups were analyzed after 4.5 h. Validations and compartment specific investigations were carried out by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Most striking gene expression differences were seen 4.5 h after LPS administration, especially within the hippocampus (chemokines and endothelial cell-specific molecule 1). Norepinephrine resulted in a discrete chemokine up-regulation, while 1,400 W had hardly any effect. CONCLUSION: Strongest gene regulations were found within the hippocampus. Norepinephrine showed a tendency of having a proinflammatory influence, while 1,400 W had no clear-cut effect onto the gene expression level.",
