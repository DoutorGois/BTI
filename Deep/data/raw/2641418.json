     "AB": "Spreading of epileptiform activity in the central nervous system is one of the fundamental problems in epileptology. The patterns of spreading of after-discharges in the hippocampus and entorphinal cortex were studied in acute experiments and using the kindling model of epileptogenesis. Three methods were used to determine the time relations between EEG signals from different brain areas; visual inspections, average amount of mutual information (AAMI) and phase spectrum method. The analysis methods used are adequate for quantification of the degree of coupling between different EEG signals during an afterdischarge, but should be used jointly since different signal features are taken into consideration by different methods. During an afterdischarge only at the beginning the focal area is clearly leading the other brain areas; thereafter the pattern becomes more complex.",
