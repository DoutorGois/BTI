     "AB": "Immunohistochemical techniques were used to examine the distribution of prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS)-2 and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in piglet brain. Samples from parietal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum were immersion fixed in 10% formalin, sectioned at 50 microm, and immunostained using specific antibodies against PGHS-2 and nNOS. Immunoreactivity for PGHS-2 was extensive throughout the areas examined. For example, PGHS-2 immunoreactive cells were present in all layers of the cortex, but were particularly dense among neurons in layers II/II, V, and VI. In addition, glial cells associated with microvessels in white matter showed PGHS-2 immunoreactivity. In contrast, nNOS immunoreactive neurons were limited in number and widely dispersed across all layers of the cortex and thus did not form a definable pattern. In the hippocampus, heavy PGHS-2 immunoreactivity was present in neurons and glial cells in the subgranular region, stratum radiatum, adjacent to the hippocampal sulcus, and in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells. Immunostaining for nNOS displayed a different pattern from PGHS-2 in the hippocampus, and was mainly localized to the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and the mossy fiber layer. In the cerebellum, PGHS-2 immunoreactivity was heavily represented in the Bergmann glia and to a lesser extent in cells of the granular layer, whereas nNOS was detected only in Basket cells. There are four conclusions from this study. First, PGHS-2 immunoreactivity is widely represented in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of neonatal pigs. Second, glia cells as well as neurons can show immunoreactivity for PGHS-2. And third, the distribution of nNOS is different from PGHS-2 immunoreactivity in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum.",
