     "AB": "Tissue levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein were studied using enzyme immunoassay in different forebrain regions in the ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres of rats housed under enriched or standard conditions after the middle cerebral artery ligation. BDNF levels in the ipsilateral to ligation side was significantly higher only in the frontal cortex of standard as compared to enriched rats. However, BDNF overall was more abundant in standard than in enriched group. In addition, BDNF levels detected in the hippocampus and frontal cortex on the ischemic side of standard rats was higher as compared to contralateral side. The present study shows that housing conditions after permanent middle cerebral artery ligation leads to differential regulation of BDNF protein levels in forebrain regions which might have important implication for post-ischemic recovery.",
