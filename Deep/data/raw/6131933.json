     "AB": "The effect of 13 hallucinogens on the uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine into hippocampal synaptosomes and of serotonin and dopamine into caudate synaptosomes was found to be inhibitory, except for lysergic acid diethylamide and 2-bromolysergic acid diethylamide, which were inactive. The indolealkylamines were generally more potent than the phenylethylamines. The reported inhibition of uptake of serotonin by 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine and lysergic acid diethylamide into whole brain synaptosomes was not reproducible at concentrations 10(2) to 10(4) times higher than those stated in the literature.",
