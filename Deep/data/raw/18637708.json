     "AB": "Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates were found to inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase - an essential enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, but their effect on cholesterol synthesis per se in the central nervous system (CNS) remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to examine possible influence of a representative agent alendronate on cholesterol synthesis rates in selected parts of rat CNS and on plasma cholesterol level. Two groups of rats were orally administered either alendronate (3 mg/kg b.w.) or vehicle for 9 days. At the end of experiment, brain (basal ganglia, frontal cortex and hippocampus) and spinal cord were isolated and cholesterol synthesis was determined using the technique of deuterium incorporation from deuterated water. In the alendronate group significant reductions of cholesterol synthesis rates were detected in frontal cortex, hippocampus and spinal cord (p<0.001). However, the experimental treatment did not produce a significant alteration in the levels of plasma cholesterol. In conclusion, this study brings the first experimental evidence of the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis with alendronate in central nervous system.",
