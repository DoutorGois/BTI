     "AB": "Two glutamate antagonists were tested in a rat model of complete, transient cerebral ischemia. Six days after 10 min ischemia the mean loss of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurones was 73%. Administration of the AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) antagonist NBQX (2,3-dihydro-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline) reduced the pyramidal neurone loss to 1%, 11% and 15%, when given before, immediately after or 1 h after ischemia, respectively. MK-801 (dizocilpine), a competitive NMDA antagonist gave no protection in this model. We suggest that the AMPA receptor transduction mechanisms are sensitized by ischemia and that the postischemic blockade of the main glutamatergic input to the CA1 cells with NBQX impairs the deleterious effect of \"normal\" postischemic excitatory transmission.",
