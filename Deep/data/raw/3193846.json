     "AB": "In vitro cytosol binding assays have shown the properties of binding of a novel steroid, ZK91587 (15 beta, 16 beta-methylene-mexrenone) in the brain of rats. Scatchard and Woolf analyses of the binding data reveal the binding of [3H] ZK91587 to the total hippocampal corticosteroid receptor sites with high affinity (Kd 1.9 nM), and low capacity (Bmax 17.3 fmol/mg protein). When 100-fold excess RU28362 was included simultaneously with [3H] ZK91587, the labelled steroid binds with the same affinity (Kd 1.8 nM) and capacity (Bmax 15.5 fmol/mg protein). Relative binding affinities (RBA) of various steroids for the Type I or Type II corticosteroid receptor in these animals are: Type I: ZK91587 = corticosterone (B) greater than cortisol (F); Type II: B greater than F much greater than ZK91587. In the binding kinetic study, ZK91587 has a high association rate of binding in the rat (20.0 x 10(7) M-1 min-1). The steroid dissociates following a one slope pattern (t 1/2 30 h), indicating, the present data demonstrate that in the rat hippocampus, ZK91587 binds specifically to the Type I (corticosterone-preferring/mineralocorticoid-like) receptor.",
