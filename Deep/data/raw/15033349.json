     "AB": "Numerous animal and clinical studies have described memory deficits following sleep deprivation. There is also evidence that the absence of sleep increases brain oxidative stress. The present study investigates the role of hippocampal oxidative stress in memory deficits induced by sleep deprivation in mice. Mice were sleep deprived for 72 h by the multiple platform method-groups of 4-6 animals were placed in water tanks, containing 12 platforms (3 cm in diameter) surrounded by water up to 1 cm beneath the surface. Mice kept in their home cage or placed onto larger platforms were used as control groups. The results showed that hippocampal oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio as well as lipid peroxidation of sleep-deprived mice was significantly increased compared to control groups. The same procedure of sleep deprivation led to a passive avoidance retention deficit. Both passive avoidance retention deficit and increased hippocampal lipid peroxidation were prevented by repeated treatment (15 consecutive days, i.p.) with the antioxidant agents melatonin (5 mg/kg), N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (200 mg/kg) or vitamin E (40 mg/kg). The results indicate an important role of hippocampal oxidative stress in passive avoidance memory deficits induced by sleep deprivation in mice.",
