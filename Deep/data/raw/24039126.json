     "AB": "DNA methylation and microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in maturation of postnatal mouse neurons. Aberrant DNA methylation and/or altered miRNA expression cause postnatal neurodevelopmental disorders. In general, DNA methylation in the 5'-flanking region suppresses gene expression through recruitment of methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBPs) to the cytosine residues of CpG dinucleotides. X-linked MeCP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2), a member of MBPs, is a methylation-associated transcriptional repressor with other functions in the central nervous system (CNS). miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR). Some miRNA genes harboring or being embedded in CpG islands undergo methylation-mediated silencing. One such miRNA is miR-7b which is differentially expressed through stages of neurodevelopment. In our present study, we focused on a canonical CpG island located in the 5'-flanking region of the murine miR-7b gene. Hypermethylation of this CpG island down-regulates miR-7b while recruiting MeCP2 to the methylated CpG dinucleotides. Meanwhile, Mecp2, a target of miR-7b, was up-regulated due to lack of restrain exerted by miR-7b during maturation of postnatal (PN) mouse neurons between PN3 and PN14. Our results indicate that miR-7b is a direct downstream gene transcriptional target while also being a negative post-transcriptional regulator of Mecp2 expression. We speculate that this bidirectional feed-back autoregulatory function of miR-7b and Mecp2 while linking DNA methylation and miRNA action maintains the homeostatic control of gene expression necessary during postnatal maturation of mammalian neurons.",
