     "AB": "The outdoor radiation exposure of the population in Switzerland from external sources results from cosmic background as well as from natural and artificial ground radiation. The geographical distribution of these components and of the total dose rate are represented on maps consisting of 2 kmx2 km grid cells. The average dose rate on Swiss territory outdoors is 147 nSv/h (1.29 mSv/a). The distributions are then related to the population density distribution by GIS application. The population is exposed to an average dose rate of 108 nSv/h (0.95 mSv/a) per capita which is just below the threshold for man-made dose rate given by national regulation. The lower value (relative to the country average 147 nSv/h) arises from the fact that most of the population lives north of the Alps where the lithology is dominated by rocks of relatively low radioactivity and where the cosmic radiation is low relative to the Alps.",
