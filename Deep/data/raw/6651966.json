     "AB": "An .82 mg/kg dose of dl-4-OH amphetamine administered ip immediately following training in a one-way active avoidance task enhanced retention performance measured 24 hr later. In contrast, 4-OH amphetamine in a dose range of .41--1.65 mg/kg ip did not affect retention of a swim escape task. The behaviorally active dose of .82 mg/kg 4-OH amphetamine decreased dopamine concentrations in the amygdala and hippocampus. A dose of 8.2 mg/kg 4-OH amphetamine administered ip to naive untrained rats decreased concentrations of norepinephrine measured in the amygdala, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and midbrain; decreased concentrations of dopamine in the amygdala, cortex, hippocampus, and striatum; and significantly reduced concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the adrenal medulla. In addition, because the integrity of the adrenal medulla is necessary for the enhancing action of 4-OH amphetamine and because 4-OH amphetamine reduces concentrations of catecholamines in the brain and adrenal medulla, it is possible that 4-OH amphetamine affects retention performance by a dual action on the brain and the adrenal medulla.",
