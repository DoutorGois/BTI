     "AB": "Using isolated Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles as the immunogen, nine mouse hybridomas were generated which produced antibodies to the tangles as tested in both tissue sections and isolated neurons from Alzheimer brain. Extraction of isolated neurofibrillary tangles with 2% SDS could not remove the antigen(s) with which these monoclonal antibodies reacted. Immunocytochemical study revealed that each of the monoclonal antibodies reacted with one or more of other tissue antigens in addition to the Alzheimer tangles. However, no reaction with either neurofilaments or microtubules was observed with any one of these antibodies. This is the first demonstration of monoclonal antibodies which have been generated against isolated Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles; these antibodies react with antigen(s) inherent to the tangles.",
