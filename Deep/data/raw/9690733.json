     "AB": "The Na+-dependent high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) transport and the [3H]hemicholinium-3 ([3H]HC-3) specific binding were measured on hippocampal synaptosomes of young (3-6 months) and old (22 months) Wistar rats. In vitro effects of 100-300 microM arachidonic acid (AA) and of 5% ethanol were tested under basal as well as stimulated (55 mM KCl) conditions. The influence of AA (an irreversible decrease of HACU and a reversible increase of [3H]HC-3 binding) was more marked under stimulated rather than basal conditions in brain tissue of young rats. The increased K+-depolarization effect on HACU and the decreased influence of AA on [3H]HC-3 binding were estimated in brain tissue of old compared to young rats. Results suggest the involvement of different pools of the high-affinity choline carrier and marked changes due to aging in the regulation of the HACU transport.",
