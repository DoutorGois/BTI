     "AB": "Substance P, which modulates synaptic excitability, can be induced by a variety of stimuli. We studied the expression of hippocampal substance P in rats in using lithium-pilocarpine model of status epilepticus during development. Status epilepticus resulted in an age-specific manner of substance P expression that was anatomically distinctive in hippocampal subfields. Maximal induction of substance P immunoreactivity was seen in the CA1 region of the two-week-old rats, and progressively decreased in the three-, four-week-old rats and adults. Meanwhile, the number of substance P-immunoreactive neurons in the CA3 region and dentate granule cell layer was minimal in the two-week-old animals, but approximated the adult level in the three- and four-week-old rats. No substance P-immunoreactive axon terminals were seen in the strata pyramidale and lucidum in the CA3 region of the two-week-old rats, but they were found to progressively increase in the three-, four-week-old rats and adults. To confirm substance P expression after status epilepticus, we studied the expression of preprotachykinin-A mRNA in the hippocampus of the three-week-old rats by in situ hybridization. Two hours following injection of lithium-pilocarpine, preprotachykinin-A mRNA dramatically increased in the granule cells, as well as in the CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus. To evaluate the relationship between behavioral seizures and substance P induction, we used the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. Injection of MK-801 completely blocked lithium-pilocarpine-induced behavioral seizures and SP induction in the two-week-old rats. These results indicate that seizure activity selectively evokes age-dependent and region-selective expression of substance P.",
