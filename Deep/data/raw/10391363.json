     "PG": "455-69",
     "AB": "Lactate and free fatty acids (FFAs) were extracted from the cortices and hippocampi of rats subjected to sham operation, or mild (1.25 atm) or moderate (2.0 atm) fluid percussion (FP) injury, and their total tissue concentrations were measured. The elevation of lactate in the injured left cortex (IC) and ipsilateral hippocampus (IH) was significantly greater in the moderate-injury than in the mild-injury group at most test times between 5 min and 48 h after injury. Levels of total FFAs were elevated in the IC and IH to a greater extent and for a longer period after injury in the moderate-injury (up to 48 h) than in the mild-injury group (up to 20 min). In general, the extent and duration of the elevation of most of the individual FFAs (palmitic, stearic, oleic, and arachidonic acids) in the IC and IH were also greater in the moderate-injury group than in the mild-injury group. In the contralateral cortex (CC) and hippocampus (CH), the elevation of lactate and total FFAs (and individual stearic and arachidonic acids) were also greater in the moderate-injury group than in the low-injury group at 5 min after injury. The extravasation of Evans blue in the IC and IH from 3 to 6 h after injury was also the greatest in the moderate-injury group. The hippocampal CA3 neuronal cell loss, but not cortical lesion volume, also increased with the severity of injury. These findings suggest that certain neurochemical, physiological (blood-brain barrier permeability), and morphologic responses increase with the severity of FP brain injury, and such relationships are consistent with the increased behavioral deficits observed with the increase of severity of brain injury.",
