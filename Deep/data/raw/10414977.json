     "AB": "Recent data showed that group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are located perisynaptic to the postsynaptic specializations of asymmetric glutamatergic synapses in the cerebellum and hippocampus in rats. In the present study, we used immunogold labeling to elucidate the subsynaptic localization of group I mGluRs (mGluR1a and mGluR5) in the internal and external segments of the globus pallidus in monkeys. In contrast to hippocampal and cerebellar neurons, which receive massive glutamatergic inputs, dendrites of pallidal neurons are covered with GABAergic boutons from the striatum intermingled with a small proportion of glutamatergic terminals arising largely from the subthalamic nucleus. In line with previous data, mGluR1a and mGluR5 immunoreactivity was found at the edge of the postsynaptic specializations of asymmetric synapses established by subthalamic-like boutons in the monkey pallidum. However, a large proportion of gold particles were also seen in the main body of the postsynaptic specializations of symmetric synapses formed by striatal GABAergic terminals. These data raise questions about the possible sources of activation of these receptors and the potential roles of group I mGluRs in modulating GABAergic neurotransmission at striatopallidal synapses.",
