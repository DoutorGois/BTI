     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease is thought to be caused by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta)-dependent synaptic dysfunction. However, the signaling pathways connecting Abeta and synaptic dysfunction remain elusive. Here we report that Abeta transiently increases the expression level of centaurin-alpha1 (CentA1) in neurons, which induces a Ras-dependent association of Elk-1 with mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction in organotypic hippocampal slices of rats. Downregulation of the CentA1-Ras-Elk-1 pathway restored normal mitochondrial activity, spine structural plasticity, spine density, and the amplitude and frequency of miniature EPSCs in Abeta-treated neurons, whereas upregulation of the pathway was sufficient to decrease spine density. Elevations of CentA1 and association of Elk-1 with mitochondria were also observed in transgenic mice overexpressing a human mutant form of amyloid precursor protein. Therefore, the CentA1-Ras-Elk-1 signaling pathway acts on mitochondria to regulate dendritic spine density and synaptic plasticity in response to Abeta in hippocampal neurons, providing new pharmacological targets for Alzheimer's disease.",
