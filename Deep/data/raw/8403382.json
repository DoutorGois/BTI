     "AB": "Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis and is regulated by both transcription-dependent and transcription-independent mechanisms. We compared the effects of asparagine, an amino acid previously shown to increase ODC activity in adult hippocampal slices, on ODC mRNA and activity in adult and neonatal hippocampal slices. In addition, we evaluated the effects of asparagine on ODC activity following seizure activity elicited by systemic administration of kainic acid (KA) in both adult and neonatal rats. Asparagine produced an increase in ODC gene expression and activity in both adult and neonatal hippocampal slices. The increase in ODC activity elicited by asparagine in hippocampal slices was the same in control animals as in animals sacrificed 16 h after KA-induced seizure activity. The asparagine-elicited increase in ODC activity in neonatal and adult hippocampal slices was blocked by the RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D. Finally, polyamines produced an inhibition of ODC activity in neonatal hippocampal slices. The results indicate that the regulation of the expression and activity of ODC is similar in neonatal and adult hippocampus.",
