     "AB": "Spontaneous activity was recorded from 652 units in 8 subcortical structures of unanesthetized rats. Recordings were obtained in central gray, mesencephalic reticular formation, parafasciculus thalami, caudate nucleus, anterior and ventromedial hypothalamus, lateral septum, and dorsal hippocampus. Eighty recordings were obtained from untreated animals and 80 from saline-injected controls, none of which showed any significant changes of unit activity during the 4- 5-hr observation period. The effect of morphine, given in 5 incremental doses from 0.5 to 30.0 mg/kg ip, was followed in 492 units. Morphine enhanced or depressed spontaneous discharge rates, or caused biphasic effects, ie enhancement alternating with depression and vice versa. Naloxone induced increase in firing after either effect of morphine, or reduced spontaneous activity after morphine-induced increases. However, when morphine reduced neuronal discharges, naloxone never caused further depression. In 86 units, morphine at any dosage failed to alter neuronal activity, but in 54 of these units naloxone nevertheless induced alterations in firing rates. The pattern of responses to morphine differed between all 8 brain regions examined and was characteristic for each individual structure. This is the first systematic study describing the dose-response characteristics of morphine in 8 brain sites recorded simultaneously. Furthermore, it utilized freely behaving animals without the interference of anesthetics, which are themselves known to interact with opiates. The variety of response patterns seen supports the neuropharmacological evidence for multiple opiate receptors or multiple sites of opiate action.",
