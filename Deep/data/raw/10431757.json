     "AB": "Guinea-pig hippocampal slices preincubated with [3H]noradrenaline were superfused with medium containing desipramine and rauwolscine and rat striatal slices preincubated with [3H]dopamine were superfused with medium containing nomifensine; the effect of cannabinoid receptor ligands on tritium overflow stimulated by NMDA or kainate was examined. Furthermore, the affinity of the drugs for cannabinoid CB1 receptors was determined in rat brain cortex membranes using [3H]SR 141716. In guinea-pig hippocampal slices preincubated with [3H]noradrenaline, tritium overflow stimulated by NMDA 100 microM and 1000 microM and by kainate 1000 microM was inhibited by the cannabinoid receptor agonists CP-55,940 and/or WIN 55,212-2. The CB1 receptor antagonist SR 141716 increased the NMDA (1000 microM)-stimulated tritium overflow but did not affect tritium overflow stimulated by NMDA 100 microM or kainate 1000 microM. The inhibitory effect of WIN 55,212-2 on the NMDA (100 microM)- and kainate (1000 microM)-evoked tritium overflow was antagonized by SR 141716. In rat striatal slices preincubated with [3H]dopamine, WIN 55,212-2 inhibited the NMDA (1000 microM)-stimulated tritium overflow. SR 141716, which, by itself, did not affect tritium overflow, counteracted the inhibitory effect of WIN 55,212-2. [3H]SR 141716 binding to rat cortical membranes was inhibited by SR 141716, CP-55,940 and WIN 55,212-2 (pKi 8.53, 7.34 and 5.93, respectively) but not affected by desipramine, rauwolscine and nomifensine (pKi < 5). In conclusion, activation of CB1 receptors inhibits the NMDA- and kainate-stimulated noradrenaline release in guinea-pig hippocampus and the NMDA-stimulated dopamine release in rat striatum. The explanation for the facilitatory effect of SR 141716 might be that it acts as an inverse agonist at CB1 receptors or that these receptors are activated by endogenous cannabinoids.",
