     "AB": "A series of new analogues of 3-[3-(4-arylpiperazinyl)-propyl]-cyclo-hexane-1',5-spirohydantoin (2), with aromatic ring fused in amide moiety (4-9) were synthesized and evaluated for affinity at 5-HTIA and 5-HT2A receptors. The influence of the substitution mode in the phenyl ring of phenylpiperazine moiety on the affinity for both receptors has been discussed. The most potent 5-HTIA (9, Ki = 53 nM) and 5-HT2A (4, 6, 8 and 9; Ki = 14-76 nM) ligands were evaluated in in vivo tests. The obtained results indicate that all in vivo tested compounds showed pharmacological profile of 5-HT2A antagonists. Additionally, a m-CF3 derivative (9), behaved like a partial agonist (agonist of pre- and antagonist of postsynaptic) of 5-HTIA receptors and may offer a new lead for the development of potential psychotropic agents.",
