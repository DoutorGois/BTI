     "AB": "Steroid-mediated cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival can be triggered by learning, experience, and brain injury. In the uninjured canary song system, testosterone induces cell proliferation that is blocked by an antibody to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, little is known with regard to the effects of neurotrophic factors on injury-induced cell proliferation and incorporation. To address this, adult male zebra finches received bilateral hippocampal lesions by infusing saline into one hemisphere and BDNF into the other. BrdU (2-bromo-5-deoxyuridine) was then injected to label mitotic cells. A greater number of BrdU-immunoreactive (BrdU-IR) cells were observed in the BDNF-treated hemisphere in the hippocampus, but not in the septum or stem cell-rich subventricular zone, indicating that BDNF promoted localized cell proliferation and incorporation at the injury site only.",
