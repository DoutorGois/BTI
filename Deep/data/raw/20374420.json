     "AB": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) has both soluble (S-COMT) and membrane-bound (MB-COMT) isoforms. A specific COMT antibody was used in immunohistochemical and confocal co-localization studies to explore the distribution of COMT in general in normal mice and MB-COMT in particular, in an S-COMT deficient mouse line. In the peripheral tissues, high COMT protein and activity levels were observed in liver and kidney, whereas in the brain, COMT expression and activity were much lower. MB-COMT was widely distributed throughout all tissues, and overall, the MB-COMT distribution mimicked the distribution of S-COMT. MB-COMT displayed some preference for brain tissue, notably in the hippocampus. MB-COMT related enzymatic activity was also pronounced in the cerebral cortical areas and hypothalamus. MB-COMT, like S-COMT, was found to be an intracellular enzyme but it was not associated with plasma membranes in the brain. Both COMT forms were abundantly found in microglial cells and intestinal macrophages, but also in astroglial cells. COMT was also present in some neuronal cells, like pyramidal neurons, cerebellar Purkinje and granular cells and striatal spiny neurons, but not in major long projection neurons. Finally, it seemed that nuclear COMT is not visible in S-COMT deficient mice.",
