     "AB": "Previous experiments have demonstrated that in the septo-hippocampal system choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) is induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) (Gnahn et al. (1983) Dev. Brain Res. 9, 45-52) and that hippocampal NGF and mRNANGF levels are correlated with the density of cholinergic innervation (Korsching et al. (1985) EMBO J. 4, 1389-1393). In the present investigation we have compared the developmental changes of ChAT, NGF, and mRNANGF levels in this system. During the postnatal development of the hippocampus the time courses of NGF and ChAT were well correlated including the most rapid increase between P12 and P14. This increase in hippocampal NGF was preceded by a corresponding increase in mRNANGF. The developmental changes in hippocampal NGF levels were also closely reflected by corresponding changes in the septum. This, together with previous observations (Korsching et al., 1985) that the adult septum, in spite of relatively high NGF levels, does not contain measurable quantities of mRNANGF, suggests that the NGF levels in the septum are determined by the quantity of NGF transported retrogradely from the field of innervation rather than by local synthesis. During the prenatal period hippocampal NGF levels were relatively high, whereas the mRNANGF was below the level of detection. Since the ingrowth of septal fibers, and with that also the removal of NGF by retrograde transport, begins around birth, the relatively high prenatal NGF levels probably result from an accumulation produced by a small copy number of mRNANGF prior to the removal of NGF by retrograde axonal transport. It is concluded that the correlation of the developmental changes in NGF and mRNANGF with the ChAT activity in the hippocampus further supports the concept of a physiological role of NGF in the central nervous system.",
