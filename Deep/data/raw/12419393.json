     "AB": "Pigeons were trained on a conditional spatial discrimination with a three-key operant chamber. The position of the correct key was left when all the keys were red, center when all the keys were green, and right when all the keys were white. Pigeons with hippocampal damages could learn the task, as well as intact birds and those that received hippocampal lesions after acquisition of the task. These results suggest that the pigeon hippocampus does not play a role in conditional spatial discrimination.",
