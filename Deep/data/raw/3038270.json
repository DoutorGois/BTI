     "AB": "Potassium-evoked cholecystokinin (CCK) release from slices of caudate-putamen and cerebral cortex, but not hippocampus incubated in vitro was increased by 152-175% by preincubation for 40 min with 10 mM lithium. These results and previous studies suggest that although different physiological agents regulate CCK release in these brain regions, these agents may share a common intracellular mediator which may be a product of inositol phospholipid turnover.",
