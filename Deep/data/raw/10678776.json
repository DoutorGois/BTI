     "AB": "The distribution of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in the hippocampal formation of monkey and rat brains was studied immunohistochemically. The NPY-neuronal system is more highly developed in the monkey compared to that in the rat. The distribution of NPY-positive products was coincident with that of abundant BDNF-positive deposits. These observations suggest that the role of BDNF and the interaction of BDNF-NPY may differ between species.",
