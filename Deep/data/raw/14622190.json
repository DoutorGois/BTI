     "AB": "For neuroprotective therapy of neurodegenerative diseases creatine treatment has gained special interest because creatine has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier, accumulate in the human brain in vivo and cause delayed neuronal cell death in a large number of animal models. Here, we used the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy to determine whether creatine administration is able to attenuate the epilepsy-associated decrease in hippocampal N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) concentrations, impairment of mitochondrial function and neuronal cell loss. In vivo1H-NMR spectroscopy showed, in epileptic rats after creatine administration, higher hippocampal NAA concentrations, suggesting improved neuronal survival. However, in vitro observation of hippocampal slices from creatine-treated epileptic rats revealed a more pronounced loss of pyramidal neurons and decrease in activity of mitochondrial enzymes in hippocampal subfields. This indicates that NAA concentrations measured by in vivo1H-NMR spectroscopy reflect alterations of metabolism rather than neuronal cell densities. Our data indicate an adverse effect of creatine on neuronal survival under conditions of enhanced neuronal activity.",
