     "AB": "Epileptiform activity was induced in area CA3 of hippocampal slices by superfusion of medium containing 50 microM bicuculline and 3.5 mM K, 50 microM bicuculline and 5 mM K, 50 nM kainic acid and 3.5 mM K, or 7 mM K. Burst potentials were recorded at rates between 5 and 44/min, depending on the convulsant treatment. Baclofen reduced the frequency of burst firing in all slices tested in a dose-dependent manner, with little change in the morphology of individual bursts. Thus baclofen primarily affected the initiation of epileptiform discharges. IC50 values varied between 27 and 500 nM and were positively correlated with the rate of bursting. These experiments indicate that baclofen, at concentrations present in the CSF of patients treated for spasticity, has an anticonvulsant-like effect in the hippocampal formation and suggest that its mode of action is to reduce the excitability of pyramidal cells.",
