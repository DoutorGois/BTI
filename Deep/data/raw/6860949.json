     "AB": "Neuronotrophic activity accumulates in a wound cavity created in the entorhinal/occipital cortex of developing rats. These trophic factors support the survival of neurons in monolayer cultures of chick embryo spinal cord, ciliary ganglion, sympathetic ganglion and dorsal root ganglion, as well as of mouse dorsal root ganglion. Trophic activity was very low both in non-injured brain tissue and in the wound cavity 1 day post-lesion, but it increased 15- to 300-fold during the subsequent 2-5 days. Together with the trophic activity in the wound fluid were other substances which interfered with the survival of spinal cord neurons. The neuronotrophic factors appeared to be proteins immunologically distinct from mouse submaxillary nerve growth factor. Fragments of rat embryo corpus striatum placed in the cortical wound cavity immediately after its formation showed very poor subsequent survival and no innervation of the host hippocampus. However, if implantation was delayed by 3 or 6 days with respect to the time at which the receiving cavity was made, the survival was greatly improved and innervation of the host took place. The time course for the accumulation of the trophic factors in the cavity paralleled the delay leading to increased survival of brain grafts. It is suggested that the neuronotrophic activity accumulating in the wound cavity during the delay period may be responsible for the increased survival of the implants.",
