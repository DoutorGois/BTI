     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss and hippocampal atrophy. Soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta)42 and plaque accumulation is implicated as the neurotoxic species in this disorder; however, at physiological concentrations (pM-nM), Abeta42 contributes to neurogenesis, long-term potentiation, and neuromodulation. Because Abeta42 binds the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7nAChRs) located presynaptically on glutamatergic terminals, involved with hippocampal dependent learning and memory, we examined the effects of the human, monomeric isoform of Abeta42 on glutamate release in the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1, of isoflurane anesthetized, 6-9 month old male C57BL/6J mice. We utilized an enzyme-based microelectrode array selective for L-glutamate measures with fast temporal (4 Hz), low spatial resolution (50x100mum) and minimal damage to the surrounding parenchyma (50-100mum). Local application of Abeta42 (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0muM; approximately 150 nl; 1-2 Seconds) elicited robust, reproducible glutamate signals in all hippocampal subfields studied. Local application of 0.1 and 1.0muM Abeta42 significantly increased the average maximal amplitude of glutamate release compared to saline in the DG and CA1. 10.0muM Abeta42 significantly elevated glutamate release in the DG and CA3, but not in the CA1. Glutamate release was completely attenuated with coapplication of 10.0muM alpha-Bungarotoxin, the potent alpha7nAChR antagonist. Coapplication of 10.0muM tetrodotoxin, indicates Abeta42 - induced glutamate release originates from neuronal rather than glial sources. This study demonstrates that the human, monomeric Abeta42 isoform evokes glutamate release through the alpha7nAChR and varies across hippocampal subfields.",
