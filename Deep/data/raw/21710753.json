     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of hippocampal Abeta42 deposition on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and phosphorylated MAPK signal molecules as well as the intervention of AD by total glucosides of paeony (TGP). METHOD: 12 week-old female SD rats were stereotactic injected one-time with a fibrillar Abeta42 positioning hippocampus to replicate AD pathology model and interfered with TGP. The expression of inflammatory cytokines and phosphorylated MAPK pathway signaling molecules were observed by immunohistochemistry (SABC), and SABC images were analyzed by image analysis software. RESULT: Compared with the control group, the IL-1beta, IL-6 and p-p38, p-JNK, p-MEK3/6 positive stained areas of AD pathology model group increased and their staining intensity decreased (the protein expression quantity inversely proportional to the staining intensity), while the IL-1beta, IL-6 and p-p38, p-JNK, p-MEK3/6 positive stained areas of the treatment groups decreased and their staining intensity increased compared with AD pathology model group. CONCLUSION: Abeta42 deposition in hippocampus can induce the brain inflammation and the over-expression of IL-1beta, IL-6 and p-p38, p-JNK, p-MEK3/6. Inhibiting the over-expression of inflammatory cytokines and phosphorylated MAPK signaling molecules may be a major antagonistic mechanism of TGP against AD.",
