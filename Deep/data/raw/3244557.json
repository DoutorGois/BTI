     "AB": "The sulfated and unsulfated octapeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) sequences and the pancreatic CCK antagonists, CR 1409 and benzotript, were applied iontophoretically in the rat dentate gyrus granular layer while the response evoked by single pulse stimulation of the perforant path was recorded. The stimulating current was varied and the resulting relationship between the slope of the response (input) against the population spike amplitude (output) was used as a measure of excitability at the granule cell synapse. All four test compounds shifted the input/output curve to the left indicating an increase in postsynaptic excitability. These results thus imply that endogenous CCK acts at the central type of CCK receptor to modulate cortical input to granule cells by reducing the threshold for synaptic excitation.",
