     "AB": "The immunohistochemical localization of pancreastatin (PST) was examined in brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control cases using three different antisera to PST, and was compared with the staining for chromogranin A (CgA), the precursor of PST. In control brains, CgA-like immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasm and fibers of certain neuronal populations, which were not immunostained with any of the PST antisera. In AD brains, dystrophic neurites of globular shape located in senile plaques were immunostained with each of the PST antisera, as well as with the CgA antibody. PST-positive and CgA-positive dystrophic neurites showed similar profiles. The present study indicates that CgA is probably cleaved to produce PST in some globular dystrophic neurites in senile plaques.",
