     "AB": "Small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels are important for excitability control and afterhyperpolarizations in vertebrate neurons and have been implicated in regulation of the functional state of the forebrain. We have examined the distribution, functional expression, and subunit composition of SK channels in rat brain. Immunoprecipitation detected solely homotetrameric SK2 and SK3 channels in native tissue and their constitutive association with calmodulin. Immunohistochemistry revealed a restricted distribution of SK1 and SK2 protein with highest densities in subregions of the hippocampus and neocortex. In contrast, SK3 protein was distributed more diffusely in these brain regions and predominantly expressed in phylogenetically older brain regions. Whole-cell recording showed a sharp segregation of apamin-sensitive SK current within the hippocampal formation, in agreement with the SK2 distribution, suggesting that SK2 homotetramers underlie the apamin-sensitive medium afterhyperpolarizations in rat hippocampus.",
