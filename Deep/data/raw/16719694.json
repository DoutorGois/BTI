     "AB": "The authors tested the hypothesis that the cholinergic nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) is involved in solving problems requiring cognitive flexibility. Rats with 192 IgG-saporin lesions of the NBM were assessed for perseveration (i.e., cognitive inflexibility) in the serial reversal of an operant discrimination and during subsequent extinction testing. It was hypothesized that the NBM lesion and control groups would not differ in the acquisition of the initial, simple discrimination, because this task does not demand cognitive flexibility. In contrast, it was hypothesized that the NBM lesion group would show perseveration during serial reversal and extinction testing. Results generally supported these hypotheses, suggesting that the NBM plays an important role in mediating cognitive flexibility.",
