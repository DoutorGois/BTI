When neuropsychiatric symptoms recurred in a previously healthy 61-year-old patient 1 month after recovering from acute HSV-1 encephalitis, repeat positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose was helpful in ruling out recurrent active infection by showing marked hypometabolism throughout the previously infected temporal lobe.",
