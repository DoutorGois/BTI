     "AB": "Glial reactivity is implicated in CNS repair and regenerative responses. Microglia, the cells responding earliest to axonal injury, produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), a cytokine with both cytopathic and neuroprotective effects. We have studied activation of hippocampal microglia to produce TNFalpha in response to transection of perforant path axons in SJL/J mice. TNFalpha mRNA was produced in a transient manner, peaking at 2 d and falling again by 5 d after lesioning. This was unlike other markers of glial reactivity, such as Mac-1 upregulation, which were sustained over longer time periods. Message for the immune cytokine interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) was undetectable, and glial reactivity to axonal lesions occurred as normal in IFNgamma-deficient mice. Microglial responses to lesion-induced neuronal injury were markedly enhanced in myelin basic protein promoter-driven transgenic mice, in which IFNgamma was endogenously produced in hippocampus. The kinetics of TNFalpha downregulation 5 d after lesion was not affected by transgenic IFNgamma, indicating that IFNgamma acts as an amplifier and not an inducer of response. These results are discussed in the context of a regenerative role for TNFalpha in the CNS, which is innately regulated and potentiated by IFNgamma.",
