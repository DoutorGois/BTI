     "AB": "Agonists of M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). An example of one of these agents is xanomeline, which has been a leading candidate, however induces various unwanted adverse effects. 3[3(3florophenyl2propyn1ylthio)1,2,5thiadiazol-4-yl]-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro1methylpyr idine oxalate (EUK1001), a fluorinated derivative of xanomeline, has been demonstrated to attenuate ADlike neurodegenerative pathology in presenilindeficient mice, which has no betaamyloid (Abeta) pathology. The present study assessed the effect of EUK1001 on the behavioral performance of the 3xTgAD model of AD. EUK1001 treatment decreased cognitive deficits in male and female AD mice in the Morris water maze test and novel object recognition tasks. EUK1001 also decreased Abeta42, however not Abeta40 in the cortex and hippocampus of AD mice. EUK1001 may also alter amyloid precursor protein processing to a nonamyloidgenic pathway in vitro. These results demonstrate that EUK1001 may ameliorate the cognitive dysfunction of AD mice, possibly by reducing Abeta production. Therefore, EUK1001 may be an effective treatment for AD.",
