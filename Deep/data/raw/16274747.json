     "PG": "455-64",
     "AB": "The sst1 receptor was the first of the 5 somatostatin receptors to be cloned by homology with the glucagon receptor 13 years ago. It is a 7-transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptor that is negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase, but can also trigger other transduction pathways. The distribution of sst1 mRNA, immunolabeling, and radioligand binding are not entirely overlapping, but the recent availability of knockout (KO) mice and a (still limited) number of selective agonists/antagonists has increased our knowledge about this receptor. These new tools have helped to reveal a role for the sst1 receptor in hippocampal, hypothalamic, basal ganglia, and retinal functions. In at least the latter 3 structures, the sst1 receptor appears to act as an inhibitory autoreceptor located on somatostatin neurons, whereas in the hippocampus such a role is still based on circumstantial evidence.",
