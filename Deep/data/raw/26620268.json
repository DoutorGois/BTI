     "AB": "Cholinergic mechanisms in the hippocampus regulate forms of synaptic plasticity linked with cognition and spatial navigation, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells under blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors, we report that a single acetylcholine pulse and repeated depolarization activated a robust and enduring postsynaptic depolarization-induced enhancement of inhibition (DEI) that masked a presynaptic depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI). Increased cytosolic Ca2+ and M1-muscarinic receptor activation caused the rise in voltage-sensitive alpha5betagamma2-containing gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptors that generated DEI. In summary, this muscarinic-mediated activity-dependent plasticity rapidly transfers depolarization effects on inhibition from presynaptic suppression or DSI to postsynaptic enhancement or DEI, a change potentially relevant in behavior.",
