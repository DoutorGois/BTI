The patient presented with confusion, loss of memory, hallucinations, abnormal behaviour, tachycardia and profuse sweating. Investigations were unrewarding and the patient's clinical state deteriorated until his death 1 month after presentation. The diagnosis was made at autopsy when bilateral extensive neuronal loss with reactive gliosis, confined to the medial temporal cortex and Ammon's horn, was revealed.",
