     "AB": "Intracerebral administration of Mycoplasma fermentans (MF), a small microorganism that has been found in the brain of some AIDS patients, induces behavioral and neuroendocrine alterations in rats. To examine the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in mediating these effects we measured MF-induced expression of TNFalpha and IL-1beta mRNA in various brain regions, and the effects of TNFalpha synthesis blockers and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) on MF-induced sickness behavior and adrenocortical activation. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of heat-inactivated MF induced the expression of both TNFalpha and IL-1beta mRNA in the cortex, dorsal hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Pre-treatment of rats with either TNFalpha synthesis blockers, pentoxifylline or rolipram, or with IL-1ra did not attenuate MF-induced anorexia, body weight loss, and suppression of social behavior. However, simultaneous administration of both pentoxifylline and IL-1ra markedly attenuated MF-induced anorexia and body weight loss, but had no effect on the suppression of social behavior. Pre-treatment with pentoxifylline, but not with IL-1ra, significantly attenuated MF-induced corticosterone (CS) secretion. Together, these findings indicate that both TNFalpha and IL-1 participate, in a complementary manner, in mediating some of the behavioral effects of MF, whereas only TNFalpha, but not IL-1, is involved in mediating MF-induced adrenocortical activation. We suggest that cytokines within the brain are involved in mediating at least some of the neurobehavioral and neuroendocrine abnormalities that may be produced by MF in AIDS patients.",
