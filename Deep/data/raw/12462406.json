We have employed a multidisciplinary approach using whole cell patch clamp recording and transcriptional analysis to define the genomic basis of trophin-induced hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Transcriptional analysis of single cells by linear amplification of antisense RNA has added a new dimension of sensitivity and selectivity to the study of the complex and heterogeneous population of neurons. We describe different gene expression profiling techniques that offer novel approaches to monitoring thousands of genes in parallel, fostering identification of circuits involved in learning and memory.",
