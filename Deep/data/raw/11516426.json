     "AB": "Using organotypic cultures of rat hippocampal slices, we investigated the possible involvement of arachidonate cascades in neuronal death following ischemic insult. Oxygen/glucose deprivation-induced neuronal damage was efficiently attenuated by various inhibitors of lipoxygenase, whereas cyclooxygenase inhibitors were less effective. Interestingly, 5- and 12-lipoxygenases are likely to separately mediate ischemic injury in the hippocampus. The present study will provide novel therapeutic targets for the development of neuroprotective agents.",
