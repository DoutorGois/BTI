     "AB": "We investigated kainate-induced excitotoxicity in embryonic rat hippocampal cells cultured in a chemically defined medium. Treatment with kainate for 24 h resulted in neuronal death, as assessed by the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the culture media. This neurotoxic effect was kainate dose- and culture age-dependent. EC50 of kainate was 127 +/- 11 microM. 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo (f)quinoxaline (NBQX) completely blocked the toxicity, while MK801, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, also blocked it but not completely. Furthermore, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) attenuated the kainate injury, while the selective and noncompetitive AMPA-preferring receptor antagonist 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7, 8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzo-diazepine (GYKI 52466) blocked it completely. Concanavalin A (ConA), which potentiates the response to kainate at kainate-preferring receptors, had little effect on kainate toxicity. Further, AMPA alone induced little toxicity, but produced remarkable toxicity when cyclothazide was used to block the desensitization of AMPA-preferring receptors. These results indicate that kainate excitotoxicity in hippocampal cultures is mediated by AMPA- but not kainate-preferring receptors, and that it involves NMDA-receptor-mediated toxicity. The non-desensitizing response at AMPA-preferring receptors may play an important role in kainate-induced excitotoxicity.",
