     "AB": "Hypothermia induced by surface cooling has shown to protect vulnerable regions of the brain during an ischemic insult. This study evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of neurotensin, a potent hypothermic agent, using a 5-min carotid occlusion procedure in the gerbil. In Experiment 1, the dose-response and time course of neurotensin-induced hypothermia were evaluated (n = 5/dose). Central infusion of 10, 20, and 30 micrograms neurotensin were found to significantly decrease core body temperature of conscious gerbils within 30 min of administration. In Experiment 2, gerbils pretreated with 30 micrograms neurotensin were permitted to become hypothermic or were maintained at 37 degrees-38 degrees C (rectal) during ischemic insult. Other gerbils were pretreated with peptide vehicle prior to ischemic insult (at 37 degrees -38 degrees C) or underwent a sham procedure (n = 6/condition). At 24 h after surgery, gerbils were tested for increased locomotor activity in an open-field apparatus. Gerbils pretreated with peptide vehicle or neurotensin and maintained at 37 degrees-38 degrees C during ischemia had significantly higher activity levels compared to the other treated groups. In contrast, gerbils made hypothermic with neurotensin exhibited activity levels similar to sham gerbils. Histological assessment revealed that neurotensin-induced hypothermia protected the CA1 region from ischemic damage.",
