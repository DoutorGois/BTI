     "AB": "The role of serotonergic (5-HT) innervation of rat hippocampus in clonidine- induced behavioural effects was studied in naive and desipramine-pretreated animals. 5,7- DHT-lesions of the median raphe nucleus (MR) produced about 50 per cent decrease of serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoloacetic acid (5-HIAA) content in the rat cortex and hippocampus. Lesions of the MR also accelerated the attenuating effect of desipramine upon locomotor inhibition produced by intrahippocampal clonidine injections. In the forced swim test (FST) the MR lesion revealed the stimulatory potency of clonidine upon rat active behaviour, which was statistically significant. However, no further potentiation by MR lesions of DMI effects upon behavioural action of clonidine could be observed in this test. It is concluded that hippocampal serotonergic innervation plays a minor role in the antidepressant-induced changes in behavioural effects of clonidine, which probably occur via modulation of local alpha-adrenoceptors. It is also conceivable that the stimulatory effect of intrahippocampal clonidine injections in the forced swim test in MR-lesioned rats, may be due to the increase in the alpha-(1)-adrenoceptor function in this brain area.",
