     "AB": "In the normal developing hippocampus of the gerbil, parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons first appear in the stratum pyramidale of CA3 at postnatal day 15 (P15), and in CA2 and hilus of the dentate gyrus from P21 onwards. Immunoreactive terminals also follow the same sequence from CA3 to CA1 to reach adult patterns by the end of the 1st month. Calbindin D-28k immunoreactivity is seen in the external part of the upper blade of the dentate gyrus at P5, and progresses to the granule cell and molecular layers of the whole gyrus by P15, except for a thin band of immature cells located at the base of the granule cell layer which are calbindin negative. Calbindin immunoreactivity in mossy fibers progresses from the external to the hilar region of CA3 during the same period. A few immunoreactive cells are also found in the stratum radiatum/lacunare of the CA3, but no calbindin-immunoreactive cells are observed in the CA1 and CA2 subfields. The adult pattern of calbindin immunoreactivity is reached at P21. Vulnerability following transient forebrain ischemia for 20 min was examined in the hippocampal formation of gerbils during postnatal development. No cellular damage was seen in animals aged 7 days. Dying cells were observed at the base of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus in animals aged 15, 21 and 30 days. Pyramidal cells in the CA3 subfield were also sensitive to ischemia in gerbils aged 15 days, and less frequently in animals aged 21 days. The adult pattern of cellular damage, characterized by selective vulnerability of the CA1 subfield, was seen from day 30 onwards.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
