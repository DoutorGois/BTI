     "AB": "Relatively few physiological studies have been carried out on intrahippocampal axons. We have recorded compound potentials from fiber groups and the activity of individual axons at 22-25 degrees C to characterize the conduction in subsets of the broad fan-shaped CA3 pyramidal axonal tree, including the Schaffer collaterals and longitudinal branches. The same wide axonal branching was indicated by antidromic activation of individual CA3 pyramidal cells. The average compound action potential latency from the CA3 to the CA1 area (Schaffer collaterals) increased by 4.16 +/- 0.06 ms/mm separation between the stimulation and registration electrodes. The impulses spread 31% faster in the 45-degree oblique temporal than in the transverse direction across CA1. The latency of the longitudinal axons in the CA3 area increased by 6.19 +/- 0.19 ms/mm. More impressive than these direction-dependent differences in latency were the large differences between individual axons running in the same direction. For both the longitudinal axons and the Schaffer collaterals, there was a broad distribution of antidromic latencies for a given distance between the stimulation and recording points. Typically, the fastest impulses arrived in half the time of the slowest. The distribution of compound action potential latencies between two points in the tissue could be made narrower by surgical restriction of the thickness and width of the preparation. By comparison, the cerebellar parallel fibers showed a narrower distribution of their latencies than the Schaffer collaterals. Because the cerebellar fibers run more straight than Schaffer collaterals, this suggested that some of the latency differences of the latter were due to differences in the path length of the axons. One consequence of our findings is that synchronous firing of neighboring CA3 pyramidal cells does not necessarily give synchronous inputs to common target CA1 neurons.",
