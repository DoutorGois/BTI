Electron microscope studies showed dark neurons, degeneration of endothelial cells and changes in basement membrane of brain capillaries, and changed astroglia in diabetic rats. Our results seem to support our previous findings in light microscopy and correspond with some others authors' suggestions that diabetes leads to chronic, generalized pathologic process in diabetic-rat brain, not-only dependent on vascular pathology, but which may be related to an oxidative/metabolic stress leading to a death of neurons in necrotic or apoptotic way.",
