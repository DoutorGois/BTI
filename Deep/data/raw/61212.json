     "AB": "Efferent projections from the medial and periventricular preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and nuclei of the diagonal band were traced using tritiated amino acid autoradiography in albino rats. Medial and periventricular preoptic area efferents were not restricted to short-axon projections. Ascending projections from the medial preoptic area (mPOA) were traced through the diagonal band into the septum. Descending mPOA axons coursed in the medial parts of the medial forebrain bundle. Projections to most hypothalamic nuclei, including the arcuate nucleus and median eminence, were observed. In the midbrain, mPOA efferents were distributed in the central grey, raphe nuclei, ventral tegmental area and reticular formation. Projections from the mPOA were also observed to the amygdala through the stria terminalis, to the lateral habenula through the stria medullaris, and to the periventricular thalamus. Axons of the most medial and periventricular preoptic area (pvPOA) neurons had a distribution similar to more lateral mPOA neurons but their longest-axoned projections were weaker. The pvPOA did not send axons through the stria medullaris but did project more heavily than the more lateral mPOA to the arcuate nucleus and median eminence. Projections from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (nST) were in most respects similar to those from the medial preoptic area, with the major addition of a projection to the accessory olfactory bulb. The nuclei of the diagonal band of Broca (nDBB) gave a different pattern of projections than mPOA or nST, projecting, for instance, to the medial septum and hippocampus. Descending nDBB efferents ran in the ventral portion of the medial forebrain bundle. Among hypothalamic cell groups, only the medial mammillary nuclei received nDBB projections. nDBB efferents also distributed in the medial and lateral habenular nuclei and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus.",
