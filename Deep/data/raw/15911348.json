     "AB": "The neural cell adhesion molecule L1 may participate in initiating and maintaining synaptic changes during learning in the hippocampus. One prominent form of synaptic change in the hippocampus is long-term potentiation (LTP) that occurs following specific patterns of synaptic activity. We present evidence that Y1176 of the YRSL motif within L1 cytoplasmic domain is dephosphorylated in LTP-induced hippocampus. The dephosphorylated L1 is associated with AP-2 and AP180 that are required for clathrin-mediated internalization of L1. These data suggest that clathrin-mediated recycling of L1 at presynaptic sites is enhanced by certain kinds of neural activity, and that maintenance of LTP-induced synaptic changes is regulated by L1 recycling.",
