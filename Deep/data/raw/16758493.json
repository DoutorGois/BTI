     "AB": "The ovarian hormone progesterone is neuroprotective in different experimental models of neurodegeneration. In the nervous system, progesterone is metabolized to 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone (DHP) by the enzyme 5alpha-reductase. DHP is subsequently reduced to 3alpha,5alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone (THP) by a reversible reaction catalyzed by the enzyme 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. In this study we have analyzed whether progesterone metabolism is involved in the neuroprotective effect of the hormone in the hilus of the hippocampus of ovariectomized rats injected with kainic acid, an experimental model of excitotoxic cell death. Progesterone increased the levels of DHP and THP in plasma and hippocampus and prevented kainic-acid-induced neuronal loss. In contrast to progesterone, the synthetic progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, Provera) did not increase DHP and THP levels and did not prevent kainic-acid-induced neuronal loss. The administration of the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride prevented the increase in the levels of DHP and THP in plasma and hippocampus as a result of progesterone administration and abolished the neuroprotective effect of progesterone. Both DHP and THP were neuroprotective against kainic acid. However, the administration of indomethacin, a 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, blocked the neuroprotective effect of both DHP and THP, suggesting that both metabolites are necessary for the neuroprotective effect of progesterone. In conclusion, our findings indicate that progesterone is neuroprotective against kainic acid excitotoxicity in vivo while the synthetic progestin MPA is not and suggest that progesterone metabolism to its reduced derivatives DHP and THP is necessary for the neuroprotective effect of the hormone.",
