     "AB": "Mounting evidence suggests the association of immune genes with complex neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia. However, immune gene expression in the brain and their involvement in schizophrenia-related behavior in animal models have not been well studied so far. We analyzed the social (resident-intruder) and sensorimotor gating (pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle) behaviors, and expression profiles of several brain immune genes in adult C57BL/6N and DBA/2J female mice. Compared to C57BL/6N mice, DBA/2J mice exhibited less social interaction in the resident-intruder test and reduced pre-pulse inhibition. The mRNA levels of Il1b and Il6 genes were significantly higher in the cortex and hypothalamus, while the mRNA level of C1qb was lower in the cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus of DBA/2J mice compared to C57BL/6N mice. Furthermore, Tnfsf13b was up-regulated in the cortex and hippocampus, and so did Cd47 in the hippocampus, while Cx3cl1 was down-regulated in the cortex of DBA/2J mice. Our study demonstrates the differential expression of several immune genes in C57BL/6N and DBA/2J strains and more importantly provides clues on their potential importance in regulating schizophrenia-related endophenotypes in animal models.",
