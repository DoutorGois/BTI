     "AB": "Evoked and spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e.p.s.p.s) at the mossy fibre input to CA3 pyramidal neurones were recorded intracellularly in slices from the guinea-pig hippocampus. The effects of several amino acid antagonists on these responses were examined. L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (L-AP4), L-serine-O-phosphate (L-SOP), kynurenate, and N-(p-bromobenzoyl)piperazine-2,3-dicarboxylate (pBB-PzDA) reduced the amplitude of evoked mossy fibre e.p.s.p.s without affecting membrane potential or input resistance. Antagonism of mossy fibre spontaneous miniature e.p.s.p.s (m.e.p.s.p.s) by these compounds fell into two groups. L-AP4 and L-SOP applied at concentrations that blocked evoked e.p.s.p.s did not affect amplitude distributions of spontaneous m.e.p.s.p.s. Kynurenate and pBB-PzDA significantly affected the amplitude distributions and reduced the mean amplitude of spontaneous m.e.p.s.p.s. These results are consistent with a presynaptic site of action for L-AP4 and L-SOP and a post-synaptic site of action for kynurenate and pBB-PzDA as antagonists of e.p.s.p.s at the guinea-pig mossy fibre-CA3 pyramidal neurone synapse.",
