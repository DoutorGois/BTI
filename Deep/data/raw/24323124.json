     "AB": "Galectin-1 (gal-1) is one of several well-studied proteins from the galectin families. It is a 14.5 kDa glycoprotein with a single carbohydrate-binding domain. To examine the distribution and properties of gal-1 in the mouse hippocampus, we performed immunohistochemistry using an anti-gal-1 antibody. We found that most gal-1-positive cells showed both NeuN and beta-tubulin III (Tuj-1) immunoreactivity (NeuN: 93%, beta-tubulin III: 88%). Furthermore, we clarified that 77% of gal-1-positive cells expressed somatostatin, 79% of gal-1-positive cells expressed GAD67, 34% of gal-1-positive cells expressed parvalbumin, 5% of gal-1-positive cells expressed calretinin, 2% of gal-1-positive cells expressed calbindin, and 31% of gal-1-positive cells expressed neuropeptide Y in the mouse hippocampus. These results indicate that gal-1 is expressed in interneurons that also express beta-tubulin III and gal-1 may be a novel marker for interneuron subpopulations in the hippocampus.",
