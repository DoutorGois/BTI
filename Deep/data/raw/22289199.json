     "AB": "Recent epidemiological studies have associated type 2 diabetes mellitus with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). A dramatic decrease in glucose utilisation has been observed in the brains of AD patients, and this decrease has led to the hypothesis that the cognitive dysfunction in AD is associated with decreased central glucose metabolism [1], in addition to cholinergic deficit and elevated amyloid accumulation in the brain [2]. The aims of the present study were to examine the effects of intracerebral administration of streptozotocin (STZ) on cognitive performance in rats as observed by Morris water maze (MWM) task and to clarify the successive insulin-related neurochemical changes through immunohistochemical analysis of the hippocampus. Significant differences were observed in all the parameters of the MWM task (escape latency, path efficiency, average swimming speed and swim path) between STZ-3V-treated and control rats. Immunohistochemical analysis using hippocampal formations revealed significant decreases in phospho-cyclic AMP binding protein, Akt and insulin-degrading enzyme immunoreactivities and a significant increase in amyloid beta immunoreactivity. Our behavioural experiments confirmed that intraventricular administration of STZ led to cognitive impairment, which was ascertained by the changes in hippocampal immunohistochemical markers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that cognitive decline in diabetes was primarily due to impaired intracerebral insulin signalling in addition to arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular changes, which hitherto have been advocated as the main cause of diabetic dementia.",
