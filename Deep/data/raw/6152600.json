     "AB": "The 30 mM K+-induced release of endogenous glutamate has been examined in slices of cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum from \"short sleep\" and \"long sleep\" mice, lines genetically selected for differential response to acute ethanol administration. In cortex and striatum, glutamate release was significantly higher in \"short sleep\" mice, while in hippocampus the difference was reversed. No differences were observed in glutamate release from cerebellum. The release was Ca++-dependent, being inhibited by lanthanum and verapamil.",
