     "AB": "Activation of the hippocampal dopamine 1-class receptors (D1R and D5R) are implicated in contextual fear conditioning (CFC). However, the specific role of the D1R versus D5R in hippocampal dependent CFC has not been investigated. Generation of D1R- and D5R-specific in situ hybridization probes showed that D1R and D5R mRNA expression was greatest in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. To identify the role of each receptor in CFC we generated spatially restricted KO mice that lack either the D1R or D5R in DG granule cells. DG D1R KOs displayed significant fear memory deficits, whereas DG D5R KOs did not. Furthermore, D1R KOs but not D5R KOs, exhibited generalized fear between two similar but different contexts. In the familiar home cage context, c-Fos expression was relatively low in the DG of control mice, and it increased upon exposure to a novel context. This level of c-Fos expression in the DG did not further increase when a footshock was delivered in the novel context. In DG D1R KOs, DG c-Fos levels in the home cage was higher than that of the control mice, but it did not further increase upon exposure to a novel context and remained at the same level upon a shock delivery. In contrast, the levels of DG c-Fos expression was unaffected by the deletion of DG D5R neither in the home cage nor upon a shock delivery. These results suggest that DG D1Rs, but not D5Rs, contribute to the formation of distinct contextual representations of novel environments.",
