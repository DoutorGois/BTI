     "AB": "The effects of the subiculum stimulation were studied in 80 antidromically identified hypothalamic supraoptic neurons of lactating rats. Inhibition of antidromic responses evoked by stimulation of the neurohypophysial stalk after conditioning stimulation of the subiculum was detected in 26% of cells studied. Sometimes the inhibition followed each separate subicular stimulus with 5-25 ms latency and was transitory, sometimes it developed gradually as the conditioning stimulation was applied. No excitatory responses to subiculum stimulation were found. Nature of the inhibition observed is discussed as related to the morphofunctional organization of subicular synaptic inhibitory inputs to neurosecretory cells.",
