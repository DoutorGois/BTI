     "AB": "Changes in glutamatergic nervous activities following intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of ethylcholine aziridinium (AF64A) were studied in rats. The levels of total glutamate, those of glutamate in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in extracellular fluid (ECF) of striatum, the activities of glutamine synthetase (GS), glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and the specific binding sites of [(3)H]MK801 in striatum, hippocampus and frontal cortex were assessed a week after the infusion of AF64A (3 nmol) into lateral ventricle. The levels of total glutamate were significantly decreased in striatum, hippocampus and frontal cortex after AF64A treatment. Although the levels of glutamate in CSF weren't changed after AF64A treatment, the levels of glutamate in ECF of striatum were significantly decreased (62.6%). GS activities in striatum were significantly decreased. But, glutaminase activities in striatum were significantly increased. However, the activities of GS and glutaminase in frontal cortex and hippocampus weren't changed. Although GDH activities in frontal cortex were significantly decreased, those in striatum and hippocampus weren't altered. The striatal densities of [(3)H]MK 801 binding sites were increased without changes in its affinity. Also, the specific binding sites of [(3)H]MK801 were increased in frontal cortex but not in hippocampus. These results indicate that the glutamatergic nervous activities were altered with the infusion of AF64A into lateral ventricle. Furthermore, it suggest that the decreased levels of glutamate after AF64A treatment may affect the change in the other parameters of glutamatergic neuronal activities.",
