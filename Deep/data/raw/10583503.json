     "AB": "We studied excitatory field potentials in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, prelimbic area) to electrostimulation of the ventral hippocampus (CA1/subicular region) in the anaesthetized rat. Nine hundred stimulus trains (5 pulses at 250 Hz) applied at 1 Hz to the ventral hippocampus significantly and persistently depressed the amplitude and maximal slope ( approximately 55% for each index) of the prelimbic field potentials, but did not change the latency of the maximal slope or peak negativity. Twelve stimulus trains (50 pulses at 250 Hz) applied subsequently at 0.1 Hz restored the depression back to control level, and this reversible depression was maintained for at least 13 h. Cumulative depressive effects on the prelimbic field potential amplitude and maximal slope were observed upon addition of stimulus trains in the hippocampus. An important implication of the results is that the direct pathway from the hippocampus to the mPFC in the rat retains long-term depression (LTD) as a neuroplastic form in vivo. This form could cooperate with long-term potentiation (LTP) and such a bi-directional synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex contributes to how cortical neural networks store information.",
