     "AB": "AIM: To determine the concentrations of chemical characteristic to extracts of leaves and flowers of Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort) in a number of selected samples and, following chemical characterization, to investigate the effects of these extracts on several pharmacological properties including effects of the extracts on inhibition of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) uptake and on antioxidant properties. METHODS: The samples were analyzed for the presence of characteristic chemicals by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) directly coupled to ultraviolet wavelength absorbance and positive or negative mode electrospray mass spectrometric detection. The effects of extracts on 5-HT uptake were determined by quantifying 3H-5-HT incorporation into rat hippocampal prisms. Estimates of effects of extracts on free radical scavenging capacity were made using a dynamic assay based on the ability of compounds to prevent the initiation of a colored reaction produced by the horseradish peroxidase catalyzed formation of hydroxyl free radicals from hydrogen peroxide using 2',2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as the color indicator. RESULTS: The chemical profile of a number of extracts were determined and found to differ substantially from each other. Inhibition of 5-HT uptake was found to correlate with hyperforin content and free radical scavenging capacity was found to correlate with the content of several flavonoids including quercetin and hyperoside. CONCLUSION: Standardized extracts of H perforatum varied substantially in the concentration of several characteristic chemicals. The correlation between pharmacological activity and certain characteristic chemicals found in these extracts indicates that the medicinal benefit derived from selected extracts will vary considerably depending on their chemical composition.",
