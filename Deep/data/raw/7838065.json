     "AB": "We investigated postischemic changes of non-pyramidal neurons in the gerbil hippocampus 1 h - 7 days after 10 min of cerebral ischemia, with parvalbumin and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-immunohistochemistry. Parvalbumin-immunoreactive interneurons in the hippocampus were unaffected up to 24 h after ischemia. A slight reduction of the immunoreactivity in neuronal processes was seen in the hippocampal CA1 sector 48 h after ischemia. Seven days after ischemia, a marked loss of parvalbumin-immunoreactive interneurons was observed in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 sectors. Furthermore, reduced staining in the dentate granular and molecular layers was observed. MAP2-immunoreactive pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus were unchanged up to 48 h after ischemia. Seven days after ischemia, a severe loss of MAP2 immunoreactivity was found in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons and dentate hilar neurons. However, scattered CA1 neurons, most likely interneurons, preserved MAP2 immunoreactivity. The results demonstrate that transient cerebral ischemia can cause a loss of parvalbumin-immunoreactive interneurons in the hippocampus. Furthermore, some interneurons seem to lose parvalbumin synthesis. Although dentate granule cells are resistant to ischemia, considerable reductions of afferent input was suggested by parvalbumin staining.",
