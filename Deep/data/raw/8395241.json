     "AB": "The production of platelet-activating factor (PAF), an alkyl ether phospholipid, was previously shown to occur in the brain upon various stimuli, and binding sites for PAF have been reported. We have recently demonstrated the existence of functional mRNA for PAF receptor in the brain by using a Xenopus oocyte expression system (Bito et al. (1992) Neuron 9, 285-294). In this review, we have analyzed the binding characteristics of PAF receptor in the rat brain and show that PAF receptor is ubiquitously distributed in the rat central nervous system, with an emphasis to the hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulb. PAF was also found to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ in rat hippocampus.",
