     "AB": "Developmental changes in the distribution of brain-specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, neurocan and phosphacan/RPTPzeta/beta, in the hippocampus of the Sprague-Dawley rat were examined using monoclonal antibodies 1G2 and 6B4. The 1G2 immunoreactivity was predominant in the neonatal hippocampus while the 6B4 immunoreactivity was predominant in the mature hippocampus. Moderate 1G2 immunoreactivity was detected in the dentate gyrus and subiculum immediately after birth. Immunoreactivity reached a peak on postnatal days 7-10 (P7-P10) when intense 1G2 labeling was present throughout the neuropil layers of the hippocampus except the mossy fiber tract. 6B4 immunoreactivity was limited in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of CA1 in the neonatal hippocampus. It gradually increased by P21 when diffuse 6B4 immunoreactivity was detected in the stratum oriens and radiatum of Ammon's horn, and in the hilus and inner one-third molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, while 1G2 immunoreactivity decreased after P21. In the adult hippocampus, moderate 6B4 immunoreactivity was present in the stratum oriens and radiatum of Ammon's horn, and in the hilus and inner one-third molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, but not in the mossy fiber tract. In addition, strong 6B4 labeling appeared around a subset of neurons after P21. The results suggest that neurocan may have a role in the development of neuronal organization, while phosphacan/RPTPzeta/beta may contribute to the maintenance and plasticity of synaptic structure and function. Furthermore, the absence of 1G2 and 6B4 immunoreactivities in the stratum lucidum suggests that neurocan and phosphacan/RPTPzeta/beta may function as a barrier for the extension of mossy fibers and provide an environment permissive for fasciculation of the mossy fibers.",
