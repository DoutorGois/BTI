     "AB": "Two new compounds (LY293558 and LY294486), that antagonize homomeric human GluR5 receptors, were examined against responses mediated by kainate receptors in the CA3 region of rat hippocampal slices. Both compounds (applied at a concentration of 10 microM) antagonized reversibly currents induced by 200 nM kainate. They also antagonized reversibly the synaptic activation of kainate receptors, evoked by high-frequency stimulation of mossy fibres, in the presence of NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists. These results show that GluR5 subunits are likely to contribute to a kainate receptor on CA3 neurones that mediates responses to both kainate and synaptically-released L-glutamate.",
