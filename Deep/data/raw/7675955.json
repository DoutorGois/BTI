     "AB": "Acute immobilization stress induced by taping four limbs, applying tail pinch stress and electric foot shock stress immediately reduced the frequency of head shakes induced by 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane ((+/-)DOI), a 5-HT2A/C agonist in rats. Immobilization stress due to the use of cylinder restraint and forced swimming did not affect 5-HT2A-mediated behavior. Acute immobilization stress did not affect [3H]ketanserin binding to the 5HT2A receptor in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Presynaptic serotonergic lesions with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine(5,7-DHT) did not affect the reduction in 5-HT2A-mediated behavior after acute immobilization stress. The decreases in head shake frequency after acute immobilization stress by taping were attenuated by pretreatment with diazepam (2.5 mg/kg IP): This attenuation was reversed by pretreatment with flumazenil (10 mg/kg IP). The reduction in (+/-)DOI-induced 5-HT2A-mediated behavior caused by stress may be related to a change in agonist affinity to the receptor or changes in other neurotransmitter systems or the effect of PI turnover.",
