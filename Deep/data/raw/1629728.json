     "AB": "The effect of calcium channel antagonists on the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine from the hippocampus of the chloral hydrate-anaesthetised rat was studied using the technique of intracerebral microdialysis. As the basal concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine was close to the limit of detection of the HPLC method (8 fmol), the 5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (10 microM), was included in the perfusion fluid. The L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channel antagonists, PN200-110, diltiazem, and verapamil, all passed through the dialysis membrane, giving a recovery of 20-30%. The N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channel antagonist, omega-conotoxin, penetrated less readily (12% recovery). The dihydropyridine, PN200-110, adhered to the probe, resulting in an effective concentration at the membrane 30% of that in the perfusion fluid. The concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the dialysate samples was reduced by 60% in the absence of calcium. The L channel antagonists had little effect on the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine, which was inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, to a maximum of 40% by omega-conotoxin. It is concluded that, under physiological conditions, the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine from the rat hippocampus is dependent on the entry of calcium through N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, although another calcium channel may also be involved.",
