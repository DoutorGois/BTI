     "AB": "The neuronal migration protein doublecortin (DCX) that associates with microtubules through a tandem DCX repeat, is required for the development of the complex architecture of the human cerebral cortex. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen with Dcx as bait, we have isolated neurabin II/spinophilin, an F-actin binding protein known to play a role in dendritic spine formation. The coiled-coil domain of neurabin II binds to a DCX region encompassing the C-terminal portion of the second DCX repeat and the N-terminal portion of the Ser/Pro-rich domain. Immunoprecipitation experiments with brain extracts show that neurabin II and Dcx interact in vivo. Several Dcx constructs that mimic human DCX mutant alleles failed to interact with neurabin II. Since Dcx and neurabin II colocalized in the developing and adult brain, a neurabin II-DCX heterodimer may be involved in neuronal migration and dendritic spine formation.",
