     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Aged rodents have proven to be a useful tool in studying age-related cognitive decline, particularly with regard to hippocampal function. A number of maze tests have been developed to evaluate hippocampal function in aged rodents, including the eight-arm radial maze, Barnes circular platform maze and Morris water maze. To some extent, these mazes have been used interchangeably to evaluate aged animals. Few researchers, however, have examined how performance of individual, aged animals compares in these three mazes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the performances in the three mazes and to examine how such performances are related to each other, to hippocampal morphology and to neurotrophin gene expression. METHODS: We screened groups of young and old Fisher 344 x Brown Norway rats for general health and physical abilities, tested the animals in the three mazes and examined correlations among performances in the mazes and in screening tests. Hippocampal neuron density and expression of hippocampal neurotrophin mRNAs were also examined and compared with behavior in the three mazes. RESULTS: Aged animals were found to be impaired in all three mazes and to have lower hippocampal neuron densities compared with young animals, with poor learning behavior significantly correlating with reduced hippocampal neuron density. Differences were observed between performance in the different mazes, but in general the Morris water maze and Barnes circular platform maze were found to give similar results.",
