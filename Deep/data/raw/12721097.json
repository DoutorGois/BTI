     "AB": "1. The cannabinoid CB(1) receptor inverse agonist/antagonist SR 141716 increases acetylcholine release in rodent hippocampus and improves memory in some experimental paradigms. Since drugs like SR 141716 may represent a novel class of cognition-enhancing drugs, we wanted to check whether the function of the CB(1) receptor is preserved during ageing. 2. Hippocampal and striatal slices from 2- to 3- and 24- to 28-month-old C57BL/6J mice were preincubated with [(3)H]-choline or [(3)H]-noradrenaline ([(3)H]-NA) and superfused. 3. The cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55212-2 inhibited, and SR 141716 facilitated, the electrically (3 Hz) evoked tritium overflow in hippocampal slices (preincubated with [(3)H]-choline) from young and aged mice to the same extent. The evoked overflow per se was less by 33% in slices from aged animals. 4. WIN 55212-2 and SR 141716 did not affect, but the muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine inhibited, the evoked (3 Hz) overflow in striatal slices (preincubated with [(3)H]-choline) from young and aged mice to the same extent. The evoked overflow per se tended to be less in slices from aged animals. 5. The evoked (0.3 Hz) overflow in hippocampal slices (preincubated with [(3)H]-NA) was not affected by WIN 55212-2 and SR 141716, but was inhibited by histamine (via H(3) receptors) in slices from young mice and, to a somewhat less extent, in slices from aged mice. The evoked overflow per se did not differ between age groups. 6. In conclusion, the function of the CB(1) receptor involved in the tonic inhibition of hippocampal acetylcholine release is preserved in aged mice.",
