     "AB": "The expression of proteins coded by the immediate early genes of the fos family and c-jun was used to study the effect of acute ethanol administration on convulsant-induced neuronal activity in rat brain. Immunoreactivity for both types of protein was induced by either SC injection of pentylenetetrazole or by IP injection of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid. Both agents elicited distinct patterns of behaviour and a high level of FOS-immunoreactivity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Acute IP doses of ethanol (1.0-3.0 g/kg) significantly reduced the behaviours and FOS-immunoreactivity induced in the cerebral cortex by both pentylenetetrazole and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid. Pentylenetetrazole-induced FOS-immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was also inhibited by ethanol. In contrast, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced FOS-immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was not inhibited by any dose of ethanol. c-JUN immunoreactivity showed a distinct pattern of induction in the hippocampus after injection of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid. Ethanol (3.0 g/kg) inhibited N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced c-JUN-immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The differences in inhibition of immunoreactivity suggest that the sensitivity of the NMDA- and GABAA-related neuronal pathways to ethanol varies among different anatomical structures.",
