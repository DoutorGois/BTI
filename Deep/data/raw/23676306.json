     "AB": "This is a review of the use of neuroimaging in epilepsy outlining the imaging strategy for new onset seizures and also those with intractable focal seizures being investigated as potential epilepsy surgery candidates. The review describes the radiological features of conditions which may be encountered in each clinical context, together with advice on the optimum imaging protocols to detect epileptogenic lesions. The review also presents the role of imaging in presurgical planning, the demonstration of eloquent function, grid placement and postoperative assessment.",
