     "AB": "The protective effects of huperzine A on transient global ischemia in gerbils were investigated. Five min of global ischemia in gerbils results in working memory impairments shown by increased escape latency in a water maze and reduced time spent in the target quadrant. These signs of dysfunction are accompanied by delayed degeneration of pyramidal hippocampal CA1 neurons and by decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus. Subchronic oral administration of huperzine A (0.1 mg/kg, twice per day for 14 days) after ischemia significantly reduced the memory impairment, reduced neuronal degeneration in the CA1 region, and partially restored hippocampal choline acetyltransferase activity. The ability of huperzine A to attenuate memory deficits and neuronal damage after ischemia might be beneficial in cerebrovascular type dementia.",
