     "AB": "Embryonic hippocampal neurons cultured on surface modified fluoropolymers showed enhanced interaction and neurite extension. Poly(tetrafluoroethylene-co-hexafluoropropylene) (FEP) film surfaces were aminated by reaction with a UV-activated mercury ammonia system yielding FEP-[N/O]. Laminin-derived cell-adhesive peptides (YIGSR and IKVAV) were coupled to FEP surface functional groups using tresyl chloride activation. Embryonic (E18) hippocampal neurons were cultured in serum-free medium for up to 1 week on FEP film surfaces that were modified with either one or both of GYIGSR and SIKVAV or GGGGGGYIGSR and compared to control surfaces of FEP-[N/O] and poly(L-lysine)/laminin-coated tissue culture polystyrene. Neuron-surface interactions were analyzed over time in terms of neurite outgrowth (number and length of neurites), cell adhesion and viability. Neurite outgrowth and adhesion were significantly better on peptide-modified surfaces than on either FEP or FEP-[N/O]. Cells on the mixed peptide (GYIGSR/SIKVAV) and the spacer group peptide (GGGGGGYIGSR) surfaces demonstrated similar behavior to those on the positive PLL/laminin control. The specificity of the cell-peptide interaction was demonstrated with a competitive assay where dissociated neurons were incubated in media containing peptides prior to plating. Cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth diminished on all surfaces when hippocampal neurons were pre-incubated with dissolved peptides prior to plating.",
