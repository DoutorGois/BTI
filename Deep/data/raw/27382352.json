     "AB": "Pro-inflammatory cytokine and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are modulated in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study investigated the effects of ibuprofen (IBU) on enhanced anxiety in a rat model of PTSD induced by a single prolonged stress (SPS) procedure. The effects of IBU on inflammation and BDNF modulation in the hippocampus and the mechanisms underlying for anxiolytic action of IBU were also investigated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given IBU (20 or 40 mg/kg, i.p., once daily) for 14 days. Daily IBU (40 mg/kg) administration signifi cantly increased the number and duration of open arm visits in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, reduced the anxiety index in the EPM test, and increased the time spent in the center of an open fi eld after SPS. IBU administration signifi cantly decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and BDNF, in the hippocampus, as assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunohistochemistry. These fi ndings suggest that IBU exerts a therapeutic effect on PTSD that might be at least partially mediated by alleviation of anxiety symptoms due to its anti-inflammatory activity and BDNF expression in the rat brain.",
