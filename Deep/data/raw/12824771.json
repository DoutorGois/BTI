     "AB": "In this study we have examined the migration and phenotypic differentiation of human expanded neural precursors (hENPs) when transplanted into the intact adult rat brain. Primary human embryonic cortical cells and hENPs derived from the same source but expanded epigenetically in culture for two different time periods were transplanted into the rodent striatum and hippocampus. Histological analysis showed that overall the number of neurons decreased with time spent in culture prior to transplantation within the core of the graft regardless of site of implantation. Furthermore, transplanted cells migrated away from the graft to a similar extent irrespective of time in culture and site of implantation, although significantly more migrated cells were of a neuronal phenotype following transplantation into the hippocampus.",
