     "AB": "The effects of prenatal malnutrition produced by protein deprivation on the neurogenesis of granule and pyramidal cells in the rat hippocampal formation was investigated by injecting pregnant rats with tritiated thymidine on E12, E16, or E20 and sacrificing the pups on P30. Granule cell neurogenesis was significantly decreased in the pups injected on E20, but not in E12 or E16 groups. There was no effect on the generation of pyramidal cells at the times noted, indicating a differential effect of prenatal malnutrition on the generation of these two different neuronal types in the hippocampal formation.",
