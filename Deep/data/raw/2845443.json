     "AB": "Following chronic administration (10 or 20 days) of diazepam (5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous pellets) or RO 15-1788 (5 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally), adenosine and benzodiazepine receptors in different rat brain areas were assessed by radioligand binding studies using [3H]R-PIA for A1 receptors, [3H]NECA and [3H]R-PIA for A2 receptors and [3H]FNZ for benzodiazepine receptors. Chronic administration of diazepam for 10, but not for 20 days, decreased A2 receptors in the striatum by 46% (p less than 0.05) and A1 receptors in the hippocampus by 13% (p less than 0.05). Administration of diazepam for 10 days and 20 days failed to alter [3H]FNZ binding in all brain areas studied. However, 20 days of diazepam administration decreased the magnitude of GABA enhancement of [3H]FNZ binding in the cortex by 25% (p less than 0.05). In contrast, chronic administration of RO 15-1788 failed to alter [3H]R-PIA, [3H]NECA and [3H]FNZ binding in all brain areas. These results suggest that adenosine receptors may play a role in the CNS actions of benzodiazepines.",
