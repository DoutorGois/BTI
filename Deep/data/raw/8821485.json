     "AB": "Studies have suggested that in the immature brain an unusually high ceiling level for potassium may lead to an increased propensity for seizures. In these experiments, the peak levels of extracellular potassium in the hippocampus in vivo were recorded in immature rats 10-27 days old and compared to levels reached in adults. There was no difference in the peak level of potassium attained during an afterdischarge in any of the age groups tested.",
