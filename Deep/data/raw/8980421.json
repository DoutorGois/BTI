     "AB": "The relation of the hippocampal neuronal activity to the rat event-related potential (ERP) generation was examined during an auditory discrimination oddball paradigm. ERPs were recorded using a linearly-arranged series of electrodes chronically implanted at the skull, in the frontoparietal cortex, in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the dorsal hippocampus and in the thalamus. The target tone elicited N40, P100, N200, and P450 at the skull electrode. The non-target tone, on the other hand, prominently evoked only the P100 component. At the intracranial electrodes, the ERP amplitude at the latency of the skull P450 was significantly greater in the CA3 region than that at other recording sites, although a phase reversal was not observed. The results indicate that the P450 of the rat may correspond to the human P3, and that the neuronal activity in the hippocampus is involved in its generation.",
