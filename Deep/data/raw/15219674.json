     "AB": "Transient hypoxia-ischemia (HI) leads to delayed neuronal death in both mature and immature neurons but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. To understand whether the pathogenesis of HI-induced neuronal death is different between mature and immature neurons, we used a rat HI model at postnatal days 7 (P7), 15 (P15), 26 (P26) and 60 (P60) in order to investigate ultrastructural changes and active caspase-3 distribution in HI-injured neurons as a function of developmental age. In P7 pups, despite more than 95% of HI-injured neurons highly expressing active caspase-3, most of these active caspase-3-positive neurons revealed mixed features of apoptosis and necrosis (a chimera type) under electron microscopy (EM). Classical apoptosis was observed only in small populations of HI-injured P7 neurons. Furthermore, in rats older than P7, most HI-injured neurons displayed features of necrotic cell death under EM and, concomitantly, active caspase-3-positive neurons after HI declined dramatically. Classical apoptosis after HI was rarely found in neurons older than P15. In P60 rats, virtually all HI-injured neurons showed the shrinkage necrotic morphology under EM and were negative for active caspase-3. These results strongly suggest that pathogenesis of HI-induced neuronal death is shifting from apoptosis to necrosis during brain development.",
