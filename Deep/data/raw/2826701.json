     "AB": "The distribution of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate (G16P2) synthase was measured in more than 70 regions of mouse brain, and nine layers of monkey retina. Activities in gray areas varied as much as 10-fold, in a hierarchical manner, from highest in telencephalon, especially the limbic system, to lowest in cerebellum, medulla, and spinal cord. The synthase levels were significantly correlated among different regions with G16P2 itself, as well as with previously published levels of a brain specific IMP-dependent G16P2 phosphatase. In contrast, neither G16P2 nor either its synthase or phosphatase correlated positively with phosphoglucomutase, and in all regions the G16P2 levels greatly exceeded requirements for activation of this mutase. This strengthens the view that G16P2 has some function besides serving as coenzyme for phosphoglucomutase. However, attempts to correlate the \"G16P2 system,\" as defined by the three coordinately related elements, synthase, phosphatase, and G16P2, with other enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, or with regional data of Sokoloff et al. [J. Neurochem. 28, 897-916 (1977)] for glucose consumption, were unsuccessful. This leaves open the possibility that brain G16P2 might serve as a phosphate donor for specific nonmetabolic effector proteins.",
