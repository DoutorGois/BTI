     "AB": "We compared three implementations of single-shot arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging: two-dimensional (2D) pulsed ASL (PASL), 2D pseudocontinuous ASL (PCASL), and background-suppressed (BS) 3D PCASL obtained in a cohort of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly controls. Study subjects also underwent (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18) F-FDG PET). While BS 3D PCASL showed the lowest (P < 0.001) gray matter-white matter cerebral blood flow (CBF) contrast ratio, it provided the highest (P < 0.001) temporal signal-to-noise ratio. Mean relative CBF estimated using the PCASL methods in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, and hippocampus showed hypoperfusion in the MCI cohort compared to the controls consistent with hypometabolism measured by (18) F-FDG PET. BS 3D PCASL demonstrated the highest discrimination between controls and patients with effect size comparable to that seen with (18) F-FDG PET. 2D PASL did not demonstrate group differentiation with relative CBF in any ROI, whereas 2D PCASL demonstrated significant differences only in PCC and hippocampus. Mean global CBF values did not differ across methods and were highly correlated; however, the correlations were significantly higher (P < 0.001) when either the same labeling (PCASL) or the same acquisition strategy (2D) was used as compared to when both the labeling and readout methods differed. In addition, there were differences in regional distribution of CBF between the three modalities, which can be attributed to differences in sequence parameters. These results demonstrate the superiority of ASL with PCASL and BS 3D readout as a biomarker for regional brain function changes in MCI. Hum Brain Mapp 38:5260-5273, 2017.
