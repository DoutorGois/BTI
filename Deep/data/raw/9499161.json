     "AB": "We studied the developmental alteration of GABA release in spontaneous ly hypertensive(SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat(WKY) brain. The release of [3H]GABA observed under high potassium(30 mM) in eleven-week-old(hypertensive) SHR hippocampus and the spontaneous release of [3H]GABA in the same aged SHR medulla oblongata were lower than those of age-matched WKY. We conclude that the GABAergic mechanisms may be different in SHR and WKY brain and may be associated with the development of hypertension.",
