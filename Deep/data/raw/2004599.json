     "AB": "The activity and distribution of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in rat brain is described. Oxidation of corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone was significantly increased by NADP; the reverse reaction was increased by NADPH. Cortisol was a poor substrate. Both 11-dehydrogenase (11-DH) and 11-oxoreductase (11-OR) activities were found in brains of rats from 6 days to adult, and 11-DH and 11-OR activities were positively correlated with each other. Highest enzyme activities were found in pituitary, cerebellum, hippocampus, and cortex. Lower levels were found in the olfactory region, hypothalamus, brain stem, preoptic nucleus, and amygdala. Two antisera to 11-DH, designated 56-125 and 56-126, reacted with a 34K component corresponding in mass to rat liver 11-DH on Western blots. The dominant species of protein in all brain regions reacting with rat liver 11-DH antibody 56-125, was at 26K mol wt. Antiserum 56-126 did not cross-react with the 26K protein. The 26K component was not a 34K degradation product. In each region of the brain, Western blot analysis showed that the 26K band intensity was directly proportional to enzyme activity. However, the 26K protein was devoid of 11-DH activity. All 11-DH and 11-OR activities were associated with the 34K antigen. The data demonstrate the nonuniform distribution of 11-DH in brain tissue. They are consistent with the notion that 11-DH may confer upon brain the ability to control intracellular levels of active glucocorticoids and in this way mediate steroid function within the cell.",
