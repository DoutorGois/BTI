     "AB": "AIM: Although surgery is the most effective means of eliminating or reducing seizures in cases of medically refractory epilepsy, the expected or unexpected surgical complications must also be kept in mind in order not to decrease patients' quality of life. The aim of this present study was to assess the surgical complications of temporal lobe epilepsy surgery and their effects on the disease course in patients with intractable epilepsy arising from the temporo-mesial structures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The records of 58 patients who underwent temporal lobectomy and/or selective amygdalahippocampectomy at Gulhane Military Medical Academy between January 2000 and August 2010 were reviewed for peri- and post-surgical complications. RESULTS: Post-surgical complications were detected in 7 patients (12%). The most common complication of ES was infection in 2 patients (2.9%). Other complications were hemorrhagic infarction, paresis of the frontal branch of the left facial nerve, subdural effusion, anxiety disorder, depressive disorder and late-onset psychosis. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest the importance of post-operative care and long-term follow up in order to achieve favorable seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery.",
