     "AB": "We examined the effects of hippocampus (Hp) and area parahippocampalis (APH) lesions in pigeons on their ability to perform a battery of tasks including autoshaping, time discrimination, spatial memory, and pattern discrimination. Pigeons with Hp-APH lesions were impaired in the acquisition of an autoshaped response, emitting fewer pecks to the stimulus than control animals. Hp-APH pigeons were also impaired in the acquisition of a radial-arm maze analogue task, and those birds that did learn the task seemed to do so by adopting a stereotypic response strategy. In contrast, Hp-APH lesions had no effect on the ability of the birds to discriminate on the basis of either temporal or visual information. Overall, these studies complement our earlier studies and suggest that the avian hippocampus is important for the processing and retention of spatial rather than non-spatial information.",
