     "AB": "Opioid peptide release in the hippocampus was shown to be increased immediately following amygdala kindling stimulation in freely moving rats using microdialysis combined with a universal opioid peptide radioimmunoassay (RIA). Extracellular opioid peptide levels were elevated (55% above basal levels) within the first 10 min after electrical stimulation-induced partial seizures in previously nonkindled animals. Fully kindled rats showed lower extracellular opioid peptide levels (40% reduction) during the interictal period [16 +/- 2.1 days (mean +/- SEM) after the last stage V seizure], in comparison with values obtained from the sham-kindled group under basal conditions. However, opioid peptide release in fully kindled rats increased above 152% of interictal levels within the first 20 min after onset of fully kindled seizures, attaining peak levels equal to that of the partial kindled group and returning to prestimulation conditions 40-60 min following the ictal events. The majority of the immunoreactive material recovered from the hippocampus within the first 20 min following partial and generalized kindled seizures coeluted with dynorphin-A (1-6), dynorphin-A (1-8), and Leu-enkephalin by HPLC/RIA analysis. It is proposed that the enhanced opioid peptide release in hippocampus induced by amygdala kindling stimulation might be associated with either enhanced excitability or seizure suppression as seizure susceptibility fluctuates. The reduced interictal opioid peptide levels may also underlie some interictal behavioral disturbances.",
