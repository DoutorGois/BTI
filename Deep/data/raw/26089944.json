     "AB": "Sanhua decoction (SHD) is a famous classic Chinese herbal prescription for ischemic stroke, and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is reported to play a key role in ischemic brain edema. This study aimed to investigate neuroprotection of SHD against focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats and explore the hypothesis that AQP4 probably is the target of SHD neuroprotection against I/R rats. Lentiviral-mediated AQP4-siRNA was inducted into adult male Sprague-Dawley rats via intracerebroventricular injection. The focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model was established by occluding middle cerebral artery. Neurological examinations were performed according to Longa Scale. Brain water content, was determined by wet and dry weight measurement. Western blot was adopted to test the AQP4 expression in ipsilateral hippocampus. After the treatment, SHD alleviated neurological deficits, reduced brain water content and downregulated the expression of AQP4 at different time points following I/R injury. Furthermore, neurobehavioral function and brain edema after I/R were significantly attenuated via downregulation of AQP4 expression when combined with AQP4-siRNA technology. In conclusion, SHD exerted neuroprotection against focal cerebral I/R injury in rats mainly through a mechanism targeting AQP4.",
