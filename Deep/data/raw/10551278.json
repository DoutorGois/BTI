     "AB": "Kindling is a generally accepted model for studying epilepsy development in the context of overexpression of processes of neuronal plasticity. In previous studies we have shown that establishment of kindling by repeated application of subconvulsive doses of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) also led to marked changes in hippocampal excitability and an impairment in learning behaviour. With the intention of further investigating the relationship between kindling development, kindling-induced changes in excitability and learning deficits, rats were chemically kindled under pretreatment with the nootropic drug piracetam. Furthermore, we tested acute piracetam effects on developed kindling seizures, the learning deficit and potentiation effects. At the investigated dose piracetam did not influence the kindling development. The kindling-induced potentiation of hippocampal field potentials was significantly diminished in piracetam-pretreated rats. Piracetam acutely injected completely antagonized this potentiation effect. Piracetam brought about a significant improvement in impaired learning performance in rats pretreated during kindling induction and acutely injected before the learning experiment, respectively. Possible correlations between the suppressing of the kindling related potentiation in hippocampal structures by piracetam and its beneficial effect on learning impairment are discussed as antagonizing overexpression of potentiation in the course of kindling.",
