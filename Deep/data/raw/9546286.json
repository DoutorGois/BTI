     "AB": "Approximately one quarter of patients with AIDS develop severe cognitive deficits called HIV-associated dementia complex (ADC). There is some controversy regarding the importance of viral load in mediating neurologic disease. With the advent of sensitive, quantitative and reproducible RNA assays for HIV load in plasma and CSF, we quantified viral load in brains from 10 autopsied HIV-infected subjects and 2 non-infected controls. The new quantitative HIV RNA assays showed general agreement with previously used semi-quantitative immunocytochemical assessments of HIV envelope protein, and were performed without professional subjective interpretation. All cases with very high levels of HIV in the CSF, had high overall levels in the brain, suggesting that CSF viral loads exceeding 10(6) copies per mL may be a surrogate marker of high viral load in the brain. Levels of virus in the spleen showed no clear association with those found in the brain. HIV RNA was not uniformly distributed throughout the brain. Selective regions, including basal ganglia and hippocampus, showed higher levels of virus than the cerebellar cortex and mid-frontal cortical gray matter. Assessment of overall brain viral load requires careful attention to regional quantitation.",
