     "AB": "The probable roles of Acetylcholine (Ach) and Dopamine (DA) in the modulation of instinctual behaviors of feeding and hoarding (HS), as also the body weight and vaginal cyclicity (EI), were studied by instillation of Atropine (Ach antagonist), Haloperidol (DA antagonist) and Apomorphine (DA agonist) in the dorsal hippocampus of nonpregnant female rats. It was observed that the HS was significantly decreased with both Atropine and haloperidol and increased with Apomorphine, although the food intake was decreased with the three chemicals. It appears that action of both Ach and DA on the dorsal hippocampus has a positive influence on hoarding behavior.",
