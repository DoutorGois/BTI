     "AB": "It is believed that oxidative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases like diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications (like peripheral neuropathy) as well as in neurodegenerative disorders like sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). Representative experimental models of these diseases are streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and STZ-intracerebroventricularly (STZ-icv) treated rats, in which antioxidant capacity against peroxyl (ORAC(-ROO)*) and hydroxyl (ORAC(-OH)*) free radical was measured in three different brain regions (hippocampus, cerebellum, and brain stem) by means of oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. In the brain of both STZ-induced diabetic and STZ-icv treated rats decreased antioxidant capacity has been found demonstrating regionally specific distribution. In the diabetic rats these abnormalities were not associated with the development of peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Also, these abnormalities were not prevented by the icv pretreatment of glucose transport inhibitor 5-thio-D-glucose in the STZ-icv treated rats, suggesting different mechanism for STZ-induced central effects from those at the periphery. Similarities in the oxidative stress alterations in the brain of STZ-icv rats and humans with sAD could be useful in the search for new drugs in the treatment of sAD that have antioxidant activity.",
