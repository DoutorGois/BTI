     "AB": "An in vitro hippocampal (CA 1 region, guinea pig) slice technique using repeated hypoxia was employed to model electrophysiological changes (DC-potentials and evoked potentials (EP) by stimulation of Schaffer-collaterals) occurring in the hypoxic CA1 pyramidal layer. A standardized neuronal response under repeated hypoxic conditions was observed in this model, consisting of disappearance of EP and a trend towards partially reversible, but progressive synaptic failure subsequent anoxic depolarisation (AD). Slices treated with the calcium antagonist nimodipine showed a prolongation of AD latency between the first and following hypoxias. So it seems possible to simulate hypoxic lesions of the brain tissue by using this in vitro slice model.",
