     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus after ovariectomy in mice. METHODS: BDNF levels were detected by immunohistochemistry combined image analysis in hippocampal CA regions and dentate gyrus of ovariectomized mice. RESULTS: The expression of BDNF in hippocampus of mice decreased significantly after the ovariectomy after 4 days. The recovery BDNF expression started 14 days after the ovariectomy and after 28 days, the expression of BDNF in hippocampus recovered to the normal level. CONCLUSION: The decrease of estrogen in ovariectomized mice can weaken the expression of BDNF in hippocampus during the early stage.",
