     "AB": "Exposure to 10-12 g/kg/day of alcohol either during days 1-10 or 11-21 of gestation had no detectable effect on hippocampal mossy fiber development. Exposing artificially reared rat pups to 7.0-7.5 g/kg/day of alcohol during days 1-10 postpartum dramatically altered the organization of the Timm-stained mossy fiber terminal field when the animals were examined as adults, suggesting that alcohol exposure during a period equivalent to the human third trimester is more deleterious to brain development than exposure during periods equivalent to either the first or second trimesters.",
