     "AB": "The hippocampal subiculum in the adult rat brain contains many neurons with nerve cell surface glycoproteins which are linked by collagenous ligands to perineuronal proteoglycans. The nerve cell surface glycoproteins or their terminal N-acetylgalactosamines are digested by endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. The terminal N-acetylgalactosamines linked by the collagenous ligands are not digested by endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosasminidase. The collagenous ligands associated with the terminal N-acetylgalactosamines were digested by collagenase. The newly exposed terminal N-acetylgalactosamines by this collagenase incubation were digested by endo-alpha-N-acetyl-galactosaminidase. These findings on the rat agree with those obtained in our previous studies of the adult mouse brain samples. Furthermore they emphasize our hypothetical model that the perineuronal proteoglycans are related--via collagen ligands--with the nerve cell surface glycoproteins.",
