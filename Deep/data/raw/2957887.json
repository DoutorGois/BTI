In the present study we have investigated the earliest effects of these drugs at the cellular level using slices of hippocampal cortex maintained in vitro. Doxyfluridine (5'-dFUrd; 50 mg/l and 500 mg/l) caused a dose dependent, reversible depression of neuronal activity. The main effect was on the pyramidal cells (population spike reduced by 14 and 25% respectively) and the afferent unmyelinated fibres (afferent fibre volley reduced by 7 and 12% respectively). Excitatory synaptic transmission was affected only by the highest concentration (field-EPSP reduced by 10%). 5-FU caused similar but less marked changes. The drugs did not cause epileptiform activity.",
