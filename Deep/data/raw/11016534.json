     "AB": "Morphological and biochemical alterations are associated with a progressive age-related cognitive deficit. Plasmenylethanolamine, the major brain plasmalogen, may be modified during aging because of a possible antioxidant role and involvement in synaptic transmission. Two- and 18-month-old rats were used to study the effect of aging on the levels and acyl composition of plasmenylethanolamine (PmE), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine (PS) in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Aging only reduced significantly the PE levels in the frontal cortex. In 18-month-old rats, the fatty acid composition of the three phospholipid classes studied showed an increase of monounsaturated fatty acid (18:1 n-9 and 20:1 n-9) and a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFAs), essentially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA was markedly decreased in hippocampus PE. DHA, but also arachidonic acid, were considerably lower in frontal cortex PmE. PS modifications were similar in both regions. Hippocampus and frontal cortex underwent specific age-induced modifications in PmE and PE acyl composition. This could produce different effects on the functional ability of these two structures involved in the processes of specific memorization.",
