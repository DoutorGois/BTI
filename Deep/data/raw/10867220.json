     "AB": "Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are ubiquitously present within the perivascular basement membrane, and have been shown to be altered in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Although the HSPG agrin clearly orchestrates the differentiation of the neuromuscular junction, its role in the brain remains unclear. Growing evidence suggests that agrin may be an important vascular basement membrane (VBM)-associated HSPG. In previous studies, we demonstrated that agrin is present throughout the brain microvasculature, as well as in neuronal cell bodies. AD brains exhibited fragmentation of VBM-associated agrin. Agrin immunoreactivity was also seen within senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. These changes were accompanied by the appearance of an additional pool of insoluble agrin. In the present study, we provide further evidence for microvascular damage in AD, by examining the distribution of agrin and laminin within the VBM, and by measuring the agrin concentration within hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, we assessed blood-brain-barrier (BBB) leakage by examining the perivascular distribution of prothrombin immunoreactivity. Soluble agrin levels were increased approximately 30% in Braak stage III-VI AD patients relative to age-matched controls. Furthermore, agrin and laminin exhibited identical patterns of VBM fragmentation in AD and colocalized with beta-amyloid in senile plaques. Microvascular changes were associated with the appearance of perivascular prothrombin immunoreactivity. Our data suggest that agrin is an important VBM-associated HSPG in the brain and that agrin levels are altered in association with microvascular damage in AD.",
