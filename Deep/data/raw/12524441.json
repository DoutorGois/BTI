     "AB": "The present study provides the first evidence that adhesion receptors belonging to the integrin family modulate excitatory transmission in the adult rat brain. Infusion of an integrin ligand (the peptide GRGDSP) into rat hippocampal slices reversibly increased the slope and amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials. This effect was not accompanied by changes in paired pulse facilitation, a test for perturbations to transmitter release, or affected by suppression of inhibitory responses, suggesting by exclusion that alterations to alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors cause the enhanced responses. A mixture of function-blocking antibodies to integrin subunits alpha(3), alpha(5), and alpha(v) blocked ligand effects on synaptic responses. The ligand-induced increases were (i) blocked by inhibitors of Src tyrosine kinase, antagonists of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, and inhibitors of calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and (ii) accompanied by phosphorylation of both the Thr(286) site on calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and the Ser(831) site on the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor. N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists blocked the latter two phosphorylation events, but Src kinase inhibitors did not. These results point to the conclusion that synaptic integrins regulate glutamatergic transmission and suggest that they do this by activating two signaling pathways directed at AMPA receptors.",
