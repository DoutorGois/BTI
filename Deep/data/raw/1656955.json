     "AB": "DNA from a rat hippocampus cDNA library and sets of highly degenerate oligonucleotide primers directed toward conserved regions of previously cloned G-protein receptors were used in the polymerase chain reaction to selectively amplify and clone new members of this gene family. A human hippocampus cDNA library was screened with a 610 base pair fragment generated by PCR and a cDNA clone, H318/3, was isolated. The deduced amino acid sequence of this clone encoded a protein of 501 amino acids that showed strong sequence homology to previously cloned G-protein receptors. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed clone H318/3 was 78% homologous to a rat alpha 1A adrenergic receptor with homology being 95% when comparisons were made in the region that lies between the first to the seventh transmembrane domains. Based on this high degree of sequence homology, we conclude that clone H318/3 represents a cDNA for a human alpha 1A adrenergic receptor.",
