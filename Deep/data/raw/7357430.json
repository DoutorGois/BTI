     "AB": "Intracellular recordings were obtained from CA1 pyramidal neurons in obliquely cut in vitro hippocampal slices. Recurrent IPSPs were elicited by antidromic stimulation of alvear fibers. The mechanisms by which IPSPs depress pyramidal cell excitability were investigated. Recurrent IPSPs could be reversed in sign by small hyperpolarizing currents applied through the recording electrode, indicating an increased membrane conductance. By using an AC bridge circuit it was found that the maximum impedance decrease usually occurred slightly before the peak of the IPSP. Otherwise the time course of the impedance change matched that of the IPSP itself. Inhibitory actions of the conductance increase were studied by adjusting the membrane potential to the IPSP equilibrium potential, thus allowing only the IPSP conductance to play an inhibitory role. Under these conditions non-linear summation of recurrent IPSPs with EPSPs originating in the apical dendrites could be demonstrated only during the initial 15--25 msec ofthe IPSP, which is the period of maximum conductance increase. The inhibition afforded by the hyperpolarization of the recurrent IPSP far outlasts the period of effective EPSP shunting by the inhibitory synaptic currents. The mechanisms of recurrent inhibition in the hippocampus thus appear similar to those operating in spinal motoneuron IPSPs.",
