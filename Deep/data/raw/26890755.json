     "AB": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with alterations in epigenetic factors leading to cognitive decline. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is a known critical epigenetic negative regulator of learning and memory. In this study, attenuation of long-term potentiation by amyloid-beta oligomer, and its reversal by specific HDAC3 inhibitor RGFP966, was performed in rat CA1 pyramidal neurons using whole cell voltage-clamp and field recording techniques. Our findings provide the first evidence that amyloid-beta oligomer-induced synaptic plasticity impairment can be prevented by inhibition of HDAC3 enzyme both at the single neuron as well as in a population of neurons, thus identifying HDAC3 as a potential target for ameliorating AD related plasticity impairments.",
