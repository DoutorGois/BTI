     "AB": "Recent genetic evidence has implicated the bromodomain containing 1 gene (BRD1) with brain development and susceptibility to Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder. The BRD1 protein, which is essential for acetylation of histone H3K14, is a putative regulator of transcription during brain development and in the mature CNS. However, several issues remain to be clarified for example regarding the regulation of the BRD1 gene upon environmental interventions. Chronic restraint stress (CRS) in rats represents an environmental method for induction of morphological and functional changes in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. In order to investigate whether the expression of the rat Brd1 gene may be regulated during such conditions, Brd1 mRNA and protein levels in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex extracts from rats subjected to either 1/2 or 6h of CRS per day for 21days were measured. We found a significant 2-fold up-regulation of long exon 7 splice variants of the Brd1 gene (Brd1-L) in hippocampus in both groups of CRS rats compared to controls. Concomitantly, we found a similar up-regulation of the BRD1 protein. In prefrontal cortex, we found no significant differences in Brd1 mRNA or protein levels. As selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors not only preserve stress-induced hyperacetylation of histone H3K14 but also have hippocampal-dependent antidepressant-like activity, we propose that BRD1 by its intrinsic acetylation activity towards histone H3K14 is a player in the regulatory processes underlying adaptation to stress in the mature CNS.",
