     "AB": "Pyroglutamyl peptidase II (PPII) is a neuronal ectoenzyme responsible for thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) degradation at the synaptic cleft. PPII, heterogeneously distributed in different brain regions and adenohypophysis, is regulated under various endocrine conditions where TRH is involved in thyrotropin or prolactin regulation but only at the adenohypophyseal level. TRH can downregulate PPII activity in cultured adenohypophyseal cells. TRH present in extrahypothalamic brain areas has been postulated to serve as a neuromodulator and levels of this peptide increase in amygdala, hippocampus and cortex after electrical stimulation (kindling or electroshock). To study whether brain PPII could be regulated in conditions that stimulate TRHergic neurons, TRH and PPII activity were determined during the development of amygdaloid kindling in the rat. TRH levels increased from stage II to V in amygdala and hippocampus in the ipsi- and contralateral side to stimulation. In n. accumbens a decrease, compared to sham was observed at stage II, but levels raised through stage V. In contrast, PPII activity was increased at stage II, in amygdala of both sides and in hipppocampus, frontal cortex, n. accumbens and hypothalamus of the contralateral side; levels decreased at stage V to sham values in most structures (except amygdala and hippocampus where the activity was 30% below controls). These results suggest that PPII activity in the central nervous system can be regulated in conditions known to affect TRHergic neurons.",
