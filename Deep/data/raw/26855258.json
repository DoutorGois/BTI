     "AB": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects over 1.7 million people in the United States alone and poses many clinical challenges due to the variability of the injuries and complexity of biochemical mechanisms involved. Thus far, there is still no effective therapy for TBI. Failure of preventative therapeutic strategies has led studies focusing on regenerative approaches. Recent studies have shown evidence that mature brains harbors multipotent neural stem cells capable of becoming mature neurons in the neurogenic regions. Following brain insults including TBI, the injured brain has increased level of neurogenic response in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and this endogenous response is associated with cognitive function following injury. In this review, we highlight recent development and strategies aimed at targeting this endogenous cell response to enhance post-TBI functional recovery. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI:Brain injury and recovery.",
