     "AB": "Neuromodulation is one of the fastest growing fields in neurosurgery, as reflected by the growing interest in the use of electrical brain stimulation (EBS) to treat drug-resistant epilepsy, pain, and movement disorders. Hippocampal stimulation should be regarded as an experimental therapy for epilepsy, and patients considered for this intervention should do so in the context of a well-designed randomized controlled trial. Only well-conducted, blinded, randomized trials, followed by long-term systematic observation will yield a clear picture of the effect of this promising therapy, and will help guide its future use. This article provides a critical review of the best available evidence on hippocampal stimulation for epilepsy.",
