     "AB": "ACTH and related peptides are known for their effects on behavior and for their efficacy on peripheral nerve regeneration. More recently, evidence demonstrating neurotrophic effects of Org2766 on recovery after damage of the central nervous system has become available. Aging studies indicated that particularly the hippocampus appears susceptible to peptide treatment. Therefore, in this study the neurotrophic influence of Org2766 on recovery of hippocampal functioning was studied after transection of the fimbria fornix connection. Analogous to results obtained with recovery of sensorimotor function following peripheral nerve damage a chronic treatment with Org2766 facilitates recovery of the impaired function, i.e. spatial learning in a Morris maze. However, the lesion-induced impairment of avoidance behavior was not influenced by the peptide treatment.",
