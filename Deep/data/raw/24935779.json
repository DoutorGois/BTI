     "AB": "To test the appropriateness of using delayed remote ischemic postconditioning against damage caused to the hippocampus by ischemia or apoptosis inducing intoxication, we chose 10-min normothermic ischemia induced by four-vessel occlusion or kainate injection (8 mg/kg i.p.) in rats. Ischemia alone caused the number of degenerated CA1 neurons after 7 days lasting reperfusion to be significantly (p<0.001) increased by 72.77%. Delayed remote ischemic postconditioning lasting 20 min was able to prevent massive increase in the neurodegeneration. The group with 10 min of ischemia and postconditioning after 2 days of reperfusion had only 15.87% increase in the number of apoptotic neurons. Seven days after kainic acid injection the number of surviving neurons was 42.8% (p<0.001), but the portion of surviving pyramidal cells in the postconditioning group is more than 98%. Our data show that remote postconditioning, performed with 20 min of tourniquet ischemia applied to the hind limb, is a simple method able to effectively stop the onset of neurodegeneration and prevent occurrence of massive muscle cell necrosis, even when used 2 days after the end of the adverse event. Surviving neurons retained a substantial part of their learning and memory ability.",
