     "AB": "Emerging evidence suggests that a group of dietary-derived phytochemicals known as flavonoids are able to induce improvements in memory acquisition, consolidation, storage and retrieval. These low molecular weight polyphenols are widespread in the human diet, are absorbed to only a limited degree and localise in the brain at low concentration. However, they have been found to be highly effective in reversing age-related declines in memory via their ability to interact with the cellular and molecular architecture of the brain responsible for memory. These interactions include an ability to activate signalling pathways, critical in controlling synaptic plasticity, and a potential to induce vascular effects capable of causing new nerve cell growth in the hippocampus. Their ability to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and the protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) signalling pathways, leading to the activation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor responsible for increasing the expression of a number of neurotrophins important in defining memory, will be discussed. How these effects lead to improvements in memory through induction of synapse growth and connectivity, increases in dendritic spine density and the functional integration of old and new neurons will be illustrated. The overall goal of this critical review is to emphasize future areas of investigation as well as to highlight these dietary agents as promising candidates for the design of memory-enhancing drugs with relevance to normal and pathological brain ageing (161 references).",
