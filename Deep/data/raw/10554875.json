     "AB": "Since both estrogen and NMDA receptor antagonists act on the hippocampus CA1 region and behaviorally affect hippocampal memory tasks, we examined how estrogen depletion (ovariectomy) and NMDA receptor antagonism interact upon spatial memory of the mouse. After ovariectomy or sham operation, mice were given a 2-week recovery before behavioral tests began under the influence of vehicle or (+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP 2, 5 and 10 mg/kg) intraperitoneal injections. CPP is a competitive, full NMDA receptor antagonist. Spatial reference memory was tested by the water maze, spatial working memory was tested by the radial arm maze, while overall locomotive activity was monitored by the Y-maze. Results from the water maze and the Y-maze did not show any spatial reference memory or activity differences between sham-operated and ovariectomized mice. The radial arm maze, however, highlighted some working memory differences between intact and ovariectomized mice. CPP treatment impaired dose dependently--the performance of ovariectomy and sham-operated mice equally on both water maze and radial arm maze, while the drug had no effect on Y-maze performance. These results suggest that short term estrogen deprivation has no effect upon spatial-reference memory, while it impairs spatial working memory. This effect is probably not mediated by NMDA receptors.",
