     "AB": "To investigate the biological roles of the presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene after neuronal injury, the changes of PS-1 mRNA expression in the gerbil hippocampus after transient ischemia were examined. From 1 day to 3 day-reperfusion after 5 min-ischemia, PS-1 mRNA was induced in the hippocampus compared with the sham-operated control. The cells which induced the PS-1 genes were neurons of CA3 and dentate gyrus, the region relatively resistant to ischemic stress. These findings suggest that the induction of PS-1 genes may be associated with some responses of neurons damaged by transient ischemia.",
