     "AB": "PURPOSE: To detect differences in global brain volumes and identify relations between brain volume and appetite-related hormones in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared to body mass index-matched controls. METHODS: Forty subjects participated in this study. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and measurements of fasting ghrelin, leptin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), as well as GLP-1 levels during mixed-meal tolerance test (MTT), were performed. RESULTS: Total brain volume and total gray matter volume (GMV) were decreased in obese PCOS compared to obese controls (p < 0.05 for both) whereas lean PCOS and controls did not show a significant difference. Secondary analyses of regional brain volumes showed decreases in GMV of the caudate nucleus, ventral diencephalon and hippocampus in obese PCOS compared to obese controls (p < 0.05 for all), whereas lean patients with PCOS had lower GMV in the amygdala than lean controls (p < 0.05). No significant relations were detected between structural differences and measured hormone levels at baseline or during MTT. CONCLUSION: This study, investigating structural brain alterations in PCOS, suggests volumetric reductions in global brain areas in obese women with PCOS. Functional studies with larger sample size are needed to determine physiopathological roles of these changes and potential effects of long-term medical management on brain structure of PCOS.",
