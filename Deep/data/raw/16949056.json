     "AB": "Estrogens are developmental regulators of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in the central nervous system, but little is known about their involvement in cytokine-induced apoptosis. In the present study, we evaluated effects of 17beta-estradiol on pro-inflammatory cytokine- and staurosporine-mediated activation of caspase-3 and LDH-release in primary neuronal/glial cell cultures of mouse hippocampal and neocortical cells at different stages of their development in vitro. Enzyme activities were determined with colorimetric methods 6 h, 14 h, 24 h, and 48 h after exposure to the apoptotic agents. Biochemical data were supported at the cellular level by Hoechst 33342 and MAP-2 stainings, which were carried out 48 h after the treatment. Cytokines (co-treatment with Il-1beta and TNFalpha; 1 ng/ml) increased caspase-3 activity in the hippocampal and neocortical cells up to over 200% of control values, and these effects were mostly observed on 2 and 7 days in vitro (DIV). Moderate, but significant cytokine-mediated increase in LDH-release was demonstrated in both tissues, especially on 7 and 12 DIV. Estradiol (100 nM) inhibited the activation of caspase-3 at early stage of development (2 DIV) in the hippocampal, but not in the neocortical cultures. The cytokine-induced activation of caspase-3 and LDH-release was inhibited by estradiol in estrogen receptor-independent way. These data point to a possible role of estrogens as non-estrogen receptor-related inhibitors of cytokine-activated apoptotic pathway in the developing central nervous system.",
