     "AB": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of pinocembrin on cognitive ability impairment in a rat model of transient global cerebral ischemia (TGCI). The TGCI model was established by inducing global cerebral ischemia for 20 min, followed by reperfusion for two weeks. The rats were divided into five experimental groups, including the sham group that were not subjected to ischemia, and four ischemic groups where the rats were exposed to TGCI. The sham and control TGCI groups were administered a vehicle intravenously immediately after reperfusion, while the other three groups were intravenously treated with 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg pinocembrin, respectively. In the present study, neurological scores were analyzed at 0 and 24 h after reperfusion, and the effect of pinocembrin on cognitive ability impairment in the TGCI rat model was investigated using a Morris water maze test. Neuronal loss was observed under an optical microscope with the assistance of Nissl staining. In addition, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells were observed under an optical microscope by an immunohistochemistry assay. Pinocembrin treatment was found to alleviate the cognitive impairments, decrease the neurological scores, diminish neuronal loss in the hippocampus and reduce the number of GFAP-positive cells in the hippocampal CA1 region of the TGCI rats. Therefore, pinocembrin alleviated memory impairment in the TGCI rats.",
