Here we describe the development of secondary, 'mirror' epileptic foci in the hippocampus contralateral to a single injection of the toxin (12 mouse LD50). This was detected in slices in vitro prepared 6 to 56 days after injection, both as evoked after-discharges and as spontaneous synchronous bursts that were mainly restricted to subregions CA3b and c.",
