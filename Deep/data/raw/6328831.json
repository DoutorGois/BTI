The eosinophilic inclusions were round and often targetoid , with a central core that had the staining characteristics of RNA. Ultrastructurally, the inclusions were mainly composed of osmiophilic granular material. Rabies viral antigen was not detected by immunofluorescence, and heavy metals were not detected by energy dispersive spectrometry. These neuronal inclusions should be distinguished from Negri bodies.",
