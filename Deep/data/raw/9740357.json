     "AB": "Deficits in performance of both spatial and visual tasks are common following tissue loss in the right temporal lobe. Since spatial and visual attributes are frequently confounded in experimental tasks, we have studied patients following unilateral temporal lobectomy, in an attempt to determine which aspect mediates the observed deficits. Spatial and visual memory performance was compared in normal controls (n = 16), left temporal (LTL; n = 19) and right temporal (RTL; n = 19) lobectomy patients, by presentation of eight abstract designs in a spatial array for subsequent recall and recognition of the designs (visual memory) and recall of their spatial position (spatial memory). By varying the retention intervals for each group, all three groups were matched on both recall and recognition of the designs at sub-ceiling levels. In contrast, recall of the position of the designs (spatial memory), tested at equivalent delays to those of the visual memory tests, revealed a deficit in the RTL patients compared to both controls and LTL patients (p < 0.05). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to quantify the extent of resection of the hippocampus and parahippocampal regions in the two patient groups and showed a significant correlation between hippocampal and parahippocampal removal and spatial memory in the RTL group only. These data support the notion of a disproportionately large involvement of the right hippocampus and adjacent regions in spatial memory.",
