     "AB": "A pharmacological study was made on the basis of a comprehensive program aimed at collating the range of behavioral and neurochemical action of five compounds belonging to the thiaisochromane series. Compounds that possess an antidepressant action with a sedative component have been screened. It has been shown that the antidepressant effect to tisocromid applied clinically cannot be accounted for by the inhibiton of reverse monoamine uptake. The neurochemical profile of the test compounds appeared to differ from that of tricyclic antidepressants. These compounds did not inhibit the neuromediator uptake, exhibited no cholinolytic action, did not potentiate the peripheral effects of catecholamines.",
