     "AB": "Strain BFLP-10(T), isolated from faeces of wild long-snouted seahorses (Hippocampus guttulatus), is a Gram-negative, motile and facultatively anaerobic rod. This bacterium produces inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain BFLP-10(T) was a member of the genus Vibrio and was most closely related to Vibrio owensii (99%), Vibrio communis (98.9%), Vibrio sagamiensis (98.9%) and Vibrio rotiferianus (98.4%). However, multilocus sequence analysis using gyrB, pyrH, recA and topA genes revealed low levels of sequence similarity (<91.2%) with these closely related species. In addition, strain BFLP-10(T) could be readily differentiated from other closely related species by several phenotypic properties and fatty acid profiles. The G+C content of the DNA was 45.6 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strain BFLP-10(T) represents a novel species within the genus Vibrio, for which the name Vibrio inhibens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is BFLP-10(T) (=CECT 7692(T)=DSM 23440(T)).",
