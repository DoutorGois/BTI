     "AB": "Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, has been reported to exert beneficial effects in models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To characterize the mechanisms underlying the putative minocycline-related neuroprotection, we studied its effect in an in vitro model of AD. Primary hippocampal cultures were treated with beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and cell viability was assessed by standard MTT-assay. Incubation with 10 muM Abeta for 24 h significantly inhibits cellular MTT-reduction without inducing morphological signs of enhanced cell death or increase in release of lactate dehydrogenase. This indicates that cell viability was not affected. The inhibition of MTT-reduction by Abeta was due to an acceleration of MTT-formazan exocytosis. Intriguingly, the Abeta-triggered increase in MTT-formazan exocytosis was abolished by co-treatment with minocycline. In vehicle-treated cells minocycline had no effect on formazan exocytosis. This hitherto unrecognized property of minocycline has to be noticed in the elucidation of the underlying mechanism of this promising neuroprotectant.",
