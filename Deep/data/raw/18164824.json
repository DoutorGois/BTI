     "AB": "The bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) mouse exhibits neurodegeneration of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum with concomitant cognitive deficits. Consistent with our previous observations, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) protein levels in the medial septum decreased by 43.5% 2 weeks after OBX without changes in glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (GAD65) levels. Interestingly, levels of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), which is localized at cholinergic neuron terminals, decreased both in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions following OBX. Confocal microscopy showed that VAChT expression was more severely reduced in CA3 14 days after OBX compared with CA1. Intriguingly, chronic treatment with a vanadium (IV) compound, VO(OPT) [bis(1-N-oxide-pyridine-2-thiolato)oxovanadium(IV)] (0.5-1 mg as vanadium (V)/kg/day, i.p.), significantly rescued cholinergic neurons in the medial septum in a dose-dependent manner. VO(OPT) treatment also prevented decreased VAChT immunoreactivity both in CA1 and CA3 regions in the hippocampus. Consistent with these findings, an impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory deficits seen in OBX mice were significantly prevented by VO(OPT) treatment. Taken together, OBX induces neurodegeneration of septo-hippocampal cholinergic neurons and impairment of memory-related behaviors. The neuroprotective effect of VO(OPT) could lead to novel therapeutic strategies to ameliorate cognitive deficits associated with cholinergic neuron degeneration in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.",
