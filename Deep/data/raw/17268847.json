     "AB": "NO (Nitric oxide) has been known as a biological signaling molecule that can function as a beneficial agent in physiologically essential functions such as differentiation or neurotransmission. In this study, we elucidated how nicotine inhibits neuronal differentiation induced by the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in hippocampal cell line, H19-7 cells, because nicotine is one of the key neuroregulatory components. Treatment of H19-7 cells with bFGF increased NO production through upregulated iNOS/ nNOS expression, and also increased expressions of neuronal markers such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT3) and Neuro-D. Pretreatment of the cells with nicotine decreased iNOS promoter activity as well as iNOS/nNOS expression induced by bFGF, resulting in decreased NO production. Nicotine also suppressed expressions of BDNF, NT3 and Neuro-D, resulting in decreased bFGF-induced neurite outgrowth. These results indicate that nicotine inhibits bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation in H19-7 cells through inhibition of NO formation by suppressing iNOS/nNOS expressions.",
