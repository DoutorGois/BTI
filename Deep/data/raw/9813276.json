     "AB": "Previously, we demonstrated that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) pretreatment protects neuroblastoma cell lines, human hNT neurons, and primary rat embryo hippocampal neurons (REHIPs) from degeneration caused by incubation with beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). Here we present evidence suggesting that TGF-beta interferes with an apoptotic pathway induced by Abeta. TGF-beta preteatment decreases the amount of DNA laddering seen following Abeta treatment in neuroblastoma cells, while in REHIPs, TGF-beta decreases the number of positive cells detected in situ by Klenow labelling following Abeta treatment. RT-PCR shows that in REHIPs, Abeta decreases mRNA expression of Bcl-2, as well as the ratio of Bcl-xL/Bcl-xS, with little effect on Bax expression. These changes are expected to promote apoptosis. When REHIPs are incubated with TGF-beta before addition of Abeta, the Bcl-xL/Bcl-xS ratio and Bcl-2 levels are increased compared to cells treated with Abeta alone. Again there is little effect on Bax expression. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry experiments also show that TGF-beta maintains increased levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein in REHIPs even in the presence of Abeta. This pattern of gene expression should function to decrease apoptosis. Similarly, RT-PCR analysis of mRNA prepared from hNT cells shows that TGF-beta pretreatment before addition of Abeta maintains a higher level of Bcl-2 expression and an increased Bcl-xL/Bcl-xS ratio as compared to cells treated with Abeta alone. In neuronal cell types treated with Abeta, TGF-beta appears to regulate expression of genes in the Bcl-2 family to favor an anti-apoptotic pathway.",
