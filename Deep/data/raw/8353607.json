This phenomenon is characterized by a clustering of glial cells in relation to the perikarya of a subpopulation of neurons in the deep pyramidal layer and around most neurons scattered in the stratum oriens and subcortical white matter. Most of the perineuronal satellite glia were identified as oligodendrocytes based on their nuclear chromatin patterns and antigenic properties. Satellite oligodendrocytes were mostly of the medium dense variety. A type of satellite glia with nuclear features of the dark oligodendrocyte could not be identified unequivocally using the antigenic criteria employed in this study.",
