     "AB": "The HNK-1 carbohydrate, an unusual 3'-sulfated glucuronic acid epitope characteristic of many neural recognition molecules, serves as a ligand in neural cell interactions and is differentially expressed in the quadriceps and saphenous branches of the femoral nerve in the PNS of adult mice. Based on these observations, we investigated the possibility that the HNK-1 carbohydrate may be differentially distributed in neurons and fiber tracts also in the CNS thereby contributing to different targeting and guidance mechanisms. We have used antibodies with different HNK-1 epitope specificities to probe for subtle differences in expression patterns. In the adult mouse cerebellum the HNK-1 carbohydrate is detectable in stripe-like compartments in the molecular and Purkinje cell layers, whereas N-CAM and its associated alpha2,8 polysialic acid does not show this compartmentation. In the adult hippocampus, the HNK-1 carbohydrate localizes to perineuronal nets of inhibitory interneurons and marks the inner third of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. In the adult spinal cord, HNK-1 labeling is most pronounced in gray matter areas. White matter enriched regions show differential labeling with regard to fiber tracts and antibody specificity. Whereas the different antibodies do not show differences in staining in the cerebellum and the hippocampus, they show differences in staining pattern of fiber tracts and motoneurons in the spinal cord. The HNK-1 expression pattern also differed in the adult spinal cord from that observed at embryonic day 14 and postnatal day 14. Our observations suggest a functional role in the specification of functionally discrete compartments in different areas of the CNS and during development.",
