     "AB": "Abnormalities of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus represent an integral part of the altered programming triggered by early life stress. Prenatally restraint stressed (PRS) rats develop long-lasting biochemical and behavioral changes, which are the expression of an anxious/depressive-like phenotype. We report here that PRS rats showed a selective impairment of depolarization- or kainate-stimulated glutamate and [(3)H]d-aspartate release in the ventral hippocampus, a region encoding memories related to stress and emotions. GABA release was unaffected in PRS rats. As a consequence of reduced glutamate release, PRS rats were also highly resistant to kainate-induced seizures. Abnormalities of glutamate release were associated with large reductions in the levels of synaptic vesicle-related proteins, such as VAMP (synaptobrevin), syntaxin-1, synaptophysin, synapsin Ia/b and IIa, munc-18, and Rab3A in the ventral hippocampus of PRS rats. Anxiety-like behavior in male PRS (and control) rats was inversely related to the extent of depolarization-evoked glutamate release in the ventral hippocampus. A causal relationship between anxiety-like behavior and reduction in glutamate release was demonstrated using a mixture of the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist, LY341495, and the GABA(B) receptor antagonist, CGP52432, which was shown to amplify depolarization-evoked [(3)H]d-aspartate release in the ventral hippocampus. Bilateral microinfusion of CGP52432 plus LY341495 in the ventral hippocampus abolished anxiety-like behavior in PRS rats. These findings indicate that an impairment of glutamate release in the ventral hippocampus is a key component of the neuroplastic program induced by PRS, and that strategies aimed at enhancing glutamate release in the ventral hippocampus correct the \"anxious phenotype\" caused by early life stress.",
