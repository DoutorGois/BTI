     "AB": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single electroconvulsive shock (ECS) on alternate days and sacrificed 48 hrs after 1, 3, or 5 seizures. The content of TRH in hippocampus, pyriform cortex and amygdala was increased 2.5-fold, 5.4-fold and 4.3-fold respectively, 48 hrs. after 3 alternate-day electroconvulsive shocks (ECS) and remained unchanged after 2 additional shocks. Pyriform cortex exhibited a significant intermediate increase (1.7-fold) after only 1 ECS. In a second study, rats were sacrificed 48 hrs after a series of 5 alternate-day ECS vs. subconvulsive shocks (SCS). SCS had no significant effect in these same regions, but was seen to alter TRH in striatum. These results provide an interesting parallel to several aspects of clinical electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) of depression. Together with other findings, these data suggest also, that endogenous TRH may play a role in the modulation of convulsive seizures.",
