     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the dorsal hippocampus and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) can potentiate ethanol response in the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. I.p. administration of different doses of ethanol (0.25-1 g/kg) did not induce CPP. However, the higher dose of the drug (1.5 g/kg i.p.) induced place aversion. Furthermore, microinjection of nicotine (0.5-1 microg/rat) into both CA1 regions (intra-CA1) and the BLA (intra-BLA) did not produce a significant CPP. Interestingly, intra-CA1 or -BLA administration of nicotine plus ethanol (0.5 g/kg) during conditioning phase significantly induced a strong CPP. Microinjection of mecamylamine, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, into the CA1 regions or into the BLA did not alter CPP. However, intra-CA1 or -BLA microinjection of mecamylamine (1-4 microg/rat) reversed the response induced by the microinjection of nicotine (1 microg/rat, intra-CA1 or -BLA) plus ethanol (0.5 g/kg i.p.) in the CPP paradigm. On the other hand, the microinjection of nicotine (0.5-1.5 microg/rat) into the BLA, but not into the CA1 regions before the testing phase potentiated the response of ethanol on the expression of conditioned place preference. Moreover, intra-CA1 administration of nicotine plus ethanol increased the locomotor activity on the test day which was reversed by pretreatment with mecamylamine, while other treatments had no effect on locomotor activity. It can be concluded that the activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the dorsal hippocampus and the basolateral amygdala can potentiate the ethanol response in the CPP paradigm.",
