     "AB": "Research has established that severe stress adversely affects hippocampal memory, and chewing has been suggested to restore impaired cognitive functions in the hippocampus. To address how chewing involves stress-attenuated hippocampal memory process, we measured the long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal slices of adult male rats that had experienced restraint stress, including some rats that were allowed to chew a wooden stick during the stress period and other rats that were not. The three experimental conditions were: 1) restraint stress without chewing (ST), 2) restraint stress with chewing (SC), and 3) no treatment (CT). We prepared hippocampal slices and collected trunk blood from all experimental animals. For rats in the two stressed groups, we collected tissue and blood at one of three post-stress time points: immediately after, 24 h after, or 48 h after exposure to the stressor. We found that the magnitude of LTP in both group ST and SC was significantly attenuated immediately after stress exposure. However, within 24 h after the end of the stress period, LTP had returned to the control level in group SC whereas it remained low in group ST. At the same post-stress time point, we found that facilitation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors by bath-applied glycine had less effect on the magnitude of LTP in group SC than on group ST, suggesting that most NMDA receptors had already become functionally restored in group SC by that time. Plasma concentration of adrenocorticotropic hormone was significantly elevated only in group ST immediately after exposure to the stressor, reflecting the involvement of chewing in decreasing subsequent corticosterone secretion. Thus, the present study demonstrates that chewing ameliorates the stress-induced impairment of NMDA receptor-mediated LTP, suggesting chewing as a good strategy to cope with severe stress by suppressing excessive endocrine responses.",
