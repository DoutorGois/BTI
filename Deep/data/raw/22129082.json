     "AB": "There is converging evidence that certain subpopulations of smokers, such as smokers with a serious mental illness like schizophrenia (SCZ), are more likely to become addicted to tobacco and are less likely to quit smoking. This review focuses on the unique risk factors that may increase vulnerability to the initiation and maintenance of nicotine addiction in persons with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders and also reviews the latest approaches to treating nicotine addiction and schizophrenia based on our neurobiological understanding of central nicotinic receptor systems and related neurotransmitters. In addition, suggestions for future lines of research to better understand reasons for the comorbidity of nicotine addiction in schizophrenia are discussed.",
