     "AB": "The memory and learning capacity in patients treated for temporal epilepsy was studied. The study was performed in 55 patients, observed before and after stereotaxic amygdalotomy and hippocampotomy. Very often disturbances in memory and learning capability were present before surgery. After surgery their learning efficiency increased. Disturbances in memory tracing, as provoked by distraction, remained at the same level after neurosurgery. No decrease in general intelligence was noted.",
