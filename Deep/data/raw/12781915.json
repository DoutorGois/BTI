     "AB": "Bupivacaine and ropivacaine are local surgical anesthetics with great efficacy in post-operative pain relief and labor analgesia. In the present study, the effects of bupivacaine and ropivacaine on ion currents induced by glycine and glutamate in acutely dissociated hippocampal CA1 neurons of rats were investigated via a nystatin-perforated patch clamping method at a clamped voltage. The magnitude of the glycine-induced ion currents was decreased reversibly and in a time-dependent manner by continuous application of 0.1 mg/ml of either bupivacaine or ropivacaine. The magnitude of the glutamate-induced ion currents was also suppressed time-dependently by continuous application of either bupivacaine or ropivacaine. The inhibitory action of bupivacaine and ropivacaine on currents induced by glycine and glutamate could be one of the mechanisms behind the actions of these anesthetics.",
