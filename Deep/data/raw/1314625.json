     "AB": "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), a 28 amino acid peptide hormone, plays many physiological roles in the peripheral and central nerve systems. A functional cDNA clone of the VIP receptor was isolated from a rat lung cDNA library by cross-hybridization with the secretin receptor cDNA. VIP bound the cloned VIP receptor expressed in mouse COP cells and stimulated adenylate cyclase through the cloned receptor. The rat VIP receptor consists of 459 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 52,054 and contains seven transmembrane segments. It is structurally related to the secretin, calcitonin, and parathyroid hormone receptors, suggesting that they constitute a new subfamily of the Gs protein-coupled receptors. VIP receptor mRNA was detected in various rat tissues including liver, lung, intestines, and brain. In situ hybridization revealed that VIP receptor mRNA is widely distributed in neuronal cells of the adult rat brain, with a relatively high expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.",
