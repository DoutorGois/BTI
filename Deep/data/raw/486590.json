     "AB": "This study is carried out on single (not averaged) recordings combining the spontaneous activity preceding the stimulus onset and the EP recorded upon acoustical stimulation. These recordings, which we call EEG-EPograms, are measured simultaneously from different subdural structures, such as the auditory cortex, medial geniculate nucleus, inferior colliculus, reticular formation and the hippocampus of the cat brain during the slow wave sleep stage. Using a combined analysis procedure (C.A.P.), the relevant frequency components of spontaneous EEG and EPs, recorded simultaneously from these brain nuclei, are analyzed according to the consistent selectivity bands depicted by the determined amplitude-frequency characteristics for the SWS-stage. In parallel with the results which we obtained for the waking stage, these analyses provide also the following information: (1) there is an important congruency in the time courses of simultaneous response components in common frequency bands, especially in the alpha and beta frequency ranges; (2) there exist significant coupling and synchrony between the evoked amplitude enhancements in the simultaneously recorded single response components; (3) the inter-nuclei coherency in the brain's electrical activity is enormously increased upon stimulation;(4) the evoked response magnitude can be predicted, with reasonable accuracy, from the spontaneous activity preceding the stimulus. All these findings are discussed with reference to those obtained for the waking stage.",
