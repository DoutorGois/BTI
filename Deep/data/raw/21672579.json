     "AB": "One of the pathways implicated in a fine-tuning control of synaptic transmission is activation of the receptors located at the presynaptic terminal. Here we investigated the intracellular events in rat brain cortical and hippocampal nerve terminals occurring under the activation of presynaptic glutamate receptors by exogenous glutamate and specific agonists of ionotropic receptors, NMDA and kainate. Involvement of synaptic vesicles in exocytotic process was assessed using [(3)H]GABA and pH-sensitive fluorescent dye acridine orange (AO). Glutamate as well as NMDA and kainate were revealed to induce [(3)H]GABA release that was not blocked by NO-711, a selective blocker of GABA transporters. AO-loaded nerve terminals responded to glutamate application by the development of a two-phase process. The first phase, a fluorescence transient completed in approximately 1min, was similar to the response to high K(+). It was highly sensitive to extracellular Ca(2+) and was decreased in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801. The second phase, a long-lasting process, was absolutely dependent on extracellular Na(+) and attenuated in the presence of CNQX, the kainate receptor antagonist. NMDA as well as kainate per se caused a rapid and abrupt neurosecretory process confirming that both glutamate receptors, NMDA and kainate, are involved in the control of neurotransmitter release. It could be suggested that at least two types ionotropic receptor are attributed to glutamate-induced two-phase process, which appears to reflect a rapid synchronous and a more prolonged asynchronous vesicle fusion.",
