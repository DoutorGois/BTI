     "AB": "Fulminant hepatic failure was induced in rabbits by intravenous administration of galactosamine hydrochloride. The animals were sacrificed after 45 h and the hippocampus analyzed for free amino acids. In addition, free amino acids were measured in plasma and in the extracellular fluid of the hippocampus 20, 30 and 45 h after galactosamine injection. The extracellular fluid compartment was analyzed by slow perfusion of a thin dialysis tube which was implanted in the hippocampus one day prior to galactosamine administration. The amino acid concentration in the extracellular fluid agreed fairly well with that of the cerebrospinal fluid in the control situation. During development of hepatic failure, the plasma concentration of all amino acids increased. The changes in extracellular amino acids were smaller, except for phosphoethanolamine and glutamate. The concentration ratio intra/extracellular amino acids decreased in the hippocampus for amino acids with a normally high concentration gradient.",
