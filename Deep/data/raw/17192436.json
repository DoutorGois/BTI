     "AB": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key regulator of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the developing and adult nervous system. It can be released from pyramidal neuron dendrites in an activity-dependent manner and has therefore been suggested to serve as a signal that provides the retrograde intercellular communication necessary for Hebbian plasticity and hippocampal-dependent learning. Although much has been learned about BDNF function by field stimulation of hippocampal neurons, it is not known whether moderate action potential-independent depolarization of single cells is capable of releasing sufficient BDNF to influence transmission at individual synapses. In this study, we show directly at the single-cell level that such modulation can occur. By using K-252a, anti-BDNF antibody, and interruption of regulated release, we confirm a model in which postsynaptic depolarization elicits calcium-dependent release of BDNF that diffuses retrogradely and enhances presynaptic transmitter release.",
