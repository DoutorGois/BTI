     "AB": "Intravenously injected [1,2-3H]deoxycorticosterone (DOC) readily enters all parts of the central nervous system. In intact and eviscerated rats the highest concentration of radioactive label was recovered from areas corresponding to the reticular formation from the brain stem. In addrenalectomized animals, in addition to high brain stem concentration, there was also a marked increase in the uptake of radioactivity in the septum, hippocampus and pituitary. Data from the eviscerated rat point to a uniform distribution of [1,2-3H]DOC in neural tissues and suggest that the higher levels of radioactivity found in the brain stem may be due to a DOC metabolite with the chromatographic characteristics of allo-tetrahydro-DOC, an anaesthetic-type steroid. A decrease in the amplitude of evoked sciatic potentials in brain stem sites but not in the thalamic relay nucleus was observed in 52% of the cases studied, following the i.v. injection of 100-150 mug DOC.",
