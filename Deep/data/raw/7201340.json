     "AB": "The content and turnover of dopamine, norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), and the content of their respective major metabolites were evaluated in 19 discrete brain areas of rats exposed to conditioned emotional response (CER), and in control groups which received either equivalent yoked shock (shock only) or compound stimulus presentation (tone only). On test day, CER animals suppressed responding and exhibited forms of emotional behavior after presentation of the conditioned stimulus (CS); while shock only and tone only control groups, and CER animals which received an acute dose of diazepam prior to testing, did not suppress. Few changes were observed in content of the biogenic amines or their metabolites, suggesting that the behavioral manipulations were acting within normal physiological limits. On the other hand, numerous changes were observed in the utilization of the 3 biogenic monoamines, which were correlated with the conditioning-anxiety (comparisons of CER vs shock only) and the shock history (comparison of shock only vs tone only). These observations are consistent with putative neural pathways in the frontal cortex, septum, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, striatum, hippocampus and brain stem (which utilize specific monoamines), and with discrete brain areas which have been implicated in classical conditioning and CER-related phenomena. These observations suggest roles for biogenic monoamines in mediating or responding to the classical conditioning and emotional components of the paradigm.",
