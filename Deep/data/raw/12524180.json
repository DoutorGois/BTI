     "AB": "The current study was designed to address the effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on plasticity and reorganization in the juvenile brain. Given that two of the major pathological sequelae of TBI involve a generalized neuroexcitation insult and diffuse axonal injury, we have employed models of these pathologies, delivered either independently or in combination, to examine their effects on injury-induced synaptic reorganization of the dentate gyrus in the developing rat. Postnatal day 28 rats received either sham, central fluid percussion traumatic brain injury (TBI), unilateral entorhinal cortical lesion (UEC), or TBI+UEC (TUEC) injury. Cognitive performance was assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM) between 11 and 15 days post-injury and the brains were processed for synaptophysin immunohistochemistry and routine electron microscopy. The MWM results revealed that TBI or UEC lesions delivered independently do not produce significant morbidity in P28 rats. However, when these injuries are combined, they reveal significant deficits in the MWM, accompanied by measurable changes in the distribution of presynaptic synaptophysin immunoreactivity over the deafferented dentate molecular layer. These observations are further supported by qualitative ultrastructural alterations in synaptic architecture in the same subregions of the dentate neuropil. The present findings show that the resilience of the immature brain following TBI is reduced when neuroexcitatory insult is combined with deafferentation. Moreover, when deafferented tissue is assessed morphologically, evidence exists for aberrant plasticity and abnormal synaptic reorganization in the juvenile brain.",
