     "AB": "The L-asparaginase activities of the brains of the Wistar, heterozygous and homozygous Brattleboro rats divided into three parts namely the anterior, middle and posterior which respectively contained cerebral cortex, hippocampus + midbrain + thalamus + hypothalamus cerebellum + pons + medulla oblongata were estimated. The L-asparaginase activities of all the three parts in the homozygous Brattleboro rats were significantly higher than in the Wistar rats as well as in the heterozygous Brattleboro rats. Twenty min following the injections of 200 mg/kg D-aspartic acid, 20 mg/kg morphine, 200 mg/kg D-aspartic acid + 20 mg/kg morphine, 6 mg/kg prolyl-leucyl-glycinamide (PLG) and 6 mg/kg PLG + 20 mg/kg morphine the L-asparaginase activities of all three parts of the homozygous Brattleboro rat brains were found to be significantly inhibited. After having seen the suppressive effect of the drugs and their combinations used before the homozygous Brattleboro rats were given D-aspartic acid, morphine, D-aspartic acid + morphine, PLG and PLG + morphine for seven days. Then their plasma vasopressin levels were determined by RIA. The treatments applied to the homozygous Brattleboro rats caused the appearance of a significant amount vasopressin in the plasma. The results were interpreted as evidence for the fact that the inhibition of the brain L-asparaginase provides and/or accelerates the biosynthesis and/or release of vasopressin. As morphine has a vasopressin releasing and a brain L-asparaginase inhibiting effect the antidiuretic action of morphine was considered to be linked to its inhibitory effect on the brain L-asparaginase.",
