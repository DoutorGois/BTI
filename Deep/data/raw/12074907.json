     "AB": "To test whether the location coding of lateral septal cells is dependent on cue constellations, we examined single units in two different recording arenas on alternating days. Repeated recordings of lateral septal neurons in the same arena revealed that matching locations are encoded on separate days by about one third of the cells. The cells typically showed location-selective firing in only one of the two recording arenas and initially showed unrelated patterns when tested in a different recording arena. When tested for a second time in each recording arena, the initially dissimilar patterns were modified towards increased similarity between arenas. Simultaneously recorded hippocampal principal cells showed distinct place fields for each recording arena throughout the recording sequence. These results indicate that the initial reorganization of the lateral septal location coding may occur as a direct consequence of the hippocampal reorganization. Further septal reorganization is then partially independent of established place fields in the CA1 and CA3 area.Location-selective cells in cortical areas that receive projections from hippocampus proper (i.e. the subiculum and the entorhinal cortex) have not been shown to encode differences between recording arenas. Although some characteristics of this generalized coding scheme have also been found for location-selective lateral septal cells, the encoding of context information was generally preserved in the subcortical target cells of projections from the CA1 and CA3 area.",
