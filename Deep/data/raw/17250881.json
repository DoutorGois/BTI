     "AB": "Disruption of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis characterized by dysfunction of the glucocorticoid negative feedback system is frequently observed in human depressives and is thought to involve a reduction in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function in the feedback sites including the brain. Recently, we found that chronic stress in rats induces similar HPA disruption that is caused by abolishment of feedback ability in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, which involves decreased cytosolic GRs or increased nuclear GRs, respectively. Also, we found that saikokaryukotsuboreito (SRBT), a herbal medicine, prevents the chronic stress-induced HPA disruption. We therefore examined here the effects of this drug on the chronic stress-induced changes in GRs in the PFC and hippocampus. Chronic stress was induced in rats by water immersion and restraint (2 h/day) for 4 weeks. SRBT significantly prevented decreased cytosolic GRs in the PFC and increased nuclear GRs in the hippocampus in the chronically stressed rats. Moreover, SRBT significantly prevented the abolishment of feedback ability in both regions. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of SRBT on the GR level are involved in its ameliorating actions on the HPA disruption. This finding provides information important for the prevention and treatment of depression.",
