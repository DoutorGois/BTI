     "AB": "The effect of apomorphine, injected into the dorsal hippocampus, on the locomotor activity of imipramine-treated rats was studied. The rats were chronically implanted with cannulae 1 week before imipramine treatment. Imipramine was given in a dose of 10 mg/kg per os, acutely, or twice a day for 14 days. Intrahippocampal injection of apomorphine induced a dose-dependent increase in locomotor activity. This effect was antagonized by pretreatment with pimozide (2 mg/kg). Repeated, but not single, administrations of imipramine significantly enhanced the apomorphine-induced locomotor hyperactivity in rats. This effect was observed at 2, 48 and 96 h after the last dose of imipramine. The results obtained indicate that repeated administration of imipramine increases the responsiveness of the hippocampal dopaminergic system.",
