     "AB": "In the mammalian central nervous system, receptors for the excitatory amino-acid neurotransmitters are divided into three subtypes depending on their sensitivity to three specific agonists: kainate, quisqualate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). The ionophores operated by NMDA are gated by Mg2+ in a voltage-dependent manner and allow passage of several cations, including Ca2+ which may be important in plastic alterations of neuronal excitability. Indeed, specific antagonists of NMDA receptors effectively block spatial learning, long-term potentiation and some animal models of chronic epilepsy. Despite their abundance on central neurons, NMDA receptors, with a few noteworthy exceptions, do not generally seem to be involved in low-frequency synaptic transmission. Here we report for the first time that NMDA receptors of the dentate gyrus, where they do not normally contribute to the generation of synaptic potentials, become actively involved in synaptic transmission following long-lasting neuronal changes induced by daily electrical stimulation (kindling) of the amygdala or hippocampal commissures. In contrast to controls, the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (e.p.s.ps) of granule cells in hippocampal slices obtained from kindled animals displayed characteristics typical of an NMDA-receptor-mediated component. The involvement of NMDA receptors in synaptic transmission may underlie the long-lasting changes in neuronal function induced by kindling.",
