     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the synergistic effect of Schwann cells (SCs) and retinoic acid (RA) on differentiation and synaptogenesis of neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from hippocampus of neonatal rats. METHODS: The classical method for 2x2 factorial analysis experiment was used to assess synergistic action of SCs and RA. NSCs were treated with RA, SCs, and SCs + RA in DMEM/F12 with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for six days, respectively. Double immunofluorescent staining was used to detect the differentiation of NSCs including nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Map2. The expression of PSD95 was used to demonstrate synaptogenesis. RESULTS: After NSCs were treated with RA or SCs, the expression of nestin and GFAP was significantly decreased while the expression of Map2 and PSD95 was significantly increased in comparison with the control. Factorial ANOVA showed that interactions between SCs and RA could induce the expression of Map2 and PSD95. CONCLUSION: SCs and RA could promote synergistically the neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis of hippocampal neural stem cells in vitro while they decreased the astrocytes and nestin positive NSCs.",
