     "AB": "PURPOSE: Early life status epilepticus (SE) could enhance the vulnerability of the immature brain to a second SE in adulthood (two-hit seizure model). Naloxone has been proved to possess inflammation inhibitory effects in nervous system. This study was designed to evaluate the dose-dependent protective effects of naloxone in kainic acid (KA)-induced two-hit seizure model. METHODS: After KA-induced SE at postnatal day 15 (P15), Sprague-Dawley rats were infused with either saline or different doses (1.92, 3.84, 5.76, and 7.68 mg/kg) of naloxone continuously for 12 h. De novo synthesis of cytokines (interleukin-1 beta [IL-1 beta], S100B) was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at 12 h after P15 SE. Glial activation states were analyzed by western blotting of glial markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], S100B, Iba1) both at 12 h after P15 SE and at P45. After a second SE at P45, cognitive deteriorations were evaluated by Morris water tests and neuron injuries were evaluated by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. RESULTS: Naloxone reduced IL-1 beta synthesis and microglial activation most potently at a dose of 3.84 mg/kg. Attenuation of S100B synthesis and astrocyte activation were achieved most dramatically by naloxone at a dose of 5.76 mg/kg, which is equal to the most powerful dose in ameliorating cognitive injuries and neuron apoptosis after second SE. CONCLUSIONS: Naloxone treatment immediately after early life SE could dose-dependently reduce cytokine production, glial activation, and further lower the vulnerability of immature brains to a second hit in adulthood.",
