     "AB": "The present study was designed to determine if the noncompetitive excitatory amino acid antagonist, dizocilpine maleate, when administered after a 17 min period of complete cerebral ischemia in primates, would improve postischemic neurologic function and hippocampal histopathologic outcome when compared to placebo-treated animals. Ten pigtail monkeys were anesthetized and subjected to complete cerebral ischemia using an established neck tourniquet model. Five minutes postischemia, five monkeys received dizocilpine 300 micrograms/kg i.v. over 5 min, followed by an infusion of 150 micrograms/kg/h for 10 h. This produced plasma levels of the drug in excess of 30 ng/ml for the duration of the infusion. An additional five monkeys were treated with an identical volume of saline placebo. All monkeys received intensive care for the initial 24 to 48 h postischemia. At 96 h postischemia, there was no significant difference in neurologic function between the two groups (p = 0.53, with the placebo group having the numerically better outcome). There also was no significant difference between hippocampal histopathology scores between dizocilpine and placebo-treated monkeys. The authors conclude that dizocilpine is not an efficacious therapy in the treatment of neurologic injury that occurs following complete cerebral ischemia in this primate model.",
