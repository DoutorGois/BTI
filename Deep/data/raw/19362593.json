     "AB": "Intrahippocampal injection of the murine modified scrapie (ME7) induces a model of prion disease in vivo. Animals inoculated with ME7 brain homogenate were compared to controls at 8, 12 and 21 weeks. The data show that the accumulation of misfolded prion (PrP(Sc)) coincided with selective reduction in presynaptic protein expression early in disease. This loss is independent of a change in the number of cell bodies in CA3 that provide the major presynaptic input to the stratum radiatum. Electron microscopy of the stratum radiatum independently evidenced a progressive decrease in the number of synapses during disease. Further, the number of postsynaptic specializations lacking an intact presynaptic specialization increased from 12 to 21 weeks. This suggests that the presynaptic compartment is selectively disrupted when the previously reported first behavioural deficits are observed in this model. This synaptic pathology or \"synaptopathy\" may represent the earliest neuronal dysfunction in this and other protein misfolding induced neurodegenerative diseases.",
