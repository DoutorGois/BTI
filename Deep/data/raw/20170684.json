     "AB": "Cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain provide the major cholinergic innervation to the cortex and hippocampus, and play a key role in memory and attentional processes. Dysfunction of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) is a cardinal feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlates with cognitive decline. Survival of BFCN neurons depends upon binding of nerve growth factor (NGF), which is synthesized and secreted by cells in the cortex and hippocampus, with high-affinity (TrkA) and low-affinity (p75(NTR)) neurotrophin receptors produced within BFCN neurons. NGF released from target cells activates TrkA on axon terminals and triggers activation of PI3K/Akt, MEK/ERK, and PLCgamma (phospholipase C) signaling pathways. The signal then travels retrogradely along axon to cell body to promote neuronal survival. However, the nature of the retrograde signal remains mysterious. p75(NTR) receptors could mediate a fundamentally different signaling pathway leading to apoptic cell death. Dysfunction of NGF and its receptors has been suggested to underlie the selective degeneration of the BFCN in end stage Alzheimer disease. In this regard, NGF, the founding member of the neurotrophin family, has generated great interest as a potential target for the treatment of AD. This review focuses on NGF-cholinergic dependency, NGF/receptor binding, signal transduction, retrograde transport, regulation of specific cellular endpoints, and the potential involvement of cytoskeleton dysfunction in defected NGF signaling.",
