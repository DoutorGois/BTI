     "AB": "An object recognition task was used to determine if chronic restraint stress (6 h/day for 21 days) impairs non-spatial memory, since chronic restraint is known to impair spatial memory. In addition, food deprivation was tested as a possible modulating factor of any stress effect in this non-reward-dependent task. Following 3 weeks of daily restraint, subjects were tested for open field activity and object recognition (over different delay intervals) during one week in two separate experiments. Experiment 1 involved testing under low demand conditions (small arena) while experiment 2 involved testing under higher-demand conditions (large arena). Basal monoamine and amino acid levels (home cage) were assessed in experiment one and monoamine arousal levels (following a sample trial) were assessed in experiment two. We observed that chronic stress impaired object recognition when the delay was extended beyond 1 h, and that food deprivation could attenuate the degree of impairment. In addition, chronic stress was associated with increased norepinephrine levels in both the amygdala and hippocampus, and dopamine (HVA/DA, DOPAC/DA) in prefrontal cortex. These changes were not observed in stress subjects that were subsequently food deprived. Food deprived subjects had higher basal serotonin activity in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus as well as higher serum CORT levels. Results suggest that food deprivation may act as a novel stress, thereby increasing subjects' arousal and attention toward the objects, which aids stressed subjects, especially in low-demand conditions. Both restraint and food deprivation affected select limbic areas associated with memory functioning.",
