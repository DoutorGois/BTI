     "AB": "Effects of prefrontal cortical or hippocampal excitotoxic lesions on behavioral parameters related to dopaminergic transmission in the basal ganglia were investigated in the rat. We examined haloperidol-induced catalepsy and apomorphine-induced stereotypic behaviors after ibotenic acid lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), dorsal (DH), or ventral hippocampus (VH) in adult rats. Haloperidol-induced (1 mg/kg) catalepsy was decreased in rats with either MPFC or VH but not DH lesions. While both DH and VH lesioned animals demonstrated a reduction in apomorphine-induced (0.75 mg/kg) stereotypic behaviors, the VH lesioned animals also showed an enhancement of locomotor activity. MPFC lesioned rats tended towards potentiation of stereotypic behaviors and reduced locomotion after apomorphine administration. These data indicate that loss of prefrontal cortical or hippocampal modulation leads to an enhancement of DA transmission within the basal ganglia, though the pattern of augmentation depends on the area lesioned.",
