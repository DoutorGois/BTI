     "AB": "The threshold current of septal stimulation required to drive the hippocampal theta rhythm was investigated as a function of stimulation frequency in male rats aged 12-19 days. The minimum in the threshold-frequency function at 7.7 Hz, characteristic of adult male rats, appeared at 15-16 days. Before that age the relation between frequency and threshold was monotonic, as in adult female rats.",
