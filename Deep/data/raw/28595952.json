     "AB": "Trans-resveratrol (tRESV), a polyphenol with antioxidant properties, is common in many food sources, hence easily accessible for study as a maternal dietary supplement in perinatal asphyxia (PA). Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy secondary to PA affects especially vulnerable brain areas such as hippocampus and is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity. The purpose of this study is to identify new epigenetic mechanisms of brain inflammation and injury related to PA and to explore the benefit of tRESV enriched maternal diet. The hippocampal interleukin 1 beta (IL-1b), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and S-100B protein, at 24-48h after 90min of asphyxia were assessed in postnatal day 6 rats whose mothers received either standard or tRESV enriched diet. The expression of non-coding microRNAs miR124, miR132, miR134, miR146 and miR15a as epigenetic markers of hippocampus response to PA was determined 24h post-asphyxia. Our results indicate that neural response to PA could be epigenetically controlled and that tRESV reduces asphyxia-related neuroinflammation and neural injury. Moreover, tRESV could increase, through epigenetic mechanisms, the tolerance to asphyxia, with possible impact on the neuronal maturation. Our data support the neuroprotective quality of tRESV when used as a supplement in the maternal diet on the offspring's outcome in PA.",
