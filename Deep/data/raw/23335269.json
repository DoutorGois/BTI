     "AB": "Sustained exposure to soluble amyloid beta (Abeta42 ) oligomers is predicted to impair synaptic function in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit, signaling synaptic loss and precipitating cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Regional changes in overall patterns of protein phosphorylation are likely crucial to promote transition from a presymptomatic to a symptomatic state in response to accumulating Abeta42. Here, we used unbiased proteomic approaches to compare the phosphoproteome of presymptomatic and symptomatic TgCRND8 mice and identify network disruptions in signaling pathways implicated in the manifestation of behavioral indices of learning and memory impairment. Phosphopeptide enrichment with triple isotopic dimethylation labeling combined with online multidimensional separation and MS was used to profile phosphoproteome changes in 2- and 6-month-old TgCRND8 mice and congenic littermate controls. We identified 1026 phosphopeptides representing 1168 phosphorylation sites from 476 unique proteins. Of these, 595 phosphopeptides from 293 unique proteins were reliably quantified and 139 phosphopeptides were found to change significantly in the hippocampus of TgCRND8 mice following conversion from a presymptomatic to a symptomatic state.",
