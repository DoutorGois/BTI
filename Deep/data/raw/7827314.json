     "AB": "Rats with either posterior parietal (PPC) or dorsal hippocampal (HIP) lesions were tested for open-field activity, acquisition of a multiple T water maze habit, and presence of a 'cognitive map' of the water maze arena. The performances of control and PPC-lesioned rats were similar on all behavioral measures. However, the HIP-damaged rats demonstrated higher levels of general activity, severe deficits in both working and reference memory in the multiple T water maze task, and failed to develop a cognitive map of the water maze arena.",
