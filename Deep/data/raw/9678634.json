     "AB": "Gender differences in the vulnerability of the lateral striatal artery (1STR artery) to systemic intoxication with 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA, succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor) were studied. Subcutaneous injection of 3-NPA (20 mg/kg once a day for 2 days) induced striatal selective lesions in half of male rats associated with motor symptoms (rolling, paddling, recumbency, etc) while female rats were resistant. Lesions were located in the lateral striata and characterized by astroglial necrotic cell death, enhanced immunoreaction to factor VIII-related antigen, edema, extravasation of IgG and sometimes bleeding. The motor and histological disturbances were highly sex-dependent and modulated by changes in hormonal levels. Males were more susceptible than females. Castration had little effect but ovariectomy enhanced the vulnerability. Replacement therapy with testosterone increased while estradiol or tamoxifen suppressed the vulnerability in ovariectomized females. Investigation of the arterial architecture of the brain often revealed rectangular and acute angled branchings in the centrolateral striatum where the ISTR artery feeds. A parallel in vitro toxicity study demonstrated that an extreme Ca++ overload and a strong cellular swelling resulted in astrocytic cell death. Data suggest that 1STR artery and astrocytes are highly vulnerable to 3-NPA intoxication in males. The greater vulnerability of the ISTR artery may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, striatal bleeding, etc. Protective effects of estrogen and tamoxifen may mediate gender differences often observed in these disorders and suggest their potential use as therapeutic agents for these disorders.",
