     "AB": "The effect of locally applied norepinephrine upon dentate granule cells and neighboring interneurons was examined in urethane-anesthetized rats. Norepinephrine inhibited the spontaneous firing of physiologically identified granule cells, but excited interneurons. These results demonstrate that two coexisting hippocampal cell types, which have many physiological properties and behavioral correlates in common, may be differentiated using a pharmacological criterion.",
