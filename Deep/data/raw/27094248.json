     "AB": "Array-based profiling studies have shown implication of aberrant gene expression patterns in epileptogenesis. We have performed transcriptome analysis of hippocampal tissues resected from patients with MTLE-HS using RNAseq approach. Healthy tissues from tumour margins obtained during tumour surgeries were used as non-epileptic controls. RNA sequencing was performed using standard protocols on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Differential gene expression analysis of the RNAseq data revealed 56 significantly regulated genes in MTLE patients. Gene cluster analysis identified 3 important hubs of genes mostly linked to, neuroinflammation and innate immunity, synaptic transmission and neuronal network modulation which are supportive of intrinsic severity hypothesis of pharmacoresistance. This study identified various genes like FN1 which is central in our analysis, NEUROD6, RELN, TGFbetaR2, NLRP1, SCRT1, CSNK2B, SCN1B, CABP1, KIF5A and antisense RNAs like AQP4-AS1 and KIRREL3-AS2 providing important insight into the understanding of the pathophysiology or genomic basis of drug refractory epilepsy due to MTS.",
