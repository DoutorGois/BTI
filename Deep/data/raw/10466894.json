     "AB": "In diseases such as the Parkinson dementia complex of Guam (PDC) or Alzheimer's disease, susceptible neurons develop intracellular tangles (iNFTs) and then die, leaving behind extracellular tangles (eNFTs). We performed counts of healthy neurons, iNFTs, and eNFTs in the hippocampus of Guamanian Chamorros who were neurologically normal or who suffered from PDC. The total of surviving and dead neurons in the CA4 region was remarkably constant from case to case, indicating that eNFTs are not phagocytosed. Since cases of recent PDC showed only marginal tangle formation in CA4, we concluded that tangle development in CA4 commenced close to the onset of the disease. Based on this assumption, as well as the further assumption that the average rate of tangle development and the average lifetime of a tangled neuron do not alter as the disease progresses, we derived equations to determine the average lifetime of tangled neurons. The results varied from 0.13 years for the most rapidly progressing case to 7.98 years for the most slowly developing case. The average for 8 cases was 2.51 years.",
