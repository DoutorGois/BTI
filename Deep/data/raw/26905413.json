     "AB": "Although ketamine shows a rapid and sustained antidepressant effect, the precise mechanisms underlying its effect are unknown. Recent studies indicate a key role of p11 (also known as S100A10) in depression-like behavior in rodents. The present study aimed to investigate the role of p11 in the antidepressant-like action of ketamine in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model. The open-field test, forced swimming test and sucrose preference test were performed after administration of ketamine (10 mg kg(-1)) or a combination of ketamine and ANA-12 (a tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) antagonist; 0.5 mg kg(-1)). The lentivirus vector for p11 was constructed to knock down the hippocampal expression of p11. In the CUMS rats, ketamine showed a rapid (0.5 h) and sustained (72 h) antidepressant effect, and its effect was significantly blocked by co-administration of ANA-12. Furthermore, ketamine significantly increased the reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus of CUMS rats, whereas ketamine did not affect the expression of p11 in CUMS rats 0.5 h after administration. In addition, ketamine significantly increased the reduced ratio of p-TrkB/TrkB in the hippocampus by CUMS rats, and its effect was also blocked by ANA-12. Moreover, the reduced expression of BDNF and p11 in the hippocampus of CUMS rats was significantly recovered to control levels 72 h after ketamine administration. Interestingly, knockdown of hippocampal p11 caused increased immobility time and decreased sucrose preference, which were not improved by ketamine administration. These results suggest that p11 in the hippocampus may have a key role in the sustained antidepressant effect of ketamine in the CUMS model of depression.",
