     "AB": "Previously, hepatic ischemia followed by reperfusion (hepatic I/R) has been found to cause cognitive impairment. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) attenuates hepatectomy induced cognitive deficits and also protects against cognitive dysfunction induced by neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we aim to determine whether sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a H2S donor, could alleviate hepatic I/R-induced cognitive impairment and the underlying mechanisms. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with NaHS (5 mg/kg/d) for 11 days. A segmental hepatic I/R model was established on the fourth day. Cognitive function, proinflammatory cytokines levels, and hippocampal ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) expression was analyzed. We found hepatic I/R increased proinflammatory cytokines levels in serum and hippocampus, up-regulated Iba1 expression, leading to cognitive impairment in rats. However, treatment with NaHS alleviated hepatic I/R induced these neuroinflammatory changes and effectively improved cognitive function. Thus, NaHS appears to protect against cognitive impairment in rats undergoing hepatic I/R by attenuating neuroinflammation in the hippocampus.",
