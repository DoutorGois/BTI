     "AB": "The brain renin-angiotensin system has been implicated in the central regulation of the cardiovascular system, body water balance, and cyclic regulation of reproductive hormones and behaviors. It also exerts some influence over the secretion of pituitary hormones. This system appears to be complete with the necessary precursors and enzymes for the formation and degradation of biologically active forms of angiotensins and several binding subtypes that are presumed to mediate these and other functions. Much information is now available on the AT1 site which preferentially binds angiotensin II (AngII), but also binds angiotensin III (AngIII), and appears to be responsible for mediating the above described classic angiotensin physiologies and behaviors. Less is known about the functional importance of the AT2 site which also binds AngII but preferentially binds AngIII. This site has been implicated in vascular growth and cerebral blood flow. Recently, an AT4 site has been discovered and characterized that preferentially binds AngII (3-8), a fragment of AngII referred to as angiotensin IV (AngIV). This AT4 site is prominent in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and spinal cord, as well as several peripheral tissues including kidney, bladder, heart, spleen, prostate, adrenals, and colon. The AT4 site may mediate memory acquisition and recall and the regulation of blood flow. The function(s) of the AT4 receptor subtype in peripheral tissues is currently unknown, although it does appear to be involved in kidney blood flow.",
