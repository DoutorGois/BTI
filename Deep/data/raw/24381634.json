     "AB": "Background. Baicalin (BA) exhibits ill understood neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative effects in brain injury. Objective. To identify the differential network pathways associated with BA-related biological effects. Methods. MCAO-induced mice received BA 5 mg/Kg (BA group). Controls received vehicle only. Following ischaemia-reperfusion, ArrayTrack analysed the whole genome microarray of hippocampal genes, and MetaCore analysed differentially expressed genes. Results. Four reversing pathways were common to BA and controls, but only 6 were in the top 10 for BA. Three of the top 5 signalling pathways in controls were not observed in BA. BA treatment made absent 3 pathways of the top 5 signalling pathways from the top 5 in controls. There were 2 reversing pathways between controls and BA that showed altered gene expression. Controls had 6 networks associated with cerebral ischaemia. After BA treatment, 9 networks were associated with cerebral ischaemia. Enrichment analysis identified 10 significant biological processes in BA and controls. Of the 10 most significant molecular functions, 7 were common to BA and controls, and only 3 occurred in BA. BA and controls had 7 significant cellular components. Conclusions. This study showed that the clinical effectiveness of BA was based on the complementary effects of multiple pathways and networks.",
