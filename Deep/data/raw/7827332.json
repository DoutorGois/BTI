     "AB": "A single 2 h episode of restraint stress decreased food intake and growth rate of rats. These deficits were not observed after five restraint periods of 2 h a day, suggesting that adaptation occurred. An acute challenge with 2 h restraint increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) synthesis rate in the cortex, hypothalamus, midbrain and hindbrain of previously unrestrained rats, but not those adapted to 5 days of 2 h daily restraint. Hippocampal and striatal 5-HT synthesis was not increased significantly by 2 h restraint in previously unrestrained rats but was increased and decreased, respectively, in rats exposed to five 2 h daily restraints, when they were restrained on the sixth day. The findings suggest an important role of 5-HT particularly in the hippocampus, in adaptation to stress.",
