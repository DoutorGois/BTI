     "AB": "Behavioral effects of neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus, medial prefrontal (prelimbic, infralimbic and anterior cingulate) cortex or dorsal striatum were assessed using a DRL-10s schedule in mice. Post-operative acquisition data indicate that mice with hippocampal, but not prefrontal or striatal lesions received fewer reinforcements during daily 30-min sessions, and were less efficient in the timing of their responses. Additional analysis of inter-response-time (IRT) distributions revealed that the responses of hippocampal-lesioned mice exhibited undistinguishable responses for short IRTs (up to 9s). In addition, prefrontal-lesioned mice demonstrated a degradation of performance with further testing, and a flattened IRT distribution at late test phase, while striatal-lesioned mice behaved similarly to sham-lesioned mice. These results are interpreted in terms of known functions of the hippocampus in behavioral inhibition, and of the prefrontal cortex in executive control/decision making (and time production).",
