     "AB": "CONTEXT: Tryptophan depletion (TD) is a model used to study the contribution of reduced serotonin transmission to the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Recent studies have not sufficiently addressed the relative contribution of a functional-length triallelic polymorphism in the promoter of the serotonin transporter, 5-HTTLPR, to the behavioral and neural responses to TD in individuals with remitted MDD (rMDD) and controls. OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of 5-HTTLPR on the behavioral and neural responses to TD in medication-free patients with rMDD and individually matched controls. DESIGN: Participants were stratified according to diagnosis and 5-HTTLPR genotypes and underwent TD on one test day and sham depletion on the other test day in a prospective, double-blind, randomized order. SETTING: Outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven medication-free patients with rMDD (18 women and 9 men) and 26 controls (17 women and 9 men). INTERVENTIONS: Tryptophan depletion was induced by administration of capsules containing an amino acid mixture without tryptophan. Sham depletion used identical capsules containing lactose. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography was performed 6 hours after TD. Magnetic resonance images were obtained for each participant. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantitative positron emission tomography of regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose and measures of depression using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: Behavioral responses to TD are affected by 5-HTTLPR in patients with rMDD and controls. A direct effect of 5-HTTLPR on the regulation of regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose was identified in patients with rMDD for the amygdala, hippocampus, and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in 5-HTTLPR modulate the sensitivity of patients with rMDD and controls to the behavioral effects of TD. In patients with rMDD, variations in triallelic 5-HTTLPR have a direct effect on regulation of regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose in a corticolimbic circuit that has been implicated in rMDD.",
