     "AB": "The effects of a high dose methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) regimen on the serotonin (5-HT) system were evaluated over a 52-wk period. MDMA was administered to rats (20 mg/kg) 8 times at 12-hr intervals. Tissue concentrations of dopamine (DA) and 5-HT, and synaptosomal uptake of 3H-5-HT and 3H-DA were measured at 2, 8, 16, 32 or 52 wk posttreatment. Synaptosomal uptake of 3H-5-HT (hippocampus) was decreased at 2 and 8 wk, but not at 16, 32 or 52 wk after drug. 5-HT tissue concentrations were measured in frontal cortex, frontal-parietal cortex, occipital-temporal cortex, nucleus accumbens/olfactory tubercle, striatum, amygdala, hippocampus, septum, hypothalamus, ventral tegmentum/substantia nigra. Two weeks after MDMA treatment, all regions showed decreased 5-HT tissue concentrations except septum. Recovery over the 52-wk interval was noted for all depleted regions, but the rate and degree of recovery was region dependent. Frontal-parietal cortex, occipital-temporal cortex and hippocampus showed the least recovery, with significant depletions at 52 wk posttreatment. Hypothalamus showed an increase in 5-HT tissue concentrations relative to age-matched controls at 52 wk. These results indicate that a high-dose MDMA regimen results in long-lasting depletions of serotonin. The rate and degree of recovery of serotonin tissue concentrations seen over the 52-wk test period is region specific.",
