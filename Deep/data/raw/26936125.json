     "AB": "Previous research has demonstrated that traumatic brain injury (TBI) activates autophagy and a neuroinflammatory cascade that contributes to substantial neuronal damage and behavioral impairment, and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an important mediator of this cascade. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that resveratrol (RV), a natural polyphenolic compound with potent multifaceted properties, alleviates brain damage mediated by TLR4 following TBI. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats, subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury, were intraperitoneally injected with RV (100 mg/kg, daily for 3 days) after the onset of TBI. The results demonstrated that RV significantly reduced brain edema, motor deficit, neuronal loss and improved spatial cognitive function. Double immunolabeling demonstrated that RV decreased microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), TLR4positive cells co-labeled with the hippocampal neurons, and RV also significantly reduced the number of TLR4positive neuronspecific nuclear protein (NeuN) cells following TBI. Western blot analysis revealed that RV significantly reduced the protein expression of the autophagy marker proteins, LC3II and Beclin1, in the hippocampus compared with that in the TBI group. Furthermore, the levels of TLR4 and its known downstream signaling molecules, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and the inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were also decreased after RV treatment. Our results suggest that RV reduces neuronal autophagy and inflammatory reactions in a rat model of TBI. Thus, we suggest that the neuroprotective effect of RV is associated with the TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.",
