     "AB": "A quantitative and qualitative description has been made of the components of the Timm-stained hippocampus of the European hedgehog. While the laminar organization and the relative size of the major subdivisions of the hippocampus (i.e., area dentata, Ammon's horn, and subiculum) are similar to those of the albino laboratory rat, the relative proportions and the staining characteristics of some of the components of the subdivisions are different. The differences are particularly evident in Ammon's horn where regions are poorly differentiated along the dentatosubicular axis and the mossy fiber zone is relatively extensive. The description characterizes a hippocampal form that can be used as a basal reference in comparative studies of the mammalian hippocampus.",
