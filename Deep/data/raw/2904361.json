     "AB": "Reduction of extracellular Mg2+ concentration induced spontaneous and evoked epileptiform activity in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and dentate gyrus (DG) of combined hippocampus (HC)-EC slices. Extracellular field potentials, as well as changes in extracellular Ca2+ and K+ concentrations, were measured in EC and DG with ion-selective/reference electrodes during both repetitive and single stimuli. In the EC, lowering extracellular [Mg2+] induces both spontaneous and single stimulus evoked ictal events consisting of extracellular negative potential shifts (up to 5 mV, 30 sec), decreases in [Ca2+]0 and increases in [K+]0. In the DG, spontaneous events were much shorter, but similar changes in [Ca2+]0, [K+]0 and field potentials (FPs) could be evoked by brief high-frequency stimulation. In both areas, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist 2-aminophosphonovalerate (2-APV) completely blocked spontaneous as well as stimulus evoked epileptiform events. The neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE), which has previously been shown to modulate long-term potentiation in the DG, was found to exhibit differential modulation of epileptiform activity in the EC and DG. In the EC, NE, acting via alpha 1-receptors, completely blocked low Mg2+-induced epileptiform activity. In contrast, in the DG, NE exhibited a beta-receptor mediated prolongation of the low Mg2+-induced ictal events, and enhanced the stimulus-induced ionic and field potential changes. From these results, we conclude that lowering extracellular [Mg2+], acting in large part through the removal of the Mg2+ voltage-dependent blockade of NMDA receptors, leads to induction of epileptiform activity in both the EC and DG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
