     "AB": "Ca2+ release from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive and ryanodine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores is mediated by distinct proteins identified as IP3 receptors (IP3R) and ryanodine receptors (RyR), respectively. We have compared the immunohistochemical localizations of IP3R and RyR in the brain at the light and electron microscopic levels and have also evaluated the distribution of the major brain intracellular Ca(2+)-pumping ATPase. IP3R and RyR occur in overlapping populations of neurons in widespread areas of the brain, but labeling is distinct in a number of areas. For example, IP3R is enriched in cerebellar Purkinje cells and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, while RyR is present at relatively low levels in these cells. RyR is most enriched in the dentate gyrus and CA3/4 areas of the hippocampus, where IP3R levels are low. In the cortex, IP3R is found in pyramidal cell bodies and proximal dendrites, whereas RyR is located predominantly in long, thin apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. In deep cerebellar nuclei, RyR is located in cell bodies that appear devoid of IP3R, whereas IP3R is enriched in terminals surrounding cell bodies. Electron microscopy in the hippocampus reveals RyR in axons, dendritic spines, and dendritic shafts near dendritic spines while IP3R is primarily identified in dendritic shafts and cell bodies. These results suggest that the IP3- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ pools have largely distinct roles in controlling intracellular Ca2+ levels, though in some sites they may interact to varying degrees.",
