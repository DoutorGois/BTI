     "AB": "UNLABELLED: In this study, we investigated the effects of lipoic acid (LA) in the hippocampus oxidative stress caused by pilocarpine-induced seizures in adult rats. Wistar rats were treated with 0.9% saline (i.p., control group), LA (10mg/kg, i.p., LA group), ubiquinone [20mg/kg, i.p., ubiquinone (UQ) group], pilocarpine (400mg/kg, i.p., P400 group), and the association of LA (10mg/kg, i.p.) plus pilocarpine (400mg/kg, i.p.) or UQ (20mg/kg, i.p.) plus pilocarpine (400mg/kg, i.p.), 30min before of administration of P400 (LA plus P400 group and UQ plus P400 group, respectively). After the treatments, all groups were observed for 1h. The enzyme activities (delta-aminolevulinic dehydratase (delta-ALA-D), Mg(2+) -ATPase, and Na(+) , K(+) -ATPase) were measured using spectrophotometric methods, and the results compared to values obtained from saline and pilocarpine-treated animals. Protective effects of LA and UQ were also evaluated on the same parameters. We reported here for the first time that Na(+) , K(+) -ATPase and delta-ALA-D activities inhibition and Mg(2+) -ATPase stimulation in the pilocarpine model are probably attributed to the oxidative stress caused by seizures in the rat hippocampus. The addition of the antioxidants LA and UQ may reverses the previously mentioned Na(+) , K(+) -ATPase and delta-ALA-D inhibitions and Mg(2+) -ATPase stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: The oxidative stress plays an important signaling role in pilocarpine-induced seizures, and antioxidant drugs might be considered as therapeutical tools in this pathology.",
