     "AB": "The complete deduced primary structure of mouse brain testican has been established from cDNA cloning. The cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 442 amino acids belonging to the proteoglycan family. The mouse brain testican core protein is 95% identical to its human testicular counterpart. In situ hybridization investigations revealed that mouse testican mRNA is mainly present in a subpopulation of pyramidal neurons localized in the CA3 area of the hippocampus. An immunocytochemical approach, with antibodies directed against an overexpressed chimeric antigen, produced in bacterial systems, showed that testican is associated with the postsynaptic region of these pyramidal neurons. Testican includes several putative functional domains related to extracellular or pericellular proteins associated with binding and/or regulatory functions. On the basis of its structural organization and its occurrence in postsynaptic areas, this proteoglycan might contribute to various neuronal mechanisms in the central nervous system.",
