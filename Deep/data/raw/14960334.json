     "AB": "DISC1 (Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1) has been associated with schizophrenia in multiple genetic studies. Studies from our laboratory have shown that Disc1, the mouse ortholog of DISC1, is highly expressed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in the adult mouse brain. Because developmental dysfunction of the hippocampus is thought to play a major role in schizophrenia pathogenesis, and the dentate gyrus is a major locus for adult neurogenesis in the mouse, we investigated Disc1 expression during mouse brain development. Strikingly, Disc1 is strongly expressed in the hippocampus during all stages of hippocampal development, from embryonic day 14 through adulthood. Disc1 mRNA was detected in the dentate gyrus at all stages in which this structure was identifiable, as well as in the cornu ammonis (CA) fields of the hippocampus, the subiculum and adjacent entorhinal cortex, and the developing cerebral neocortex, hypothalamus, and olfactory bulbs, all of which also express Disc1 in the adult mouse brain. In addition, Disc1 mRNA was seen in regions of the developing mouse brain which do not express Disc1 during adulthood, regions including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, reticular thalamic nucleus and reuniens thalamic nucleus. These results demonstrate that Disc1 marks the hippocampus from its earliest stages, and suggest that developmental Disc1 dysfunction may lead to defects in hippocampal function that are associated with schizophrenia.",
