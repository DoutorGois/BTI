     "AB": "The significance of multiple growth factors acting on individual neurons in the central nervous system is presently unclear. Cultured hippocampal neurons were used in the present study to compare the neurotrophic actions of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) with the better characterized growth factors, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Additionally, cultures were utilized to identify possible interactions between FGF-2 and the other growth factors. Activation of the ERK and Akt pro-survival pathways, as well as neuronal survival itself, were studied. The maximal magnitude of Akt activation stimulated by FGF-2 was found to be similar to that stimulated by IGF-1 and BDNF. In contrast, IGF-1 was less effective at inducing ERK activation than were BDNF and FGF-2. All three agents were found to promote survival of neurons cultured under serum-free, low-insulin conditions, with FGF-2 surprisingly being significantly more effective than the other two peptides. Co-treatment with maximal concentrations of either IGF-1 or BDNF enhanced FGF-2-stimulated Akt and ERK activation. However, no enhancement of survival beyond that stimulated by FGF-2 was observed with co-treatment. These findings suggest that FGF-2 may play an important role in promoting the survival of hippocampal neurons. Additionally, an interesting dissociation was identified between the positive interaction of FGF-2 with both IGF-1 and BDNF in activating Akt and ERK, and the lack of enhancement of FGF-2-induced neuroprotection.",
