     "AB": "Studies have shown that neurogenesis and angiogenesis do exist in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The ephrin ligands and Eph receptors are the largest members of receptor tyrosine kinases, and their interaction via cell-cell contact participates in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and tissue remodeling. However, there is little information about the function of the ephrin-A5/EphA4 complex in TLE. In the current study, we found that ephrin-A5 was expressed in astrocytes, while EphA4 existed in endothelial cells in the hippocampus in a mouse model of TLE. Furthermore, the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of both ephrin-A5 and EphA4 and the binding capacity of ephrin-A5/EphA4 showed gradual increase in spatiotemporal course. When ephrin-A5-Fc was injected into the hippocampus at 3 days post-status epilepticus (SE) for 7 days, the spontaneous recurrent seizure (SRS) frequency and intensity of the mice attenuated in the following 2 weeks. Furthermore, doublecortin-positive neuronal progenitor cells were reduced in the subgranular zone, and the density of microvessels decreased in the hilus. The molecular mechanism was attributed to ephrin-A5-Fc-induced inhibition of phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), and also EphA4 and VEGF reduction. In summary, interaction between ephrin-A5 and EphA4 could mediate the ERK and Akt signaling pathways in pilocarpine-induced epilepsy, and intervention of the ephrin/Eph interaction may play an essential role in the suppression of newborn neuron generation, microvessel remodeling, and SRS in a mouse model of TLE. The ephrin-A5/EphA4 communication may provide a potential therapy for the treatment of TLE.",
