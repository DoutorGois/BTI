     "AB": "This study examines the relationship between the levels of apolipoprotein E (apoE) and apolipoprotein J (apoJ, also designated as clusterin) as a function of apoE genotype in the hippocampus and cortex of Alzheimer disease (AD) subjects. These two lipophilic proteins which are involved in the maintenance of lipid homeostasis are both synthesized in the brain by astrocytes. Results indicate a reduction of apoE levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex that is proportional to the apoE4 allele dose. Conversely, apoJ (clusterin) levels were found to increase proportionately to the number of apoE4 allele dose. These results suggest a compensatory induction of apoJ (clusterin) in the brain of apoE4 AD subjects showing low brain levels of apoE.",
