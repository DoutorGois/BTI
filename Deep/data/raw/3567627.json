     "AB": "In a previous study it was found that there are significant differences in the numbers of granule cells in the dentate gyrus of adult Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats and also that the continued postnatal addition of new cells to the dentate gyrus has quite different consequences in the two strains. We have now extended these observations to the two major cytoarchitectonic fields of the hippocampus (the regio superior or field CA1; and the regio inferior or field CA3). The mean number of pyramidal neurons in field CA1 of 1-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats is 420,000 (+/- 60,000 S.E.), while Wistar rats at the same age have 320,000 (+/- 20,000). The numbers of neurons in field CA3 in the two strains are: 330,000 (+/- 30,000) and 210,000 (+/- 20,000), respectively. Whether these strain differences reflect specific differences in the neural organization of the hippocampal formation in the two strains, or are related to more general differences in total body weight or brain weight, is unknown. Since during the first two days postnatally we estimate that there are between 358,000 and 491,000 cells in field CA1 of Sprague-Dawley rats, it would seem that there is no significant naturally-occurring neuronal death in this hippocampal field. This may be due to the extensive collateral projections of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons.",
