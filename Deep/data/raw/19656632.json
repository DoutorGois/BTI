     "AB": "Hormones are trophic factors that integrate central and peripheral nervous system functions, and can influence social, cognitive, emotional and physical (SCEP) processes. Greater understanding of behavioral and neurobiological underpinnings of mental, cognitive, and/or physical changes with maturation is becoming increasingly important as the world's population ages. There are individual differences in how people age, but the factors that influence these differences are not well understood. Social supports are one factor that may influence the trajectory of age-related processes. The loss of close relationships, especially among older persons, is one of the greatest risk factors for mental and physical decline. Progesterone, secreted by the ovaries, or produced de novo in the brain, is readily converted centrally to 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP), and can influence SCEP, through rapid, non-classical steroid-mediated actions. Our hypothesis is that 3alpha,5alpha-THP is a key trophic factor in SCEP and development. Our research has demonstrated that 3alpha,5alpha-THP facilitates social and sexual behavior of rodents, which evokes further increases in 3alpha,5alpha-THP in midbrain and hippocampus, brain areas involved in SCEP. The role of 3alpha,5alpha-THP to influence social and/or sexual experience, and thereby SCEP, is discussed in this review. Further understanding of these neurobiological and/or behavioral factors may lead to findings that ultimately can promote health and prevent disease.",
