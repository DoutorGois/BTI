     "AB": "Recently, there has been considerable interest in a possible link between changes in brain polyunsaturated fatty acids, neural membrane phospholipid degradation, serotonergic neurotransmission, and depression. The present study aims to examine effects of antidepressants on lipids in different regions of the brain at individual molecular species level, using the novel technique of lipidomics. Balb/C mice received daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 10 mg/kg of the antidepressants maprotiline, fluoxetine and paroxetine for 4 wk. The prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum were harvested, and lipid profiles compared to those of saline-injected mice. Treatment with maprotiline and paroxetine, but not fluoxetine, resulted in significant decreases in phosphatidylcholine (PC) species, PC36:1, PC38:3, PC40:2p, PC40:6, PC40:5, PC42:7p, PC42:6p and PC42:5p in the prefrontal neocortex. The decreases in phospholipids were accompanied by increases in lysophospholipid species, lysoPC16:0, lysoPC18:2 and lysoPC18:0 in the prefrontal cortex, indicating increase in phospholipase A2 activity and possible release of long-chain fatty acids. Maprotiline and paroxetine treatment also resulted in decreases in sphingomyelin and increases in several ceramide species in the prefrontal cortex. It is postulated that endogenous release of long-chain fatty acids may be related to the mechanism of action of maprotiline and paroxetine.",
