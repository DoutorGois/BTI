     "AB": "Considerable attention has been focused on the role of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases including epilepsy. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the temporal and spatial alteration of CRF receptor in the gerbil hippocampal complex in order to characterize the possible changes and associations with different sequelae of spontaneous seizure in these animals. Thirty minutes postictal, a decline in CRF receptor immunoreactivity was observed in the granule cells and hilar neurons. In the subiculum, CRF receptor immunoreactivity was also significantly decreased at this time point. Twenty-four hours after seizure onset, the immunoreactivity in these regions recovered to the pre-seizure level. Moreover, 30 min after seizure in the entorhinal cortex, the density of CRF receptor immunoreactivity began to decrease, particularly in the layers II and III, compared to pre-seizure group. Nevertheless, 24h after seizure onset, CRF receptor immunodensity had recovered to its seizure-sensitive (SS) level. These results suggest that altered CRF receptor expression in the hippocampal complex may affect tissue excitability and seizure activity in SS gerbils.",
