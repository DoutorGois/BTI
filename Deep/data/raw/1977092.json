     "AB": "The systemic injection of kainic acid (KA) has been shown to destroy neurons in the hippocampus and to induce limbic-type seizure activity. However, little is known on the neurochemical events that are associated with this convulsant effect. In the present work we studied the spontaneous and the K(+)-stimulated release of labeled tau-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, serotonin and dopamine, in hippocampal slices of KA-treated rats, at the moment of clinical seizures (2 h) and 72 h later. At the onset of convulsions we found a 40-45% decrease in the K(+)-stimulated release of GABA. The release of the other neurotransmitters was not significantly affected by KA treatment. After 72 h GABA release was still reduced by 30-40%. It is concluded that the epileptogenic effect of KA in the hippocampus is probably related to a diminished inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission.",
