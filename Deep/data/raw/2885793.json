     "AB": "The influence of intralimbic and intrahypothalamic application of catecholamine-related compounds on the release of neuronally localized corticosterone in the central amygdala, ventral hippocampus and medial hypothalamus was investigated under in vivo and in vitro conditions. It is reported that agonists and antagonists of the alpha-adrenergic system did not affect the release of corticosterone in the brain areas studied. In contrast, the beta-adrenoreceptor agonist isoprenaline markedly enhanced the release of corticosterone. This response is prevented in the presence of the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol. The data reveal that limbic and hypothalamic beta-adrenoreceptors play a role in the regulation of corticosterone release and suggest a functional interaction between catecholaminergic and corticosterone releasing neurons in forebrain areas.",
