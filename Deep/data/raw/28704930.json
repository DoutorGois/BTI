     "AB": "Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in the neuropathology associated with status epilepticus (SE) and is implicated in the development of epilepsy. While excitotoxic mechanisms are well-known mediators affecting mitochondrial health following SE, whether hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) also contributes to SE-induced mitochondrial dysfunction remains to be examined. Here we first evaluated the temporal evolution of poly-ADP-ribosylated protein levels in hippocampus following kainic acid-induced SE as a marker for PARP-1 activity, and found that PARP-1 was hyperactive at 24 h following SE. We evaluated oxidative metabolism and found decreased NAD(+) levels by enzymatic cycling, and impaired NAD(+)-dependent mitochondrial respiration as measured by polarography at 24 h following SE. Stereological estimation showed significant cell loss in the hippocampal CA(1) and CA(3) subregions 72 h following SE. PARP-1 inhibition using N-(6-Oxo-5,6-dihydro-phenanthridin-2-yl)- N,N-dimethylacetamide (PJ-34) in vivo administration was associated with preserved NAD(+) levels and NAD(+)-dependent mitochondrial respiration, and improved CA(1) neuronal survival. These findings suggest that PARP-1 hyperactivation contributes to SE-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and CA(1) hippocampal damage. The deleterious effects of PARP-1 hyperactivation on mitochondrial respiration are in part mediated through intracellular NAD(+) depletion. Therefore, modulating PARP-1 activity may represent a potential therapeutic target to preserve intracellular energetics and mitochondrial function following SE.",
