     "AB": "Administration of single doses of ethanol or presence of ethanol in the incubation medium does not change 3H-flunitrazepam binding in rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. In rats made dependent on ethanol by three daily ethanol administrations for six days and sacrifices 1 hr after the last ethanol dose 3H-flunitrazepam binding is decreased in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. This decrease is present only in membranes preincubated with Triton X-100 and is due to decreased number of binding sites. In rats sacrificed 16 hours after the last chronic ethanol dose the 3H-flunitrazepam binding returns to control levels.",
