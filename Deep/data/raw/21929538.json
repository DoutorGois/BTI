     "AB": "Although the pathological role of presenilin-1 mutation in early onset familial Alzheimer's disease has been widely studied, few focused on how the presenilin-1 mutations result in memory impairment and tau hyperphosphorylation. In the present study, we expressed human Val97Leu mutant presenilin-1, which is reported in Chinese pedigrees by our group, in transgenic mice and found that the mutant presenilin-1 induced spatial memory deficit and tau hyperphosphorylation at PHF-1, pS199/202, pT231 and pS396 epitopes, but not at pS214 and pS422 epitopes. Pearson analysis showed that the memory deficit was only significantly correlated with tau phosphorylation level at PHF-1, pS199/202, pT231 and pS396 epitopes. Additionally, the hyperphosphorylated tau and tangle-like argentophilic structures were detected at CA3 and CA4, but not CA1, region of hippocampus, and we also found tangle-like structure and wizened degenerative neurons in frontal cortex. We demonstrated the tau hyperphosphorylation at the same epitopes in N2a cells expressing the mutant presenilin-1, which is caused by inhibition of phosphoinositol-3 kinase/Akt and activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 specifically. Our data demonstrated that human Val97Leu mutant presenilin-1 causes spatial memory deficit in mice and increases tau phosphorylation level in glycogen synthase kinase-3-dependent manner.",
