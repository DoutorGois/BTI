     "AB": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) displays diverse modes of action in the CNS including the modulation of feeding behavior, gonadotropin releasing hormone release, and stress responses. Many of the above physiological actions have been at least partially attributed to actions of NPY on the NPY Y5 receptor subtype. We utilized an antibody directed against the NPY Y5 receptor to characterize the distribution of this receptor in the rat brain. Using Western blot analysis, this antibody recognized a single major band at approximately 57 kD. To further verify the specificity of the antibody, animals were treated for 5 days with antisense oligonucleotides for the Y5 receptor. The antisense treatment significantly reduced food intake and body weight. Furthermore, the Y5 antibody detected a significant decrease in Y5 receptor protein. Y5-like immunoreactivity (-ir) was observed throughout the hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus and cortex. Double-label immunofluorescence demonstrated that Y5-ir was colocalized with the following neuronal phenotypes in the hypothalamus, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, neurophysins, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and gamma-amino butyric acid. In addition, functional interactions were demonstrated by the presence of close appositions of NPY fibers with Y5-ir expressing cells. The wide distribution of the Y5 receptor-ir, as well as the colocalization within specific neuronal populations, agrees with the distribution of the Y5 receptor mRNA and the known physiological roles of the NPY/Y5 system. The role of the NPY/Y5 receptor system as a mediator between signals of peripheral energy availability and reproductive neuroendocrine function is discussed.",
