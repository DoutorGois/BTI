     "AB": "Administration of Abeta(1-42) into the rabbit brain induces apoptosis and phosphorylation of tau. These Abeta effects correlate with the activation of JNK and ERK, but not of p38. Treatment with 7 mM lithium inhibits apoptosis, modulates JNK and ERK and does not affect the phosphorylation of tau. Our results demonstrate that lithium, at this dose, effectively inhibits the Abeta-induced apoptosis but has no effect on tau phosphorylation, and that MAP kinases are not involved in the phosphorylation of tau.",
