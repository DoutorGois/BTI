     "AB": "The expression of mRNA for Talpha1-tubulin, a cytoskeletal protein, was studied in the rat kindling model of epilepsy. The Talpha1-tubulin mRNA level increased significantly in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 of hippocampus ipsilateral to stimulation from 8 h to 4 weeks after amygdaloid kindled seizures. The peak increase was observed at 1 week after the last seizures both in the DG and CA3. These results suggest that the microtubule formation contributes to synaptic remodeling and reorganization of neural networks, which may be based on the kindling-inducing epileptogenesity.",
