     "AB": "Treatment with methamphetamine (MA) on postnatal days P11-20 induces adult spatial learning and memory deficits without affecting monoamine levels in various brain regions. In this study, we examined the pituitary and adrenal response of animals administered MA four times daily on P11, P11-15, or from P11 to P20. Corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) levels were assessed over a 1-hour period following MA exposure. On P11, MA produced marked elevations of both CORT and ACTH; this is during the stress hyporesponsive period (SHRP). On P15 and P20, the maximal effect of MA on CORT titers was observed at 30 min, with lower, but still significantly increased, levels at 60 min compared to controls. Males receiving MA on P15 had higher levels of ACTH than did control males, while no differences were noted among females. On P20, MA treatment resulted in higher levels of ACTH relative to vehicle-injected controls, but levels were not different from controls that were only weighed at each drug administration. MA treatment inhibited body, but not brain weight gain, resulting in hippocampal weights that were heavier in the MA-treated animals when expressed as a percent of body weight. The elevations of adrenal steroids by MA, during late phases of hippocampal neurogenesis, may contribute to neuronal alterations that are later manifested in deficits of learning and memory.",
