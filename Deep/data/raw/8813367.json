     "AB": "Bifemelane hydrochloride (BF) is a modulator of various neurotransmitter systems. The effect of BF on the cholinergic system was studied in the gerbil hippocampus at 100 days after ischemic damage. Marked enhancement of AChE staining was noticed in the CA1 of saline-treated animals at 100 days after ischemia, while the post-ischemic enhancement of AChE staining intensity was milder in BF-treated animals. Muscarinic receptor density was markedly decreased in the CA1 subfield after ischemia. Interestingly, BF-treated animals showed higher muscarinic receptor binding in many brain areas, particularly in the dentate gyrus. These results indicate that BF modulates cholinergic neuronal plasticity in the ischemic hippocampus after long-term survival.",
