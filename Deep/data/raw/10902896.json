     "AB": "After seizures caused by kindling or kainic acid (KA), hippocampal granule-cell axons, the mossy fibers, sprout into the supragranular layer of the rat. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive, but excitotoxic loss of hilar cells, which project to this supragranular layer, is suspected to be a critical determinant. Consistent with this hypothesis, we previously reported that while rats show mossy fiber sprouting after kainate, ICR mice do not. This may be associated with the observation that ICR mice, unlike rats, do not appear to show hilar cell death after KA (McNamara et al., Mol Brain Res 1996;40:177-187). Other strains of mice, however, such as 129/SvEMS, do show hilar cell death after KA (Schauwecker and Steward, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1997;94:4103-4108). We examined the possibility that the 129/SvEMS mouse strain would show granule-cell sprouting, in contrast to ICR mice. After administration of KA, mossy fiber sprouting was indeed observed in strain 129/SvEMS, but only in animals displaying evident hilar cell death. In contrast, neither hilar cell death nor mossy fiber sprouting was observed in ICR mice, confirming previous results. Both mouse strains demonstrated comparable behavioral seizures. These results strengthen the view that hilar cell death, together with epileptogenesis, triggers reactive synaptogenesis and mossy fiber sprouting.",
