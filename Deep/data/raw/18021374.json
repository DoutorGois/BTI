     "AB": "We report a case of a 68-year-old right-handed man with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) having a 22-month duration. His initial symptoms were dysarthria and swallowing difficulty at the age of 67. Subsequently bulbar palsy and pyramidal signs developed. His cognitive functions including face recognition, personality, and behavior were not changed compared with that of before the disease onset. However, magnetic resonance imaging disclosed severe right side-predominant temporal atrophy. The neurological diagnosis was bulbar type ALS. Pathological examination disclosed histological evidence of ALS, including loss of Betz cells and lower motor neurons, corticospinal tract degeneration, and Bunina bodies. In addition, severe neuronal loss in the bilateral temporal cortex with an anterior gradient was found. Ubiquitin-positive inclusions were encountered in the spinal anterior horn cells and hippocampal dentate gyrus, while few ubiquitin-positive inclusions were noted in the affected temporal cortex. The amygdala, especially the basolateral nuclear group, was severely affected by neuronal loss with tissue rarefaction. Moderate neuronal loss was encountered in the parahippocampal gyrus, and to a lesser degree, in the ambient gyrus. Unexpectedly, many argyrophilic grains, coiled bodies, tau-positive bush-like astrocytes, pretangles, and ballooned neurons were found in the limbic system and temporal cortex. In the hippocampus, selective tau accumulation with minor neurofibrillary changes was observed in CA2 neurons. The present case suggests that (i) ALS and AGD do rarely coexist, and (ii) when ALS patients have severe temporal atrophy, not only ALS with dementia but also concurrent AGD should be considered in the differential diagnosis.",
