     "AB": "In recent decades, there has been a significant expansion in our understanding of the role of astrocytes in neuroprotection, including spatial buffering of extracellular ions, secretion of metabolic coenzymes, and synaptic regulation. Astrocytic neuroprotective functions require energy, and therefore require a network of functional mitochondria. Disturbances to astrocytic mitochondrial homeostasis and their ability to produce ATP can negatively impact neural function. Perturbations in astrocyte mitochondrial function may accrue as the result of physiological aging processes or as a consequence of neurotoxicant exposure. Hydrophobic environmental neurotoxicants, such as 1,3-dinitrobenzene and alpha-chlorohydrin, cause regionally specific spongiform lesions mimicking energy deprivation syndromes. Astrocyte involvement includes mitochondrial damage that either precedes or is accompanied by neuronal damage. Similarly, environmental neurotoxicants that are implicated in the etiology of age-related neurodegenerative conditions cause regionally specific damage in the brain. Based on the regioselective nature of age-related neurodegenerative lesions, chemically induced models of regioselective lesions targeting astrocyte mitochondria can provide insight into age-related susceptibilities in astrocyte mitochondria. Most of the available research to date focuses on neuronal damage in cases of age-related neurodegeneration; however, there is a body of evidence that supports a central mechanistic role for astrocyte mitochondria in the expression of neural injury. Regional susceptibility to neuronal damage induced by aging by exposure to neurotoxicants may be a reflection of highly variable regional energy requirements. This review identifies region-specific vulnerabilities in astrocyte mitochondria in examples of exposure to neurotoxicants and in age-related neurodegeneration.",
