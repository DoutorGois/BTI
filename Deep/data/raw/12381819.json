     "AB": "Paired recordings between CA3 interconnected pyramidal neurons were used to study the properties of short-term depression occurring in these synapses under different frequencies of presynaptic firing (n = 22). In stationary conditions (0.05-0.067 Hz) pairs of presynaptic action potentials (50 ms apart) evoked EPSCs whose amplitude fluctuated from trial to trial with occasional response failures. In 15/20 cells, paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was characterized by facilitation (PPF) while in the remaining five by depression (PPD). Increasing stimulation frequency from 0.05-0.067 Hz to 0.1-1 Hz induced low frequency depression (LFD) of EPSC amplitude with a gradual increase in the failure rate. Overall, 9/12 cells at 1 Hz became almost \"silent\". In six cells in which the firing rate was sequentially shifted from 0.05 to 0.1 and 1 Hz, changes in synaptic efficacy were so strong that PPR shifted from PPF to PPD. The time course of depression of EPSC1 could be fitted with single exponentials with time constants of 98 and 36 s at 0.1 and 1 Hz, respectively. In line with the inversion of PPR at 1 Hz, the time course of depression of EPSC2 was faster than EPSC1 (7 s). Recovery from depression could be obtained by lowering the frequency of stimulation to 0.025 Hz. These results could be explained by a model that takes into account two distinct release processes, one dependent on the residual calcium and the other on the size of the readily releasable pool of vesicles.",
