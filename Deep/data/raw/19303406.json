     "AB": "The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of the administration of resveratrol (RV) on memory and on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus, cerebellum and blood in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The animals were divided into six groups (n=6-13): Control/saline; Control/RV 10 mg/kg; Control/RV 20 mg/kg; Diabetic/saline; Diabetic/RV 10 mg/kg; Diabetic/RV 20 mg/kg. One day after 30 days of treatment with resveratrol the animals were submitted to behavioral tests and then submitted to euthanasia and the brain structures and blood were collected. The results showed a decrease in step-down latency in diabetic/saline group. Resveratrol (10 and 20 mg/kg) prevented the impairment of memory induced by diabetes. In the open field test, no significant differences were observed between the groups. In relation to AChE activity, a significant increase in diabetic/saline group (P<0.05) was observed in all brain structures compared to control/saline group. However, AChE activity decreased significantly in control/RV10 and control/RV20 (P<0.05) groups in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum, while no significant differences were observed in diabetic/RV10 and diabetic/RV20 groups in all brain structures compared to control/saline group. Blood AChE activity increased significantly in diabetic/saline group (P<0.05) decreased in control/RV10, control/RV20 and diabetic/RV20 groups (P<0.05) compared to control/saline group. In conclusion, the present findings showed that treatment with resveratrol prevents the increase in AChE activity and consequently memory impairment in diabetic rats, demonstrating that this compound can modulate cholinergic neurotransmission and consequently improve cognition.",
