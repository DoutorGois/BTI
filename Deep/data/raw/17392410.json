     "AB": "Learning and memory are thought to involve activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Recent studies have indicated that endocannabinoid-dependent modulation of inhibitory transmission facilitates induction of hippocampal LTP and that endocannabinoids play a key role in certain forms of LTD. Here, we show that repetitive low-frequency synaptic stimulation (LFS) produces persistent up-regulation of endocannabinoid signaling at hippocampal CA1 GABAergic synapses. This LFS also produces LTD of inhibitory synapses and facilitates LTP at excitatory, glutamatergic synapses. These endocannabinoid-mediated plastic changes could contribute to information storage within the brain.",
