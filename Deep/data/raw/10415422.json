     "AB": "Inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) was transiently induced in the neurons throughout the entire hippocampus between 6 and 24 h after injection of kainic acid (KA). The induction of COX-2 correlated more closely with the induction of c-Jun than with that of c-Fos. Phosphorylated c-Jun was induced 6-12 h after in the CA3 pyramidal neurons, which undergo apoptosis. Almost all of neurons with phosphorylated c-Jun were colocalized with COX-2. These results suggest that COX-2 and c-Jun phosphorylation may participate in KA-induced neurodegeneration.",
