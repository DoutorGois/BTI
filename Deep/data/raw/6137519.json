     "AB": "The activities of choline acetyltransferase and ATP-citrate lyase were significantly correlated (r = 0.995) in fractions of small and large synaptosomes isolated from rat hippocampus and cerebellum. The activities of these two enzymes did not correlate with those of pyruvate dehydrogenase, carnitine acetyltransferase, citrate synthase, acetyl-CoA synthetase, lactate dehydrogenase, or with the rate of high-affinity glutamate uptake in the synaptosomal fractions. The results provide additional evidence linking ATP-citrate lyase to the cholinergic system in the brain.",
