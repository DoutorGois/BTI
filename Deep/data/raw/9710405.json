     "AB": "BACKGROUND: This study examined the effects of thiopental on intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) changes induced by membrane depolarization, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, and ischemia. METHODS: Experiments were performed in brain slices prepared from Wistar rats. [Ca2+]i measurements were taken on the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus or layers II to III of the somatosensory cortex using the fura-2 fluorescence technique. Membrane depolarization and NMDA receptor activation were induced by exposing slices to 60 mM K+ and 100 microM NMDA, respectively. In vitro ischemia was induced by superfusing slices with glucose-free Krebs solution equilibrated with 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide. Thiopental was applied 5 min before application of high K+ and NMDA, or before in vitro ischemia. RESULTS: Ischemia for 15 min produced a characteristic [Ca2+]i increase in both hippocampal and cortical slices. Thiopental prolonged the latency to the appearance of the [Ca2+]i plateau and reduced the magnitudes of increase in [Ca2+]i 8, 10, and 15 min after the onset of ischemia. Thiopental also suppressed the high K+- and NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i increases. The NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i increases were attenuated to a greater extent in cortical slices than were those in hippocampal slices. The inhibition of thiopental on the 200-microM NMDA-mediated [Ca2+]i response was confirmed in cultured cortical neurons. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that thiopental attenuates ischemia-induced [Ca2+]i increases in the hippocampus and cortex in vitro, probably because of its inhibition of both voltage-gated calcium channels and NMDA receptors. The regionally different inhibition of thiopental on NMDA receptors may relate to its region-specific action against ischemia.",
