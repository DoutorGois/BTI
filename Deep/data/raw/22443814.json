     "AB": "Golden hamsters of one common laboratory strain had a high incidence of hydrocephalus internus. When a severity score of hydrocephalus was used, a major autosomal recessive locus could be identified. However, when a binary score (hydrocephalus, no hydrocephalus) was used, no such major locus could be detected and results of test matings were not consistent with Mendelian inheritance. Golden hamsters with severe forms of hydrocephalus had a dorsally compressed and ventrally intact hippocampus. Implications for the behavior and well-being of affected hamsters are unknown but researchers using this strain should be aware of the likely presence of hydrocephalus.",
