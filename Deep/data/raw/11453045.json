     "AB": "Age-related changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) were examined with [99Tc(m)]-d,l-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO), using a single photon emission tomography (SPET) gamma camera system equipped with a high resolution collimator, in 33 normal individuals in three age groups: 40 years old (n = 11), 75 years old (n = 9) and 88 years old (n = 13). A standard activity of 1000 MBq [99Tc(m)]-d,l-HMPAO was administered. Regional CBF (rCBF) (relative to cerebellar counts) was quantified in 28 grey and white matter regions. The mean rCBF of all the regions was 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.83) in 40 year olds, 0.77 (0.74-0.80) in 75 year olds and 0.76 (0.73-0.78) in 88 year olds. rCBF in the hippocampus, angular and cingular gyri, and frontal association and motor cortices was 5-10% lower in the 75 and 88 year olds than in the middle-aged subjects (P < 0.05). The annual reduction in rCBF was 0.10% between the ages of 40 and 75 years and 0.13% between the ages of 75 and 88 years. The reduction in rCBF in the hippocampus rose from 0.14% between the ages of 40 and 75 years to 0.33% between the ages of 75 and 88 years. The mean rCBF in all 33 individuals showed no sex-related differences.",
