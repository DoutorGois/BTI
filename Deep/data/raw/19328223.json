     "AB": "Our previous studies showed that the assembly of the GluR6-PSD95-mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) signaling module played an important role in rat ischemic brain injury. In this study, we aimed to elucidate whether ischemic preconditioning could downregulate the assembly of the GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 signaling module and suppress the activation of MLK3, MKK4/7, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). As a result, ischemic preconditioning could not only inhibit the assembly of the GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 signaling module, diminish the phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun, downregulate Fas ligand expression, attenuate the phosphorylation of 14-3-3 and Bcl-2 and the translocation of Bax to mitochondria, but also increase the release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-3. In contrast, both GluR6 antisense ODNs (oligodeoxynucleotides) and 6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5-nitro-1 H-benz[g]indole-2,3-dione-3-oxime (NS102), an antagonist of GluR6 receptor, prevented the above effects of preconditioning, which shows that suppressing the expression of GluR6 or inhibiting GluR6 activity contributes negatively to preconditioning-induced ischemia tolerance. Taken together, our results indicate that preconditioning can inhibit the over-assembly of the GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 signaling module and the JNK3 activation. GluR6 subunit-containing kainite receptors play an important role in the preconditioning-induced neuronal survival and provide new insight into stroke therapy.",
