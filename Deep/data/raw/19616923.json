     "AB": "Growing evidence indicates that glia pathology contributes to the pathophysiology and possibly the etiology of depression. The study investigates changes in behaviors and glial fibrillary associated protein (GFAP) in the rat hippocampus after chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), a rat model of depression. Furthermore, we studied the effects of clomipramine, one of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), known to modulate serotonin and norepinephrine uptake, on CUS-induced depressive-like behaviors and GFAP levels. Rats exposed to CUS showed behavioral deficits in physical state, open field test and forced swimming test and exhibited a significant decrease in GFAP expression in the hippocampus. Interestingly, the behavioral and GFAP expression changes induced by CUS were reversed by chronic treatment with the antidepressant clomipramine. The beneficial effects of clomipramine treatment on CUS-induced depressive-like behavior and GFAP expression provide further validation of our hypothesis that glial dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of depression and that glial elements may represent viable targets for new antidepressant drug development.",
