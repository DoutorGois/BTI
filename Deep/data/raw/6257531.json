     "AB": "In rats receiving repeated injections of imipramine, there is a reduction in the number of high affinity binding sites for [3H]imipramine and [3H]dihydroalprenolol present in crude synaptic membrane preparations from various brain structures. The location of the sites that become subsensitive to the two ligands did not coincide; the binding sites to [3H]imipramine became subsensitive in the hippocampus but not in cortex or cerebellum. In contrast the binding sites to [3H]dihydroalprenolol became subsensitive in cortex and cerebellum but not in hippocampus. It can be suggested that in rats repeatedly treated with imipramine the down regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors may not coincide with the down regulation of the high affinity binding sites for imipramine. Such a dissociation is supported further by experiments with rats treated with iprinidol.",
