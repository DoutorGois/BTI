     "AB": "Retrograde amnesia following disruptions of hippocampal function is often temporally graded, with recent memories being more impaired. Evidence supports the existence of one or more neocortical long-term memory storage/retrieval site(s). Neurotoxic lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or the dorsal hippocampus (DH) were made 1 day or 200 days following trace fear conditioning. Recently encoded trace fear memories were most disrupted by DH lesions, while remotely encoded trace and contextual memories were most disrupted by mPFC lesions. These data strongly support the consolidation theory of hippocampus function and implicate the mPFC as a site of long-term memory storage/retrieval.",
