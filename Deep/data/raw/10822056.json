     "AB": "The genetically epilepsy-prone rat (GEPR) seizure model is characterized by extensive abnormalities in brain noradrenergic function. Earlier studies had suggested that GEPRs might not regulate adrenoceptors in a normal fashion. The purpose of the present study was to determine if GEPR-9s are capable of up and down regulation of alpha(1)- and beta-adrenoceptors in response to increments or decrements in extracellular norepinephrine. Seizure induction has been shown to increase extracellular norepinephrine. Chronic sound or electroshock-induced seizures caused down regulation of beta-adrenoceptors in frontal cortex and in hippocampus from GEPR-9s. Similarly, chronic daily treatment with the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor desmethylimipramine produced down regulation of beta-adrenoceptors in frontal cortex and in hippocampus from GEPR-9s. As is the case in neurologically normal animals, chronic electroshock-induced seizure did not cause down regulation of beta-adrenoceptors in 6-hydroxydopamine pretreated GEPR-9s. Chronic electroshock treatment also caused up-regulation of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in frontal cortex but not in hippocampus. In 6-hydroxydopamine pretreated GEPR-9s, chronic electroshock treatment caused a further up-regulation of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in frontal cortex but not in hippocampus. Taken together, these results indicate that GEPR-9s are capable of up and down regulation of alpha(1)- and beta-adrenoceptors in a manner that is qualitatively similar to the regulation of these receptors in normal animals. Whether the regulation of brain adrenoceptors is quantitatively different in GEPRs from normal animals remains to be established.",
