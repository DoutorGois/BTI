     "AB": "Nerve growth factor (NGF), its messenger RNA (mRNA) and its receptor protein and mRNA are found in several brain regions. Little attention has been given to the possibility that the hypothalamus, which controls the endocrine system, may produce NGF and/or express NGF receptors. This would indicate the existence in this brain area of neuronal populations which are either target for NGF-responsive cells or sensitive to NGF, respectively. Blot hybridization of polyadenylated (poly(A)+) RNA to a mouse NGF cRNA probe revealed the presence of NGF mRNA in both the suprachiasmatic region (henceforth, called preoptic area [POA]) and medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) of developing female rats. The mRNA was already detectable on fetal day 18 and reached maximal levels around postnatal day 3 (MBH) and 12 (POA), declining thereafter. This pattern was temporally different than that of areas known to produce NGF, i.e., the neocortex (Cc) and hippocampus (Hc). In agreement with previous reports, NGF mRNA levels in these areas were negligible before birth, became maximal between the second and third week of postnatal life and decreased moderately thereafter. The concentration of NGF protein, measured by a two-site enzyme immunoassay, was 3 times higher in the POA than in the MBH at an infantile age (day 12), increasing 2-fold in the POA of juvenile animals (day 28) but not in the MBH. This developmental pattern was similar to that seen in the Hc, though the NGF concentrations were significantly lower in the POA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
