     "AB": "Many brain modifications have been described in ageing: cognitive functions, learning ability and memory retention decline very frequently. It is not clear whether the observed deficits are related to alterations in memory processes (short- or long-term memory), in memory modulation or in nonassociative factors. We tried to correlate the morphological neurophysiological and neurochemical changes in aged brain with the decline in learning behaviour. Psychopharmacology of ageing is developing quickly, but presently no data are completely convincing, even though prospects are interesting.",
