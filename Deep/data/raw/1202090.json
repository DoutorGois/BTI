     "AB": "Rats implanted with electrodes in the dorsal or ventral hippocampus received posttrial stimulation in training sessions with footshock reinforcement. Afterdischarges without overt seizures were consistently without effect on the rate of acquisition of suppression of licking during an auditory conditioned stimulus (CS), although conditioning was retarded by the delivery of distracting stimuli following footshock. The rate of conditioning remained insensitive to elicitation of dorsal hippocampal afterdischarges (DHAD) despite subsequent alterations of session length, intertrial interval and preexposure to the CS. However, faster extinction of suppression occurred following DHAD, suggesting a limited but essential role of the hippocampus in addressing stored information.",
