     "AB": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: A growing body of literature supports the concept that antiaging herbs may be potential candidates for use in treating age-related neurodegeneration, including Alzheimers disease (AD). Mori Fructus is a well-known traditional herbal medicine, food, and dietary supplement. This study employed models of amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced AD to investigate the protective effects of Mori Fructus ethanol extract (ME) against age-related disease and cognitive deficits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To examine the protective effect of ME, we measured cell viability, cytotoxicity, and survival in rat primary hippocampal cultures. We performed behavioral tests and histological analysis in mouse models of AD induced by Abeta(25-35) toxicity. To investigate the mechanism underlying the protective effect, we performed western blotting using antibodies against apoptotic markers as well as the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), and tau. We also measured apoptotic marker fluorescence intensity. RESULTS: ME significantly attenuated Abeta-induced cell damage, enhanced Akt and GSK-3beta phosphorylation, and reduced tau phosphorylation. ME reduced apoptotic markers that were activated by GSK-3beta, and reduced reactive oxygen species production. Further, ME decreased the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-associated X expression ratio, mitochondria depolarization, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and caspase-3 activation. We confirmed that ME treatment improved cognitive impairment and neuronal cell death induced by Abeta(25-35) toxicity in the mouse hippocampus via its antiapoptotic activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ME protects cognition and neurons in AD-like models induced by Abeta via reduction of tau phosphorylation and apoptosis through GSK-3beta inactivation.",
