     "AB": "New neurons are continually produced after birth from neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Recent studies have reported that fatty acid binding protein 7 (Fabp7/brain lipid binding protein (BLBP)) is required for the maintenance of embryonic NSCs/NPCs and have identified an association between the Fabp7 gene and behavioral paradigms that correlate with hippocampal functions. However, the specific roles of Fabps in postnatal neurogenesis remain unknown. Herein, we demonstrate the effects of Fabp7, and another Fabp, Fabp5, on postnatal neurogenesis. Fabp7 and Fabp5 were detected in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the DG, and Fabp7+ cells were less differentiated than Fabp5+ cells. We analyzed the differentiation state of NSCs/NPCs in the SGZ of 4-week-old (4w) Fabp7 knockout (7KO), Fabp5 KO (5KO), and Fabp7/Fabp5 double KO (7/5KO) mice and found that the number of NSCs/NPCs was dramatically reduced compared with wild-type mice. Although the uptake of BrdU 1 day after injection was decreased in all KO mice, the survival of BrdU+ cells 1 month after injection was increased in the 7/5KO mice compared to other three genotypes. We also observed an enhancement of neuronal differentiation in all Fabp KO mice. In addition, the proliferation and survival of NSCs/NPCs differed along the anterior-posterior axis (A-P axis). A greater number of newborn cells in the posterior region became extinct, but this tendency was not apparent in the Fabps KO mice. These data suggest that Fabp7 and Fabp5 have differential roles for proliferation and survival of the NSCs/NPCs during postnatal DG neurogenesis.",
