     "AB": "The distribution and time course of changes of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d) positivity were studied in immature rats (12 and 25 days old) surviving motor status epilepticus (SE) induced by a high dose of pilocarpine. Motor SE characterized by continuous convulsions was interrupted after 2 h by an injection of clonazepam (0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg in 12- and 25-day-old rats, respectively) in order to reduce mortality. Correlation between electroencephalographic and behavioral seizure activity was confirmed using animals with electrodes implanted bilaterally in the hippocampus and sensorimotor cortex. Brains were examined 2, 6, 13, and 21 days after motor SE using NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry. Two types of changes were found in both age groups: (a) decrease of NADPH-d positivity occurred in both neuropil and cell bodies in piriform, periamygdalar, and entorhinal cortices; and (b) NADPH-d positivity was induced in the cell bodies in the hippocampal fields CA1/2, CA3, and dentate gyrus. These changes were more intense in animals surviving SE at postnatal day 25 than in younger age group, and they peaked 2 days after SE. The changes observed after SE disappeared quickly in 12-day-old rat pups, where only moderate changes could be observed in piriform, periamygdalar, and entorhinal cortices 6 days after SE, whereas the changes in the histochemical positivity persisted in older animals even 21 days after SE.",
