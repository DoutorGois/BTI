     "AB": "CHT1 is a Na(+)- and Cl(-)-dependent, hemicholinium-3 (HC-3)-sensitive, high affinity choline transporter. Par-4 (prostate apoptosis response-4) is a leucine zipper protein involved in neuronal degeneration and cholinergic signaling in Alzheimer's disease. We now report that Par-4 is a negative regulator of CHT1 choline uptake activity. Transfection of neural IMR-32 cells with human CHT1 conferred Na(+)-dependent, HC-3-sensitive choline uptake that was effectively inhibited by cotransfection of Par-4. Mapping studies indicated that the C-terminal half of Par-4 was physically involved in interacting with CHT1, and the absence of Par-4.CHT1 complex formation precluded the loss of CHT1-mediated choline uptake induced by Par-4, indicating that Par-4.CHT1 complex formation is essential. Kinetic and cell-surface biotinylation assays showed that Par-4 inhibited CHT1-mediated choline uptake by reducing CHT1 expression in the plasma membrane without significantly altering the affinity of CHT1 for choline or HC-3. These results suggest that Par-4 is directly involved in regulating choline uptake by interacting with CHT1 and by reducing its incorporation on the cell surface.",
