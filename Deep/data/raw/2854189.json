     "AB": "To examine the effects of TET on the electrophysiology of area CA1 of hippocampus, hippocampal slices were obtained from adult hooded rats and were maintained in vitro using standard techniques. Stimulating and recording electrodes were placed in the Schaffer collaterals and CA1 pyramidal cell body layer, respectively. Following baseline measurements, slices were exposed to either 0, 1, 3, 6, or 10 microM TET in the incubating medium. Both pyramidal cell excitability and recurrent/feedforward inhibition were suppressed in a dose-dependent manner within 3 hr postexposure. The evoked population spike and population excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) were suppressed significantly by 2 hr postexposure for 1 and 3 microM TET exposures, and by 45 min postexposure for 6 and 10 microM exposures. A similar dose-dependency was observed for the suppression of recurrent/feedforward inhibition in hippocampal CA1. A second procedure tested the specificity of TET effects to axonal conduction of Schaffer collaterals. Both the stimulating and recording electrode were placed in the Schaffer collaterals so that both the Schaffer collateral population fiber volley and the CA1 pyramidal cell population EPSP could be recorded. TET exposure suppressed pyramidal cell EPSPs without significantly affecting the amplitude of Schaffer collateral fiber volleys. The results support the view that acute TET exposure suppresses synaptic transmission in area CA1 of hippocampus.",
