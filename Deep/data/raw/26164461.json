     "AB": "Lamotrigine (LTG) has shown benefits in animal models of cerebral ischemia, but the mechanism involved was not fully studied. This study was carried out to examine the effects of LTG on cognitive dysfunction, beta-amyloid1-42 accumulation, and tau protein hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus of ischemic rats. Transient ischemic stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate the cognitive function of rats. We found that LTG significantly attenuated ischemia-induced cognitive deficits and decreased neuronal injury in the hippocampal CA1 zone. Moreover, LTG reduced beta-amyloid1-42 and phosphorylated tau (AT8) in the hippocampus after ischemia. These results suggested that the cognition-protective effects of LTG after cerebral ischemia might involve inhibition of toxic beta-amyloid accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus.",
