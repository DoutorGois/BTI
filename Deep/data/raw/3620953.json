     "AB": "Changes in glucose uptake in the gerbil hippocampus were studied by high-resolution [3H]2-deoxyglucose radioautography under sham and postischemic conditions. Sections of dorsal hippocampi were fixed by chemical fixatives or rapid-freezing and freeze-substitution techniques. Light and electron microscope radioautograms showed that the cell soma of each CA1 neuron subjected to transient ischemia revealed various degrees of glucose uptake. In the neuropil of the CA1 stratum radiatum, glucose uptake was higher in the thin dendrites of the ischemic group. Cell damage due to transsynaptic stimulation is suggested by these results.",
