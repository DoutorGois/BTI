     "AB": "The effects of fish oil supplementation on motor disorders, memory dysfunction, and lipid peroxidation (LP) induced by typical neuroleptics were studied. Wistar rats received a suspension prepared with fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids, water, and Tween 80 (1%) in the place of drinking water (FO group) or vehicle (C group) for 8 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, half of the animals of both groups were treated with haloperidol (H and FO + H groups; experiment 1), fluphenazine (F and FO + F groups; experiment 2), or vehicle (C group), administered once a week (12 mg/kg/im) for 4 weeks, maintaining the treatment with FO. Extrapyramidal motor disorders by haloperidol and fluphenazine were observed by an increase in vacuous chewing movements and catalepsy (P < 0.05). These effects were reduced by FO treatment (P < 0.05). Both neuroleptics displayed impairment in memory retention observed by latency time to find the original location of platform in water-maze task, after 4 days of training performed in the last treatment week. This effect was reduced by FO (P < 0.05) to both haloperidol and fluphenazine treatments. Haloperidol increased the LP in plasma and hippocampus, and these effects were decreased by FO treatment (P < 0.05). Fluphenazine increased the LP in plasma and substantia nigra, which were completely decreased by FO treatment (P < 0.05). The FO decreased the motor disorders, memory dysfunction, and oxidative damage typical neuroleptic-induced. Our results indicate that FO exhibits a neuroprotector role useful on diseases related to oxidative damages, and may be considered in the prevention of motor and memory side effects induced by the antipsychotic treatment.",
