     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of hemorrhage on cell apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region of rats under controlled hypotension (CH). METHODS: A total of 36 Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: Group C (with no CH) and Group H (with CH). According to different ratios of blood loss to total blood volume, Group C and Group H were redivided into 6 subgroups (6 in each group): C1,H1 (10%); C2, H2 (20%); C3, H3 (30%). Induced by sodium nitroprusside and esmolol, the mean material pressure in Group H was decreased to 50~55 mmHg and kept for 10 minutes, and then blood loss was started, keeping the pump speed. Without CH, the same style of hemorrhage was performed in Group C. The material pressure was increased 60 minutes later after the hemorrhage. Expression of bcl-2 and caspase-3 protein was detected by immunohistochemical method, and apoptosis cells were detected by TUNEL staining. RESULTS: The average optical density of bcl-2 and caspase-3 was higher in Group H3 than that in Group C3 (P<0.05). There were more apoptosis cells examined by TUNEL in Group H3 than in Group C3 (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Thirty percent blood loss under controlled hypotension can induce cell apoptosis in hippocampal CA1 region in rats.",
