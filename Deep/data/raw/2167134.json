     "AB": "The intracellular recording of CA1 neurons in mouse hippocampal slice preparation was used to study the properties of depolarizing responses to iontophoretically applied GABA to their apical dendrites. Reversal potential of depolarizing responses was dependent on parameters of injecting current. It was about -60 mV and - (45-55) mV when iontophoretic currents 40-60 nA and 8-20 nA were used respectively. Application of tetrodotoxin (0.1-0.5 microM) resulted in decrease in amplitude of depolarizing responses evoked by weak currents, increase in slope of plot, reflecting relationship between response amplitude and membrane potential, and hyperpolarizing shift of reversal potential. Blocking++ of synaptic transmission with low calcium solution did not produce such changes. These results suggest that GABA depolarizing responses have a potential-sensitive component due to activation of sodium channels.",
