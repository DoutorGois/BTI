     "AB": "Substantial experimental evidence indicates a major role for the circadian system in mood disorders. Additionally, proinflammatory cytokines have been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of depression. However, the molecular elements determining the functional interplay between these two systems in depression have not been described as yet. Here we investigate whether long-term light deprivation in the constant darkness (DD) paradigm affects depression-like behavior in mice and concomitantly modulates the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. We find that after 4 weeks of DD, mice display depression-like behavior, which is paralleled by reduced hippocampal cell proliferation. This chronobiologically induced depressive state is associated with elevated levels of plasma IL-6 (interleukin-6) and IL-6 and Il1-R1 (interleukin 1 receptor, type I) protein levels in the hippocampus and also alters hippocampal protein levels of the clock genes per2 and npas2. Using pharmacological blockers of the NF-kappaB pathway, we provide evidence that the effects of DD on depression-like behavior, on hippocampal cell proliferation, on altered expressional levels of brain and plasma IL-6, and on the modulation of clock gene expression are mediated through NF-kappaB signaling. Moreover, NF-kappaB activity is enhanced in hippocampal tissue of DD mice. Mice with a deletion of IL-6, one of the target genes of NF-kappaB, are resistant to DD-induced depression-like behavior, which suggests a pivotal role for this cytokine in the constant darkness mouse model of depression. We here first describe some of the molecular elements bridging chronobiological and inflammatory processes in the constant darkness mouse model of depression.",
