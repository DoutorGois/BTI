     "AB": "Mutations that alter signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a well established regulator of neuronal protein synthesis, have been linked to autism and cognitive dysfunction. Although previous studies have established a role for mTORC1 as necessary for enduring changes in postsynaptic function, here we demonstrate that dendritic mTORC1 activation in rat hippocampal neurons also drives a retrograde signaling mechanism promoting enhanced neurotransmitter release from apposed presynaptic terminals. This novel mode of synaptic regulation conferred by dendritic mTORC1 is locally implemented, requires downstream synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor as a retrograde messenger, and is engaged in an activity-dependent fashion to support homeostatic trans-synaptic control of presynaptic function. Our findings thus reveal that mTORC1-dependent translation in dendrites subserves a unique mode of synaptic regulation, highlighting an alternative regulatory pathway that could contribute to the social and cognitive dysfunction that accompanies dysregulated mTORC1 signaling.",
