To evaluate the optimal parameters for efficient gene delivery of defective herpes simplex virus type one (HSV-1) vectors into a specific brain region, an HSV-1 vector expressing E. coli beta-galactosidase was used to infect organotypic cultures of hippocampal slices. beta-Galactosidase was expressed as early as 2 h after infection in a dose-dependent manner as measured on immunoblots, and reached a maximum level after approximately 35 h. Expression of the RNA and the antigen was still evident after the longest time sampled (11-12 days), whereas no beta-galactosidase was ever detected in cultured slices infected with a control virus lacking the reporter gene. Hippocampal cells expressing the reporter gene outlined the contour of the neuronal cell body layers in fields CA3 and dentate gyrus; such correspondence was less evident in field CA1. Anatomical, morphological, and immunohistochemical criteria also confirmed that the majority of these infected cells were neurons. beta-Galactosidase was also detected in the somata and processes of infected interneurons. Tests for synaptic pathology associated with virus infection showed no changes in pre- and postsynaptic markers.",
