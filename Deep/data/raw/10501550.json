     "AB": "In order to assess effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in the brain excluding the hypothalamus, the effects of GLP-1 (7-36) amide, a naturally produced active fragment, on the electroencephalogram and hippocampal single unit activities of anesthetized male Wistar rats were examined. I.c.v. injection of GLP-1 (7-36) amide decreased the hippocampal theta wave duration. Juxtacellular administration of GLP-1 (7-36) amide first increased and then decreased single unit activities recorded in the hippocampal CA1, which effects were antagonized by exendin (9-39) amide, a GLP-1 receptor antagonist, or 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, a non-NMDA type glutamate receptor antagonist. These results indicate that GLP-1 receptors exist in the hippocampus and are involved in modulating hippocampal activity through an increase in the release of excitatory amino acid transmitters.",
