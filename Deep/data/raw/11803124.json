     "AB": "The effects of the certified food dye Fast Green FCF (Food Green 3) on miniature synaptic events in whole-cell voltage clamped hippocampal interneurons were examined. Fast Green FCF reduced the frequency, but did not affect the amplitude or kinetics, of miniature synaptic events in a dose-dependent manner. At 1 mg/ml (1.2 mM), the frequency was reduced to 21% of control. The half-maximum effective concentration was estimated to be 200 microg/ml (250 microM). In contrast, the dye Phenol Red neither affected frequency, amplitude nor kinetics of synaptic events. The results suggest that Fast Green FCF acts at a presynaptic locus, thereby inhibiting the release of neurotransmitter.",
