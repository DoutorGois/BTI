     "AB": "The effects of ATP, cytochrome C, meclofenoxate and CDP-choline on the central nervous system were studied electrophysiologically in rabbits. The threshold of arousal reaction and evoked muscular discharges following stimulation of the brainstem reticular formation, evoked muscular discharges in the fore- and hindlimbs on stimulation of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, afferent average evoked potential due to stimulation of the sciatic nerve and unit discharges of nerve cells in the brainstem reticular formation were examined. The results indicate that ATP facilitated the sensory system, cytochrome C facilitated the motor system and meclofenoxate and CDP-choline acted on both systems, but meclofenoxate had activity more like ATP, and CDP-choline had activity more closely allied to that of cytochrome C.",
