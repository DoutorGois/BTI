     "AB": "The distribution throughout the normal human brain of the dopamine D2-family of receptors were investigated autoradiographically. Three ligands were used, [3H]-YM-09151-2 to define the D2, D3, D4 receptors; [3H]raclopride the D2 D3 receptors; and [3H](+)-7-OH-DPAT, in the presence of GTP, demonstrates D3 distribution. [3H]-YM-09151-2 and [3H]raclopride binding were highest in caudate (121 vs 130 fmol mg(-1)), putamen (96 vs 136 fmol mg(-1)), and nucleus accumbens (113 vs 120 fmol mg(-1)). [3H]-YM-09151-2 also displayed significant binding in several cortical areas (56-39 fmol mg(-1)) and hippocampus (27 fmol mg-1). [3H](+)-7-OH-DPAT was highest in the nucleus accumbens. Based upon the ligands properties it is inferred that D2 distribution is highest in putamen, caudate and nucleus accumbens; D3 in the nucleus accumbens; D4 receptor in cortical areas and hippocampus.",
