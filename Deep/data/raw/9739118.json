     "AB": "Using various antibodies to the amyloid ss precursor protein (APP) associated with Alzheimer's disease, we investigated changes in the distribution of APP in the hippocampus and neocortex of adrenalectomized (ADX) rats. In contrast to sham-operated controls, ADX rats euthanised after a survival period of 5 months showed striking APP reactivity in the CA1-CA4 fields and in the surviving cells in the dentate gyrus. Our results suggest the enhanced APP reactivity in hippocampal neurons may pertain to previous observations on the accumulation of APP fragments in the neocortex during ischemic or traumatic injury. Thus, long-term hormone deprivation would be another factor, which may influence the expression of APP in brain.",
