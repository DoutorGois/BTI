     "AB": "In the present study, effects of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF, 0.5-2.5 ng/ml) on synaptic transmission were investigated in rat hippocampal slices. Stimulation was applied to Schaffer collateral/commissural afferents and evoked spikes were recorded in CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Continuous perfusion of slices with aFGF slightly decreased the basal amplitude of the spikes and significantly increased the paired-pulse facilitation. When brief tetanic stimulation (7 impulses at 100 Hz) was applied 30 min after the perfusion of aFGF, aFGF-treated slices enhanced the magnitude of short-term potentiation after the tetanus and facilitated the generation of long-term potentiation. aFGF also enhanced post-tetanic potentiation directly after the tetanus. These effects of aFGF were dose-dependent. The enhancement of short-term potentiation and facilitation of the generation of long-term potentiation were not evident when aFGF was applied with or 10 min after the tetanus. The results suggest that aFGF is implicated in modulation of synaptic efficacy and can activate some mechanisms related to the generation of long-term potentiation.",
