     "AB": "Aging is the accumulation of diverse deleterious changes in the cells and tissues leading to increased risk of diseases. Oxidative stress is considered as a major risk factor and contributes to age related increase in DNA oxidation and DNA protein cross-links in central nervous system during aging. In the present study, we have evaluated the salubrious role of grape seed extract on accumulation of oxidative DNA damage products such as 8-OHdG and DNA protein cross-links in aged rats. Male albino rats of Wistar strain were divided into four groups: Group I, young control rats; Group II, young rats treated with grape seed extract (100 mg/kg b.wt.) for 30 days; Group III, aged control rats; Group IV, aged rats supplemented with grape seed extract (100 mg/kg b.wt.) for 30 days. Our results, thus, revealed that grape seed extract has inhibiting effect on the accumulation of age-related oxidative DNA damages in spinal cord and in various brain regions such as cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus.",
