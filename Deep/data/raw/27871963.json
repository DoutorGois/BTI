     "AB": "Nanomedicine offers a promising tool for therapies of brain diseases, but they may be associated with potential adverse effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the uptake of silica-nanoparticles engineered for laser-tissue soldering in the brain using SH-SY5Y cells, dissociated and organotypic slice cultures from rat hippocampus. Nanoparticles were predominantly taken up by microglial cells in the hippocampal cultures but nanoparticles were also found in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. The uptake was time- and concentration-dependent in primary hippocampal cells. Transmission electron microscopy experiments demonstrated nanoparticle aggregates and single particles in the cytoplasm. Nanoparticles were found in the endoplasmic reticulum, but not in other cellular compartments. Nanoparticle exposure did not impair cell viability and neuroinflammation in primary hippocampal cultures at all times investigated. Neurite outgrowth was not significantly altered in SH-SY5Y cells, but the neuronal differentiation markers indicated a reduction in neuronal differentiation induction after nanoparticle exposure.",
