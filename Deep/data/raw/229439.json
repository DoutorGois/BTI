     "AB": "The distribution of a high affinity enkephalin-dipeptidylcarboxypeptidase between regions of mouse brain is markedly heterogenous and parallels that of opiate receptors. Furthermore intrastriatal administration of kainic acid as well as interruption of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lead to similar decreases in this peptidase activity and in the number of opiate receptors. On the contrary, no correlation was found between low affinity enkephalin degrading enzymes and opiate receptors.",
