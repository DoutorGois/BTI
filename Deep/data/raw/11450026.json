     "AB": "To clarify the mechanism of ischemic tolerance induced by HBO, we investigated the effect of HBO on immunoreactivity to Bcl-2 and Bax, apoptosis-regulating protein, or Mn-SOD, a radical scavenging system, in the CA1 sector of the gerbil hippocampus. Pretreatment comprising, five sessions at 2 ATA (atmosphere absolute) every other day, but not that comprising, ten sessions at 3 ATA every day, caused significant increases in Bcl-2 and Mn-SOD immunoreactivity in the CA1 sector compared with in the sham pretreatment group. No significant differences in Bax immunoreactivity and neuronal density in the CA1 hippocampal neurons was observed between the groups. These results suggest that protection against mitochondrial alterations after ischemia through Mn-SOD and/or Bcl-2 expression is related to the ischemic tolerance induced by repeated HBO pre-treatment.",
