     "AB": "In the present study astrocytes reactivity during cerebral post-ischemic reperfusion was evaluated immunocytochemically by using antibodies to vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S-100 protein. At the 7th day of post-ischemic reperfusion few GFAP-positive cells were observed in the hippocampus and cerebellum, the number of GFAP-positive cells increased slightly after 20 days of reperfusion. This poor GFAP-positivity may be due to the inhibition of GFAP polymerization by S-100; in fact, S-100 immuno-reactivity was already evident from the 7th day. Vimentin immuno-staining was evident both at the 7th and 20th day of reperfusion in microglial cells and in oligodendrocytes, suggesting that these cells are involved in the recovery of neurons following brain injury.",
