     "AB": "The presence of iron in brain tissue in increased concentrations in Parkinson's disease cases, where it might be responsible for oxidative stress, and the parallel observation that the iron transporter lactoferrin (Lf) was present in increased amounts in surviving neurons, led us to study the synthesis of Lf in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. In this context, the origin and expression of brain Lf in normal, aged and MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-treated mice were investigated. Lf immunostaining was observed mainly on microvessels in the cerebral cortex of the adult mice and to a greater extent in older mice. Lf immunoreactivity was also present in the hippocampus only in the aged mouse brains, associated with structures which seemed to be pyramidal neurons and fibers. After RT-PCR (polymerase chain reaction), Lf transcripts were found in mouse brain tissue whatever the age of the animals studied but the level of their expression was very low. No up-regulation of Lf was detectable during aging. Lf distribution and expression in the MPTP-induced Parkinsonian mouse model were also investigated. A marked depletion of dopamine (DA) occurred in the high dose MPTP-treated mice. The level of Lf expression was found to be markedly increased in the same animals and this up-regulation occurred on the first day after MPTP administration. When the brain was stressed by the neurotoxin MPTP, Lf expression increased in line with antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, which may permit the protection of brain tissue from oxidative damage induced by the drug.",
