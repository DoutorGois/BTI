     "AB": "The purpose of this study is to provide a point of reference regarding the neurotoxic effects resulting from exposure to environmental contaminants. Benzo(a)pyrene is a member of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) family and it is a by-product of combustion processes. Thus, persons living near factories or hazardous waste sites face the danger of exposure through contact with contaminated air, water and soil. In an effort to understand the impact of environmental contaminants, we have investigated the effects of gestational B(a)P aerosol exposure on long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular correlate of learning and memory in the F1 generation. Briefly, timed-pregnant rats were exposed to B(a)P via nose-only inhalation on gestation days 11-21 for 4 hr per day. Dams were maintained to term and pups were weaned on postnatal day 30. Subsequent electrophysiological studies during postnatal days 60-70 revealed a diminution in LTP across the perforant path-granular cells synapses in the hippocampus of F1 generation animals that were transplacentally exposed to B(a)P aerosol relative to unexposed controls. Additionally, NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1) protein was found to be downregulated in the hippocampus of B(a)P exposed F1 generation animals. Taken together, our results suggest that gestational exposure to B(a)P aerosol attenuates the capacity for LTP in the F1 generation.",
