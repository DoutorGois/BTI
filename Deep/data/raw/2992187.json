     "AB": "The chronic emotional pain stress resulting in a development of neurosis-like state in rats induced an increase of arterial pressure and change of the cardiac rate dynamics under the conditions of functional load. An increase of cardiac mass was also seen without change of masses of the thymus, adrenal glands and the spleen. The rise of activity of cytochromeoxidase and activation of peroxide lipide oxidation (by malonate dialdehyde level) were observed in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus of neurotized rats. Injection of antioxidant F-801 before each emotional pain stress trial prevented vegetative disturbances, cardiac hypertrophy, and increase of oxidative activity in the brain. The role of peroxide lipide oxidation and that of the factor of hypoxia in development of disturbances caused by neurotization were discussed.",
