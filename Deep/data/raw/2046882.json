     "AB": "Soluflazine, a potent adenosine transport inhibitor, was intracerebroventricularly administered to rats via ALZET mini osmotic pumps (4nmole, 0.5 L/hr) for 14 days and the effect on adenosine receptors was determined in specific brain areas. Soluflazine decreased adenosine A1 radioligand binding in the hippocampus as measured by [3H]R-PIA, and lowered adenosine A2 binding sites in the striatum, as estimated by the \"NECA minus R-PIA\" assay. Previous work from our lab has shown the ability of diazepam and triazolam to decrease adenosine binding in the same brain areas. The data show that a specific adenosine transport inhibitor produces the same effect on adenosine receptors as benzodiazepines, and suggest a role for adenosine in the CNS effects of benzodiazepines.",
