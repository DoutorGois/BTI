     "AB": "This study aimed to report hippocampal dose from single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for 4 to 10 brain metastases and determine feasibility of hippocampal-sparing SRS. Patients with 4 to 10 brain metastases receiving single-isocenter, multi-target single-fraction SRS were identified. Hippocampi were contoured using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0933 atlas. RTOG 0933 dose constraints were converted to a biologically effective dose using an alpha/beta of 2 (D100 421 cGy, Dmax 665 cGy). Number of metastases, total target volume, prescribed dose, and distance of nearest metastasis (dmin) were analyzed as risk factors for exceeding hippocampal constraints. If hippocampi exceeded constraints, the SRS plan was re-optimized. Key dosimetric parameters were compared between original and re-optimized plans. To determine if a single target can exceed constraints, all targets but the closest metastasis were removed from the plan, and dosimetry was compared. Forty plans were identified. Fifteen hippocampi (19%) exceeded constraints in 12 SRS plans. Hippocampal sparing was achieved in 10 of 12 replanned cases (83%). Risk factors associated with exceeding hippocampal constraints were decreasing dmin (24.0 vs 8.0 mm, p = 0.002; odds ratio [OR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.26) and total target volume (5.46 cm(3)vs 1.98 cm(3), p = 0.03; OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.32). There was no difference in exceeding constraints for 4 to 5 vs 6 to 10 metastases (27% vs 21%, p = 0.409) or prescribed dose (18 Gy, p = 0.58). For re-optimized plans, there were no significant differences in planning target volume (PTV) coverage (99.6% vs 99.0%, p = 0.17) or conformality index (1.47 vs 1.4, p = 0.78). Six (50%) plans exceeded constraints with a single target. A substantial minority of hippocampi receive high radiation dose from SRS for 4 to 10 brain metastases. Decreasing distance of the closest metastasis and total target volume are associated with exceeding hippocampal constraints. Re-optimizing these plans yielded hippocampal-sparing SRS plans with acceptable dosimetry. Prospective evaluation of the impact of hippocampal dose from SRS on neurocognition merits consideration.",
