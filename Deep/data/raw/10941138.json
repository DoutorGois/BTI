     "AB": "The probes to detect vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) in vivo are important to evaluate the mapping and function in cholinergic system. To develop high-specific and high-affinity radiotracer for single photon emission computed tomography, we investigated piperazine analogs which replaced the piperidine ring of (-)-vesamicol with a piperazine ring. We found that the piperazine analog of iodobenzovesamicol, trans-5-iodo-2-hydroxy-3-[4-phenylpiperazinyl] tetralin (DRC140), had high affinity for VAChT in rat brain. We carried out binding assay in subcellular fraction of the rat brain. The highest B(max) for [(125)I]-DRC140 binding was observed in the synaptic vesicle fraction (1,751 fmol/mg protein), followed by the crude vesicle (821 fmol/mg protein) and the P2 fraction (187 fmol/mg protein). These K(d) values were similar to the affinity of highly purified synaptic vesicular fraction (K(d) = 0.3 nM) with a one-site model. The possibility that [(125)I]-DRC140 recognizes sigma receptor was excluded by our finding large inhibition constants (K(i) = 849 nM for haloperidol, K(i) = 3,052 nM for 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine). In vivo distribution studies with the [(123)I]-DRC140 in rats showed a rapid brain uptake. The highest brain area was in striatum, followed by frontal cortex, occipital cortex, and hippocampus. The lowest brain area was cerebellum. The radioactivity of high-accumulated areas in ex vivo autoradiography was reduced by a preinjection of (-)-vesamicol and these levels were reduced to the radioactivity in cerebellum. These results show that [(125)I]-DRC140 can provide extremely high specific tracer with excellent brain permeability as a ligand for single photon emission computed tomography.",
