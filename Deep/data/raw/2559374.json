Dendritic mitochondria containing Ca deposits were found in a narrow band of stratum radiatum 280-350 microns distant from stratum pyramidale. Axonal mitochondria containing Ca deposits were evenly distributed in stratum radiatum. The total number of calcium containing-mitochondria was highest in long-term potentiated slices, and less in slices treated with APV; the lowest values were obtained with low-frequency stimulation.",
