     "AB": "Fear memory is a motivational system essential for organisms survival having a central role in organization of defensive behaviors to threat. In the last years there has been a growing interest on conditioned fear memory reconsolidation and extinction, two specific phases of memorization process, both induced by memory retrieval. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these two mnemonic processes may allow to work out therapeutic interventions for treatment of human fear and anxiety disorders, such as specific phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. Based on the use of one-trial conditioning paradigms, which allow to follow the evolution of a mnemonic trace in its various phases, the present paper has attempted to reorganize the current literature relative to the rodents highlighting both the role of several brain structures in conditioned fear memory reconsolidation and extinction and the selective cellular processes involved. A crucial role seems to be play by medial prefrontal cortex, in particular by prelimbic and infralimbic cortices, and by distinct connections between them and the amygdala, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.",
