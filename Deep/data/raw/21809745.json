     "AB": "This paper is taken from a presentation one of us (EN) had hoped to give at the 2010 ASET Annual Conference. In it EN provides evidence that in true Alzheimer dementia (AD), memory loss is the initially dominating problem due to deterioration of the circulation in the hippocampus, which has a vulnerable blood supply to begin with. Brain pathology is likely to be secondary. Could this situation be prevented, or even reversed, with simple techniques like \"head-down therapy\"? What was planned to be an oral presentation by EN could not materialize because of his illness. Thanks to Janet Ghigo's invaluable assistance, our efforts have resulted in this joint presentation. The paper is presented in the conversational style Dr. Niedermeyer would have used in his oral presentation. This style reminds AJET readers of both Dr. Niedermeyer's unquenchable curiosity and his infectious enthusiasm about all research.",
