     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Extrasynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors that contain the delta subunit (deltaGABAA receptors) are highly expressed in the dentate gyrus (DG) subfield of the hippocampus, where they generate a tonic conductance that regulates neuronal activity. GABAA receptor-dependent signaling regulates memory and also facilitates postnatal neurogenesis in the adult DG; however, the role of the deltaGABAA receptors in these processes is unclear. Accordingly, we sought to determine whether deltaGABAA receptors regulate memory behaviors, as well as neurogenesis in the DG. METHODS: Memory and neurogenesis were studied in wild-type (WT) mice and transgenic mice that lacked deltaGABAA receptors (Gabrd(-/-)). To pharmacologically increase deltaGABAA receptor activity, mice were treated with the deltaGABAA receptor-preferring agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol (THIP). Behavioral assays including recognition memory, contextual discrimination, and fear extinction were used. Neurogenesis was studied by measuring the proliferation, survival, migration, maturation, and dendritic complexity of adult-born neurons in the DG. RESULTS: Gabrd(-/-) mice exhibited impaired recognition memory and contextual discrimination relative to WT mice. Fear extinction was also impaired in Gabrd(-/-) mice, although the acquisition of fear memory was enhanced. Neurogenesis was disrupted in Gabrd(-/-) mice as the migration, maturation, and dendritic development of adult-born neurons were impaired. Long-term treatment with THIP facilitated learning and neurogenesis in WT but not Gabrd(-/-) mice. INTERPRETATION: deltaGABAA receptors promote the performance of certain DG-dependent memory behaviors and facilitate neurogenesis. Furthermore, deltaGABAA receptors can be pharmacologically targeted to enhance these processes.",
