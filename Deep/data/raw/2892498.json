     "AB": "A striking strain dependency in response of central neuromediators (dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine activities and somatostatin) to various periods of alcohol treatment has been noted in striatum and hippocampus in mice. For biogenic amines the C57Bl strain loses tolerance to prolonged alcohol injury earlier than the Balb/c strain. At the opposite the Balb/c strain exhibits a remarkable long lasting tolerance for cholinergic activity. The unequal capacity to adapt, also appears to depend on the nervous structure and the neurotransmitter considered. Such discrepancies may underly differences in behavioral changes observed in alcoholics.",
