     "AB": "The effect of chronic ethanol consumption on the catalytic activity of protein kinase C isolated from rat brain was studied in two different ways. Enzyme activity was first measured by phosphorylation of Histone IIIS in vitro. There was no change in the activity of the cytosolic enzyme. Membrane-associated enzyme activity was reduced in the ethanol-treated animal. This difference was not evident if the enzyme was stimulated by arachidonate. The reduction in enzyme activity was confirmed by analysis of the phosphorylation of endogenous substrates in intact synaptosomes. When the binding of the ligand [3H]phorbol dibutyrate was measured by quantitative autoradiography, increased binding to membrane-associated protein kinase C was observed in the CA1 region of the hippocampus but not in other brain regions. These results indicate that ethanol treatment results in a general reduction in membrane-associated protein kinase C activity as measured in vitro but the effect may not be consistent in all brain regions. The differential effect in the CA1 region of the hippocampus may be a reflection of a disruption in the normal regulation of protein kinase C activity in this area and may indicate that this region is a sensitive target for the action of ethanol.",
