     "PG": "37-40",
     "AB": "In experiments on male rats the paper investigated the effect of pharmacological prophylaxis with Panpal (pyridostigmine in combination with benactyzine and trihexyphenidyl) on the activity of acetylcholinesterase in the whole blood, diaphragm, and selected parts of the brain (frontal cortex, pontomedular region, hippocampus, cerebellum) at hour 1 and 3 of untreated and treated (oxime HI-6 with atropine) intoxication with the organophosphorous insecticide phosdrine. Whereas in the CNS Panpal did not produce statistically significant changes in the activity of acetylcholinesterase in the course of untreated and treated phosdrine intoxication, in the blood and diaphragm Panpal markedly intensified phosdrine-induced inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase activity and, in addition, decreased the reactivating effect of the oxime HI-6. The data give evidence of the importance of the combination of the prophylactically used reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine with anticholinergics, which could eliminate the consequences of a pyridostigmine-induced decrease in the activity of the enzyme in the periphery.",
