     "AB": "Mutant mice lacking the glutamate receptor subunit delta2 exhibit changes in the structure and function of the cerebellar cortex. The most prominent functional feature is a deficiency in the long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses. These mutant mice exhibit severe impairment during delay eyeblink conditioning but learn normally during trace eyeblink conditioning without the cerebellar LTD, even with a 0 trace interval. We investigated the hippocampal contribution to this cerebellar LTD-independent \"0 trace interval\" learning. The mutant mice whose dorsal hippocampi were aspirated exhibited severe impairment in learning, whereas those that received post-training hippocampal lesions retained the memory. The wild-type mice showed no impairment in either case. These results suggest that the hippocampal component of the eyeblink conditioning task becomes dominant when cerebellar LTD is impaired.",
