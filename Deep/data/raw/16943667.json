     "AB": "Based on recent work demonstrating age-dependent ketogenic neuroprotection after traumatic brain injury (TBI), it was hypothesized that the neuroprotection among early post-weaned animals was related to induced cerebral transport of ketones after injury. Regional changes in monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2) were acutely examined with immunohistochemistry after sham surgery or controlled cortical impact injury among postnatal day 35 and adult rats. Both ages showed elevated MCT2 expression in the ipsilateral cerebral vasculature after TBI. Using Western blotting, MCT2 expression was 80-88% greater in microvessels isolated from postnatal day 35 rats at all time points relative to adults. The increased MCT2 expression was temporally correlated with an age-related increase in cerebral uptake of ketones, when ketones were made available after injury.",
