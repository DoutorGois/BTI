     "AB": "The effect of acute and chronic lithium treatments on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) release and on its regulation by presynaptic 5-HT autoreceptors was studied in [3H]5-HT preloaded superfused rat brain slices. The [3H]5-HT overflow evoked by a 30-s exposure to 65 mM K+ was increased after 3 weeks of ingestion of lithium-containing diet in the three brain areas examined. Acute injection of 4 mEq/kg lithium chloride did not affect 5-HT release. The K+-induced release observed in both control and chronically lithium-treated animals was Ca2+-dependent. Chronic lithium treatment was also found to be associated with a decrease in basal [3H]5-HT overflow in the cortex and hypothalamus but not in hippocampus [corrected]. The Ca2+-independent overflow induced by fenfluramine was also decreased in cortical slices from lithium-treated animals. The sensitivity of the inhibitory 5-HT autoreceptors was assessed by the response to the 5-HT agonist 5-methoxytryptamine. The results indicate a marked reduction in the maximal inhibition of [3H]5-HT release induced by 5-methoxytryptamine in slices obtained from animals which have been treated with lithium for 3 weeks. These data suggest that the functional down regulation of the prejunctional 5-HT sites may be responsible for the increase in K+-stimulated 5-HT overflow in brain slices of animals treated chronically with lithium.",
