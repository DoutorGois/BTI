     "AB": "Pentyl-4-yn-valproic acid (VPA), a cognition-enhancing agent whose mode of action has been attributed to cell adhesion molecule-mediated neuritogenesis, has been shown to enhance hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. Here, we investigated its potential to reverse age-related memory impairment that relates mainly to declarative memory. Aged spatial learning deficits in the water maze paradigm were demonstrated by swim angle analysis, the angle between axes of start-to-platform and start-to-animal position, and latency to reach a submerged platform. Chronic pentyl-4-yn-VPA administration mediated a significant improvement in both search strategy and latency to find the submerged platform in aged animals. Pentyl-4-yn-VPA also facilitated task recall in aged animals as evidenced by increased time in the target quadrant during a probe trial 3 days following the final training session. The action of pentyl-4-yn-VPA on platform latency, search strategy and task recall suggests that this agent may have great benefit in the treatment of age-dependent cognitive decline.",
