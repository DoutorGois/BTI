     "AB": "We show here that transient forebrain ischemia selectively elevates levels of neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) in rat neurons that are resistant to the injurious effects of this treatment. This observation suggests that increasing NAIP levels may confer protection against ischemic cell death. Consistent with this proposal, we demonstrate that two other treatments that increase neuronal NAIP levels, systemic administration of the bacterial alkaloid K252a and intracerebral injection of an adenovirus vector capable of overexpressing NAIP in vivo, reduce ischemic damage in the rat hippocampus. Taken together, these findings suggest that NAIP may play a key role in conferring resistance to ischemic damage and that treatments that elevate neuronal levels of this antiapoptotic protein may have utility in the treatment of stroke.",
