     "AB": "Hippocampus is one of the most vulnerable tissues to glucocorticoid (GC). In the present study, we demonstrate that dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic GC, induces apoptotic cell death in hippocampal progenitor HiB5 cells without any additional insult. Interestingly, expression of 27-kDa heat shock protein (HSP27) was markedly induced by DEX in time- and dose-dependent manners. This induction was dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that DEX-evoked oxidative damage to HiB5 cells is responsible for the HSP27 induction. To evaluate a possible role of HSP27, we generated two mutant HiB5 cell lines, in which expression of HSP27 was inhibited or enhanced by the over-expression of HSP27 cDNA with antisense or sense orientation (AS-HSP27 and S-HSP27, respectively). DEX-induced apoptotic cell population was significantly increased in AS-HSP27 HiB5 cells and evidently decreased in S-HSP27 cells. These results indicate that HSP27 protects hippocampal progenitor cells from GC-induced apoptotic cell death.",
