Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry revealed that while expression of prothrombin and protease nexin-1 did not change significantly in TMT-treated hippocampi, PARs (in particular PAR-1 and to a lesser extent PAR-2 and PAR-3) were upregulated in reactive astrocytes, suggesting their involvement in neurodegeneration and in the consequent response of the nervous tissue.",
