     "AB": "AIM: To simultaneously determine three unconjugated neurosteroids, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) , pregnenolone (PREG), allopregnenolone (AP), from several brain regions of the rat. METHODS: Neurosteroids were isolated separately in a two steps procedure by using ethyl acetate-n-hexane (90:10) as the first step to extract the unconjugated steroids, then the steroid fractions were further purified by SPE. All steroids were derivatized with 2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylphenylhydrazine (2-NFPH) and analyzed by HPLC-MS ( APCI) using selected-ion monitoring. Methyltestosterone was chosen as the internal standard. Results The linear calibration curve of DHEA was obtained in the concentration range of 0.030-2.00 microg x L(-1). The linear calibration curves of PREG and AP were obtained in the concentration range of 0.025-2.00 microg x L(-1). The concentrations of DHEA, PREG and AP in male rat brain regions were (0.70 +/- 0.23), (4.8 +/- 1.9), (1.1 +/- 0.6) ng x g(-1) for frontal cortex, (0.57 +/- 0.28), (6 +/- 3), (0.5 +/- 0.3) ng x g(-1) for hippocampus, (1.5 +/- 1.0), (9 +/- 5), (1.4 +/- 0.9) ng x g(-1) for amygdale, (0.52 +/- 0.14), (7.7 +/- 2.8), (0.5 +/- 0.6) ng x g(-1) for striatum, (2.9 +/- 1.6), (18 +/- 9), (1.6 +/- 1.3) ng x g(-1) for nucleus accumbens, (4.0 +/- 2.0), (27 +/- 12), (0.8 +/- 0.5) ng x g(-1) for pituitary gland, (1.7 +/- 1.2), ( 16 +/- 10), and (0. 8 +/- 0.7) ng x g(-1) for hypothalamus, respectively. CONCLUSION: Good linearity and accuracy were observed for each steroid. The procedure was suitable for measuring concentrations of the unconjugated steroids in rat brain simultaneously.",
