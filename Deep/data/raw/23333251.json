     "AB": "Most studies relating experimental depression and neurogenesis use mainly male rodents subjected to models of chronic stress. The forced swimming test (FST) is a widely utilized model of acute stress, but its effects on the neurogenic process in the hippocampus using females in different endocrine conditions has not been explored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cell proliferation and early-, short- and long-lasting effects of forced swimming (FS) on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in rats in two endocrine conditions: proestrous and ovariectomized. To determine cell proliferation we used the endogenous marker Ki67. Cell survival was established with the thymidine analog, BrdU (75mg/kg, 2/12, i.p.), which was administered before FS to proestrous and ovariectomized rats. FS increased immobility and corticosterone levels in OVX but not in rats in proestrus. In addition, FS did not affect cell proliferation but significantly decreased the number of BrdU-labeled cells at 2h only in OVX-rats, an effect that remained for 3 and 14 days after FS. Data are discussed taking into consideration the relationship between gonadal and adrenal hormones in adult hippocampal neurogenesis in adult females. Our data also support the use of FS as a model for studying neurogenesis.",
