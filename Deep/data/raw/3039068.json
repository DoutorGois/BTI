     "AB": "Two strains of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV) were microinjected into either the hippocampus or cerebellum of two different mouse strains. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed rapid and extensive spread of virus within the hippocampus and certain of its afferent connections. In contrast, only scattered peroxidase positive cells were observed following cerebellar inoculation. Extensive lesions were observed only in animals surviving intrahippocampal inoculations. These results suggest that localization of the pathological process in HSV encephalitis is due in part to a selective vulnerability of telencephalic or limbic structures.",
