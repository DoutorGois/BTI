     "AB": "Cortistatin (CST) is an endogenous neuropeptide characterized by remarkable structural and functional resemblance to somatostatin (SST), both peptides sharing the ability to bind and activate all five SST receptor subtypes. Evidence is also available showing that CST exerts biological activities independently from SST, perhaps via the activation of specific receptors that remain to be fully characterized at present. Here we have investigated the effects of CST on the gene expression and release of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) from rat hypothalamic and hippocampal explants; moreover, we compared the effects of CST with those of SST and octreotide (OCT) in these models. We found that: (i) CST inhibits the expression and release of CRH from rat hypothalamic and hippocampal explants under basal conditions as well as after CRH stimulation by well known secretagogues; (ii) SST does not modify basal CRH secretion from the hypothalamus or the hippocampus, while it is able to reduce KCl-stimulated CRH release from both brain areas; (iii) OCT inhibits both basal and KCl-induced CRH secretion from rat hypothalamic explants, while it has no effect on CRH release from the hippocampus, either under basal conditions or after stimulation by high K(+) concentrations; (iv) at variance with CST; SST and OCT have not effect whatsoever on veratridine-induced CRH release from the hypothalamus. In conclusion the present findings provide in vitro evidence in support of the hypothesis that CST plays a role in the regulation of endocrine adaptive responses to stress.",
