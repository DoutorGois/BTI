     "AB": "Nitric oxide has been postulated as a retrograde intercellular messenger for long-term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity that is associated with learning and memory processes. In the present study we investigated whether the loss or survival of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) diaphorase-containing neurons, which are known to synthesize nitric oxide, would be an useful indicator for evaluating the structural and functional state of the rat hippocampus after status epilepticus that is induced by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid. Besides NADPH diaphorase histochemistry, two other histological parameters were studied: the grade of cell damage evaluated from silver-impregnated sections, and the number of somatostatin-containing neurons in different hippocampal subfields. We found that the number of NADPH diaphorase-containing neurons in the hilus and granule cell layer correlated well with spatial learning and memory performance as assessed by the Morris water-maze test. The extent of cell damage in the CA1 subfield analysed in silver-impregnated sections and the number of hilar somatostatin-containing neurons also significantly correlated with latencies in the water-maze test. Furthermore, linear regression analysis revealed that the number of somatostatin-containing neurons in the hilus explains about 50% of the variation in water-maze learning. These findings emphasize that although general structural preservation is of crucial importance for the function of the hippocampus also interneurons, such as somatostatin- and NADPH diaphorase-containing neurons, may play an important role during the acquisition phase and processing of information in hippocampal circuitry. Therefore, in addition to evaluating general cell damage, analysis of the cell loss that occurs in the interneuron subpopulations will be beneficial in verifying structural and functional deficits of the hippocampus after status epilepticus.",
