     "AB": "We examined by immunohistochemistry the expression of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits (GluRs) in glial cells of the rat dorsal hippocampus 3 to 28 days after transient forebrain ischemia. In general, the expression of GluRs at all time points studied underwent a drastic reduction that was primarily restricted to the CA1 region. In addition to the disappearance of GluRs as a result of neuronal cell death, we observed their expression in reactive glial cells. The time course of expression and the subunits involved were different for astrocytes and microglia. Reactive astrocytes exhibited kainate, GluR5-7, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), NR2A/B, receptor subunits, both of which were maximally expressed approximately 4 weeks after ischemia. In contrast, reactive microglia expressed GluR4 and NR1 subunits, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA), and NMDA receptor subtypes, respectively, with maximal expression observed between 3 and 7 days after ischemia. These results demonstrate that specific types of GluRs are expressed in reactive glial cells after ischemia and that, overall, their expression levels peak around or after the periods of maximal astrogliosis and microgliosis. Thus, modulation of GluR expression may be one of the molecular components accompanying the gliotic process.",
