     "AB": "Two classic animal behavior despair tests-the forced swimming test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST) were used to evaluate antidepressant-like activity of a new chalcone compound, chalcone-1203 in mice. It was observed that chalcone-1203 at dose of 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg significantly reduced the immobility time in the FST and TST in mice 30 min after treatment. In addition, chalcone-1203 was found to exhibit significant oral activity in the FST in mice. It also produced a reduction in the ambulation in the open-field test in mice not previously habituated to the arena, but no effect in the locomotor activity in mice previously habituated to the open-field. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolites in mouse brain regions were also simultaneously determined by HPLC-ECD. It was found that chalcone-1203 significantly increased the concentrations of the main neurotransmitters 5-HT and NE in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and cortex. Chalcone-1203 also significantly reduced the ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT in the hippocampus and cortex, shown down 5-HT metabolism compared with mice treated with stress vehicle. In conclusion, chalcone-1203 produced significant antidepressant-like activity, and the mechanism of action may be due to increased 5-HT and NE in the mouse hippocampus and cortex.",
