     "AB": "The effects of four glutamate receptor antagonists on alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-responses were evaluated using both in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological techniques: whole cell patch-clamp recordings from cultured mouse cortical neurones and microiontophoresis in the rat hippocampus. The compounds tested were NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline), GYKI 52466 (1-(4-amino-phenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methyl-endioxyl-5H-2,3-benzodiaze pine), PNQX (pyrido[3, 4-f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione, 1,4,7,8,9,10-hexahydro-9-methyl-6-nitro-, methanesulfonate), NS377 (7-ethyl-5-phenyl-1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,7-diaza-as-indacene-2 ,3-dione), and MK-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz(a,d)cycloheptene-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate). In vitro, the IC50 values (in microM) for inhibition of AMPA-evoked inward currents were approximately 0.4 for NBQX, approximately 7.5 for GYKI 52466, approximately 1 for PNQX and approximately 15 for NS377. PNQX and NS377 also inhibited NMDA-induced currents with IC50 values at approximately 5 and approximately 18 microM, respectively, while NBQX at 60 microM and GYKI 52466 at 100 microM had only weak effects. The ED50 values in micromol/kg i.v. for inhibition of AMPA-evoked hippocampal neuronal spike activity in vivo were approximately 32 for NBQX, approximately 19 for GYKI 52466, approximately 17 for PNQX and approximately 11 for NS377 with efficacy values (maximal inhibition) between 71% and 81%. The ED50 values (in [Lmol/kg i.v.) and efficacy values for inhibition of NMDA-evoked hippocampal neuronal spike activity were approximately 28 with an efficacy of 61% for NBQX, approximately 16 with 35% for PNQX and approximately 6 with 61% for NS377. GYKI 52466 did not significantly affect NMDA responses, whereas MK-801 showed NMDA specificity in vivo.",
