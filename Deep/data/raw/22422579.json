     "AB": "Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposits in the brain are critical in the neurotoxicity induced by Abeta. This study elucidates the underlying signaling pathway by which cilostazol protects HT22 neuronal cells from Abeta(1-40) (3-30 muM)-induced deterioration of cell proliferation, viability, and neurite elongation. Cilostazol rescued HT22 cells from the apoptotic cell death induced by Abeta toxicity through the downregulation of phosphorylated p53 (Ser15), Bax, and caspase-3 and the upregulation of Bcl-2 expression, which improved neuronal cell proliferation and viability. Furthermore, Abeta(1-40) suppressed both phosphorylated CK2alpha protein expression and CK2 activity in the cytosol; these were concentration dependently recovered by cilostazol (3-30 muM). Cilostazol significantly increased the levels of GSK-3beta phosphorylation at Ser9 and beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser675 in the cytosol and nucleus. Cilostazol effects were reversed by KT5720 (1 muM, PKA inhibitor) and TBCA (40 muM, inhibitor of CK2) and CK2alpha knockdown by siRNA transfection. Likewise, Abeta-stimulated GSK-3beta phosphorylation at Tyr 216 was decreased by cilostazol in the control but not in the CK2alpha siRNA-transfected cells. Furthermore, the Abeta (10 muM)-induced suppression of neurite elongation was recovered by cilostazol; this recovery was attenuated by inhibitors such as KT5720 and TBCA and blocked by CK2alpha knockdown. In conclusion, increased cAMP-dependent protein kinase-linked CK2alpha activation underlies the pharmacological effects of cilostazol in downregulating p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 and upregulating GSK-3beta phosphorylation at Ser9/beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser675, thereby suppressing Abeta(1-40)-induced neurotoxicity and improving neurite elongation.",
