     "AB": "It is long acknowledged that the N-methyl d-aspartate receptor co-agonist, d-serine, plays a crucial role in several N-methyl d-aspartate receptor-mediated physiological and pathological processes, including schizophrenia. Besides d-serine, another free d-amino acid, d-aspartate, is involved in the activation of N-methyl d-aspartate receptors acting as an agonist of this receptor subclass, and is abundantly detected in the developing human brain. Based on the hypothesis of N-methyl d-aspartate receptor hypofunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and considering the ability of d-aspartate and d-serine to stimulate N-methyl d-aspartate receptor-dependent transmission, in the present work we assessed the concentration of these two d-amino acids in the post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of patients with schizophrenia and healthy subjects. Moreover, in this cohort of post-mortem brain samples we investigated the spatiotemporal variations of d-aspartate and d-serine. Consistent with previous work, we found that d-aspartate content was selectively decreased by around 30% in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus, of schizophrenia-affected patients, compared to healthy subjects. Interestingly, such selective reduction was associated to greater (around 25%) cortical activity of the enzyme responsible for d-aspartate catabolism, d-aspartate oxidase. Conversely, no significant changes were found in the methylation state and transcription of DDO gene in patients with schizophrenia, compared to control individuals, as well as in the expression levels of serine racemase, the major enzyme responsible for d-serine biosynthesis, which also catalyzes aspartate racemization. These results reveal the potential involvement of altered d-aspartate metabolism in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as a factor contributing to dysfunctional N-methyl d-aspartate receptor-mediated transmission in schizophrenia.",
