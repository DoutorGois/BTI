     "AB": "Stereotyped behavior was induced in rats with ouabain administered intraventricularly in doses of 2, 3 and 4 microgram in 50 microliter saline. Haloperiodol reduced the stereotyped behaviour. Monoamine turnover studies showed a reduction in concentration of norepinephrine in hippocampus and midbrain, an increase in norepinephrine turnover in the medulla oblongata and a reduction in dopamine turnover in the striatum. The interpretation of these finds is discussed. It is suggested that this model could be significant clinically as it demonstrates that impairment of Na+-K+-ATP'ase may result in behavioral abnormalities characterised by stereotypy.",
