     "AB": "Schizophrenia is a neuropsychiatric disorder of unknown etiology associated with subtle changes in brain morphology. The cell recognition molecules (CRMs) neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and L1 are involved in morphoregulatory events and numerous neurodevelopmental processes. We found a selective increase of 105- to 115-kDa N-CAM in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia while other N-CAM isoforms and L1 proteins were not altered. There was also evidence for an abnormality in CRM expression in schizophrenic patients: concentrations of 200-kDa L1 were strongly correlated with expression of N-CAM isoforms and cleaved L1 proteins in controls, whereas these correlations were absent in patients with schizophrenia. The increase of the 105- to 115-kDa N-CAM isoform in the brains of patients with schizophrenia confirms previous cerebrospinal fluid findings. Increased N-CAM in schizophrenia may result from structural brain abnormalities, from glial processing of N-CAM, or from an aberration in the regulation of N-CAM expression.",
