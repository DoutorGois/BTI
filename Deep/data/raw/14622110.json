     "AB": "Ras-related GTPases of the Rho family, such as RhoA and RhoB, are well-characterised mediators of morphological change in peripheral tissues via their effects on the actin cytoskeleton. We tested the hypothesis that Rho family GTPases are involved in synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. We show that GTPases are activated by synaptic transmission. RhoA and RhoB were activated by low frequency stimulation, while the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by high frequency stimulation was associated with specific activation of RhoB via NMDA receptor stimulation. This illustrates that these GTPases are potential mediators of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, and raises the possibility that RhoB may play a role in plasticity at hippocampal synapses during LTP.",
