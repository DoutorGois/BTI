Cell structure in CA1, Ca2, and CA3 fields, polymorphic layer of the fascia dentata and its medial and lateral limbs were revealed in sections of the dorsal hippocampus. In neocortical sections, cortical neurons and subcortical structure were preserved, however, some cortical fragments changed their configuration and formed spherical structures, where cortical neurons were located in the external layer without forming typical of neocortex 6-layer structure.",
