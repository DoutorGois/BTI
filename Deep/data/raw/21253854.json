     "AB": "Reeler is a mutant mouse with defects in layered structures of the central nervous system, such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, and has been extensively examined for more than half a century. The full-length cDNA for the responsible gene for reeler, reelin, was serendipitously identified, revealing that Reelin encodes a large secreted protein. So far, two Reelin receptors, apolipoprotein E receptor 2 and very low-density lipoprotein receptor, and the cytoplasmic adaptor protein Disabled homolog 1 (Dab1) have been shown to be essential for Reelin signaling. Although a number of downstream cascades of Dab1 have also been reported using various experimental systems, the physiological functions of Reelin in vivo remain controversial. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of the Reelin-Dab1 signaling pathway in the developing cerebral cortex.",
