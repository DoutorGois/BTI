     "AB": "A role for ionotropic (NMDA, AMPA, and kainate) excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors in seizure and seizure-related brain damage is well documented. To study the possible role of metabotropic (G-protein linked) EAA receptors in this regard, a highly selective metabotropic EAA agonist was injected into the hippocampus of halothane-anesthetized rats. This resulted in delayed-onset seizures and selective hippocampal neuronal damage that was indirectly mediated by NMDA receptors. This provides direct evidence for a novel role of metabotropic EAA receptors in the etiology of seizures and neuronal damage.",
