     "AB": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible role of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) in the pathogenesis of recurrent febrile seizures (FS) in rats. On a rat model of recurrent FS, the ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons, the plasma level of H(2)S, the expressions of cystathionine b-synthase (CBS) and c-fos, and the development of mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) in hippocampus were examined after treatment with NaHS, a donor of H(2)S, or hydroxylamine (HA), an inhibitor of CBS. We found that the plasma level of H(2)S increased significantly, the expressions of CBS and c-fos increased markedly, and MFS was evident in hippocampus in FS group. NaHS alleviated the neuronal damage of recurrent FS rats, decreased the expression of c-fos, and inhibited MFS obviously. HA aggravated the neuronal damage of recurrent FS rats, further increased the expression of c-fos, and enhanced the mossy fiber outgrowth. The results showed that endogenous H(2)S system was involved in the development of FS. Exogenous H(2)S may exert beneficial effect on the pathogenesis of FS-related brain damage.",
