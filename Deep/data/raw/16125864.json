     "AB": "A link between temporal lobe epilepsy (the most common epileptic syndrome in adults) and neuropeptides has been established. Among neuropeptides, the possible involvement of bradykinin has recently received attention. An autoradiographic analysis has shown that B1 receptors, which are physiologically absent, are expressed at high levels in the rat brain after completion of kindling, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Thus, the present work aimed at investigating the functional implications of this observation, by studying the effect of B1 receptor activation on extracellular glutamate levels in the kindled hippocampus. Microdialysis experiments have been performed in two groups of rats, control and kindled. Glutamate outflow has been measured under basal conditions and after chemical stimulation with high K+ (100 mM in the dialysis solution). Basal glutamate outflow in kindled animals was significantly higher than in controls. High K+-evoked glutamate outflow was also more pronounced in kindled animals, consistent with the latent hyperexcitability of the epileptic tissue. The B1 receptor agonist Lys-des-Arg9-BK induced an increase of basal and high K+-evoked glutamate outflow in kindled but not in control rats, and the selective B1 receptor antagonist R-715 prevented both these effects. Furthermore, R-715 significantly reduced high K+-evoked glutamate outflow when applied alone. These data suggest that the bradykinin system contributes to the modulation of epileptic neuronal excitability through B1 receptors.",
