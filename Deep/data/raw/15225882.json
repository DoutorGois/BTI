     "AB": "We have isolated a novel transcript with homology to the major microtubule-associated protein in dividing sea urchin embryos, EMAP. The protein has a predicted MW of approximately 180 kDa and we have named it Eml5 (EMAP-like protein 5). Eml5 contains 11 putative WD40 domains and 3 hydrophobic stretches of 43 aa, HELP domains, which have been suggested to be involved in microtubule binding. Eml5 appears to consist of two tandem repeats of the complete EMAP protein separated by a putative dimerization domain. Eml5 mRNA and protein is expressed at high levels in the hippocampus, cerebellum and olfactory bulb, as determined by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. Eml5 transcripts can be detected in fore- and hindbrain structures from embryonic day 13 onwards. Because other EMAP-like proteins are involved in regulating microtubule dynamics, it is likely that Eml5 plays a role in the regulation of cytoskeletal rearrangements during neuronal development and in adult brain",
