     "AB": "Oxidative stress is one of predisposing factors to age-related neurodegeneration in the brain. In particular, thiol-containing groups are susceptible to oxidative stress, which induces the formation of the disulfide bond and/or hyperoxidized form of thiol-containing proteins. We observed the protein thiol levels in the hippocampal homogenates and also investigated changes in hyperoxidized form of peroxiredoxin (Prx-SO(3)) immunoreactivity and proteins levels in the gerbil hippocampal subregions during normal aging. Levels of total thiol, non-protein thiol, and protein thiol were decreased in the hippocampal homogenates with age. At post-natal month 1 (PM 1), pyramidal and non-pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region (CA1) showed Prx-SO(3) immunoreactivity. Prx-SO(3) immunoreactivity in the cells was decreased by PM 12, thereafter, Prx-SO(3) immunoreactivity in the cells increased again with age. In the CA2/3, Prx-SO(3) immunoreactivity in pyramidal cells was not significantly changed; however, the immunoreactivity in pyramidal cells was very low at PM 12. Prx-SO(3) immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus (DG) was distinctly changed during aging. At PM 1, Prx-SO(3) immunoreactivity in granule and polymorphic cells was weak and strong, respectively. The immunoreactivity in the neurons was decreased with age, not shown in any neurons at PM 12. Thereafter, Prx-SO(3) immunoreactivity increased again with age. In addition, Prx-SO(3) protein level in the hippocampus was lowest at PM 12. These results suggest that thiol-containing proteins are changed during aging and Prx-SO(3) immunoreactivity was different according to cells in the hippocampal subregion during aging.",
