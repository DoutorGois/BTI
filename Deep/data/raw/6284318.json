     "AB": "Electrophysiological field potentials recorded from in vitro hippocampal slice preparations show dose-dependent differences in response to 17-beta-estradiol (E2) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) added to the incubation medium. Using a wide range of doses (1 pM-10 nM), it was found that mid-range concentrations of estradiol (100 pM) and THC (10 pM) tended to increase field potentials in CA1 of rodents. Higher dose levels of each agent were found to depress neuronal activity. In the context of prior findings, these results suggest that the two compounds share a common mechanism of action in the hippocampus.",
