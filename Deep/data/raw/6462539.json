     "AB": "Adult male hooded rats were tested pretreatment for spontaneous alternation and open-field behaviors. Animals were then intubated with either 5 or 7 mg/kg trimethyltin chloride (TMT Cl) or the isotonic saline vehicle. Post-treatment, animals were again tested for spontaneous alternation and open-field behaviors during three separate 5-day periods: days 14-18, days 56-60 and days 106-110. Additionally, both body weight and water intake were assessed. The larger dose of TMT Cl resulted in significant, but temporary reduction in body weight, elevated water intake for approximately 3 weeks, and a persistent increase in open-field activity. The smaller dose of TMT Cl resulted in elevated water intake for approximately 3 weeks and a temporary increase in open-field activity. Since the tendency to enter choice arms decreased in all groups across testing sessions, the effects of TMT Cl on spontaneous alternation could not be accurately assessed.",
