     "AB": "Nestin is a protein of embryonic intermediate filaments expressed by multipotent neural stem cells. In the present study, the nestin expression pattern in the mouse hippocampus 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 days after treatment with trimethyltin (TMT) was examined to explore the possible role played by nestin in chemically induced hippocampal injury. TMT treatment (2.5mg/kg, intraperitoneally) selectively injured the dentate gyrus (DG) of the mouse hippocampus. The level of hippocampal mRNA encoding nestin increased significantly 2 and 3 days post-treatment and thereafter decreased (at 4 and 8 days post-treatment). The level of nestin protein significantly increased 2 - 4 days post-treatment, particularly in the injured region of the DG, and predominantly in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes in the hippocampal DG. Ki67-positive proliferating cells were increased following TMT treatment and co-localized with nestin-positive reactive astrocytes. Thus, we suggest that nestin contributes to remodeling of the chemically injured DG via glial scar formation and the alteration of neurogenesis.",
