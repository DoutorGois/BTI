     "AB": "alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn) abnormality and mitochondrial deficiency are two major changes in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). A link between alpha-Syn and mitochondria in PD has been demonstrated by a recent study showing that accumulation of alpha-Syn in the mitochondria from the PD-vulnerable brain regions was associated with decreased complex I activity of these mitochondria. In this study, we examined the normal expressions of alpha-Syn in mitochondria from different regions of the rat brain. We showed that alpha-Syn was highly expressed in the mitochondria in olfactory bulb, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus, where the cytosolic alpha-Syn was also rich. However, the cerebral cortex and cerebellum were two exceptions, which contained rich cytosolic alpha-Syn but very low or even undetectable levels of mitochondrial alpha-Syn. The close quantitative association between mitochondrial and cytosolic alpha-Syn in most brain regions, suggests that the concentration of cytosolic alpha-Syn may determine the amount of alpha-Syn in mitochondria. This is partially supported by the in vitro experiment showing that incubation of alpha-Syn with endogenous alpha-Syn-undetectable cerebellar mitochondria caused a dose-dependent transport of alpha-Syn to the mitochondria. Moreover, we found that the inhibitory effect of alpha-Syn on complex I activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain was also dose-dependent. These results suggest that alpha-Syn in mitochondria is differentially expressed in different brain regions and the background levels of mitochondrial alpha-Syn may be a potential factor affecting mitochondrial function and predisposing some neurons to degeneration.",
