     "AB": "Incubation of purified protein kinase C with H2O2 results in the generation of a persistently activated form of the enzyme which is no longer dependent on Ca2+ or lipid cofactors. This oxidative activation of purified protein kinase C requires added Fe2+ in the incubation medium. Treatment of the soluble fraction of hippocampal homogenates with H2O2 also leads to persistent activation of protein kinase C; however, oxidative activation of protein kinase C under these conditions does not require the addition of Fe2+. The persistently activated form of protein kinase C appears as a novel peak of activity on DE52 anion exchange columns, suggesting a modification of the charge character of the enzyme. Thus, oxidative modification of protein kinase C can result in its persistent activation, and this mechanism may constitute a pathway for physiological activation of the enzyme in the hippocampus.",
