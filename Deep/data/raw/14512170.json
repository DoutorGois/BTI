     "AB": "Rat cortical neurons cultured in conditioned media from human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) show increased neuronal protein synthesis, neurite outgrowth, mitogen-activating protein kinase activity, and synaptic function. Neurotrophic properties of human MDM-conditioned media are significantly enhanced by human peripheral nerve and to a more limited extent by CD40 ligand pre-stimulation. Such positive effects of MDM secretions on neuronal function parallel the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). MDM activation cues may serve to balance toxic activities produced during neurodegenerative diseases and thus, under certain circumstances, mitigate neuronal degeneration.",
