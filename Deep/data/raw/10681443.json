     "AB": "Apoptosis is a cell-suicide process that appears to play a central role not only during normal neuronal development but also in several neuropathological disease states. An important component of this process is a proteolytic cascade involving a family of cysteine proteases called caspases. Caspase inhibitors have been demonstrated to be effective in inhibiting neuronal cell death in various apoptotic paradigms. We have created transgenic mice that neuronally express the baculoviral caspase inhibitor p35. Neuronal expression of the p35 protein was found to confer functional caspase inhibitory activity and prevent apoptosis in isolated cerebellar granular cultures induced to undergo apoptosis either via staurosporine treatment or through withdrawal of extracellular potassium. Neuronal expression of p35 was also found to attenuate neurodegeneration associated with the excitotoxic glutamate analogue kainic acid (KA) in vitro and in vivo. Organotypic hippocampal cultures isolated from p35 transgenics demonstrated lowered caspase activity and decreased apoptosis compared with wild type when exposed to KA. In vivo injection of KA also produced decreased caspase activity and cell death in p35 transgenics vs. wild type. These results suggest that the presence of p35 in neurons in vivo is protective against various types of apoptosis, including seizure-related neurodegeneration, and that caspases may be attractive potential targets for preventing neuronal injury associated with diseases such as epilepsy. These mice also provide a valuable tool for exploring the role of caspases in other neuropathological conditions in which apoptosis has been implicated.",
