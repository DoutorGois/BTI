     "AB": "1-(2-Methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine, NAN-190, is a novel compound with putative 5-HT1A antagonist properties. In the present study, the effects of NAN-190 were examined with regard to functional pre- and post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptor-mediated events, using in vivo brain microdialysis and behavioural techniques. Our findings provide evidence that NAN-190 acts as a mixed agonist/antagonist at central 5-HT1A receptors. Thus, NAN-190 blocked (+)8-OH-DPAT-induced behaviour in reserpinized rats, indicating antagonist properties at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. However, the compound was also able to decrease the release of 5-HT in vivo, tentatively due to an agonist action at somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. These data extend previous information on the pharmacological profile of NAN-190 and further emphasizes the difference between pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in brain.",
