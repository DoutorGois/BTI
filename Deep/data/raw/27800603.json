     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between hippocampal and total brain volume and the course of depressive symptoms over eight years of follow-up in patients with a history of vascular disease. METHOD: Within the SMART-Medea study, 636 participants (62 +/- 10 years) had a 1.5-tesla brain MRI obtaining hippocampal and total brain volumes. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 biannually during eight-year follow-up. Generalized estimating equation models with robust standard errors were used to assess the associations of hippocampal and total brain volumes with depressive symptoms during follow-up adjusting for age, sex, education, and intracranial volume. An interaction term between volume and time (6-month intervals) was included to examine whether the course of depressive symptoms differed according to hippocampal and total brain volume. RESULTS: The mean PHQ-9 score was 2.8 +/- 3.5. Smaller hippocampal volumes were associated with an increasing course of depressive symptom levels, while larger volumes were associated with decreasing levels (P-value interaction = 0.07). Smaller total brain volume was associated with consistently higher levels of depressive symptoms, but not with change in course of depressive symptoms (P-value interaction = 0.45). CONCLUSION: Smaller hippocampal volume but not total brain volume is associated with poorer course of depressive symptoms over eight years of follow-up.",
