     "AB": "Antibodies to synthetic peptides corresponding to different regions of beta/A4-protein recognize deposits of amyloid in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Down's syndrome cases and in the normal ageing brain. We have prepared a monoclonal antibody, mAb 22.212, raised against a synthetic C-terminal peptide of beta/A4 protein (residues 28-40) which labelled senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease after proteolytic treatment of tissue sections. In addition to recognising synthetic beta/A4-peptides that include the C-terminal residues 28-42, the mAb 22.212 was found to cross-react with a soluble, 47 kDa protein found in brain homogenates. This protein was shown, by amino acid sequence analysis and immunoassay, to be neuron-specific enolase (NSE). The mAb 22.212 did not recognize the non-neuronal enolase (NNE) or muscle-specific enolase (MSE) isoforms and its epitope was mapped to a short stretch of amino-acids unique to NSE, near the C-terminus. The cross-reactive NSE epitope is sited between residues 402-423 in NSE and shows no common sequence with beta/A4, perhaps suggesting that it is a conformational epitope. The significance and applications of these findings are discussed.",
