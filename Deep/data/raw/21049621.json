     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study effects of Tianbingtiaodu capsule on changement of learning and memory abilities and expression of NMDAR1 in epileptic rats. METHODS: Picrotoxin (1.5 mg/kg) was injected intraperitonrally in SD rats for thirty days. After the repeated attacks epilepsy model had been established successfully, model rats were randomly divided into model group, Tianbingtiaodu capsule low dosage (0.4 g/kg) group, Tianbingtiaodu capsules high dosage(0. 8 g/kg) group, Piracetam group and Piracetam and Valproate group. All groups were fed everyday. Sixty days later, the learning and memory abilities were tested with Morris water maze method. Expression of NMDAR1 in hippocampus was observed with western-blot and immunohistochemical method. The expression of NMDAR1 mRNA in hippocampus was determined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the learning and memory abilities were significantly lower (P < 0.01), immune positive remarks of expression of NMDAR1 in hippocampus AC3 significantly increased in model group (P < 0.05); Compared with model group,the learning and memory abilities and expression of NMDAR1 in hippocampus was improved significantly in Tianbingtiaodu group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Tianbingtiaodu capsule could improve the impairment of learning and memory in rats after repeated attacks of epilepsy through adjusting the NMDAR1 expression.",
