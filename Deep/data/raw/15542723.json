     "AB": "Electrophysiological studies were performed to determine whether or not hippocampal serotonergic modulation was affected following repeated administration of methamphetamine (MAP). Rats were i.p. administered with MAP (5 mg/kg) or saline once a day for 5 days. Hippocampal slices were prepared at 24 h, 5 and 10 days after the final MAP or saline injection. The population spikes (PS) induced by stimulation of Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers were recorded in the hippocampal CA1 region. Application of serotonin (5-HT) via a bath perfusion system inhibited the PS in a concentration-dependent manner. At 24 h after the final injection, 10-microM 5-HT-induced inhibition of PS was not affected by MAP treatment. However, 5 days after the final injection, the inhibition by 5-HT (10 microM) of PS was significantly augmented in the MAP-treated group. Ten days after the final injection, this augmentation was not statistically significant compared with that of control group. 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, inhibited PS, but the inhibition was not enhanced or reduced 5 days after the final MAP treatment. However, the enhancement of PS by RS 67333, a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, was attenuated 5 days after the MAP treatment. It was found that 5-HT-induced inhibition of PS in the hippocampal CA1 region was potentiated 5 days after cessation of MAP, and this effect was suggested to be due to reduction of excitatory 5-HT4 receptor functions.",
