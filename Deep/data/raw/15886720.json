     "AB": "It is hypothesized that olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, has beneficial effects on cognitive impairment and neuropathological changes in treating neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we investigated the effects of chronic administration of olanzapine on the spatial memory impairment and hippocampal cell death induced by the direct injection of okadaic acid (OA), a potent neurotoxin, into the rat hippocampus. After being pretreated with olanzapine (0.5 or 2 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 2 weeks, the rats were unilaterally microinjected with OA (100 ng) into the hippocampus, and then were continuously administrated with olanzapine for an additional week The rats were trained on a spatial memory task in an eight-arm radial maze before OA administration, and tested on the same task 18 h after the last olanzapine injection. After the behavioral test, the rats were killed for Nissl staining and terminal deoxynucleutidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling staining. OA significantly induced spatial memory impairment, and caused pyramidal cell loss in the CAI and apoptotic cell death in the hippocampus. Olanzapine significantly attenuated OA-induced spatial memory impairment and the OA-induced neuropathological changes in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that olanzapine may have therapeutic effects in treatment of cognitive impairment and neuropathological changes of schizophrenia and other neurodegenerative diseases.",
