     "AB": "Whether febrile seizures lead to hippocampal necrosis is a question of paramount clinical importance. This study attempted to simulate a complex febrile seizure, compared with hyperthermia (HYP) alone and prolonged seizure alone (produced by continuous hippocampal stimulation (CHS)). Four groups of rats were studied at each of two ages, immature (postnatal day, P20) and adult (P60). Group 1 was subjected to 45 min of HYP (body temperature 40 degrees C) plus CHS, Group 2 received 45 min of HYP alone, Group 3 got 45 min of CHS alone, and Group 4 was sham-handled control rats. Baseline and post-session EEGs were recorded in all groups. Subsequently, brains were examined histologically for evidence of hippocampal damage. Both CHS-treated groups (with and without HYP) exhibited behavioral and EEG seizures while the group undergoing HYP alone did not have seizures. There were no gross histological lesions in any group. Cell counts in regions CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus and dentate hilus did not differ in rats under any condition of hyperthermia and CHS, in either P20 or P60 rats compared to age-matched controls. These results indicate that both immature and mature rodents are resistant to hyperthermic brain damage and raises the question of whether febrile seizures play a role in the genesis of mesial temporal sclerosis.",
