     "AB": "AIM: To observe the effects of different subtypes of central nicotinic receptor on learning and memory. METHODS: Passive avoidance response, including step-down avoidance and step-through avoidance in mice and long-term potentiation (LTP) in rat hippocampal slices. RESULTS: Hexamethonium (C6) 7 micrograms/mouse and kappa-bungarotoxin (kappa-BTX) 0.6 microgram/mouse inhibited the acquisition of avoidance conditioning in mice, and kappa-BTX yielded this effect with a dose-response relationship. kappa-BTX 1 mumol.L-1 suppressed the induction of LTP (P < 0.05), but not normal synaptic transmission and maintenance of LTP in rat hippocampal slices. CONCLUSION: The subtypes of central nicotinic receptor sensitive to kappa-BTX play an important role in learning and memory.",
