     "AB": "The purpose of this study is to determine if paeonol can protect hippocampal neurons against injury due to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury. The rat neurons were cultured in an OGD environment and the model of OGD injury was established. Paeonol and MK-801, a positive control drug, were added before deprivation. Neuron viability was measured by the reduction of MTT; glutamate was analyzed by amino acid analyzer; binding activity of NMDA receptor was evaluated by liquid scintillation counting and the expression of NMDA receptor NR1 subunit mRNA was semiquantitatively determined by RT-PCR. Compared with OGD injury group, paeonol treatment obviously increased cell survival rate and reduced the binding activity of NMDA receptors and the release of glutamate; and down-regulating the expression of NR1 subunit. These results suggest that paeonol may exhibit its protective effect against OGD injury by the action on NMDA receptor of rats.",
