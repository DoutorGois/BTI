     "AB": "1. Two different types of kainate response were recorded in cultured rat hippocampal neurons with the use of the whole-cell and outside-out configurations of the patch-clamp technique. 2. There was an outward rectification in the current-voltage (I-V) plot of the kainate-induced current (type I response) in relatively large neurons bearing a morphological resemblance to young pyramidal cells. In smaller neurons with elliptical somata and fine neurites, the kainate response was characterized by a remarkable inward rectification in the I-V plot of the kainate-induced current and a significant permeability to Ca2+ (type II response). 3. Both type I and type II responses were negligible below 2 microM and almost saturated at 500 microM kainate. The concentrations producing half-maximal responses and the Hill coefficients were 68 microM and 1.76 and 56 microM and 1.21 for type I and type II responses, respectively. Both responses were suppressed similarly by the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). 4. The mean single-channel conductance (gamma) of the type II kainate response was estimated, from the relation between the whole-cell mean currents and current variances, to be 8.7 pS. The power spectrum for the current noise was fitted with the sum of two Lorentzians with cutoff frequencies (fc) of 61.1 +/- 1.4 and 327.8 +/- 10.5 Hz (n = 12).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
