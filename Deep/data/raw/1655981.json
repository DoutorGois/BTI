     "AB": "Expression of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor subtypes was determined in mouse brain using oligonucleotide-specific in situ hybridization. All subtypes, except one that deletes 120 bp from the full-length InsP3 receptor cDNA, were expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells. In hippocampus, various subtypes showed distinct expression patterns. These results suggest that regionally selective expression of InsP3 receptor subtypes may result in the generation of functionally distinct channels.",
