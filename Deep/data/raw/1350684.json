     "AB": "The NMDA receptor antagonist, D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) (5 micrograms) and the GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol (0.03 microgram) were infused bilaterally into the entorhinal cortex of rats 0, 90, 180, or 360 min after training in habituation to a novel environment or in step-down inhibitory avoidance. Animals were tested for retention 22 h after training in each task. AP5 and muscimol were amnestic for both tasks when given 90 or 180 min after training, but had no effect when given 0 or 360 min after training. In contrast, intraamygdala injections or AP5 or muscimol were amnestic when given 0 but not 90 min after inhibitory avoidance training. The results indicate that the entorhinal cortex plays a late but important role in posttraining memory processing; this role involves glutamatergic NMDA receptors and is inhibited by GABAA receptors. The intervention of the entorhinal cortex in posttraining memory processing is subsequent, and could be secondary, to that of the amygdala and other limbic structures.",
