     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the protective effect of glial growth factor-2 (GGF2) on brain injury. METHODS: Thirty-four SD rats underwent lateral fluid percussion to establish brain injury models and then were randomly divided into 4 groups: treatment group (n = 10, the plasmid pEGFP-N1-GGF2 mixed with liposome was injected into the brain tissue directly), vector control group (n = 10, the vector pEGFP-N1 mixed with liposome was injected into the brain tissue directly), liposome control group (n = 10, liposome was injected), and sham operation group (n = 4). Three assessment tasks were performed for neurobehavioral evaluation: Clivas Test, Beam Balance Test and Beam Walking Test. 10 days after brain injury, the rats were sacrificed and their brains were embedded in paraffin for HE staining, Nissle staining and immunohistochemical examination of MBP, NSE, and GFAP. RESULTS: The Clivas test score of the treatment group was 66.25 +/- 3.54, significantly higher than those of the vector control group and. liposome control group (58.31 +/- 3.72 and 57.21 +/- 3.93 respectively, both P < 0.05). The beam test score of the treatment group was 2.59 +/- 0.21, significantly lower than those the vector control group and liposome control group (3.41 +/- 0.25 and 3.24 +/- 0.22 respectively, both P < 0.05). The walking test score of the treatment group was 20.15 +/- 2.59, significantly lower than those of control group and liposome control group (27.00 +/- 3.47 and 27.80 +/- 3.00 respectively, both P < 0.05). The improvement in beam walking test was the greatest. The neuron number in the external granular layer and external pyramidal layer in cortex of the treatment group was 98 +/- 10, significantly more than those of the vector control group and liposome group (75 +/- 7 and 67 +/- 8, both P < 0.05). The neuron number in the internal pyramidal layer in cortex of the treatment group was 37 +/- 4, significantly more than those of the vector control group and liposome group (19 +/- 3 and 23 +/- 4 respectively, both P < 0.05). The neuron number in the CA1 region in hippocampus of the treatment group was 102 +/- 11, significantly more than those of the vector control group and liposome group (67 +/- 8 and 58 +/- 9 respectively, both P < 0.01). Higher level of immunoreactivity with MBP was also detected in the cortex in the rats of the treatment group. CONCLUSION: Cationic liposome-mediated GGF2 gene therapy effectively promotes the recovery of brain injury.",
