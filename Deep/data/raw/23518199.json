     "AB": "PURPOSE: The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway is involved in the epileptogenesis. Sorting Nexin 25 (SNX25) has been recently proposed to modulate TGF-beta signaling through endosomal sorting of TGF-beta receptors for lysosomal degradation. The aim of the present study was to determine the expression pattern of SNX25 in brains of epilepsy patients and in animal model of epilepsy. METHODS: We investigated the expression of SNX25 in the brain tissues of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in the pilocarpine-induced rat model of epilepsy using western blotting, real-time quantitative RT-PCR, and double-label immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The expression of SNX25 was significantly increased in TLE patients in comparison to controls (0.21+/-0.07 vs. 0.11+/-0.03, P<0.05). In the lithium-pilocarpine induced epileptic rats, significant elevation of SNX25 levels was detected in the chronic phase, while no SNX25 alteration occurred in the acute and latent phases. Moreover, SNX25 localized to astrocytes and neurons, in both human samples and animal models. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that upregulation of SNX25 might be involved in the development of temporal lobe epilepsy.",
