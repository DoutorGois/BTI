     "AB": "Although generalization to conditioned stimuli is not a new phenomenon, renewed interest in understanding its biological underpinning has stemmed from its association with a number of anxiety disorders. Generalization as it relates to fear processing is a temporally dynamic process in which animals, including humans, display fear in response to similar yet distinct cues or contexts as the time between training and testing increases. This Review surveys the literature on contextual fear generalization and its relation to several views of memory, including systems consolidation, forgetting, and transformation hypothesis, which differentially implicate roles of the hippocampus and neocortex in memory consolidation and retrieval. We discuss recent evidence on the neurobiological mechanisms contributing to the increase in fear generalization over time and how generalized responding may be modulated by acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval mechanisms. Whereas clinical perspectives of generalization emphasize a lack of fear inhibition to CS(-) cues or fear toward intermediate CS cues, the time-dependent nature of generalization and its relation to traditional views on memory consolidation and retrieval are often overlooked. Understanding the time-dependent increase in fear generalization has important implications not only for understanding how generalization contributes to anxiety disorders but also for understanding basic long-term memory function.
