     "AB": "Neuronal activity is highly sensitive to changes in oxygen tension. In this study, we examined the impact of hypoxic/ischemic conditions on neuronal ensemble activity patterns in the mouse brain using in vivo extracellular electrophysiological recordings from up to 8 sites in the thalamus, dorsal hippocampus, and neocortex, while cerebral hypoperfusion was induced by unilateral carotid artery occlusion. After a few minutes, the occlusion triggered a rapid change in the power of the local field oscillations. In the hippocampus, but not in the neocortex, the absolute power changes at all frequency ranges (relative to the baseline) became less pronounced with time, and no significant changes were observed 30min after the occlusion-induced hypoperfusion. We also tested whether continuous hypoperfusion induced by the occlusion for up to 1 week alters neuronal activity. In the hippocampus and the thalamus, the chronic occlusion did not lead to a reduction in the power of the local field oscillations. These results indicate that certain neuronal populations have the ability to maintain internal neurophysiological homeostasis against continuous hypoperfusion.",
