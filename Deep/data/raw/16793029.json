     "PG": "170-85",
     "AB": "Epilepsy is characterized by hyperexcitability of hippocampal networks, excessive release of glutamate, and progressive neurodegeneration. Presynaptic group II metabotropic receptors (mGluR2 and mGluR3) are among different mechanisms that modulate presynaptic release of glutamate, especially at the mossy fibers in the hippocampus. Here, we explore whether mGluR2/3 expression is affected in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy obtained via pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). Immunohistochemical assays were performed in age-matched controls and two groups of epileptic rats sacrificed at 25-35 days (1 month post-SE) and at 55-65 days (2 months post-SE) following SE onset. A dramatic lessening of mGluR2/3 immunofluorescence was observed at CA1 and CA3 stratum lacunosum/molecular (SLM) declining to 60% and 68% of control values in 1-month and 2-month post-SE, respectively. Additionally, thickness of mGluR2/3-stained SLM layer narrowed up to 70% of controls indicating atrophy at this branch of the perforant path. Epileptic rats exhibited a marked and progressive down-regulation of mGluR2/3 expression in mossy fiber at hilus and CA3 stratum lucidum in contrast with an enhanced expression of vesicular glutamate transporter type 1 (VGluT1) at the mossy fibers. Intense VGluT1 punctated staining was detected at the inner third molecular layer indicating glutamatergic sprouting. In the molecular layer, mGluR2/3 labeling slightly declined in the 1-month post-SE group but then increased in the 2-month post-SE group although it was diffusely distributed. Down-regulation of mGluR2/3 at the mossy fibers and the SLM may render epileptic hippocampal networks hyperexcitable and susceptible to glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration.",
