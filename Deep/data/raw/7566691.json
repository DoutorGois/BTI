     "AB": "The enhanced production of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by astroglia appears to be a general response of the CNS to many types of toxic insult. The organometallic neurotoxicant, trimethyltin (TMT), is one such agent known to increase the production of GFAP as a consequence of widespread neuronal destruction. TMT also leads to transient reductions in body temperature (Tb), a response which may alter the neurotoxic effects of this compound. To study the role of Tb in the neurotoxic effects of TMT, rats were injected (i.v.) with saline or 8.0 mg/kg TMT and maintained at ambient temperatures (Ta) of 16, 22, or 30 degrees C for 72 hr while Tb (core) was measured periodically. Animals were then housed at a Ta of 22 degrees C for 35 days after which time their brains were removed and dissected into hippocampus, cerebral cortex, striatum, midbrain and cerebellum for subsequent analysis of GFAP. TMT led to a significant decrease in Tb of rats housed at 22 degrees C measured 3 hr after treatment. Tb of rats maintained at Ta's of 16 and 30 degrees C was unaffected by TMT initially (i.e., no hypothermia); however, by 72 hr after TMT, rats maintained at 22 and 30 degrees C had a significantly elevated Tb. TMT led to marked elevations in GFAP levels, a response that was affected by Ta. In the hippocampus the elevation in GFAP was significantly greater in rats housed at 16 and 30 degrees C. A similar pattern was seen in the midbrain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
