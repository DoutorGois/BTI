     "AB": "We studied the effects of oestradiol and progesterone on progesterone receptor (PR) isoform content in the brain of ovariectomized rats and in intact rats during the oestrous cycle by Western blot analysis. In the hypothalamus and the preoptic area of ovariectomized rats, PR-A and PR-B content was increased by oestradiol, whereas progesterone significantly diminished the content of both PR isoforms after 3 h of treatment in the hypothalamus, but not in the preoptic area. In the hippocampus, only PR-A content was significantly increased by oestradiol while progesterone significantly diminished it after 12 h of treatment. In the frontal cortex, no treatment significantly modified PR isoform content. During the oestrous cycle, the lowest content of PR isoforms in the hypothalamus was observed on diestrus day and, by contrast, in the preoptic area, the highest content of both PR isoforms was observed on diestrus day. We observed no changes in PR isoform content in the hippocampus during the oestrous cycle. These results indicate that the expression of PR isoforms is differentially regulated by sex steroid hormones in a regionally specific manner.",
