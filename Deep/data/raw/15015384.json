     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the mechanism of SHU-Dihuang on the function of learning and memory. METHOD: On the dementia model mouse caused by AlCl3 and the rats model damaged thalamic arcuate nucleus with MSG, we observed the function of learning and memory by step down task and Morris water maze task, mensurated the content of glutamic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid by TLC, and observed the expression of NMDAR1 and GABAR in hippocampi by immunohistochemical means. RESULT: Shu Di Huang could decrease the times of mistakes and prolong the incubation period in step down task, and shorten the incubation period of seeking the platform in Morris water maze task. Shu Di Huang could adjust the content of Glu and GABA in brain, and increase the expression of hippocampal NMDAR1 and GABAR as well. CONCLUSION: Shu Di Huang can improve the function of learning and memory of dementia animal model, and its mechanism may be related to the adjustment of the content of Glu and GABA in brain, and increase of the expression of hippocampal NMDAR1 and GABAR.",
