     "AB": "Research in humans indicates that women may show greater cognitive benefits from aerobic training (AT) than men. To determine whether this sex difference extends to rodents, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in healthy, older rodents. Results indicate that compared to controls, AT improved hippocampus-dependent and -independent learning and memory. A sex difference was found with males showing larger benefits from AT on conditioned-avoidance and non-spatial memory tasks. AT also increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor compared to controls, with larger effects in females. As an exploratory analysis, sex differences in voluntary AT were examined separately from forced AT. Voluntary AT enhanced non-spatial memory to a greater extent in males. Forced AT enhanced hippocampus-dependent learning and memory more so in females. These findings suggest that sex is an important factor to consider, and studies directly assessing sex differences in the ability of exercise to improve brain function are needed.",
