     "AB": "1. The long-term enhancement of synaptic excitability in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons produced by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) was studied in rabbit hippocampal slices in vitro. 2. Bath application of the mGluR agonist (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3- dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD) (5-20 microM) for 20 min produced a reversible depolarization of membrane potentiatil, blockade of spike accommodation, and increase in input resistance of CA1 neurons. However, a long-lasting increase in synaptic excitability was observed: single stimuli applied to the Schaffer collateral commisural fiber pathway evoked epileptiform discharges in the presence of 1S,3R-ACPD and after the washout of 1S,3R-ACPD, persistent paroxysmal depolarization shifts (PDSs) were evoked by afferent stimulation. A long-lasting enhancement of synaptic excitability was also observed in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5), which blocked the stimulation-evoked PDS and associated afterdischarges. 3. When biphasic, monosynaptically evoked inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) were recorded in the presence of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) (10-15 microM) and D-AP5 (20 microM), the bath application of 1S,3R-ACPD produced a significant reduction (approximately 50%) of both components of the IPSP, which persisted after the washout of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
