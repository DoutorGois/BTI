     "AB": "In contrast to models and theories that relate adult neurogenesis with the processes of learning and memory, almost no solid hypotheses have been formulated that involve a possible neurocomputational influence of adult neurogenesis on forgetting. Based on data from a previous study that implemented a simple but complete model of the main hippocampal circuitry (Weisz & Argibay, 2009), we now test this model under different situations to better study the case of remote memories. The results of this work show that following neurogenesis, the new, ongoing memories in the hippocampus are better retained than when no neurogenesis occurs at all, while the older memories are affected (to a lesser extent) by a special type of interference that is different from interference that occurs with an increasing number of memories per se. This work adds a new point of analysis in support of the interference view that might lead to the forgetting of memories in the hippocampus as they are transferred to neocortex for long-term storage, consistent with the Complementary Learning Systems models of system-level consolidation. Attention should be directed to the specific causes of interference; the results of this work signal a type of distortion of remote memories that is produced by the birth and the growth of new processing units, which results in a subtly impoverished retrieval as new neurons become active. The proposals of this model fit well with some empirical findings that are related to the issue. In the future, as new evidence emerges, we believe that this biological process, which is largely related to learning and memory, will also help to shape our ideas about normal forgetting and its possible contributions to system consolidation.",
