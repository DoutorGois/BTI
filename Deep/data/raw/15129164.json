     "AB": "Tolerance against ischemia can be induced in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of the brain. In gerbils tolerance evolvement is blocked by the NMDA-antagonist MK-801. To examine this mechanism in rats, MK-801 was administered i.p. 1 h prior to tolerance inducing ischemia. Body temperature and activity were monitored before and after ischemia, and show that MK-801 results in hyperthermia immediately after the injection, the post-ischemic body temperature remain elevated until 5 h post-ischemia in spite of the animals being less active than control animals. Histology shows that pre-treatment with MK-801 does not affect the CA1 neuronal density, and we thus conclude that for the used rat model, MK-801 does not affect development of ischemic tolerance.",
