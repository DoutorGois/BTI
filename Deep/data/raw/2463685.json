     "AB": "Properties of membrane K+ conductances induced by baclofen and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the hippocampus were investigated by using guinea-pig brain slices. Baclofen hyperpolarized the membrane and decreased the input resistance of pyramidal cells through the activation of a membrane K+ conductance. GABA caused a biphasic response in pyramidal cells, consisting of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing components. Combined application of picrotoxin and bicuculline eliminated the major part of the depolarizing component of the biphasic response and produced a relatively pure hyperpolarizing response which was also mediated by an increase in K+ conductance. The K+ conductance change induced by baclofen showed prominent inward rectification. However, the K+ conductance induced by GABA did not show an obvious rectifying property. The K+ conductance activated by baclofen was strongly antagonized by a low concentration (5 x 10(-6) M) of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). In contrast, the K+ conductance activated by GABA was insensitive to 4-AP even at a high concentration of 10(-3) M. The slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential (slow i.p.s.p.) evoked by stimulation of the mossy fibres was totally suppressed by a low concentration of baclofen (5 x 10(-6) M). Whereas GABA (10(-3) M) decreased the amplitude of the slow i.p.s.p., the reduction of the amplitude was proportional to the decrease in the amplitude of the electrotonic potentials produced by constant inward current injections. These results suggest that the hyperpolarizations induced by GABA and baclofen may be generated by K+ conductances of different kinetic and pharmacologic properties.",
