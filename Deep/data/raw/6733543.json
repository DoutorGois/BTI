     "AB": "Modulation of CA1 field potential amplitudes by normal and stress concentrations of corticosterone (CT) was observed in hippocampal slice preparations from adrenalectomized rats. Slices exposed to CT levels characteristic of a morning (4 nM) or evening (7 nM) resting state showed increased population spike amplitudes in the CA1 pyramidal cell field within 10 min. A stress concentration (15 nM) also increased spike amplitudes, but only at the higher stimulus intensities. The effects of these doses were essentially the same 10 and 60 min after administration. The hormone facilitated responding more in morning resting concentrations than in concentrations characteristic of the evening resting state. This occurred, however, only for relatively low intensity stimuli. The data provide some support for the suggestion that circadian fluctuations in magnitude of long-term potentiation result from corresponding changes in CT level. The rapid onset of the observed changes is difficult to account for in terms of generally accepted mechanisms of receptor binding.",
