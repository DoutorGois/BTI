     "AB": "Evidence has accumulated that the rat hippocampus plays a central role in spatial memory. In complement to lesion studies, reversible lidocaine-induced inactivations have been used to investigate the time-course of the memory processes mediated by the hippocampus. A number of studies suggest that, in some conditions, the hippocampus is not necessary for online acquisition of spatial information. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of bilateral lidocaine-induced inactivations of the dorsal hippocampus in the acquisition of new spatial information. After initial learning of a place navigation task in the water maze, rats were tested for acquisition of a new platform location and received injections of lidocaine in the hippocampus prior to each daily four-trial block. The training blocks were separated by a 24-h period allowing the hippocampus to recover from inactivation. The results show that lidocaine-injected rats were able to learn the new platform location like controls. Inactivations, however, was found to induce a within-block learning impairment. This suggests that the hippocampus can perform off-line processing and that another structure is able to handle spatial information during hippocampal inactivations. Parietal-lesioned rats that received an injection of lidocaine were still able to learn the new platform location suggesting that the parietal cortex does not sustain this role. Overall, our results suggest that the hippocampus is not necessary for all stages of memory formation and co-operates with other brain, possibly cortical, structures which remain to be determined.",
