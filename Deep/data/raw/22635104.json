     "AB": "The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) has been thought to play a critical role in amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)-mediated neurodegeneration and Abeta metabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Our previous report showed that membrane-associated p75NTR protein expression was significantly increased in the hippocampi of two different strains of transgenic AD mice and was associated with the age-dependent elevation of Abeta1-42 levels. Here, we provide evidence that the Abeta1-42 oligomers known as ADDLs (Abeta-derived diffusible ligands) induce p75NTR protein expression through insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. An in vivo microinjection study demonstrated that microinjected ADDLs increased the p75NTR protein expression by 1.4-fold in the ipsilateral hippocampus compared to the contralateral hippocampus. In addition, ADDLs microinjected into mouse hippocampi facilitated IGF-1R phosphorylation within 30 min and the co-administration of picropodophyllin, an IGF-1R kinase inhibitor, blocked ADDLs-induced p75NTR expression. We examined the possible involvement of IGF-1R in the increased p75NTR protein expression in the hippocampi of 6-month-old AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 AD model mice that had accumulated significant amounts of Abeta1-42 and showed significantly higher p75NTR expression than age-matched wild-type mice. We found that IGF-1R phosphorylation in these transgenic mice was higher than that in the wild-type mice. These findings indicate that Abeta1-42 oligomers stimulate the p75NTR protein expression in the hippocampus through IGF-1R signaling. Thus, Abeta1-42 oligomers-mediated IGF-1R activation may trigger an increase in p75NTR protein expression in the hippocampus of AD brain during the early stages of disease development.",
