     "AB": "Spermidine is an endogenous polyamine with a polycationic structure present in the central nervous system of mammals. Spermidine regulates biological processes, such as Ca(2+) influx by glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor), which has been associated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cGMP/PKG pathway activation and a decrease of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in rats' cerebral cortex synaptosomes. Na(+),K(+)-ATPase establishes Na(+) and K(+) gradients across membranes of excitable cells and by this means maintains membrane potential and controls intracellular pH and volume. However, it has not been defined whether spermidine modulates Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in the hippocampus. In this study we investigated whether spermidine alters Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in slices of hippocampus from rats, and possible underlying mechanisms. Hippocampal slices and homogenates were incubated with spermidine (0.05-10 muM) for 30 min. Spermidine (0.5 and 1 muM) decreased Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in slices, but not in homogenates. MK-801 (100 and 10 muM), a non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptor, arcaine (0.5muM), an antagonist of the polyamine binding site at the NMDA receptor, and L-NAME (100muM), a NOS inhibitor, prevented the inhibitory effect of spermidine (0.5 muM). ODQ (10 muM), a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, and KT5823 (2 muM), a protein kinase G inhibitor, also prevented the inhibitory effect of spermidine on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity. Spermidine (0.5 and 1.0 muM) increased NO(2) plus NO(3) (NOx) levels in slices, and MK-801 (100 muM) and arcaine (0.5 muM) prevented the effect of spermidine (0.5 muM) on the NOx content. These results suggest that spermidine-induced decrease of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity involves NMDA receptor/NOS/cGMP/PKG pathway.",
