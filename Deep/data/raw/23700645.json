     "AB": "Opioids such as morphine are commonly used analgesics in clinical practice. Three opioid receptors that mediate opioid effects have been identified with molecular cloning: delta, delta (enkephalin-preferring); kappa, kappa (dynorphin-preferring); and mu, micro (ss-endorphin-preferring) (1). Each type of opioid receptor consists of subtypes of receptors as suggested by pharmacological studies (2, 3). These receptors have high specificity in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and their presence is ubiquitous. The opioid receptors (G-protein-coupled; decrease adenylyl cyclase activity) play an important role in the regulation of analgesia, shock, appetite, thermoregulation, cardiovascular, and mental and endocrine function (2-5). Although micro opioid receptors are the major receptor to mediate the analgesic effects of opioids, kappa opioid receptors (KOR) and delta opioid receptors are also important in antinociception. Opioids have been found to protect cells from ischemia injury in the heart and brain via the delta receptors. On the other hand, the kappa antagonist prevents neurodegeneration. In humans, the kappa1 and kappa2 KORs are the most abundant brain opioid receptors and are widely distributed in deeper layers of the neocortex (particularly temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices), striatum, and thalamus, with lower levels in the amygdala, hippocampus, occipital cortex, and cerebellum (6, 7). The KORs have been implicated in several clinical brain disorders, including substance abuse (8), epilepsy (9), Tourette's syndrome (10), and Alzheimer's disease (11). (+/-)-4-Methoxycarbonyl-2-[1-pyrrolidinylmethyl]-1-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl]-p iperidine (GR89696) is a novel, highly potent, and selective KOR agonist (12). The (-)-isomer, (-)-4-methoxycarbonyl-2-[1-pyrrolidinylmethyl]-1-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl]-pip eridine, also known as GR103545, is the more potent optical isomer of GR89696 (IC50, 0.018 nM versus 6.0 nM, respectively). GR89696 is centrally penetrating, with a log P value of 3.14, and it has potent antinociceptive, sedative, and diuretic effects. The Ki values for GR89696 kappa1- and kappa2-receptor binding are in the low nanomolar or subnanomolar range. GR89696 is an agonist for the kappa2 opioid receptor and an antagonist for the kappa1 receptor in the guinea pig hippocampus (13). [(11)C]GR103545 was studied as a positron emission tomography (PET) agent for use with the noninvasive study of kappa opioid receptors in the brain. However, there is a need for KOR antagonist radioligands because they tend to bind to both high- and low-affinity receptors (14). Hence, antagonists bind to a higher number of receptors than the agonists (15). (S)-3-Chloro-4-(4-((2-(pyridine-3-yl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)methyl)phenoxy)benzamide (LY2795050) was determined to be a selective KOR antagonist. Zheng et al. (16) prepared and evaluated [carbonyl-(11)C]LY2795050 ([(11)C]LY2795050) for use with in vivo PET imaging of KOR distribution in monkey brain tissue.",
