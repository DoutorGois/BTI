     "AB": "The cross-immunoreactivity, topography, and fiber projections of the alpha MSH-immunoreactive specific neurons in the forebrain of the rat appear to be distinctly different from that of the neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate opiocortin system. The cell bodies, immunoreactive only to alpha-MSH, have a specific pattern of distribution in the dorsal and lateral hypothalamic regions from the level of the retrochiasmatic region to the premammillary area of the posterior hypothalamus. Immunoreactive fibers of these cells appear to extend into regions of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. An antomical relationship between the immunostained fibers and/or terminals of the arcuate opiocortin pool of neurons and the alpha-MSH-immunoreactive perikarya is described utilizing the ABC (Avidin-Biotin-Peroxidase Complex) and ABC-GO (Glucose Oxidase) or glucose oxidase-antiglucose oxidase complex methods of immunocytochemistry in which two tissue antigens with contrasting colors are demonstrated in the same tissue section.",
