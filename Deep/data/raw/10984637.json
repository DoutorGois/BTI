     "AB": "The effects of gonadal steroids or tamoxifen over the synaptic density of the CA1 region of the hippocampus was investigated in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Chronic oral administration of conjugated equine estrogen, conjugated equine medroxyprogesterone, a combination of both or tamoxifen was performed in ovariectomized (OVX) rats over a period of 60 days. Synaptic density of the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region was evaluated by means of electron microscopy. Significant increases in the range of 34-49% were found for treated animals as compared to OVX controls not subject to hormonal replacement. Our results confirm previously reported effects of estradiol over synaptic density in this region and reports for the first time an effect of medroxyprogesterone (alone or in combination with estrogen) and tamoxifen. Our findings support the notion that hormonal replacement therapy and tamoxifen might have beneficial effects for cognitive function.",
