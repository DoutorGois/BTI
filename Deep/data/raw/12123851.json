     "AB": "We studied the effects of a wasp toxin beta-pompilidotoxin (beta-PMTX) on rat hippocampal CA1 interneurons by the current-clamp technique. The firing patterns of pyramidal neurons and pyramidale interneurons were not affected by beta-PMTX, but in oriens and radiatum interneurons, beta-PMTX converted the action potentials to prolonged depolarizing potentials by slowing the inactivation of Na(+) channels. In lacunosum moleculare interneurons, beta-PMTX induced initial bursting spikes followed by block of succeeding spikes. Comparison of beta-PMTX with a sea anemone toxin, ATX II, revealed that ATX II altered the firing properties of pyramidal neurons and pyramidale interneurons that were unchanged by beta-PMTX. Our results suggest that beta-PMTX modulates Na(+) currents in CA1 interneurons differently in various CA1 neurons and the toxin is useful to classify Na(+) channel subtypes.",
