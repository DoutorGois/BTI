     "AB": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic damage are critical early features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated with amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau. We previously reported that the scaffolding protein RanBP9, which is overall increased in AD, simultaneously promotes Abeta generation and focal adhesion disruption by accelerating the endocytosis of APP and beta1-integrin, respectively. Moreover, RanBP9 induces neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo and mediates Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying such neurotoxic processes. Here, we show that RanBP9 induces the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in mitochondrial superoxides associated with decrease in Bcl-2, increase in Bax protein and oligomerization, fragmentation of mitochondria, and cytochrome c release. RanBP9-induced neurotoxic changes are significantly prevented by the mitochondrial fission inhibitor Mdivi-1 and by classical inhibitors of the mitochondrial apoptosis, XIAP, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xl. RanBP9 physically interacts with the tumor suppressor p73 and increases endogenous p73alpha levels at both transcriptional and post-translational levels;moreover, the knockdown of endogenous p73 by siRNA effectively blocks RanBP9 and Abeta1-42-induced mitochondria-mediated cell death. Conversely, siRNA knockdown of endogenous RanBP9 also suppresses p73-induced apoptosis, suggesting that RanBP9 and p73 have cooperative roles in inducing cell death. Taken together, these finding implicate the RanBP9/p73 complex in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in addition to its role in enhancing Abeta generation.",
