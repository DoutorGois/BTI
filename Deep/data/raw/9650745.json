     "AB": "In the previous study [Takeda et al. (1996) Neurosci Lett 221: 17-21], we reported that the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the external space of neuronal perikarya (extraneuroperikaryal AGE deposits) were significantly abundant in the Alzheimer's brain. In this study, we investigated the spatial relationship of the extraneuroperikaryal AGE (carboxymethyllysine and pentosidine) deposits in astrocytes and microglial cells in the Alzheimer's disease brain using double immunolabelling for AGEs and astrocyte or microglial cell markers. Most of the extraneuroperikaryal AGE deposits were co-localized with glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes. AGE deposit-bearing astrocytes also contained Gomori-positive granules. Furthermore, some of the extraneuroperikaryal AGE deposits were co-localized with microglial cells. These extraneuroperikaryal AGEs may activate astrocyte and microglia, and play a role in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",
