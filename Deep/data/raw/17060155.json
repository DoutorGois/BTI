     "AB": "The paradigm for soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) function in mammalian cells has been built on advancements in our understanding of structural and biochemical aspects of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, involving specifically synaptobrevin, syntaxin 1 and SNAP25. Interestingly, a good number of SNAREs which are not directly involved in neurotransmitter exocytosis, are either brain-enriched or have distinct neuron-specific functions. Syntaxins 12/13 regulates glutamate receptor recycling via its interaction with neuron-enriched endosomal protein of 21 kDa (NEEP21). TI-VAMP/VAMP7 is essential for neuronal morphogenesis and mediates the vesicular transport processes underlying neurite outgrowth. Ykt6 is highly enriched in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and is targeted to a novel compartment in neurons. Syntaxin 16 has a moderate expression level in many tissues, but is rather enriched in the brain. Here, we review and discuss the neuron-specific physiology and possible pathology of these and other (such as SNAP-29 and Vti1a-beta) members of the SNARE family.",
