     "AB": "Dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission has been investigated in striatum and in the septohippocampal pathway of the locomotor activity and memory deficient Snell dwarf mouse. In striatum a sharp decrease in 3-MT levels with a concomitant decrease in DA turnover is indicative of a strong decrement in the functional activity of striatal dopaminergic terminals in the mutant mouse. The observed enhancement in serotoninergic markers (5HT, 5HIAA, 5 HTP), at the opposite, provide evidence for an altered relationship between serotonin and dopamine striatal neurotransmission in the mutant mouse as compared to the normal mouse. Impairment in dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission has also been observed in the septohippocampal pathway where the removal of acidic metabolites of these neurotransmitters from brain appears to be disturbed. The data presented here are discussed with regard to previously noted alterations in cholinergic activity as well as to the behavioral disturbances of the dwarf mutant.",
