     "AB": "Kindling was induced in male wistar rats (280-320 g) by daily ip injections of PTZ in subthreshold doses (30 mg/kg). Repeated administration of PTZ to animals resulted in developing of enhanced seizures and also enhanced seizure susceptibility which could be sustained for a long time (6 months) after last seizure paroxysm. The lesioned hippocampus retarded the manifestation of PTZ kindling, where as lesioned caudate nuclei increased the seizure kindling development. Results also revealed hippocampus as a determinant structure in PTZ kindling formation, which stabilize the epileptic manifestations and make them chronic, at the same time caudate nuclei retarded the epileptic seizures stabilization. This role may be only antiepileptic, and not anti-kindling as is known for caudate nuclei.",
