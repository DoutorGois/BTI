     "AB": "Acute electroconvulsive shock (ECS) causes a significant increase of protein synthesis in depressive patients and such an increase raises the possibility that the regulation of specific proteins and enzymatic activities in the brain might be one of the mechanisms required for the induction of long-term adaptive neurochemical changes after electroconvulsive therapy. In current studies, we investigated and compared simultaneously the short- and long-term effects of an acute ECS on the expression and enzymatic activities of both tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases (TH and TpOH, respectively) in different rat brain areas. Our results demonstrated that an acute ECS produced: (1) a long-lasting decrease in TH and TpOH protein levels in locus ceruleus (LC), ventral tegmental area (VTA) and in TpOH protein level in the raphe centralis (RC), maximal at 72 h, with concomitant changes in mRNA levels and enzymatic activities in the LC only; (2) large increase of TpOH protein levels in the frontal cortex (Cxf) (+145%) and increase of TH protein levels in the hippocampus (Hip) (+207%), maximal at 72 h and 7 days which was not accompanied by corresponding increase of in vivo enzymatic activities. Furthermore, a second ECS increased in vivo TpOH activity in the Cxf (+19%) while decreasing K(m) value (-50%) for tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor. A stability of the observed findings on TpOH activity in the Cxf after repeated ECS might be one of the mechanisms for the antidepressant effects of electroconvulsive therapy.",
