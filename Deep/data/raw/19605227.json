     "AB": "Specific [(3)H]corticosterone uptake in hippocampus and septum was reduced in socially deprived, as well as in crowding-stressed mice, in comparison with grouped ones. Its magnitude was related to hierarchic rank in the group but unrelated to agressiveness which, in turn, was unaffected by adrenalectomy and corticosterone replacement. A complex, regulatory interplay may exist between limbic specific corticosterone receptors and hypophyso-adrenal activity.",
