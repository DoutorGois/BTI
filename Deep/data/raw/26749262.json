     "AB": "A naphthalimide-based fluorescent probe, LyNP-NO, was designed and synthesized for the selective detection of exogenously and endogenously generated nitric oxide (NO) in C6 glial cells. In addition, LyNP-NO was also explored for monitoring endogenous NO levels in rat hippocampus at various tissue depths by stimulating the brain with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA).",
