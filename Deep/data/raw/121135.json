     "AB": "The histoenzymological mapping of beta-galactosidase in various nuclei and fiber tracts of reptilian cerebral hemisphere (Calotes versicolor) has been reported for the first time. Almost all the enzymatic preparations demonstrate mild activity in the nuclei except one nucleus (HPD) which reveals intense activity. On the other hand, the fiber tracts, in view of the intense activity of the enzyme, have presented themselves as well delineated tracts along their entire courses so much so that in certain nuclei they can be clearly distinguished passing through the nuclei. The metabolic significance of the enzyme in various locales has been discussed.",
