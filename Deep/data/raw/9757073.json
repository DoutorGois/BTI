     "AB": "Changes in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding in different brain areas were investigated in neonatal and adult pigs exposed to psychological stress (weaning) and a physical stressor (repeated snaring). The GR binding was significantly decreased 4 days after weaning in both the hippocampus and the amygdala, but there were no changes in the hypothalamus. Repeated snaring of adult pigs resulted in a significant diminished GR binding only in the hippocampus.",
