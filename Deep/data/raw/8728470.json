     "AB": "Brain pH is thought to be an influential factor in determining susceptibility to seizures. We compared the susceptibility of brain slices from carbonic anhydrase II (CA II)-deficient mice to epileptiform activity induced by low extracellular [Mg2+], with slices from normal littermates, both bathed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid at pH 7.3. In both entorhinal cortex and hippocampal field CA1, epileptiform activity started earlier in CA II-deficient slices. Raising extracellular [CO2] (20%; extracellular pH, 6.7) reversibly blocked the epileptiform activity in normal, but not in CA II-deficient, slices. The data, combined with previous in vivo findings showing an increased resistance of mutants to seizures, suggest the presence of in vivo anticonvulsant acidosis with long-term compensatory changes that lead to in vitro 'proconvulsant' behavior in CA II-deficient slices clamped at pH 7.3.",
