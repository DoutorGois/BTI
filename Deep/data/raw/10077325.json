     "AB": "Glucocorticoids are toxic to hippocampal neurons. We report here that the steroid dehydroepiandrosterone protects neurons of primary hippocampal cultures against the toxic effects of corticosterone. Corticosterone (20-500 nM) added for 24h to primary cultures of embryonic day 18 rat hippocampus resulted in significant neurotoxicity. Dissociated cells were grown for at least 10 days, initially in serum-containing medium, but serum was removed before adding steroids for 24 h. Neurotoxicity was measured by counting the number of cells stained either for beta-tubulin III or glial fibrillary acidic protein. Corticosterone-induced toxicity was prevented by co-treatment of the cultures with dehydroepiandrosterone (20-500 nM). Dehydroepiandrosterone on its own had little effect, though the highest concentration used (500 nM) was mildly toxic. Immunohistochemical studies on the nuclear translocation of a range of stress-activated protein kinases showed that stress-activated protein kinases 1, 2, 3 and 4 were all translocated by 10 min exposure to corticosterone (100 nM). Dehydroepiandrosterone (100 nM) attenuated the translocation of stress-activated protein kinase 3, but not the others. These experiments show that dehydroepiandrosterone has potent anti-glucocorticoid actions on the brain, and can protect hippocampal neurons from glucocorticoid-induced neurotoxicity. This protective action may involve stress-activated protein kinase 3-related intracellular pathways, though direct evidence for this has still to be obtained.",
