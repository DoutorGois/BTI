     "AB": "We determined the concentration of the messenger RNA species which encode four (m1-m4) of the five cloned muscarinic receptors in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients as compared to age-matched controls. Assays were performed using the quantitative method of DNA-excess solution hybridization in the cerebral cortex (frontal, temporal and occipital), hippocampus, nucleus basalis of Meynert and brainstem. The results suggest a statistically significant decrease in the m1 muscarinic receptor message in the temporal and occipital cortex, with no change in other regions. There was no change in the level of mRNA encoding the m2, m3 or m4 receptors in any of the brain regions studied.",
