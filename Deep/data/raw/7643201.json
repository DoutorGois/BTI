     "AB": "Using confocal microscopy in conjunction with microdrop application of Dil, we have imaged and measured individual dendritic spines of living hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute brain slices, before and approximately 3 hr after induction of long-term potentiation by chemical means. Statistical analysis of changes in the length of individual spines, and comparison with results of Monte Carlo simulations, suggests that two forms of structural change occur in chemically induced long-term potentiation: growth of a subpopulation of small spines, and angular displacement of spines. These changes could provide a structural basis for the expression of long-term potentiation.",
