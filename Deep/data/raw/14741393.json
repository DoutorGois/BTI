     "AB": "The mossy fiber system in the hippocampus of amygdaloid-kindled rats was examined by using highly polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) as a marker for immunohistochemical detection of immature dentate granule cells and mossy fibers in combination with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling of newly generated granule cells. Statistically significant increases in BrdU-labeled cells and PSA-NCAM-positive cells occurred in the dentate gyrus following kindling. The increase in PSA-NCAM-immunoreactive neurites was confined to the entire stratum lucidum of CA3. Immunoelectron-microscopic examination also revealed that PSA-NCAM-positive immature synaptic terminals of the sprouting mossy fibers increased in the stratum lucidum of CA3 in the kindled rats. The increase in the numbers of PSA-NCAM-positive granule cells correlated well with the increase in the immunopositive neurites and synaptic terminals on the mossy fiber trajectory. The increase in these PSA-NCAM-immunopositive structures is thought to reflect the enhancement of sprouting and synaptogenesis of mossy fibers by a subset of granule cells newly generated during amygdaloid-kindling and suggests that the reorganization of the mossy fiber system on the normal trajectory at least in part contributes to the acquisition and maintenance of an epileptogenic state.",
