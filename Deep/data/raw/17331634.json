     "AB": "Effects of exercise in animals with epilepsy have been demonstrated. To investigate whether the type of physical activity, voluntary or forced, would promote different morphological changes in hippocampal formation we performed an immunocytochemical study using the parvalbumin (PV) distribution as a marker. Control rats and rats with epilepsy were submitted to a voluntary (wheel running) and forced (treadmill) exercise for 10 days (acute physical exercise) or 45 days (chronic physical exercise). It was observed in normal rats a higher number of PV-positive cells in the hilus of dentate gyrus (DG) in the voluntary and forced exercise groups (acute and chronic physical exercise), when compared to the control group. In animals with epilepsy the number of PV-positive cells and staining intensity of PV-fibers in the hilus was significantly higher only in the acute physical exercise (voluntary and forced). These findings demonstrate that acute physical exercise, both voluntary and forced results in increased number of PV-positive cells and staining intensity of PV-fibers in the hilus of rats with epilepsy and the occurrence of these changes takes place only in the early phase of epilepsy.",
