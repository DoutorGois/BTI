     "AB": "The combination of retrograde transport of fluorescent dyes and indirect immunofluorescence has been used to study the putative neurotransmitter specificity of the tuberal lateral hypothalamic projection to the cerebral cortex. Injections of either fast blue or diamidino yellow dye into the cerebral cortex or hippocampus retrogradely labeled large, multipolar neurons scattered through the lateral hypothalamic area and zona incerta at the level of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. Approximately 80% of these neurons stained immunohistochemically with an antiserum against alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). A second population of smaller, predominantly bipolar alpha-MSH-like immunoreactive neurons was seen in the arcuate nucleus and retrochiasmatic area, but none of these projected to the cerebral cortex. Immunohistochemical staining for ACTH (18-24), another proopiomelanocortin series peptide, or with an antiserum against alpha-MSH (4-10) demonstrated only the second of these cell groups. Our results indicate that the tuberal lateral hypothalamic projection to the cerebral cortex contains a substance similar but not identical to alpha-MSH, and that this material is probably not derived from the same proopiomelanocortin precursor as true alpha-MSH.",
