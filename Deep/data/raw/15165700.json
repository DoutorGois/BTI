     "AB": "Increasing evidence suggests that cholesterol plays a central role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Caveolin is a cholesterol-binding membrane protein involved in cellular cholesterol transport. We investigated the changes in the protein amount of hippocampal caveolin of autopsy-confirmed AD and aged-matched control subjects. Our results demonstrate that caveolin protein levels in the hippocampus and caveolin mRNA in the frontal cortex are up-regulated in AD by approximately two-fold, compared to control brains. These results suggest a relationship between caveolin-1 expression levels and a dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis at the plasma membrane of brain cells. In support of this hypothesis, a significant increase in caveolin protein levels has also been observed in hippocampal tissue from ApoE-deficient (knockout) and aged wild-type mice; two situations associated with modifications of transbilayer distribution of cholesterol in brain synaptic plasma membranes. These results indicate that caveolin over-expression is linked to alterations of cholesterol distribution in the plasma membrane of brain cells and are consistent with the notion of a deterioration of cholesterol homeostasis in AD.",
