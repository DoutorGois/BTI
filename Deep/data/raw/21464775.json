     "AB": "Homer1a, an activity-dependent induced member of the scaffold protein family Homer, plays an essential role in synaptic reorganization and is widely used as a neuronal activity marker. However, the cell type transcribing Homer1a remains unidentified. Here, we investigated the main cell types of the amygdala, hippocampus, primary somatosensory cortex, and dorsal striatum that express Homer1a. Homer1a expression relevant to the baseline neural activity as well as exposure to unfamiliar and conditioned contexts was preferentially detected in the excitatory neurons within the basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, and neocortex, and in inhibitory neurons within the central amygdala and dorsal striatum. These findings indicate that Homer1a is expressed in the principal neurons of each region regardless of whether they are excitatory or inhibitory neurons.",
