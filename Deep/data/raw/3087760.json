     "AB": "The breakdown of inositol phospholipid (PI) stimulated by hippocampal noradrenaline in rat miniprisms in vitro was used as an index of alpha 1-adrenoceptor function after selective noradrenergic denervation. Selective denervation was produced by microinjections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into either the dorsal noradrenergic bundle (DNAB) or the locus coeruleus (LC), or by systemic treatment with the noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP4 (N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine). Fourteen days after these treatments, there was a large depletion of cortical noradrenaline but no change in the stimulation of hippocampal PI breakdown by noradrenaline. It is concluded that selective noradrenergic denervation under the conditions used here does not lead to hippocampal alpha 1-adrenoceptor supersensitivity as assessed by noradrenaline-stimulated PI breakdown.",
