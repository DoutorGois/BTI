     "AB": "Stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy (SLAH) uses laser interstitial thermal therapy guided by magnetic resonance thermography. This novel intervention can achieve seizure freedom while minimizing collateral damage compared to traditional open surgery, in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. An algorithm is presented to guide treatment decisions for initial and repeat procedures in patients with and without mesial temporal sclerosis. SLAH may improve access by medication-refractory patients to effective surgical treatments and thereby decrease medical complications, increase productivity, and minimize socioeconomic consequences in patients with chronic epilepsy.",
