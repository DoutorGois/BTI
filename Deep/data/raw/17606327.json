     "PG": "734-45",
     "AB": "In this study, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) were examined at five time points [postnatal day (P)11, 15, 20, 21, and 68 (the latter with or without behavioral testing)] during and after P11-20 (+)-methamphetamine (MA) (10 mg/kg 4 x day) treatment. BDNF in MA-treated animals was elevated on P15 and P20 in the hippocampus but not in the hypothalamus and was unchanged on P11 and P21. On P68 (1 h after Morris water maze testing) MA-treated offspring showed a trend toward higher levels of BDNF in the hippocampus than saline-treated animals. MA treatment increased NGF levels in the hippocampus but only on P20. No effect of MA treatment was observed in the elevated zero maze. MA-treated offspring had increased latencies, cumulative distances, path lengths, and first bearings in the Morris water maze. The findings indicate that early MA exposure induces hippocampal BDNF increases that precede the later emergence of spatial learning deficits.",
