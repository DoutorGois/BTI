     "AB": "Apoptosis is known to occur in the limbic system after myocardial infarction (MI) in the rat. Our study was designed to evaluate the time course dynamics of this phenomenon in limbic areas. Apoptosis, i.e., caspase-3 activity and the number of terminal dUTP nick-end labelling-positive cells, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were quantitated in sham-operated controls and MI rats 1, 2 and 7 days after surgery. Both apoptosis parameters were increased throughout, although in different structures: the CA1 region of the hippocampus and the medial amygdala at day 1, the CA1 region of the hippocampus and the lateral amygdala at day 2, and the frontal cortex at day 7. At day 2, BDNF was decreased in the prefrontal cortex and medial amygdala, whereas it was elevated in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus; at day 7, BDNF was reduced in the frontal cortex and posterior hypothalamus but was augmented in the medial amygdala. These data indicate that post-MI apoptosis in the limbic system is a dynamic process occurring mainly in the hippocampus and amygdala during the first days after MI. The fact that BDNF was increased as early as 2 days after MI suggests that neurogenesis can occur rapidly in selected limbic regions after MI.",
