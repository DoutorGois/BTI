     "AB": "The translocator protein (TSPO) is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein involved in the transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria, which is the first step for the synthesis of steroid hormones, as well as in the regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening and apoptosis. Studies have shown that the activation of TSPO may promote neuroprotective actions in experimental models of neurodegeneration and brain injury. In a previous study, our group showed that 4'-chlorodiazepam (4'-CD), a TSPO ligand, was neuroprotective against amyloid-beta (Abeta) in SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate if 4'-CD was also neuroprotective against Abeta in organotypic hippocampal cultures and to identify its mechanisms of action. Abeta decreased the cell viability of organotypic hippocampal cultures, while 4'-CD had a neuroprotective effect when administered at 100nM and 1000nM. The neuroprotective effects of 4'-CD against Abeta were associated with an increased expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD). No differences were found in the expression of catalase, glial fibrillary acidic protein, Akt and procaspase-3. In summary, our results show that 4'-CD is neuroprotective against Abeta by a mechanism involving the modulation of SOD protein expression.",
