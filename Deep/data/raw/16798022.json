     "AB": "The effects of beta amyloid (Abeta) on cytoplasmic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](c)) have been studied extensively, but the current literature on this aspect is confusing. We reported that 20 microM Abeta(25-35) significantly inhibited the synchronized spontaneous cytoplasmic Ca(2+) transients immediately after application, whereas it had little effect on the baseline [Ca(2+)](c) concentration in neurons. Abeta(1-42) had a similar effect on the Ca(2+) transients as Abeta(25-35), while it increased baseline [Ca(2+)](c) concentration gradually. However, Abeta(1-40) had little effect on either Ca(2+) transients or baseline [Ca(2+)](c). Such differential effects of Abeta on Ca(2+) signals might explain, at least partially, the confusing observations from the previous studies and provide important therapeutic implications for preventing or reversing early neuron damage in Alzheimer's disease.",
