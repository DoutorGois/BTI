     "AB": "Sepsis is associated with high morbidity and mortality. This study was to investigate the protective effects of electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment with different waveforms on septic brain injury in rats and its mechanism. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated by EA with different waveforms (continuous wave, dilatational wave, or intermittent wave) at Baihui (GV20) and Tsusanli (ST36) acupoints for 30min, and underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation. The results showed that EA pretreatment with different waveforms improved survival rate, attenuated encephaledema, brain injury, neuronal apoptosis and cognitive dysfunction, and preserved blood-brain barrier (BBB). EA pretreatment decreased the production of tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-alpha, interleukin(IL)-6, malondialdehyde (MDA), and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in serum and hippocampus at 48h after sham or CLP operation. Additionally, EA pretreatment downregulated the expressions of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1(Iba 1). The effect of dilatational wave was the most significant, followed by intermittent wave, and continuous wave was relatively poor. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that EA pretreatment with three waveforms alleviates sepsis-induced brain injury by inhibition of microglial activation and attenuation of inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. These findings suggest that EA pretreatment with dilatational wave at Baihui and Tsusanli acupoints might be a promising therapeutic strategy for relieving septic brain injury.",
