     "AB": "An animal model of experimental autoimmune nigral damage (EAND) has been developed in guinea pigs by immunization with hybrid dopaminergic cells (MES 23.5). In such animals, loss of 40% of the substantia nigra (SN) neurons and damage to an additional 10% of SN neurons was associated with a 37-43% decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity and a 36% decrease of dopamine (DA) content in the nigral-striatum. Eight of the thirteen animals developed significant hypokinesia. The EAND model suggests that degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in SN can be caused by immune-mediated processes, which may help our understanding of the pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease.",
