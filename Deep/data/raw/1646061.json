     "AB": "1. The action of analogues and C-terminal fragments of neuropeptide Y (NPY) was examined on excitatory synaptic transmission in area CA1 of the rat hippocampal slice in vitro, by use of intracellular and extracellular recordings, to determine by agonist profile the NPY receptor subtype mediating presynaptic inhibition. 2. Neither NPY, analogues nor fragments of NPY affected the passive or active properties of the post-synaptic CA1 pyramidal neurones, indicating their action is at a presynaptic site. 3. The full-sequence analogues, peptide YY (PYY) and human NPY (hNPY), were equipotent with NPY at the presynaptic receptor, while desamido hNPY was without activity. 4. NPY2-36 was equipotent with NPY. Fragments as short as NPY 13-36 were active, but gradually lost activity with decreasing length. NPY 16-36 had no effect on extracellular field potentials, but still significantly inhibited excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes. Fragments shorter than NPY 16-36 had no measurable effect on synaptic transmission. 5. The presynaptic NPY receptor in hippocampal CA1 therefore shares an identical agonist profile with the presynaptic Y2 receptor at the peripheral sympathetic neuroeffector junction.",
