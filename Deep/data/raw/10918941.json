     "AB": "The neurotoxicity of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, CAS 13755-38-9) was examined using primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. The cell viability was significantly reduced after the cultures were co-incubated with IL-6 4, 40, 400 ng/ml or SNP 1, 10, 100 mumol/l for 24 h. In addition, N omega-nitro-L-arginine (NNA, CAS 2149-70-4) at 0.1 mmol/l, when co-added with IL-6 400 ng/ml in cultures, significantly increased IL-6 reduced viability from 78.3 +/- 6.7% to 113.3 +/- 10.0%. These results indicate that IL-6 exerts neurotoxicity on cultured hippocampal neurons probably via overformation of nitric oxide in cultures.",
