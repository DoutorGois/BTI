In view of an earlier finding that the CA1 region does not suffer normal age-related neuronal loss, these data support the earlier conclusion that the neuropathologic mechanisms involved in the AD-related losses in CA1 are not related to normal aging and that the study of the cellular and molecular events involved in the AD-related loss of CA1 cells can aid in the identification of the unique pathologic processes associated with AD.",
