     "AB": "[125I]CGP 42112, first developed to identify angiotensin II receptor subtype 2 (AT2), was recently shown to bind to a novel non-angiotensin binding site in injured rat brain tissue. We addressed the question whether non-angiotensin [125I]CGP 42112 binding appears after kainic acid induced hippocampal neurodegeneration, a process of neuronal cell death at a distance from the toxin injection site. After intraventricular kainic acid injection, we found non-angiotensin [125I]CGP 42112 binding in the hippocampal areas CA3 (4 and 14 days after injection), CA1 and CA4 and the subiculum (14 days after injection). In addition, 14 days after kainic acid injection, [125I]CGP 42112 binding was found in 50% of the animals, in the thalamus, amygdala and piriform cortex, areas receiving projections from the hippocampus and suffering kainic acid induced delayed neurodegeneration. The loss of neurons in these regions was accompanied by an accumulation of activated microglia as demonstrated by immunostaining with the specific antibodies OX-42 and ED1. The time course and regional pattern of OX-42/ED1 positive immunostaining was identical with the appearance and distribution of the non-angiotensin [125I]CGP 42112 binding site. The non-angiotensin [125I]CGP 42112 binding was not detected in brain regions unaffected by kainic acid injection. Our findings indicate the expression of a novel [125I]CGP 42112 binding site on activated microglia. This site appears at a distance from the lesion and may be of importance in the process of neuronal death and brain tissue repair.",
