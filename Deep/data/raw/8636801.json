     "AB": "Correlation of myelin-stained or cryotomic sections of human brain with inversion-recovery MR images can display the cerebral commissures as white-matter tracts (in hypersignal on MRI), crossing the mid-line. MRI shows routinely in three orthogonal planes a) the corpus callosum stretched above the supra-tentorial ventricles, it's four portions (rostrum, genu, body and splenium) and connections with the Deep Grey Nuclei b) the fornix, intralimbic commissure joining anteriorly the mammillary bodies (through it's columns) to the alveus posteriorly and inferiorly (via it's two crura), arcing around the thalamus and lying over the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus as shown on the frontal sections c) the anterior commissure, white-matter tract connecting the two temporal lobes. In axial view, the anterior commissure has the shape of bicycle handlebars, coursing posteriorly, inferiorly and laterally behind the head of the caudate nucleus and passes into the lateral nucleus of the globus pallidus into the inferior and middle temporal gyri. Because the anterior commissure is easily recognisable in all planes, it's appears to be a important landmark for identification of the lateral and medial nuclei of the globus pallidus on axial and sagittal planes d) at least, the posterior commissure, anterior margin of the pineal region, closely related to the superior colliculi, acquire a major importance in the AC-PC line delineation becoming a reference landmark for stereotatical procedures.",
