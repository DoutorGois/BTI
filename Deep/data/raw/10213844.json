     "AB": "This is a review on the ontogenesis of major neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the developing human central nervous system. In general, the molecules under study appeared early in development, usually in the first trimester. Cholinergic neurons were found to be present around the time of neuropeptide formation. The newly formed neuropeptidergic fibers extended towards the cholinergic centers where both might interact. In the major centers of the central nervous system, neuropeptides were also noted to colocalize with various neurotransmitters. For example, in the facial nucleus, enkepahlin and substance P fibers coexisted with cholinergic and catecholaminergic neurons, suggesting complex interactions. In the interpeduncular nucleus, peptidergic neurons acting as interneurons clearly modulated the afferent input to this nucleus. In the hippocampus and in sensory organs such as the retina, there were indications that neuropeptides and gamma-amino butyric acid coexisted. We hypothesize that interactions of neurotransmitters and peptides in neurons and fibers early in development play an indispensable role in the morphogenesis of the human central nervous system.",
