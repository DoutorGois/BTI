     "AB": "The \"sex-hormone\" estrogen-17beta promotes several cognitive functions and is a master regulator of brain bioenergetics via the estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta). In this work, by using Real-Time PCR analysis, we evaluated the effect of aging and high fat diet (HFD) on ERalpha and ERbeta expression in rat hippocampus and cortex. In young rats, ERbeta is abundant in cortex and ERalpha in hippocampus. During the aging, in the cortex, we observe a general decrease in ERalpha and ERbeta expression; in hippocampus ERalpha increases and ERbeta decreases. ER expression patterns in rat brain are also affected by the administration of an HFD. In cortex, after 4weeks of HFD, ERbeta transcripts are down-regulated, whereas ERalpha levels remain unchanged; after 12weeks, both ERalpha and ERbeta expression is up-regulated. In the hippocampus, the level of ERbeta transcripts does not change following HDF, whereas ERalpha expression is affected by HDF, in a time-dependent manner: it increases after the 4-week treatment and decreases after 12weeks. Possible involvements of these receptors in the control of cortex and hippocampus functions during aging and in the modulation of energetic metabolism and feeding behaviour are discussed.",
