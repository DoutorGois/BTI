     "AB": "We have recently demonstrated high theta-phase synchronization between the lateral amygdala and CA1 area of the hippocampus during retrieval of long-term (1 day) fear memory, and not during short-term (2 h) or remote memory retrieval (30 days). These results indicated that the amygdalo-hippocampal interaction reflects a dynamic change of ensemble activities related to various stages of fear memory storage. In this study, we investigated theta activity during the reconsolidation of a remote contextual fear memory by re-exposing animals to the shock context 30 days after training. Consistent with our previous results, high theta synchronization was no longer apparent during re-exposure to the shock context, but was significantly higher 1 day after context re-exposure. These data indicate that the reconsolidation of remote contextual fear memory includes changes in ensemble activities between the lateral amygdala and CA1.",
