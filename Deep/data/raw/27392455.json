     "AB": "Glutamatergic neuron activity and/or the modification of the activity with glucocorticoids are closely linked to synaptic Zn(2+) dynamics as well as synaptic Ca(2+) dynamics. The dynamic crosstalk of synaptic Zn(2+) signaling to intracellular Ca(2+) signaling via calcium channels is involved in synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognitive activity. The influx of extracellular Zn(2+) into postsynaptic neurons, which is closely linked to glutamate signaling in the synaptic cleft, is critical for cognitive activity. However, excess intracellular Zn(2+) signaling induced by excess glutamatergic neuron activity is involved in not only cognitive decline in neurological disorders but also stress-induced cognitive decline. On the other hand, it has been recognized that excess Ca(2+) influx into postsynaptic neurons induces neuronal death, while the involvement of excess intracellular Ca(2+) signaling in cognitive decline is poorly understood. Understanding of synaptic Zn(2+) dynamics, which are modified by glutamate and glucocorticoid signaling, may be meaningful to prevent Zn(2+)-mediated cognitive decline. This paper summarizes the current knowledge on Zn(2+) dynamics under changing synaptic environment and its impact on cognitive decline.",
