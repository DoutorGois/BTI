     "AB": "The flux control coefficient of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), for the in vivo synthesis of the key biological mediator nitric oxide (NO), was determined in four rat brain regions with varying NOS activities (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum) using metabolic control theory. Flux control coefficients were calculated from the ratio of the initial slopes of the fractional effect of the NOS inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA) on NO pathway flux and NOS activity. Under conditions of normal behaviour in the rat, NOS had a flux control coefficient not significantly different from one in all regions examined. These data demonstrate that the large majority of flux control for the synthesis of NO in the brain resides in NOS itself and not in the transport of its amino acid precursor, L-arginine, across the blood-brain or neuronal cell membranes. This paper describes the first example in which the control of metabolic flux has been quantified in a mammalian system in vivo and demonstrates the power of metabolic control theory to elucidate the distribution of control within a metabolic pathway in vivo.",
