     "AB": "Memory tasks can be performed using multiple cognitive strategies, which are mediated by different brain systems. The transverse patterning (TP) task is dependent upon the integrity of the hippocampal system, however, we previously demonstrated successful TP following hippocampal damage using meaningful stimuli and relations (Moses, S.N., Ostreicher, M.L., Rosenbaum, R.S., Ryan, J.D., 2008. Successful transverse patterning in amnesia using semantic knowledge. Hippocampus 18, 121-124). Here, we used magnetoencephalgraphy (MEG) to directly observe the neural underpinnings of TP, and the changes that occur as stimuli and relations become more meaningful. In order to optimize our ability to detect signal from deep, non-dominant, brain sources we implemented the event-related synthetic aperture magnetometry minimum-variance beamformer algorithm (ER-SAM; Cheyne, D., Bakhtazad, L., Gaetz, W., 2006. Spatiotemporal mapping of cortical activity accompanying voluntary movements using an event-related beamforming approach. Human Brain Mapping 27, 213-229) coupled with the partial least squares (PLS) multivariate statistical approach (McIntosh, A.R., Bookstein, F.L., Haxby, J.V., Grady, C.L., 1996. Spatial pattern analysis of function brain images using partial least squares. NeuroImage 3, 143-157; McIntosh, A.R., Lobaugh, N.J., 2004. Partial least squares analysis of neuroimaging data: Applications and advances. NeuroImage 23, S250-S263). We found that increased meaningfulness elicited reduced bilateral hippocampal activation, along with increased activation of left prefrontal and temporal cortical structures, including inferior frontal (IFG), as well as anterior temporal and perirhinal cortices. These activation patterns may represent a shift towards reliance upon existing semantic knowledge. This shift likely permits successful TP performance with meaningful stimuli and relations following hippocampal damage.",
