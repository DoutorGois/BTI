     "AB": "Excitatory amino acids have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. In the present study, kainate, quisqualate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subclasses of L-glutamate receptors were measured in adult rat brain by quantitative receptor autoradiography following surgical construction of an end-to-side portacaval anastomosis (PCA). PCA resulted in sustained hyperammonemia and decreased binding of L-glutamate to the NMDA receptor when compared to sham-operated controls. Decreases in binding ranged from 17 to 39% in several regions of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. Binding to quisqualate and kainate receptor subtypes was not altered. PCA leads to astrocytic changes in brain but does not result in any measurable loss of neuronal integrity. It is therefore proposed that decreased glutamate binding to the NMDA receptor following PCA results from increased extracellular glutamate caused by decreased reuptake into perineuronal astrocytes and a compensatory down-regulation of these receptors. Such changes could be of pathophysiological significance in hepatic encephalopathy.",
