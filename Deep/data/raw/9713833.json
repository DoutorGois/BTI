     "AB": "Several forms of long-term potentiation (LTP), a putative cellular mechanism for memory storage, have been described in the hippocampus. In this review, I discuss the mechanisms of induction and expression of LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapses and at the mossy fiber pathway. The early biochemical steps responsible for LTP at these two pathways are well understood. However, future studies should transcend the study of signal transduction systems and focus on the identification of the synaptic proteins that experience activity-dependent modifications, ultimate effectors of the plastic changes.",
