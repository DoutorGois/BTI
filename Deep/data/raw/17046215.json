     "AB": "Primary neuronal cultures on substrates patterned with extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin have yielded much information regarding the physiological characteristics of neuronal cells in vitro. Surface charge also influences neuronal adherence, and a positive charge can have stimulatory effects. The attraction between laminin patterns and polycation films are of interest in the study of neuronal adhesion. We cultured primary hippocampal neurons on poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) films with laminin grids and evaluated their viability and morphology by means of fluorescent microscopy after 5-7 days. The results showed that the neurons did not form networks on the laminin grids. It is inferred that the PEI films were more favourable for neuronal adhesion than the laminin grid.",
