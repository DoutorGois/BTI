     "AB": "A series of experiments was carried out both in the hippocampal pyramidal and thalamic ventrobasal neurons to investigate the effect of serotonin level in the brain on slow fluctuations of neuronal discharges. Single neuronal activities were recorded in the following two pharmacologically treated states: (1) a 5-hydroxytryptamine depleted state by p-chlorophenylalanine administration (PCPA phase) and (2) a 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine administered state under the PCPA pretreatment (5-MeODMT phase). The slow fluctuations of neuronal activities in the frequency range of 0.02-1.0 Hz in both nuclei were prominent during the PCPA phase and were similar to those during the paradoxical sleep. In contrast, slow fluctuations were suppressed during the 5-MeODMT phase and neuronal activities during this phase were similar to those during slow wave sleep (SWS). The results show that serotonin in the brain definitely plays a role in stabilizing single neuronal activities.",
