     "AB": "A 10-min bilateral carotid occlusion (BCO) in Mongolian gerbils induces transient generalized epileptic discharges in the hippocampal and cortical regions, which are followed by long lasting interictal spiking activity. An initial peak of this activity occurs within 18-36 h after BCO, then it decreases slowly and completely disappears by the 6th-7th day. On the 7th day, morphological evidence shows a selective loss of CA1 hippocampal neurons. 4-(3-Phosphonopropyl)-2-piperazine-carboxylic acid (CPP), a competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor was administered (7 or 15 mg/kg i.p.) immediately after clamping, and again every 12 h for 3 consecutive days. It induced a dose-related depression of epileptic activity, while, on the other hand, at both dosages, it always prevented the loss of CA1 neurons. The results are discussed in view of the different mechanisms mediating cell damage and epileptic activity.",
