     "AB": "The beta-isomer of kainic acid has been reported to have anticonvulsant activity with a profile suggesting amino acid antagonism. The present study, on neurons in the cerebral cortex of anaesthetised rats or in hippocampal slices, shows that beta-kainate does not antagonise any of the major agonists at amino acid receptors: N-methylaspartate, quisqualic acid or alpha-kainic acid. beta-Kainate does have an excitant action of its own which can be partially reduced by 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid but is unaffected by gamma-D-glutamylglycine. It is blocked completely by kynurenic acid.",
