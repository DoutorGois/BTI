     "AB": "Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament of astrocytes, shows increased expression during aging. Because we found that chronic food restriction retards the increase of GFAP mRNA in aging rats and because food restriction decreases the load of oxidized proteins and lipids in association with increased life span, we investigated the regulation of GFAP during oxidative stress and aging. First, we showed that food restriction decreased the transcription of GFAP in aging rats. This result generalizes effects of food restriction on age changes of transcription; whether transcription decreases during aging as in hepatic genes, or increases during aging as in astrocytic GFAP, food restriction attenuates the age change. Moreover, food restriction decreased microglial activation during aging, which suggested the hypothesis that GFAP expression is sensitive to oxidative stress. Because GFAP transcription in cultured glia is increased by oxidative stress in response to hydrogen peroxide and cysteamine whether or not microglia were present, we conclude that responses of GFAP to oxidative stress in astrocytes do not depend on microglial activation. The results implicate oxidative stress in the increased expression of GFAP during aging, but also in responses to brain injury.",
