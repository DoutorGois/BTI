     "AB": "A method is described allowing quantitative determination of leucine from biological material up to 1 - 10(-11) M by means of dansylation of amino acids and their thin-layer chromatographic separation on polyamide microfoils. By selecting [14C]-U-L-leucine as an 'internal' standard, which is added to the tissue during the homogenization procedure, it is possible to correct for data scattering related to variations of the conversion rate or the yield of the dansylation reaction, and to losses in the different steps of thin-layer chromatography that are difficult to standardize.",
