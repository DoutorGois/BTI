     "AB": "Acute effects of the atypical tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) trimipramine on long-term potentiation (LTP) were investigated in this study. Electrically evoked population spikes (PS) were tested under the influence of trimipramine in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. A concentration of 10 microM trimipramine reduced PS amplitudes to 85.1 +/- 8.8%. They were reduced to 12.2 +/- 8.5% with 50 microM trimipramine. In experiments with LTP, trimipramine 10 microM was applied. Only 8 of 10 tested slices showed LTP. These potentiations were smaller than in the control experiments. LTP could not be induced with 50 microM trimipramine. In conclusion, the influence of trimipramine on LTP is similar to other TCA. It is contended that this contributes to the antidepressant effect of the drug.",
