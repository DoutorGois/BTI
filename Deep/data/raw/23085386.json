     "AB": "The present study aimed to characterize dopamine release in the hippocampus and D2-like receptor-induced Gi protein activation in several brain areas of fully kindled rats. During the interictal period, kindled rats showed lower extracellular levels of dopamine when compared with those obtained in the control group under basal conditions, a situation that was not modified when an afterdischarge was evoked. Hippocampal perfusion of sulpiride, a D2 receptor antagonist, enhanced dopamine release, which was more evident when an afterdischarge was induced in kindled rats. In addition, sulpiride perfusion was associated with longer seizure duration. Functional autoradiography experiments revealed increased [(35)S]GTPgammaS incorporation as a consequence of D2-like receptor activation in different brain areas of fully kindled animals, including the ventral hippocampus. The present study reveals that hippocampal kindling is associated with alterations in dopamine release and D2-like receptor-induced neurotransmission.",
