     "AB": "1. The kinetics of open channel block of GluR2-containing and GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors (AMPAR) by dicationic compounds (IEM-1460, IEM-1754, and IEM-1925) have been studied in rat hippocampal neurones using whole-cell patch clamp recording and concentration-jump techniques. Neurones were isolated from hippocampal slices by vibrodissociation. 2. The dicationic compounds were approximately 100 - 200 times more potent as blockers of GluR2-lacking AMPAR than as blockers of GluR2-containing AMPAR. The subunit specificity of channel block is determined by the blocking rate constant of a dicationic compound, whereas differences in unblocking rate constants account for differences in potency. 3. Hyperpolarization may decrease the block produced by IEM-1460 and IEM-1754 block due to the voltage-dependence of the unblocking rate constants for these compounds. This suggests that dicationic compounds permeate the AMPAR channel at negative membrane potentials. The effect was particularly apparent for GluR2-lacking AMPAR. These findings indicate that the presence of GluR2-subunit(s) in AMPAR hinders the binding of the cationic compounds and their permeation through the channel. 4. The most potent compound tested was IEM-1925. The presence of a phenylcyclohexyl moiety instead of an adamantane moiety, as in IEM-1460 and IEM1754, is probably responsible for the higher potency of IEM-1925. Dicationic compounds are important not only as pharmacological tools, but also as templates for the synthesis of new selective AMPAR blockers which may be potential therapeutic agents.",
