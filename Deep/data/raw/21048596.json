     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To identify whether epileptic discharges can be conducted out of the brain according to the principle of a lightning rod. METHODS: This experimental study was conducted at Central South University, Xiangya Hospital, Hunan, China between 2005 and 2008. Eighty Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with intra hippocampus and intra frontal lobe electrodes, and randomized to 3 groups: (A) a group that was kindled via stimulation of intra-hippocampus injection of penicillin, (B) a group that was stimulated via a copper wire connected to the intra-hippocampus electrodes of group A, (C) a group composed of non-stimulated, control rats. The behavioral changes and epileptiform activity were assessed by both Racine Grade and electrocorticogram (ECoG). RESULTS: The intrahippocampal ECoG recordings were coincident with clinical seizures, electrographic seizures occurred not only in the injected hippocampus group A rats, but also in the connected group B rats. However, there were no visible seizures or ECoG burst at any time in group C rats. CONCLUSION: Epileptic discharge can be conducted out of the brain, which may open new therapeutic approaches for epilepsy.",
