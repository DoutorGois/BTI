     "AB": "PURPOSE: This study addresses the question of epileptogenesis by investigating the effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) on the silent period of the pilocarpine model of epilepsy. METHODS: Adult Wistar rats were subjected to status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine and treated with CBZ or saline, i.p, during 56 days. Latency for the first spontaneous seizure, incidence, frequency, and duration of seizures were monitored for < or =56 days after treatment. Hippocampal histologic analysis was performed. RESULTS: CBZ reduced the frequency and duration of the seizures and the hippocampal damage. CONCLUSIONS: CBZ did not abort the epileptogenesis but minimized the expression of seizures and hippocampal damage.",
