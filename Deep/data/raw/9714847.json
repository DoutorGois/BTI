     "AB": "We have isolated a novel cDNA (HiAT3: hippocampus abundant transcript 3) in the course of screening for genes that are preferentially expressed in neonatal mouse hippocampus using random 3'-directed cDNA sequencing approach. It encodes a 180-aa protein that has high similarity to SCG10, a neuron-specific negative regulator of microtubule dynamics during neurite outgrowth. The expression of HiAT3 is limited to neurons and peaks about 1 week after birth. The identification of HiAT3 suggests that there may be an elaborate destabilizing regulation for microtubule dynamics in neurons in addition to the stabilizing effect of multiple microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs).",
