     "AB": "Several types of learning and memory processes are regulated by the hippocampus which is an important subcortical structure in the mammalians' brain. Previous investigations have shown that different receptor systems in the CA1 region of hippocampus are involved in learning and memory functions. Investigating the possible influence of dorsal hippocampal GABA-A receptors on histamine-induced spatial facilitation in adult male Wistar rats was the focus of the current study. Rats were bilaterally implanted with dorsal hippocampal (CA1) cannulae, recovered from surgery and then trained in Morris water maze (MWM) for 4 consecutive days. A block of four trials was given each day. All drugs were injected into CA1 regions, 5min before training. Pre-training intra-CA1 microinjection of muscimol, a GABA-A receptor agonist, at the dose of 0.01 or 0.02mug/rat, increased the traveled distance or the escape latency and traveled distance to the hidden platform, respectively, indicating a water maze spatial acquisition impairment. Intra-CA1 administration of bicuculline, a GABA-A receptor antagonist however, significantly decreased the escape latency and traveled distance to the hidden platform, suggesting a spatial learning facilitation. On the other hand, pre-training intra-CA1 microinjection of the subthreshold dose of muscimol plus different doses of histamine (0.025, 0.05 and 0.1mug/rat) did not alter the histamine response. Meanwhile, the co-administration of the ineffective dose of bicuculline together with histamine potentiated the spatial learning. Moreover, bilateral infusion of histamine (0.025, 0.05 and 0.1mug/rat) by itself, facilitated the spatial learning. Notably, the drug injections had no effect on swimming speed during the MWM training sessions. Our results suggest that the dorsal hippocampal (CA1) GABA-A mechanism(s) may influence the histamine-induced facilitation of spatial acquisition.",
