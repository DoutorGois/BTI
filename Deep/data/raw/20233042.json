     "AB": "The temporal and regional expression profiles of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), after moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) were measured to investigate the effects of post-traumatic hypothermia (33 degrees C) or hyperthermia (39 degrees C). In the first phase of this study, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to groups of moderate TBI (1.8-2.2 atm), severe TBI (2.4-2.7 atm), and sham-injured control. The rats were killed at 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, or 1 week after TBI, for mRNA and protein analysis. In the second phase, rats underwent moderate fluid percussion brain injury, followed immediately by 4 h of post-traumatic normothermia (37 degrees C), hyperthermia (39 degrees C), or hypothermia (32 degrees C). The rats were killed at 12 and 48 h after TBI for mRNA expression analyses, or killed at 24 and 72 h after TBI for protein expression analyses. Brain samples, including the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of each group), were assayed using RT-PCR and Western blot techniques. MMP-9 levels in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were significantly increased after TBI compared with those of sham injured animals (p < 0.01). Two expression peaks of MMP-9 were observed in the ipsilateral cortex and hippocampus. An increase in injury severity was associated with an increase in mRNA (12 and 48 h), and protein (24 and 72 h) levels of MMP-9. Post-traumatic hypothermia attenuated the increase in both the mRNA and protein levels of MMP-9, compared with normothermia and hyperthermia (p < 0.01). In contrast, hyperthermia had no significant effect on mRNA (at 12 h) and protein levels (at 24 h) of MMP-9, compared with normothermic values (p > 0.05), but resulted in a significant increase in the levels of MMP-9 mRNA and protein at 24 and 72 h, respectively (p < 0.01). Increases in MMP-9 mRNA and protein after TBI were proportional to injury severity in this model. The effects of post-traumatic hypothermia on the expression of MMP-9 may partially explain the observed effects of post-traumatic temperature on secondary injury after TBI.",
