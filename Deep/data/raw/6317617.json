     "AB": "Opioid receptors can be localized to the hippocampal formation of the rat by autoradiography. The binding of 3H-enkephalinamide to fixed and mounted tissue sections has all the characteristics associated with binding to opioid receptors. It is saturable, of high affinity and displays stereospecificity. The opioid receptor distribution shows striking regional variation throughout the hippocampal formation. Areas with high density include the pyramidal cell layer of both regio superior (CA1) and regio inferior (CA3), stratum moleculare of the hippocampus, the cell layer of subiculum, the superficial part of presubiculum and the deep layer (VI) of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices. Areas with low to medium densities include regions corresponding to the dendritic field of the pyramidal cells (str. oriens, str. radiatum and the mossy fiber zone), the dentate granule cell layer and the molecular layer of the dentate area. Enkephalin-like immunoreactivity is detected in both intrinsic neuronal systems: 1) the mossy fibers which terminate on the proximal part of the CA3 pyramidal cell dendrites and on CA4 pyramidal cells, 2) cell bodies with multiple short processes, probably interneurons, dispersed throughout the hilus of the dentate area, the pyramidal cell layer of hippocampus, the str. radiatum, and occasionally in the str. moleculare and in the str. oriens, and extrinsic neuronal systems: 1) the lateral perforant path and 2) the lateral temporo-ammonic tract. Thus, the hippocampus contains intrinsic systems of enkephalin-like immunoreactive nerve terminals which may exert their effect on the opioid receptors with a localization corresponding to the pyramidal cells and their apical dendrites. Extrinsic enkephalinergic systems corresponding to the terminal fields of the lateral perforant path and the temporoammonic tract, both of entorhinal origin, may influence the opioid receptors located in the molecular layer of the dentate area, and in the molecular layer of the hippocampus and the subiculum. Thus, the enkephalin-like immunoreactive nerve terminals are all located in areas which contain opioid binding sites. This suggests that the \"opioid peptide-opioid receptor\" systems may regulate hippocampal neuronal activity via neurotransmission or neuromodulation. However, a high or medium number of opioid binding sites occur over the pyramidal cell bodies and the dentate granule cell bodies, and these opioid binding sites are not in close contact with the major enkephalinergic systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
