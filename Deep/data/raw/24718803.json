     "AB": "The advent of photoactivatable tools has revolutionized imaging of dynamic cellular processes. One such application is to visualize axonal transport-an intricate and dynamic process by which proteins and other macromolecules are conveyed from their sites of synthesis in the cell bodies to their destinations within axons and synapses. High-quality dynamic imaging of axonal transport using photoactivatable vectors can now be routinely performed using epifluorescence microscopes and CCD cameras that are standard in most laboratories, yet this is largely underutilized. Here we describe detailed protocols for imaging cargoes moving in fast and slow axonal transport in axons of cultured hippocampal neurons.",
