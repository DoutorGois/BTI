     "AB": "The inhibitory amino acid taurine has been held to function as a modulator and osmoregulator in the brain, being of particular importance in the immature brain. The release of preloaded [3H]taurine was now studied in hippocampal slices from developing (7-day-old), adult (3-month-old) and ageing (6-24-month-old) mice focussing on the effects of agonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kainate and 2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) potentiated taurine release concentration-dependently at each age, more so in the immature than in the adult and ageing hippocampus. The effect of kainate was blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) in the developing and aged hippocampus and those of AMPA and NMDA by 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) and dizocilpine a(MK-801) at every age studied. This indicates the involvement of NMDA and AMPA receptors in taurine release throughout the life-span of mice, while the kainate-receptor-mediated release does not appear to function in adults. The increased hippocampal taurine release evoked by ionotropic glutamate receptors could act neuroprotectively, counteracting by several mechanisms the harmful effects of the simultaneous release of excitatory amino acids. The substantial release of taurine in the immature hippocampus might be particularly significant in view of the vulnerability of brain tissue to excitotoxicity at early age.",
