     "AB": "This study assessed the behavioral and electrographic effects of (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg, IP), a noncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptors, in hippocampal (HIP)-kindled cats. MK-801 at a higher dose significantly reduced the afterdischarge duration, but not the behavioral seizure stage, of HIP-kindled seizures. This anticonvulsant effect occurred in association with the appearance of severe behavioral toxicity and paradoxical worsening of background electroencephalogram characterized by profound spike and wave discharges. The present data suggest the dissociative effect of MK-801 on seizure activity and limitations of its clinical utility as an antiepileptic agent.",
