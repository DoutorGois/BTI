The present experiment was conducted to investigate whether this hyperemotionality is specific to amygdala kindling or whether it can be produced by kindling other structures. Rats received 99 convulsive or sham stimulations of either the amygdala, the hippocampus, or the caudate nucleus. One day after the stimulation phase, each rat's open-field activity and resistance to capture were assessed; the following day, each rat was tested on an elevated plus maze. The site of stimulation had a significant effect on the results of each of these tests. The amygdala-kindled and hippocampal-kindled rats explored less in the open field, were more resistant to capture from the open field, and engaged in a greater percentage of open-arm activity in the elevated plus maze than did the caudate-kindled rats or the sham-stimulated controls. The caudate-kindled rats were more active in the open field than their sham-stimulated controls, but they did not significantly differ from them in terms of the other measures. These results suggest that kindling-induced emotionality is produced by limbic kindling but not nonlimbic kindling.",
