     "AB": "MicroRNAs (miRs) are small regulatory molecules, which orchestrate neuronal development and plasticity through modulation of complex gene networks. MicroRNA-137 (miR-137) is a brain-enriched RNA with a critical role in regulating brain development and in mediating synaptic plasticity. Importantly, mutations in this miR are associated with the pathoetiology of schizophrenia (SZ), and there is a widespread assumption that disruptions in miR-137 expression lead to aberrant expression of gene regulatory networks associated with SZ. To systematically identify the mRNA targets for this miR, we performed miR-137 gain- and loss-of-function experiments in primary rat hippocampal neurons and profiled differentially expressed mRNAs through next-generation sequencing. We identified 500 genes that were bidirectionally activated or repressed in their expression by the modulation of miR-137 levels. Gene ontology analysis using two independent software resources suggested functions for these miR-137-regulated genes in neurodevelopmental processes, neuronal maturation processes and cell maintenance, all of which known to be critical for proper brain circuitry formation. Since many of the putative miR-137 targets identified here also have been previously shown to be associated with SZ, we propose that this miR acts as a critical gene network hub contributing to the pathophysiology of this neurodevelopmental disorder.",
