     "AB": "We investigated whether 17beta-estradiol affects the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the central nervous system in vivo. 17beta-Estradiol was administered intracerebroventricularly, and then ERK activity in the rat hippocampus was measured. We found that ERK activity in the rat hippocampus had increased to approximately threefold its basal level at 5 min. This rapid effect was mimicked by the membrane-impermeable estradiol, bovine serum albumin-conjugated 17beta-estradiol, and was not inhibited by tamoxifen and 7alpha,9-(4,4,5,5, 5-pentafluoropentylsulphinyl)nonylestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3, 17beta-diol (ICI 182780), classical nuclear estrogen receptor antagonists. These data suggest that the rapid activation of ERK by estradiol in vivo is mediated through a putative membrane estrogen receptor in the rat hippocampus.",
