     "AB": "Oxidative stress initiates age-related reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis and the use of antioxidants has been proposed as an effective strategy to prevent or attenuate the reduction of neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and/or peroxiredoxin-2 (PRX2) on cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus in a model of D-galactose-induced aging model. For this study, we constructed an expression vector, PEP-1, fused PEP-1 with SOD1 or PRX2, and generated PEP-1-SOD1 and PEP-1-PRX2 fusion protein. The aging model was induced by subcutaneous injection of D-galactose (100 mg/kg) to 6-week-old male mice for 10 weeks. PEP-1, PEP-1-SOD1 and/or PEP-1-PRX2 fusion protein was intraperitoneally administered to these mice at 13-week-old once a day for 3 weeks and sacrificed at 30 min after the last administrations. The administration of PEP-1-SOD1 and/or PEP-1-PRX2 significantly improved D-galactose-induced deficits on the escape latency, swimming speeds, platform crossings, spatial preference for the target quadrant in Morris water maze test. In addition, the administration of PEP-1-SOD1 and/or PEP-1-PRX2 ameliorated D-galactose-induced reductions of cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus and significantly reduced D-galactose-induced lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus. These effects were more prominent in the PEP-1-SOD1-treated group with PEP-1-PRX2. These results suggest that a SOD1 and/or PRX2 supplement to aged mice could improve the memory deficits, cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus of D-galactose induced aged mice by reducing lipid peroxidation.",
