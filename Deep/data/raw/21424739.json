     "AB": "The candidate plasticity related gene 15 (cpg15) plays important roles in neural development and plasticity. In the present study, we studied the role of the cpg15 3'-untranslated region (UTR) in regulating the expression of the gene. The results showed that the presence of the 3'-UTR significantly decreases, while loss of a putative AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3'-UTR increases the cpg15 expression, indicating that the 3'-UTR and ARE may be essential for regulation of cpg15 expression. In addition, HuD, a neural-specific RNA binding protein, increased the cpg15 expression, which depends on the presence of the 3'-UTR and ARE. RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay demonstrated that HuD forms a complex with cpg15 mRNA in the cells of rat hippocampus. Deletion of HuD domains RRM1 plus RRM2 or Hinge region plus RRM3 attenuates the function of HuD in enhancing the cpg15 expression. The results suggest that HuD regulates the cpg15 expression via the 3'-UTR-mediated mechanism, which requires the presence of the ARE.",
