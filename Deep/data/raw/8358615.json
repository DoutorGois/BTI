     "AB": "A human urinary trypsin inhibitor (urinastatin)-like immunoreactive substance with trypsin-inhibitory activities was found in the murine brain. Regional levels of this urinastatin (UT)-like substance in the brain were within 5 ng/mg protein and were expressed in a descending order as follows: cerebral cortex not equal to hippocampus > hypothalamus > mesencephalon not equal to corpus striatum >> medulla oblongata > cerebellum. Mechanical lesioning of the cerebral cortex or hippocampus with a needle induced a rapid and intense appearance of a UT-like immunoreactive substance in the neuronal cells of injured sites. Conditioned fear-stress induction incited a reversible increase in the level of UT-like immunoreactive substance in the hippocampus. These results suggest that the UT-like immunoreactive substance is produced by neurons in response to brain injury and fear-stress stimuli.",
