     "AB": "Tau pathology is implicated in mechanisms of neurodegenerative tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and hereditary frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). It has been reported that transgenic mice expressing FTDP-17 mutation P301L of human tau (P301L mice) display extensive tau pathology and exhibit behavioral deficits with aging. In this study, we investigated the effects of T-817MA, a neuroprotective agent, on the motor and cognitive impairments associated with neuronal degeneration in P301L mice. T-817MA prevented the progression of motor deficit and the loss of spinal cord motor neurons in P301L mice. Furthermore, T-817MA significantly attenuated the spatial memory impairment and the reduction in synaptic terminal density in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of P301L mice. These results indicate that T-817MA improved the motor and cognitive impairments as a result of inhibiting neuronal degeneration derived from tau pathology in the P301L mice. Therefore, it is expected that T-817MA has a therapeutic potential for tau-related neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.",
