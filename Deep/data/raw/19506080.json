     "AB": "Sialidase Neu4 is reported to be dominantly expressed in the mouse brain, but its functional significance is not fully understood. We previously demonstrated that sialidase Neu3, also rich in mouse brain, is up-regulated during neuronal differentiation with involvement in acceleration of neurite formation. To elucidate physiological functions of Neu4, as well as Neu3, we determined expression during mouse brain development by quantitative RT-PCR. Expression was relatively low in the embryonic stage and then rapidly increased at 3-14 days after birth, whereas Neu3 demonstrated high levels in the embryonic stage and down-regulation after birth. Murine Neu4 was found to possess two isoforms differing in expression levels, developmental pattern, and enzymatic character. Distinct from the human isoforms, the murine forms, to a different extent, both catalyzed the removal of sialic acid from gangliosides as well as glycoproteins, and one isoform seemed to act on polysialylated NCAM efficiently, despite the low activity toward ordinary substrates. In situ hybridization demonstrated Neu4 mRNA to be present mainly in the hippocampus in which NCAM is rich and decreases after birth. During retinoic acid-induced differentiation, Neu4 expression was down-regulated in Neuro2a cells. Overexpression of Neu4 resulted in suppression of neurite formation, and its knockdown showed the acceleration. Thin layer chromatography of the glycolipids from Neu4-transfected cells showed ganglioside compositions to be only slightly affected, although lectin blot analysis revealed increased binding to Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) lectin of a approximately 95-kDa glycoprotein, which decreased with cell differentiation. These results suggest that mouse Neu4 plays an important regulatory role in neurite formation, possibly through desialylation of glycoproteins.",
