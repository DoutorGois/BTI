     "AB": "Earlier findings suggest that, in addition to its well-known neurotrophic role, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is also involved in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of acute administration of ethanol (1.25 or 2.5 g/kg i.p.) on the expression profile of BDNF in the rat brain by determining the BDNF mRNA expression in the frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and ventral tegmental area. Ethanol decreased BDNF mRNA levels dose-dependently in the hippocampus, and after the higher ethanol dose in the frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and amygdala, while increasing them in the ventral tegmental area. Furthermore, BDNF mRNA expression was found to be regulated in a temporally different manner in all investigated brain areas. These data suggest that BDNF is involved in the acute effects of ethanol, but separate brain areas may be differentially engaged in the mediation of these effects.",
