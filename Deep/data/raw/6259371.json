     "AB": "Biochemical studies on the hippocampus of acutely prepared rabbits revealed more than twofold increases in cyclic GMP levels following tetanic potentiation of the pathway from the medial septal region to CA1 pyramidal cells. Diazepam, administered intravenously, prevented the elevation in cyclic GMP levels in this region and also attenuated the post-tetanic potentiation seen following the presentation of trains at frequencies within theta rhythm. The results imply a modulatory role for cyclic nucleotides in the enhancement of pyramidal cell excitability and suggest that the biochemical mechanism for the psychoactive benzodiazepines may well include the suppression of cyclic GMP levels.",
