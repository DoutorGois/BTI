     "AB": "Adverse early-life experiences, including various forms of early-life stress, have consistently been linked with vulnerability to cognitive and emotional disorders later in life. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the enduring consequences of early-life stress is an active area of research, because this knowledge is critical for developing potential interventions. Animal models of early-life stress typically rely on manipulating maternal/parental presence and care, because these are the major source of early-life experiences in humans. Diverse models have been created, and have resulted in a wealth of behavioral outcomes. Here we focus on recent findings highlighting early-life stress-induced behavioral disturbances, ranging from hippocampus-dependent memory deficits to problems with experiencing pleasure (anhedonia). The use of naturalistic animal models of chronic early-life stress provides insight into the spectrum of cognitive and emotional outcomes and enables probing the underlying mechanisms using molecular-, cellular-, and network-level approaches.",
