     "AB": "1. A specific anti-NAS antibody and fluorescein-labelled second antibody were employed to investigate the presence of NAS in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus as a function of age. 2. Immunoreactive NAS (INAS) was present in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus as early as 20 days postconception. 3. INAS appears to be present primarily in cell bodies. 4. Cross-reactivity and inhibition experiments confirm the positive identification of INAS. 5. INAS is age-dependent and increases with age reaching adult levels by day 30 post-conception/17 days after birth. 6. The appearance and subsequent increase in INAS correlates with the development of dentate granular cells and their subsequent synapse development suggesting a role for NAS in the normal functioning of these cells.",
