     "AB": "Glutamate excitotoxicity plays a key role in inducing neuronal cell death in many neurological diseases. In mice, intranasal administration of kainic acid (KA), an analogue of the excitotoxin glutamate, results in hippocampal cell death and provides a well-characterized model for studies of human neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we describe neurodegeneration and gliosis following intranasal administration of KA in C57BL/6 mice. By using Nissl's staining, neurodegeneration was found in area CA3 of hippocampus, and neuronal apoptosis was demonstrated by enhanced FAS(CD95/APO-1) expression detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Astrogliosis was exhibited by increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in the hippocampus and cortex. We also studied the profile of molecular expression on microglia in C57BL/6 mice. One and 3 days after KA administration, CD45, F4/80, CD86, MHCII, iNOS but not CD40 expression was enhanced or induced on microglia. In summary, KA administration results in an early microglial activation and a prolonged astrogliosis in C57BL/6 mice.",
