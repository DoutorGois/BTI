     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is multifactorial and, to date, no single cause of the sporadic form of this disease, which accounts for over 99% of the cases, has been established. In AD brain, protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) activity is known to be compromised due to the cleavage and translocation of its potent endogenous inhibitor, I2PP2A, from the neuronal nucleus to the cytoplasm. Here, we show that adeno-associated virus vector-induced expression of the N-terminal I2NTF and C-terminal I2CTF halves of I2PP2A , also called SET, in brain reproduced key features of AD in Wistar rats. The I2NTF-CTF rats showed a decrease in brain PP2A activity, abnormal hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau, a loss of neuronal plasticity and impairment in spatial reference and working memories. To test whether early pharmacologic intervention with a neurotrophic molecule could rescue neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits, 2.5-month-old I2NTF-CTF rats and control littermates were treated for 40 days with Peptide 6, an 11-mer peptide corresponding to an active region of the ciliary neurotrophic factor. Peripheral administration of Peptide 6 rescued neurodegeneration and cognitive deficit in I2NTF-CTF animals by increasing dentate gyrus neurogenesis and mRNA level of brain derived neurotrophic factor. Moreover, Peptide 6-treated I2NTF-CTF rats showed a significant increase in dendritic and synaptic density as reflected by increased expression of synapsin I, synaptophysin and MAP2, especially in the pyramidal neurons of CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus.",
