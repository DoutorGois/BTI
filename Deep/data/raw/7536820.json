     "AB": "Realistic estimates of channel-gating parameters of synaptic receptors are essential to an understanding of synaptic transmission and modulation. However, the gating of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) channels appears to differ, depending on recording conditions; thus, it remains unclear what measurements are most relevant to synaptic receptors. To further explore this discrepancy, we examined the open probability (Po) of NMDA channels in whole-cell and outside-out patch recording from cultured hippocampal neurons. Currents were evoked by rapid application of saturating concentrations of NMDA in the presence or absence of the \"irreversible\" open channel blocker, MK-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine) . The reduction of the peak amplitude and the acceleration of the decay of the current in MK-801 were used to derive Po by fitting the current traces to a multistate kinetic model. The Po in whole cell was low (0.04), similar to that previously measured for synaptically activated NMDA channels. In contrast, ensemble average currents from outside-out patches were much more rapidly blocked in the presence of MK-801, indicative of a significantly higher Po. The Po also gradually increased with the duration of recording in both whole-cell and outside-out configurations, suggesting that channel gating is sensitive to mechanical alterations of the patch or that washout of cytoplasmic factors leads to an increase in channel open probability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
