     "AB": "MicroRNAs (miR) are single-stranded short RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by degradation or translational repression of mRNA. It has been reported that the downregulation of miR-199a plays an important role in cardiac ischemic tolerance. We examined the expression of miR-199a after 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA) preconditioning in rat brain. 3-NPA (20mg/kg), an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, was injected intraperitoneally to induce ischemic tolerance in rats. For comparison, the control group received intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (0.9% sodium chloride). Quantitative RT-PCR assay was applied to detect the expression of miR-199a. Luciferase reporter assays and Western blotting were used to verify the target genes of miR-199a. In cortex and striatum, miR-199a was downregulated at two separate time intervals (the 2nd and 4th day), while in the hippocampus, it was downregulated on the 2nd day after 3-NPA preconditioning. The maximum reduction of miR-199a was 66.3% in striatum (4th day), 54.9% in hippocampus (2nd day), and 27.6% in cortex (2nd day). The level of sirt1 protein, a putative target of miR-199a and a known mediator of neuroprotective effect in brain ischemic tolerance, decreased significantly in hippocampal neurons by overexpression of miR-199a, while it increased with knockdown of miR-199a. Taking these results together, we hypothesize miR-199a may have a role in the formation of cerebral ischemic tolerance.",
