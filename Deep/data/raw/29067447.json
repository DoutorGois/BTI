     "AB": "Neuroinflammation triggered by surgical trauma contributes to postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), a multiligand inflammatory receptor, is involved in the damaging effects of various cellular processes, contributing to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. However, the potential role of RAGE in the acute period of POCD has not been fully investigated. C57BL/6 male mice undergoing surgery of the tibia under isoflurane anesthesia were treated with the RAGE antagonist FPSZM1 or vehicle control intraperitoneally for a period of 7 days. The cognitive function of the animals was tested using trace fear conditioning on the third postoperative day. To determine astrocytic activation, microgliosis, p65 expression, inflammatory factor levels and postsynaptic density protein95 (PSD95) expression in the hippocampus, the animals were euthanized on either the first, third or seventh postoperative day. Compared with the control group, the cognitive function of the surgical animals was impaired on the third postoperative day. Astrocytic activation, microgliosis and the expression levels of p65, interleukin (IL)1beta, IL6, and PSD95 were significantly increased on the first, and third postoperative days. However, tumor necrosis factoralpha expression was significantly increased only on postoperative day 1. All of the surgical effects observed were partially inhibited by treatment with FPSZM1. In summary, the results of the present study suggest that RAGE serves an important role in the acute inflammatory process of POCD, and blocking RAGE can inhibit neuroinflammation and attenuate POCD. Thus, the RAGE signaling pathway may be a novel target in the prevention, and treatment of POCD.",
