     "AB": "Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a known inducible inflammatory mediator. COX-2 is constitutively expressed in the hippocampus and may regulate synaptic plasticity. The present study investigated the ageassociated alterations in white blood cell counts and hippocampal COX2 expression in healthy mice using immunohistochemical and western blot analyses at 1 month postnatal (PM1), PM3, PM6, PM12 and PM24. White blood cell counts were significantly decreased in the PM24 group when compared with the PM1 group. In addition, lymphocyte counts were decreased in the PM24 group when compared with all other groups. By contrast, monocyte, neutrophil and eosinophil counts were increased in the PM24 group; however, this did not reach statistical significance. COX2 expression was identified in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampal CA2/3 region. COX2 immunoreactivity was maintained until PM18, however, the levels significantly decreased by PM24. These results suggest that, despite alterations in the differential white blood cell counts, the significant decrease in constitutive COX2 expression in the hippocampus may be associated with degenerative age-associated alterations in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.",
