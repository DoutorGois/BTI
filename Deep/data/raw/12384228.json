     "AB": "To date, there is little information regarding the regional division (dorsal and ventral) of hippocampal mitotic activity at either baseline or following seizures. To determine the regional distribution of hippocampal mitotic activity, animals were given seizures followed by injections of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (label for mitotic cells). Our results indicate that the baseline and seizure-induced levels of mitotic activity (neurogenesis) are greater in the dorsal hippocampus as compared to the ventral hippocampus. Moreover, seizures were able to significantly increase mitotic activity in both dorsal and ventral hippocampus with a greater proportional increase from baseline in the ventral hippocampus as compared to the dorsal hippocampus. These results suggest that the amount of mitotic activity differs between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus and suggests that seizure activity is capable of differentially driving mitotic activity in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus.",
