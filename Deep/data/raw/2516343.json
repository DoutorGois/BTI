     "AB": "Changes in immunoreactivity of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were investigated in the brains of rats subsequently to seizures induced by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Increased levels of the neuropeptide were observed in the frontal cortex (increase of 1300% of control value), striatum (900%), dorsal hippocampus (400%) and amygdala/pyriform cortex (135%) three days after injection of the neurotoxin. Intravenous infusion of mannitol (1.5 g/kg, under thiopental anesthesia) which prevents seizures and post-seizure brain damage suppressed the changes in CGRP-like immunoreactivity. Injection of pentylenetetrazol causing generalized motor seizures resulted in no change of CGRP-immunoreactivity after three days. The pronounced but reversible increases of brain CGRP levels suggest a strong but short-lasting activation of the peptide system. The failure of pentylenetetrazol to produce a similar effect and the protective action of mannitol suggest that sustained seizures and/or post-seizure brain damage may be required to produce the rise in peptide levels.",
