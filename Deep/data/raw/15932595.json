     "AB": "Significant reduction in glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1)- and GluR2/3-immunopositive neurons was demonstrated in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in mice killed on days 1, 7 and 60 after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PISE). In addition, GluR1 and GluR2/3 immunostaining in the strata oriens, radiatum and lacunosum moleculare of areas CA1-3 decreased drastically on days 7 and 60 after PISE. Neuronal loss observed in the above regions may account, at least in part, for a decrease in GluR immunoreactivity. By contrast, many GluR1-immunopositive neurons were observed in the gliotic area of CA1. Of these, about 42.8% were immunopositive for markers for hippocampal interneurons, namely calretinin (7.6%), calbindin (12.8%) and parvalbumin (22.4%). GluR1 or GluR2/3 and BrdU double-labelling showed that the GluR1- and GluR2/3-immunopositive neurons at 60 days after PISE were neurons that had survived rather than newly generated neurons. Furthermore, anterograde tracer and double-labelling studies performed on animals at 60 days after PISE indicated a projection from the hilus of the dentate gyrus to gliotic areas in both CA3 and CA1, where the projecting fibres apparently established connections with GluR1-immunopositive neurons. The projection to CA1 was unexpected. These novel findings suggest that the intrinsic hippocampal neuronal network is altered after PISE. We speculate that GluR1-immunopositive neurons in gliotic CA1 act as a bridge between dentate gyrus and subiculum contributing towards epileptogenesis.",
