     "AB": "The distribution of vasopressin and oxytocin binding sites in the central nervous system of the merione (Meriones shawi), a rodent adapted to desert life, was studied by means of conventional film radioautography at macroscopic scale and historadioautography at cellular level using radioiodinated ligands highly selective for either oxytocin or type V1 a vasopressin receptors. Both types of binding sites exhibited the same selectivity for endogenous peptides as in the rat. Distribution of oxytocin binding sites was similar in some structures (limbic system, spinal cord) to that described in the rat and in other rodents. Vasopressin binding sites were much more widely distributed in the merione than in the rat brain. In addition to locations common to most rodents (lateral septum and suprachiasmatic nucleus), in merione vasopressin binding sites occurred in several areas known to express oxytocin binding sites in the rat (olfactory system, hypothalamus). Colocalisation of vasopressin and oxytocin binding sites, which occurred in the CA1 and CA2 fields of Ammon's horns of the hippocampus, the caudate-putamen and the fundus striati of the merione, has so far not been reported in any other rodent.",
