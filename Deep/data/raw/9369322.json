     "AB": "The mechanisms by which diabetes impairs cognitive function are not well-established. In the present study, we determined the electrophysiological and biochemical nature of disturbances in the mechanism of long-term potentiation (LTP) in diabetic rats. As previously reported, the administration of streptozotocin (STZ) was found to reduce the magnitude of LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, while the same treatment did not interact with the capacity of the hippocampus to generate long-term depression induced by low-frequency stimulation. In addition, STZ treatment did not modify the component of excitatory postsynaptic potentials mediated by activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors, suggesting that NMDA receptor function remained intact in STZ-treated slices. At the biochemical level, the capacity of calcium to increase [3H](RS)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole propionic acid (3H-AMPA) binding to glutamate/AMPA receptors in rat brain tissue sections was markedly affected in most regions of the hippocampus of STZ-treated rats. Moreover, changes in 3H-AMPA binding properties elicited by both exogenous phospholipase A2 and melittin, a potent activator of endogenous phospholipases, were also altered in synaptoneurosomes from diabetic rats. Taken together, the present data suggest that the loss of LTP maintenance in STZ-treated rats is more likely the result of disruption of calcium-dependent processes that are suspected to modulate postsynaptic AMPA receptors during synaptic potentiation. Understanding the biochemical factors participating in the impairment of AMPA receptor modulation might provide important clues revealing the very basis of memory deficits in diabetes.",
