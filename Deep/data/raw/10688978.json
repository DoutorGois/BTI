     "AB": "5-Hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptors, which activate inhibitory G-proteins, are implicated in psychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression. Studies suggest that chronic 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist administration alters 5-HT(1A) receptor function, but the effect of chronic treatment on 5-HT(1A) receptor-activated G-proteins is unclear. In this study, agonist-stimulated [35S]guanylyl-5'-O-(gamma-thio)-triphosphate (GTPgammaS) binding was examined following chronic administration of buspirone. Brains were processed for [35S]GTPgammaS autoradiography using R(+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) for 5-HT(1A) receptors or baclofen for GABA(B) receptors. Net 8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding was decreased by 25-30% in the septum and dorsal raphe nucleus of buspirone-treated animals. No significant changes in 8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding were found in the prefrontal, entorhinal or cingulate cortices or hippocampus in buspirone-treated rats. GABA(B) receptor-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding was increased by 25% in the hippocampus, with no significant changes in any other region examined. These results demonstrate region-specific alterations in 5-HT(1A) and GABA(B) receptor-activated G-proteins following chronic buspirone treatment, which may contribute to the clinical effects of this drug.",
