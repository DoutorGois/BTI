     "AB": "Whereas the levels of other selenoproteins in the brain decrease when selenium is deficient, the level of selenoprotein W (Se-W) is maintained, suggesting that it has a critical role in the brain. Previously, we reported that Se-W is a GSH-dependent antioxidant [Jeong et al. (2002)]. In this study, the expression of Se-W and thioredoxin (Trx) in the brain and during embrynic development was analyzed by an in situ hybridization technique. Se-W mRNA was highly expressed in the cortex, dentate gyrus, and hippocampus of postnatal rat brains, and in the spinal cord and brain of developing embryos. In contrast, Trx mRNA was highly expressed in the cerebellum, olfactory bulb, and dentate gyrus of postnatal rat brains, and in the liver, telencephalon, and back muscle of developing embryos. Thus these two antioxidant proteins have different and non-overlapping expression patterns. The distribution of Se-W suggests that it plays an important role as an antioxidant in the developing brain and embryo.",
