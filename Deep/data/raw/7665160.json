     "AB": "We describe the isolation and characterization of a human gene (CLCN3) and its murine homologue (Clcn3) sharing significant sequence and structural similarities with all previously identified members of the voltage-gated chloride channel (ClC) family. This gene is expressed primarily in tissues derived from neuroectoderm. Within the brain, Clcn3 expression is particularly evident in the hippocampus, olfactory cortex, and olfactory bulb. CLCN3 encodes a 760-amino-acid protein that differs by only 2 amino acid residues from the protein encoded by Clcn3. CLCN3 protein also shows a high similarity with GEF1, an integral membrane protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae known to be involved in respiration and iron-limited cell growth, and with the predicted protein product of a DNA sequence from the mold Septoria nodorum. This high degree of sequence conservation in very distantly related species such as human and yeast indicates that this gene has retained a fundamental function throughout evolution.",
