     "AB": "Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and its molecular forms of a precocial murid, Acomys cahirinus, characterized by a large hippocampus, were measured during post-natal development and compared with rat. The activity of soluble AChE in Acomys increased slightly up to 4 weeks after birth. The total AChE activity increased somewhat more but, in rats, this increase was still greater. Three main molecular forms of AChE were separated by 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Their close similarity to the rat AChE forms was assessed by gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrofocusing. Maturation of these forms, i.e., conversion of simple into more complex forms in the soluble fraction of AChE was, however, considerably delayed reaching only after 4 weeks the pattern comparable to that of rat.",
