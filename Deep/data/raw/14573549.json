     "AB": "Hippocampal network activity oscillates between sustained rhythms (e.g., theta) and aperiodic population spikes (e.g., sharp waves, dentate spikes). Although temperature is known to modulate various aspects of rhythmic hippocampal activity, little is known regarding the influence of temperature on the incidence of population spikes. We recorded spontaneous hippocampal activity along the CA1-dentate gyrus axis using multisite silicon electrodes in urethanized infant rats (P2-P16) at brain temperatures of 37 and 27 degrees C. Theta and gamma activity, as well as sharp waves, were detected at 37 degrees C but not at 27 degrees C. In contrast, dentate spikes were rare at 37 degrees C but their incidence increased several-fold at 27 degrees C (epileptiform activity also emerged at 27 degrees C in the oldest pups). This surprising increase in the incidence of dentate spike activity in a cold brain represents the first such demonstration for a neuronal field pattern. In addition, these findings indicate that changes in brain temperature produce systems-level shifts in the balance among reciprocally interacting hippocampal components.",
