     "AB": "Inhibitory neurotransmission is critical for neuronal circuit formation. To examine whether inhibitory neurotransmission receives target-selective modulation in the long term, we expressed the cDNA of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which has been shown to induce the augmentation of GABAergic synapses in vivo and in vitro, in a small population of cultured hippocampal neurons. At 48 h after transfection, the expression level of glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), a GABA synthetic enzyme that resides mainly in GABAergic terminals, was selectively enhanced around the BDNF-expressing neurons, in comparison with the neighboring control neurons interposed between the BDNF-expressing neurons and inhibitory neurons. Exogenous BDNF application for 48 h also increased the GAD level and enhanced the GABA release probability. These potentiating effects were attenuated in inhibitory synapses on neurons expressing a dominant negative form of the BDNF receptor (tTrkB). This suggests that postsynaptic BDNF-TrkB signaling contributes to the target-selective potentiation of inhibitory presynaptic machineries. Since BDNF is expressed in an activity-dependent manner in vivo, this selectivity may be one of the key mechanisms by which the independence of functional neuronal circuits is maintained.",
