     "AB": "We examined the roles of A- and D-type K channels in the integration of EPSPs, particularly EPSP reduction, in a model dendrite using a computer simulation program (NEURON), instead of conventional electrophysiological methods which present technical difficulties. We obtained two important results: (1) KD channels play a crucial role in every synaptic input event, and (2) KA channels affect reduction of the second EPSP only when the second synaptic input is applied with a short interval (<100 ms). These results suggest that KD channels, which have not yet been analyzed experimentally, play a major role in synaptic integration in dendrites by altering their cable properties.",
