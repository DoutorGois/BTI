     "AB": "The differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) is influenced by a variety of factors. Therefore, it is important to explore the best external conditions that will induce NSCs to differentiate into hair cells. In this study, we investigated the best in vitro conditions for differentiation of NSCs derived from the hippocampus of newborn guinea pigs into hair-like cells. NSCs were separated and induced in different combinations of growth factors-in a control group and 7 combinations. Myosin VIIa-positive cells were detected to compare the effects of various combinations of growth factors on the differentiation of NSCs into hair-like cells. NSCs were differentiated into hair-like cells in all groups, but cell growth was best in the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) + epidermal growth factor (EGF) group and the bFGF + EGF + brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) group. The rates of myosin VIIa-positive cells in the 8 groups studied ranged from 13.53 to 22.71%, but the results in the bFGF+EGF and bFGF+EGF+BDNF groups had statistical significance compared with other groups (p < 0.05). While bFGF, EGF, and BDNF all can induce the differentiation of NSCs into hair-like cells, the synergies of bFGF+EGF and bFGF+EGF+BDNF are the best.",
