     "AB": "Aberrations in hippocampal neurogenesis are associated with learning and memory, synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the linkage between them, beta-amyloidosis and neuroinflammation is not well understood. To this end, we generated a mouse overexpressing familial AD (FAD) mutant human presenilin-1 (PS1) crossed with a knockout (KO) of the CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene. The PS1/CCL2KO mice developed robust age-dependent deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis associated with impairments in learning and memory, synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation. Neurogliogenesis gene profiling supported beta-amyloid independent pathways for FAD-associated deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis. We conclude that these PS1/CCL2KO mice are suitable for studies linking host genetics, immunity and hippocampal function.",
