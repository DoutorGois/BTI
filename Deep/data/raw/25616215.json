     "AB": "People with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), compared to healthy older adults (HO), benefit less from semantic congruent cues during episodic encoding. The presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) varepsilon4 makes this congruency benefit smaller, but the neural correlates of this deficit are unknown. Here, we estimated the source generators of EEG oscillatory activity associated with successful encoding of face-location associations preceded by semantically congruent and incongruent cues in HO (N = 26) and aMCI subjects (N = 34), 16 of which were varepsilon4 carriers (varepsilon4(+) ) and 18 varepsilon4 noncarriers (varepsilon4(-) ). Source estimation was performed in those spectrotemporal windows where the power of low-alpha, high-alpha, and beta oscillatory activity differed either between congruent and incongruent faces or between groups. Differences in high-alpha and beta-oscillatory dynamics indicated that aMCI varepsilon4(+) are unable to activate lateral regions of the temporal lobe involved in associative memory and congruency benefit in HO. Interestingly, and regardless of APOE genotype, aMCI activated additional regions relative to HO, through alpha oscillations. However, only activation in a distributed fronto-temporo-parietal network in varepsilon4 noncarriers was paralleled by enhanced memory. On the contrary, the redundant prefrontal activation shown by aMCI varepsilon4(+) did not prevent performance from decreasing. These results indicate that the effect of aMCI-related degeneracy on functional networks is constrained by the presence of APOE varepsilon4. Whereas individuals with aMCI varepsilon4(-) activate attentional, perceptual and semantic compensatory networks, aMCI varepsilon4(+) show reduced processing efficiency and capacity.",
