     "AB": "The aim of the study was a quantitative examination of neurons of hippocampal subfields (CA1-CA4) in mature male Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus; syn. Alopex lagopus). The preparations were dyed using cresyl violet. Histological preparations were used to morphometricaly analyze the neurons of hippocampus. This analysis included the following parameters: average size of cells in mum, periphery of cells in mum, average cell area in mum2, percentage of cells in area and size of the largest and smallest cells in mum in CA1-CA4 fields. Morphometric observations show that the cells involved in hippocampal formation in polar fox in all layers CA1 -CA4 differ in size, shape, cell area and nucleus area. The size of the cell area in CA3 is the largest and fluctuates around 249.4 mum2, whereas in CA2 the cell area is 184.1 mum2. The cells of the CA2 field are densely arranged, pyramidal and contain a small amount of cytoplasm; their size fluctuates. Cells of CA2 and CA4 had the largest diameter of about 23.6 mum, whereas cells of the CA3 field had the smallest diameter of about 8.3 mum.",
