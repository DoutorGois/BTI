     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the changes of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in rat brain tissue and to explore the mechanism of secondary cerebral injury after brain concussion. METHODS: The brain concussion model was established with the pathological changes of rat brain tissue by Weil stain. The expressions of MDA and SOD in brain tissue were examined by photochemical method. The expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in cerebral cortex and hippocampus were examined by immunochemistry. RESULTS: Nerve myelin sheath showed disorder, disruption, gryposis and swelling by Weil stain. Above changes were more severe at 12h. The quantity of MDA in rat brain tissue after concussion was significantly higher than that in the control group. The activity of SOD was significantly lower than that in the control group. The expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta increased more significantly in cerebral cortex and hippocampus in rat brain tissue after concussion than that in the control group. CONCLUSION: Oxidative stress and inflammatory injury in the rat brain tissue, which may play an important role in secondary cerebral injury after concussion.",
