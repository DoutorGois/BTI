     "AB": "The reuniens nucleus (RE) is the largest nucleus of the midline thalamic nuclei (MLN). RE has strongly connections with the amygdala and hippocampus, the structures that are involved in the learning and memory processes. In our previous report we have shown the role of RE in the spatial learning and memory using Morris water maze (MWM) task. Since RE is connected to multiple limbic structures, its involvement in the emotional learning and memory is a possibility. The present study was designed to elucidate the role of RE in acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval on the passive avoidance (PA) task which depends on a distributed network including the thalamus, amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus. For this purpose, rats were chronically implanted with a cannula aimed at the RE through which 0.5 mul tetracaine (2%) or saline were injected. Rats were trained in a PA task and their retention test was performed 24h later. The injection of saline or tetracaine was applied 5 min before or 5, 90, and 360 min after the acquisition trial and 5 min before the retention tests. Our findings showed that inactivation of RE before training did not affect acquisition, but affected memory retention 24h later in PA task. Moreover, inactivation of RE only 5 min after training impaired consolidation but not after 90 or 360 min. Also, inactivation of the RE, 5 min before the retrieval test impaired memory retrieval in PA task. In conclusion, it seems that RE is involved in memory processes in rats.",
