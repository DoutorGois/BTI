     "AB": "Recent studies clearly showed that neurogenesis continues to occur in the certain brain regions including the hippocampus. The stem or progenitor cells are divided equally (proliferation) or unequally, survive apoptosis and differentiate to mature neuron and glia. Such newborn cells integrate into existing neuronal networks, make synaptic contacts and finally change the plasticity. The proliferation is decreased by stress, but chronic treatment with antidepressants increases it. We have shown the involvement of the cAMP-CREB cascade in mature granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) around stem/progenitor cells in the drug action. To see the direct effect of some psychotropic drugs, we established a culture system of adult rat DG-derived neural precursor cells (ADP). Several antidepressants did not affect the proliferation. Moreover 5-HT did not promote the proliferation of ADPs. The findings suggested SSRI might affect neurogenesis through an indirect pathway.",
