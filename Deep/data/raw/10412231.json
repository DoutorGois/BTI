     "AB": "Effects of ageing on Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity in crude synaptosomal fractions from the rat brain parietal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus has been studied. From 12 months to 24 months, a progressive decline in enzyme activity in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and striatum was found which correlated with increase in lipid peroxidation in the three brain regions. In the thalamus, ageing did not affect the enzyme activity and lipid peroxidation. Age-related decline in multiple unit action potentials was also observed in two brain regions, viz. hippocampus and parietal cortex. Statistical correlations calculated by Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that decline in Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity correlated to decline in multiple unit action potentials. There was rise in lipid peroxidation also and the data indicate that age-related changes in lipid peroxidation and Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity contribute to the deterioration of electrophysiological activity.",
