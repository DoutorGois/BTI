     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: A genetic variant (rs3800779; M30) in the KCNH2 gene has been associated with schizophrenia, a lower intelligence quotient (IQ) and processing speed scores, altered brain functions and increased KCNH2-3.1. mRNA levels in the hippocampus. The aims of this study were to investigate whether the KCNH2 polymorphism is associated with schizophrenia-related neurocognitive deficits and to confirm the association between the variant and schizophrenia. METHODS: The effects of the risk genotype on IQ and seven neurocognitive batteries were examined by the analysis of covariance in 191 healthy subjects. We performed a meta-analysis of the association between M30 and schizophrenia using five independent ethnic groups (1,720 cases; 2,418 controls). RESULTS: Consistent with the previous study, we provided evidence that subjects with the risk T carriers had significantly lower IQ scores than those with the G/G genotype (P = 0.048). Of the seven neurocognitive batteries, subjects with the risk genotype demonstrated lower performances on attention/vigilance (P = 0.0079) and working memory (P = 0.0066) relative to subjects with the G/G genotype. Meta-analysis demonstrated evidence for an association between M30 and schizophrenia without showing heterogeneity across studies (odds ratio = 1.18; P = 0.0017). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the KCNH2 polymorphism could be associated with schizophrenia-related neuropsychological deficits and the risk of developing schizophrenia.",
