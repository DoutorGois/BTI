     "AB": "The mechanisms by which antidepressants regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are still unknown. The ABCB1-type multiple drug resistance (MDR) p-glycoprotein (PGP) regulates the HPA axis by limiting the access of glucocorticoids to the brain in mice and humans. Previous work in cell cultures has found that antidepressants enhance glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function in vitro by inhibiting MDR PGP, and therefore by increasing the intracellular concentration of glucocorticoids-but this model has never been tested directly in animals. Here, the tricyclic antidepressant, desipramine (20 mg/kg/day, i.p., for seven days), was administered to abcb1ab MDR PGP knockout mice (congenic on the FVB/N background strain) and to FVB/N controls. The hippocampal mRNA expression of GR, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), MDR (Mdr1a) PGP, and 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) were measured, together with plasma corticosterone levels. In FVB/N controls, desipramine induced a significant upregulation of GR mRNA in the CA1 region (+31%; p=0.045); in contrast, in abcb1ab (-/-) mice, desipramine induced a significant downregulation of GR mRNA in the CA1 region (-45%; p=0.004). MR mRNA expression was unaltered. Desipramine decreased corticosterone levels in both FVB/N controls and in abcb1ab (-/-) mice, but in abcb1ab (-/-) mice the effects were smaller. Specifically, in FVB/N controls (but not in abcb1ab (-/-) mice), desipramine reduced corticosterone levels not only compared with saline-treated mice but also compared with the 'physiological' levels of untreated mice (-39%; p=0.05). Finally, desipramine reduced Mdr1a mRNA expression across all hippocampus areas (-9 to -23%), but had no effect on 11beta-HSD1 mRNA expression. These data support the notion that the MDR PGP is one of the molecular targets through which antidepressants regulate the HPA axis.",
