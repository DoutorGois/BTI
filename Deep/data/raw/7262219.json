In the mossy fibres, Schaffer collaterals and Str. oriens fibres the c.v. varied from 0.36-0.38 m/s; in the alveus c.v. was 1.20 m/s. In the perforant path (p.p.) two groups of c.vs were found: in the medial p.p. the mean (+/- s.e) c.v. was 0.32 +/- 0.02 m/s, whereas in the lateral p.p. it was 1.36 +/- 0.14 m/s.",
