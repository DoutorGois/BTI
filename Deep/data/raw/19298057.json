     "AB": "Extracellular translational motion in the brain is generally considered to be governed by diffusion and tortuosity. However, the brain as a whole has a significant zeta-potential, thus translational motion is also governed by electrokinetic effects under a naturally occurring or applied electric field. We have previously measured zeta-potential and tortuosity in intact brain tissue; however, the method was tedious. In this work, we use a four-electrode potentiostat to control the potential difference between two microreference electrodes in the tissue, creating a constant electric field. Additionally, some alterations have been made to simplify our previous procedure. The method entails simultaneously injecting two 70 kDa dextran conjugated fluorophores into rat organotypic hippocampal cultures and observing their mobility using fluorescence microscopy. We further present two methods of data analysis: regression and two-probe analysis. Statistical comparisons are made between the previous and current methods as well as between the two data analysis methods. In comparison to the previous method, the current, simpler method with data analysis by regression gives statistically indistinguishable mean values of zeta-potential and tortuosity, with a similar variability for zeta-potential, -21.3 +/- 2.8 mV, and a larger variability for the tortuosity, 1.98 +/- 0.12. On the other hand, we find that the current method combined with the two-probe analysis produces accurate and more precise results, with a zeta-potential of -22.8 +/- 0.8 mV and a tortuosity of 2.24 +/- 0.10.",
