     "AB": "In the brain, the polyamines spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) serve highly specific functions by interacting with various ion channel receptors intimately involved with synaptic signaling. Both, glial cells and neurons contain Spd/Spm, but release and uptake mechanisms could re-distribute polyamines between cell types. The cellular and subcellular localization of polyamine biosynthetic enzymes may therefore offer a more appropriate tool to identify local sources of enhanced Spd/Spm synthesis, which may be related with specific roles in neuronal circuits and synaptic function. A recently characterized antibody against Spd synthase was therefore used to screen the rat brain for compartment-specific peaks in enzyme expression. The resulting labeling pattern indicated a clearly heterogeneous expression predominantly localized to neurons and neuropil. The highest levels of Spd synthase expression were detected in the accumbens nucleus, taenia tecta, cerebellar cortex, cerebral cortical layer I, hippocampus, hypothalamus, mesencephalic raphe nuclei, central and lateral amygdala, and the circumventricular organs. Besides a diffuse labeling of the neuropil in several brain areas, the distinct labeling of mossy fiber terminals in the cerebellar cortex directly indicated a synaptic role for Spd synthesis. Electron microscopy revealed a preferential distribution of the immunosignal in synaptic vesicle containing areas. A pre-synaptic localization was also observed in parallel and climbing fiber terminals. Electrophysiological recordings in acute cerebellar slices revealed a Spd-induced block of evoked extracellular field potentials resulting from mossy fiber stimulation in a dose-dependent manner.",
