     "AB": "The Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a major mediator of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), two opposing forms of synaptic plasticity underlying learning, memory and cognition. The heterozygous CaMKIIalpha isoform KO (CaMKIIalpha(+/-)) mice have a schizophrenia-related phenotype, including impaired working memory. Here, we examined synaptic strength and plasticity in two brain areas implicated in working memory, hippocampus CA1 and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Young CaMKIIalpha(+/-) mice (postnatal days 12-16; corresponding to a developmental stage well before schizophrenia manifestation in humans) showed impaired hippocampal CA1 LTP. However, this LTP impairment normalized over development and was no longer detected in older CaMKIIalpha(+/-) mice (postnatal weeks 9-11; corresponding to young adults). By contrast, the CaMKIIalpha(+/-) mice failed to show the developmental increase of basal synaptic transmission in the CA1 seen in wild-type (WT) mice, resulting in impaired basal synaptic transmission in the older CaMKIIalpha(+/-) mice. Other electrophysiological parameters were normal, including mPFC basal transmission, LTP, and paired-pulse facilitation, as well as CA1 LTD, depotentiation, and paired-pulse facilitation at either age tested. Hippocampal CaMKIIalpha levels were approximately 60% of WT in both the older CaMKIIalpha(+/-) mice and in the younger WT mice, resulting in approximately 30% of adult WT expression in the younger CaMKIIalpha(+/-) mice; levels in frontal cortex were the same as in hippocampus. Thus, in young mice, approximately 30% of adult CaMKIIalpha expression is sufficient for normal LTD and depotentiation, while normal LTP requires higher levels, with approximately 60% of CaMKIIalpha expression sufficient for normal LTP in adult mice.",
