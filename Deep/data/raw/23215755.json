     "AB": "Besides functions of the interleukin-6 (IL-6)/gp130 cytokine family in immunology, IL-6 signaling has influence on memory processes. IL-6 acts on target cells via a membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and subsequent association with the signal-transducing protein gp130. While gp130 is expressed on all cells in the body, IL-6R is expressed in only on few cells such as hepatocytes and some leukocytes. Cells lacking IL-6R were shown not to be responsive to the cytokine. Interestingly, a soluble form of the IL-6R in complex with IL-6 can stimulate cells that do not express the membrane-bound IL-6R. This signaling pathway has been called IL-6 trans-signaling. IL-6 trans-signaling can specifically be blocked by a soluble gp130 protein (sgp130Fc) without affecting IL-6 classic signaling via the membrane-bound IL-6R. Transgenic mice expressing sgp130Fc in the blood, but not in the central nervous system, were analyzed for hippocampus-dependent and independent memory, together with exploratory- and anxiety-related behavior. Transgenic animals did not show impaired hippocampus-dependent or independent learning and memory. However, compared to wild-type animals, they showed reduced exploratory behavior and an increased thermal pain threshold, indicating that these effects depend on IL-6 trans-signaling. These results bear important consequences for the therapeutic blockade of IL-6 activity in autoimmune diseases.",
