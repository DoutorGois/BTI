     "AB": "We have investigated possible sex differences in the regional concentrations of neuropeptides in the rat brain. Immunoreactive neurotensin (NT), neurokinin A (NKA), galanin (GAL), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were measured by radioimmunoassay in frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus and pituitary in male and female pre- and postpubertal rats. Sex differences were found for NPY (p < 0.001), NT (p < 0.01) and GAL (p < 0.05), in particular in hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus and pituitary, but not for CGRP, SP and NKA. Results from analysis of neuropeptides in one sex may not be entirely applicable to the other.",
