     "AB": "The ultrastructure of the hippocampal mossy fibre layer was studied in ultrathin sections and freeze-fracture preparations of rabbits under deep Nembutal anaesthesia, after recovery from ether anaesthesia, and 40 min after a single injection of methoxypyridoxine, that is, during the second generalized seizure discharge. The giant mossy fibre boutons contain two types of vesicles: evenly distributed, small round clear vesicles (50 nm) and a few scattered large dense-core vesicles (100 nm). In rare instances fusion of dense-core vesicles with the presynaptic membrane was observed. No differences in the morphology of the mossy fibre synapses were found between anaesthetized and unanaesthetized animals. During epileptiform seizures, however, the size and shape of clear and dense-core vesicles varied greatly. The active synaptic zones were covered with large, core-containing omega profiles or bumps and indentations. Only dense-core vesicles seem to undergo exocytosis. A fusion of clear vesicles with presynaptic membrane was not observed. Various explanations for the fact that only dense-core vesicles seem to undergo exocytosis are discussed. The hypothesis is put forward that in the mossy fibre bouton two morphologically and functionally distinct populations of synaptic vesicles exist and that only one of them undergoes visible irreversible exocytosis, whereas the majority, that is, the small vesicles discharge their transmitter by reversible fusion. After MP injection features of membrane retrieval were also prominent. Frequently, at the borders of the active synaptic zones coated membrane convolutes of both pre- and postsynaptic membranes had invaded the terminals as well as the postsynaptic spine. Thus, in contrast to electrical stimulation, the self-sustained seizures allows energy-expensive processes such as extensive membrane internalization to take place during the interictal pauses.",
