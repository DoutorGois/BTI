     "AB": "The changes in monoamine levels of different brain regions following Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) intraperitoneal inoculation were examined in experimentally JEV-infected mice. In addition, virus distribution was studied using infectivity assay and immuno-histochemistry of viral antigen. 1) The level of monoamines in brain tissues was not affected by 48 hours after viral inoculation, but marked effects were elicited at 96 hours after the inoculation. The cerebral concentration of 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5 HIAA) was increased, while that of dopamine (DA) showed a decrease. Especially these alteration were observed in the cerebral cortex, but not in the cerebellum. 2) The viral growth in the brain was observed at 48 hours after the inoculation. The growth in the cerebellum, however, was found to be lower than those in other cerebral regions. 3) The viral antigen was detected in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, mesencephalon and diencephalon in addition to the substantia nigra and striatum. From these results, it is presumed that clinical manifestation of JEV infection may involve the changes in the metabolism of neurotransmitter, especially those of DA and serotonin in the brain.",
