     "AB": "The synthesis and transport of newly synthesized proteins in dendrites of rat hippocampal pyramid cells were investigated. Labelled leucine was injected into the left lateral ventricle and the hippocampal region was processed for light and electron microscopic autoradiography. To differentiate between the silver grains originating from 'sedentary' or 'migratory' proteins, the radioactivity in dendritic areas free of ribosomes and rich in ribosomes was determined separately. Several conclusions were reached. (1) Protein synthesis in dendrites takes place mainly in the proximal parts although a slight synthetic activity can be observed along the whole dendritic tress as well. (2) Newly synthesized proteins are transported toward the distal dendritic region; the data obtained suggest that cisterns of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the microtubular system may be involved in this transport. (3) Two phases of dendritic transport may be distinguished; a fast phase with a rate of 100-200 mm/day and a slow phase with a rate of 2.8-10 mm/day. It also seems probable that the majority of the proteins newly synthesized in dendrites are transported by the slow phase.",
