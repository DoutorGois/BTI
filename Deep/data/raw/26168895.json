     "AB": "Increasing evidence indicates that dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist, has a neuroprotective effect against cerebral injury. However, it remains unknown whether and how DEX functionally prevents the pathological form of synaptic plasticity caused by ischemia in the hippocampal CA1 neurons. To address this issue, we analyzed the role of DEX using a model of brain ischemia (oxygen and glucose deprivation, OGD) referred to as post-ischemic LTP (i-LTP). We found that DEX could reduce i-LTP by selectively activating alpha2 receptors. To clarify its detailed mechanisms, the presynaptic and postsynaptic roles of DEX were investigated. The activation of the alpha2 receptors of DEX decreased the frequency spontaneous mEPSCs, which exerted its presynaptic mechanisms. In addition, DEX also decreased the amplitude of mEPSCs and prevented the depolarization of postsynaptic membranes during OGD treatment, which exerted its postsynaptic mechanisms. More importantly, our results indicate that postsynaptic beta receptors, not alpha1 receptors, participated in i-LTP. Therefore, these results demonstrated that decreasing beta receptors activation by DEX-medicated pre- and post-synaptic alpha2 receptors activation is responsible for i-LTP. Because of the NMDARs required for i-LTP, we further examined the critical roles of postsynaptic beta receptors downstream PKA regulation of NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs (NMDA EPSC). We clarified that it is attributable to the direct effect of DEX on NMDA EPSC as mediated by PKA inactivation. These findings suggest that DEX can protect neurons from functional damage caused by a relatively mild degree of transient cerebral ischemia, and this effect is mediated by both presynaptic reduction of NE and glutamate release and postsynaptic suppression of NMDAR activation by beta receptors and downstream PKA regulation.",
