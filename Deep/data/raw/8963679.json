     "AB": "Using quantitative receptor autoradiographic methods we have examined A1 adenosine receptors, adenosine uptake sites, benzodiazepine receptors, NMDA, AMPA, and kainic acid receptors in temporal lobes removed from patients suffering from complex partial seizures and in normal control post-mortem temporal cortex. Binding to A1 adenosine receptors and NMDA receptors was reduced in epileptic temporal cortex, while the other neurochemical parameters were unchanged. The reason for this A1 receptor loss is unclear as it occurred in both idiopathic and symptomatic cases and thus may be a consequence rather than an initial cause of seizures. However, because adenosine is a powerful anticonvulsant substance, loss of anticonvulsant A1 receptors may contribute to the human epileptic condition. It is also possible that the observed differences in A1 binding are due to autopsy vs. biopsy changes in the levels of A1 adenosine receptors.",
