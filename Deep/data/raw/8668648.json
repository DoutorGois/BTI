     "AB": "Polyamine concentrations including putrescine, spermidine and spermine were documented in two brain areas of rats with mild and severe stages of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) due to fulminant hepatic failure induced by galactosamine HC1 injection (3 g kg-1 i.p.). In the mild stage of HE putrescine increased by 3-4 times whereas spermidine and spermine showed a slight increase. The scenario, however, was found to be changed going from the mild to the severe stage of HE, since in this last stage spermidine and spermine showed a further rise while putrescine was found to be significantly lower than in the mild stage of HE in both the brain areas studied. The changes in the ratio among the three polyamines with an enhanced prevalence in the severe stage of HE of spermidine and spermine are likely to be related to the exhaustion of the synthetic pathway of putrescine or to a reduction of the interconversion to this polyamine from spermidine and spermine. Considering that these last two polyamines potentiate the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor mediated toxicity and that they might exert neurotoxic effects per se, there are clear reasons for suspecting an implication of the described changes of polyamines in the neurochemical mechanism which sustain HE and to surmise a potential therapeutic effect in this pathology of non-competitive antagonists of polyamine-site on N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors.",
