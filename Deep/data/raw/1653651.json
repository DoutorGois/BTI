     "AB": "We report the isolation and molecular characterization of trkC, a new member of the trk family of tyrosine protein kinase genes. trkC is preferentially expressed in the brain. In situ hybridization studies revealed trkC transcripts in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and the granular cell layer of the cerebellum. The product of the trkC gene has been identified as a glycoprotein of 145,000 daltons, gp145trkC, which is equally related to the previously characterized gp140trk and gp145trkB tyrosine kinases. gp145trkC is a functional receptor for neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). However, gp145trkC does not bind the highly related neurotrophic factors NGF or BDNF. In proliferating cells, the interaction between gp145trkC and NT-3 elicits a more efficient biological response than when NT-3 binds to its other receptors gp140trk and gp145trkB. These results indicate that gp145trkC may play an important role in mediating the neurotrophic effects of NT-3.",
