     "AB": "Maintenance of lasting synaptic efficacy changes requires protein synthesis. We report here a mechanism that might influence translation control at the level of the single synapse. Stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in hippocampal slices induces a rapid protein kinase C-dependent translocation of multifunction kinase p90rsk to polyribosomes; concomitantly, there is enhanced phosphorylation of at least six polyribosome binding proteins. Among the polyribosome bound proteins are the p90rsk-activating kinase ERK-2 and a known p90rsk substrate, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, which regulates translation efficiency via eukaryotic initiation factor 2B. Thus metabotropic glutamate receptor stimulation could induce synaptic activity-dependent translation via translocation of p90rsk to ribosomes.",
