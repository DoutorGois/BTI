     "AB": "Postnatal development, such as synapse refinement, is necessary for the establishment of a mature and functional central nervous system (CNS). Using differential display analysis, we identified a novel gene, termed Bdm1, that is more abundantly expressed in the adult brain than in the embryonic brain. The full-length Bdm1 cDNA is 2718 base pairs long and contains an open reading frame of 1059 base pairs encoding a 38-kDa protein. Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of Bdm1 mRNA in the brain was weak on embryonic days and increased in the early postnatal period. Bdm1 mRNA was significantly expressed in the brain and heart, but there was no or little expression in other tissues. During the differentiation of mouse carcinoma cells P19 to neuron-like cells by retinoic acid, Bdm1 mRNA was up-regulated almost parallel to neurofilament mRNA. Expression of Bdm1 mRNA was observed appreciably in PC12 cells after neuronal differentiation but not in the nonneural cell lines examined. In situ hybridization demonstrated that Bdm1 was expressed widely in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamus, and medulla oblongata. Taken together, these data suggest that Bdm1 gene plays a role in the early postnatal development and function of neuronal cells.",
