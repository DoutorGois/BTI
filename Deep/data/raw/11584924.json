     "AB": "This study examined the consequences of elevated corticosterone levels in lactating rats on their offspring's serotonergic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A receptor system and behavioral coping with stress. The mothers received normal drinking water or water with corticosterone, which, via the milk, enters the circulation and brains of the pups. In adulthood, the corticosterone-nursed offspring showed a consistently more passive way of coping with environmental challenges. However, they did not seem to be more anxious. Autoradiographic analysis of the 5-HT1A receptor system revealed a decrease in the adult 5-HT1A receptor binding in the hippocampal CA1 region. The results support the hypothesis that differences in behavioral coping with stress by adult rats are associated with differences in the serotonergic system. At the same time, it suggests that adult coping and its neuronal substrates are not solely determined by genes but depend on subtle developmental factors as well.",
