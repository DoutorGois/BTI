     "AB": "It is well known that the early life experiences affect stress responses and other physiological and behavioral traits in adulthood. Both rat and human studies have shown that early postnatal effects are associated with methylation of the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor gene exon 1(7) (rat) and 1-F (human) promoters. Methylation of these sites is also seen following methionine administration in adult rats. However, it remains unclear whether similar alterations in DNA methylation profiles can result from prenatal influences. To address this question, we fed pregnant rats a methyl-supplemented diet that resulted in alteration of the stress response. However, methylation analysis revealed no effect of methyl supplements on methylation patterns of the glucocorticoid receptor gene exon 1(7) promoter in offspring. These results suggest that the pre- and postnatal effects of methyl supplementation have different mechanisms.",
