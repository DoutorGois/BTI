     "AB": "The microscopy of biological specimens has traditionally been a two-dimensional imaging method for analyzing what are in reality three-dimensional (3-D) objects. This has been a major limitation of the application of one of science's most widely used tools. Nowhere has this limitation been more acute than in neurobiology, which is dominated by the necessity of understanding both large- and small-scale 3-D anatomy. Fortunately, recent advances in optical instrumentation and computational methods have provided the means for retrieving the third dimension, making full 3-D microscopic imaging possible. Optical designs have concentrated on the confocal imaging mode while computational methods have made 3-D imaging possible with wide field microscopes using deconvolution methods. This work presents a brief review of these methods, especially as applied to neurobiology, and data using both approaches. Specimens several hundred micrometers thick can be sampled allowing essentially intact neurons to be imaged. These neurons or selected components can be contrasted with either fluorescent, absorption, or reflection stains. Image analysis in 3-D is as important as visualization in 3-D. Automated methods of cell counting and analysis by nuclear detection as well as tracing of individual neurons are presented.",
