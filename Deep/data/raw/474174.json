     "AB": "The brains from 12 schizophrenic patients were investigated post-mortem for their content of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA). Six of the schizophrenics had been lobotomized 25--30 years prior to death. A control group matched for age was collected in the autopsy room. The concentrations of NA, DA, and HVA in different parts of the brain from the schizophrenic group did not differ from those of the controls. 5-HT was determined in 11 nuclei or areas of the brain. The schizophrenic group had lower mean values compared with the controls, and in the hypothalamus, medulla oblongata, and hippocampus the difference was at a significant level. 5-HIAA was determined in six areas of the brain but only in a few cases. There was a trend towards lower means of 5-HIAA in the schizophrenics. Cause of death, medication, food intake, age, time between death and autopsy, time the corpses have lain in room temperature, and dissection technique are discussed in relation to these findings. These variables have to be kept under careful control before changes can be claimed as having pathogenetic importance for schizophrenia or for the progressing dementia in this disease.",
