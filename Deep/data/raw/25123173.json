     "AB": "Endocannabinoids (eCBs) modulate both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in hippocampus via activation of pre-synaptic cannabinoid receptors. Here, we present a model for cannabinoid mediated short-term depression of excitation (DSE) based on our recently developed model for the equivalent phenomenon of suppressing inhibition (DSI). Furthermore, we derive a simplified formulation of the calcium-mediated endocannabinoid synthesis that underlies short-term modulation of neurotransmission in hippocampus. The simplified model describes cannabinoid-mediated short-term modulation of both hippocampal inhibition and excitation and is ideally suited for large network studies. Moreover, the implementation of the simplified DSI/DSE model provides predictions on how both phenomena are modulated by the magnitude of the pre-synaptic cell's activity. In addition we demonstrate the role of DSE in shaping the post-synaptic cell's firing behaviour qualitatively and quantitatively in dependence on eCB availability and the pre-synaptic cell's activity. Finally, we explore under which conditions the combination of DSI and DSE can temporarily shift the fine balance between excitation and inhibition. This highlights a mechanism by which eCBs might act in a neuro-protective manner during high neural activity.",
