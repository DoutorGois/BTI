     "AB": "An experimental limbic seizure was induced in cats by microinjection of kainic acid into the left amygdala. Measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the limbic structure and cerebral cortex was performed by means of the hydrogen clearance method. Immediately after the development of continuous multiple spikes, rCBF increased about 2-fold in the left amygdala (LA) and remained so during the seizure. When continuous multiple spikes were transmitted to the left hippocampus (LH), rCBF in the LH increased to 140% of the baseline value, but in the right amygdala (RA) and left sensorimotor cortex (LCx) it remained unchanged. During limbic seizure in which spike discharges propagated to the LCx, rCBF in the LA, RA, LCx and LH increased to 220%, 130%, 120% and 190%, respectively. In the interictal stage in which interictal spike discharges intermittently appeared in the LA, rCBF returned to baseline values in the primary and secondary foci. The results show that rCBF increased almost simultaneously with the development of the seizure in the primary focus and the areas where seizure propagation were observed, and returned to baseline value once the seizure had disappeared. During the interictal stage, rCBF in the primary focus was only slightly increased in spite of persistence of interictal spike discharges.",
