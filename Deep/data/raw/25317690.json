     "AB": "Kainic acid (KA) is a potent neurotoxic substance valuable in research of temporal lobe epilepsy. We tested how subconvulsive dose of KA influences spontaneous behavior of adult Wistar rats. Animals were treated with 5 mg/kg of KA and tested in Laboras open field test for one hour in order to evaluate various behavioral parameters. Week after the KA treatment animals were tested again in Laboras open field test. Finally, rat's brains were sliced and stained with Fluoro-Jade B to detect possible neuronal degeneration. Treatment with KA increased the time spent by locomotion (p<0.01), exploratory rearing (p<0.05) and animals traveled longer distance (p<0.01). These parameters tended to increase thirty minutes after KA administration. Week after the treatment we did not found differences in any measured behavioral parameter. Histology in terms of Fluoro-Jade B staining did not reveal any obvious neuronal damage in hippocampus. These results demonstrate that subconvulsive KA dose changes the behavioral parameters only transiently. Clarification of timing of the KA induced changes may contribute to understand mutual relationship between non-convulsive seizures and behavioral/cognitive consequences.",
