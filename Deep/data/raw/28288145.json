     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Hyperthermia after hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) in newborn infants is associated with worse neurological outcomes. Loss of thermoregulation may also be associated with greater injury. METHODS: In the postnatal-day 7 (P7) rat, the effect of 5h of graded hyperthermia (38 degrees C or 39 degrees C) immediately after unilateral HI was compared to normothermia (NT, 37 degrees C), and therapeutic hypothermia (TH, 32 degrees C). Early (negative geotaxis) and late (staircase test) behavioural testing was performed, as well as neuropathology scoring in adulthood. Separately, P7 rats were exposed to HI, and individual nesting temperatures monitored before analysis of neuropathology at P14. RESULTS: Mortality increased as temperature was increased from 38 degrees C (0%) to 39 degrees C (50%) after HI. Hyperthermia also resulted in early behavioural deficits compared to NT animals. In adulthood, pathology scores in the thalamus, basal ganglia, cortex, and hippocampus increased as post-hypoxic temperature increased above NT. Significant global neuroprotection was seen in the TH group. However, no significant difference was seen between HI groups in the staircase test. One hour after HI, the core temperature of pups was inversely correlated with global pathology scores at P14. CONCLUSION: Early temperature is a significant determinant of injury after experimental HI. Spontaneous decreases in core temperature after HI may confound neuroprotection studies.Pediatric Research (2017); doi:10.1038/pr.2017.51.",
