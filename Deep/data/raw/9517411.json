     "AB": "The effects of YM90K on alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity were investigated using kainate, AMPA and cyclothiazide in rat hippocampal cultures. YM90K had neuroprotective actions against both kainate toxicity and cyclothiazide-enhanced AMPA toxicity. YM90K induced a parallel and rightward shift of both kainate and AMPA dose-response curves. The application of YM90K even 3 hr after the start of kainate exposure significantly reduced kainate toxicity. These results indicate that YM90K protects neurons against AMPA receptor-mediated toxicity at an agonist site on the AMPA receptor and that YM90K protects against AMPA receptor-mediated toxicity even if applied after neurotoxic insult.",
