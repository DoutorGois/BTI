     "AB": "The postnatal development of leucine5-enkephalin-like immunoreactivity within the hippocampal formation of the rat has been analyzed using immunocytochemical techniques. From the day of birth to postnatal day three, no intrinsic hippocampal elements exhibit immunoreactivity although labeled axons are found within the fimbria, within the alveus, and in the vicinity of the angular bundle. On postnatal day 4, a few immunoreactive hippocampal neurons can be seen in stratum radiatum of the region CA3 and by postnatal day 8, within the hilus, strata pyramidale and oriens of regio superior, and the subiculum. There is a dramatic increase in the incidence of immunoreactive perikarya between postnatal days 8 and 10 in all fields as well as the appearance of labeled neurons in CA1 stratum pyramidale and stratum granulosum of the dentate gyrus. Two days after the first appearance of immunoreactive perikarya, intensely immunoreactive neurons, labeled much more extensively than is ever seen in the adult, are encountered in each subfield of the hippocampus. The spatio-temporal order in both the emergence of perikaryal immunoreactivity and the transient appearance of intensely immunoreactive neurons follows that of neurogenesis, with immunoreactivity developing 12-14 days after the peak period of last cell division for a given hippocampal region. The incidence of immunoreactive perikarya in the dentate gyrus was quantified in rat pups ranging from postnatal days 8 to 19. The appearance of labeled neurons followed the spatio-temporal gradients that have been described for neurogenesis in this region as well. Immunoreactive perikarya emerged in the suprapyramidal stratum granulosum prior to their emergence in the infrapyramidal zone and in the temporal pole of the dentate earlier than in the mid-dorsoventral dentate. The lateral perforant path and mossy fiber axons, seen to exhibit enkephalin-like immunoreactivity in the adult hippocampal formation, differ in their relative maturity at the age immunoreactivity first appears. Immunoreactivity appears as early as postnatal day 4 in the lateral perforant path, an age at which these axons are just growing into their target field while it is not found within the mossy fibers until after postnatal day 10, an age at which mossy fiber bouton elaboration is well advanced and physiologically competent mossy fiber synapses with the regio inferior pyramidal cells have been established. The latter observation indicates that enkephalin is not necessary for synaptic transmission at the mossy fiber synapse.",
