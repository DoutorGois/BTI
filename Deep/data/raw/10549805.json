     "AB": "We examined the relationship between the histochemical distribution of endogenous GLP-1 (7-36) amide in the hippocampus and memory impairment assessed by a step-through type passive avoidance task in rats continuously infused with beta-amyloid protein (1-40) into the lateral cerebroventricle using a mini-osmotic pump. Our results demonstrated that endogenous GLP-1 (7-36) amide appears in the hippocampus accompanied by progression of memory impairment. Electrophysiological studies also indicated that endogenous GLP-1 inhibits hippocampal neuronal activity in beta-amyloid protein-treated rats.",
