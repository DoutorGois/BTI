     "AB": "Using a four-arm plus-shaped maze, rats with neurotoxic lesions in the dorsal hippocampus were trained in a spatial reference memory task in which both the extramaze constellation of stimuli and an intramaze landmark (a piece of sandpaper covering the floor of the goal) indicated the location of the goal arm. After reaching criterion, animals were given two transfer tests in order to investigate how much they had learned about the intra and extramaze cues. Results showed that during the intramaze transfer, based exclusively on the intramaze cue, hippocampal rats produced a performance clearly superior to that of the controls. Importantly, the average percentage of correct responses recorded in the hippocampal group during the extra versus the intramaze transfer test was similar. Thus, no decremental processing of the intramaze cue was detected in the lesioned group. In contrast, control rats showed a decremental processing of the intramaze landmark performing worse during the intramaze transfer as compared with the extramaze transfer. These results support the view that the hippocampus regulates decremental changes in the processing of normally irrelevant stimuli, extending this claim into a spatial domain.",
