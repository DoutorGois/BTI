     "AB": "Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays crucial roles in progressive neuronal death in ischemic brain injury. In the present study, we evaluated two radiolabeled COX-2 selective inhibitors, [11C]celecoxib and [11C]rofecoxib, as positron emission tomography (PET) tracers for COX-2 imaging in normal and ischemic mouse brains. We also took advantage of our newly-generated antibody highly selective for mouse COX-2 to prove accumulation of the radioligands in regions enriched with COX-2. In vitro autoradiography demonstrated specific binding of high-concentration [11C]rofecoxib but not [11C]celecoxib to the cerebellum and brain stem of normal brains wherein COX-2 immunoreactivity in neurons was most abundantly observed. Meanwhile, both of these radioligands failed to detect COX-2 expression in PET assays despite their excellent brain permeability. Hypoperfusion-induced ischemia caused marked necrotic neuron death accompanied by gliosis and enhancement of neuronal COX-2 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus. Correspondingly, in vitro autoradiographic binding of [11C]rofecoxib was increased in the injured hippocampus compared to the uninjured contralateral region, but failed in living brains of ischemia model likewise. Our work provides the rationale for monitoring COX-2 as a biomarker reflecting ischemic brain injuries and demonstrates that [11C]rofecoxib, not [11C]celecoxib, is useful for in vitro assays of COX-2, but its affinity would be insufficient for in vivo PET visualization.",
