     "AB": "A series of new 1-[4-(indol-3-yl)butyl]-4-arylpiperazines was prepared to identify highly selective and potent 5-HT(1A) agonists as potential pharmacological tools in studies of mood disorders. The combination of structural elements (indole-alkyl-amine and aryl-piperazine) known to introduce 5-HT(1A) receptor affinity and the proper selection of substituents (R on the indole moiety and R' on the aryl moiety) led to compounds with high receptor specificity and affinity. In particular, the introduction of the methyl ether or the unsubstituted carboxamide as substituents in position 5 of the indole (R) guaranteed serotonergic 5-HT(1A) affinity compared to the unsubstituted analogue. Para-substituted arylpiperazines (R') decreased dopaminergic D(2) binding and increased selectivity for the 5-HT(1A) receptor. Agonistic 5-HT(1A) receptor activity was confirmed in vivo in the ultrasonic vocalization test, and the results suggest that the introduction of the carboxamide residue leads to better bioavailability than the corresponding methyl ether. 3-[4-[4-(4-Carbamoylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl]-1H-indole-5-carboxamide 54 was identified as a highly selective 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist [GTPgammaS, ED(50) = 4.7 nM] with nanomolar 5-HT(1A) affinity [IC(50) = 0.9 nM] and selectivity [D(2), IC(50) > 850 nM]. 3-[4-[4-(4-Methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl]-1H-indole-5-carboxamide 45 is one of the most potent and selective 5-HT(1A) agonists known [5-HT(1A), IC(50) = 0.09 nM; D(2), IC(50) = 140 nM].",
