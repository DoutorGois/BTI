     "AB": "Voxel-based morphometric (VBM) investigations of temporal lobe epilepsy have focused on the presence and distribution of gray matter abnormalities. VBM studies to date have identified the expected abnormalities in hippocampus and extrahippocampal temporal lobe, as well as more diffuse abnormalities in the thalamus, cerebellum, and extratemporal neocortical areas. To date, there has not been a comprehensive VBM investigation of cerebral white matter in nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy. This study examined 25 lateralized temporal lobe epilepsy patients (13 left, 12 right) and 62 healthy controls in regard to both temporal and extratemporal lobe gray and white matter. Consistent with prior reports, gray matter abnormalities were evident in ipsilateral hippocampus and ipsilateral thalamus. Temporal and extratemporal white matter was affected ipsilateral to the side of seizure onset, in both left and right temporal lobe epilepsy groups. These findings indicate that chronic temporal lobe epilepsy is associated not only with abnormalities in gray matter, but also with concomitant abnormalities in cerebral white matter regions that may affect connectivity both within and between the cerebral hemispheres.",
