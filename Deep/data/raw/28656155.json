     "AB": "The development of synthetic small molecules capable of promoting neuronal fate in stem cells is a promising strategy to prevent the decline of hippocampal function caused by several neurological disorders. Within this context, isoxazole 9 (Isx-9) has been shown to strongly induce cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), while also improving hippocampal function in healthy mice. We have recently demonstrated that Isx-9 is able to restore normal neurogenesis levels after procedural stress. Here, we further discuss these findings highlighting the importance of including a naive group in studies investigating the effects of either restraint stress or mild chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) on adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",
