     "AB": "In order to separate the effect of different theta generators in the hippocampus and to characterize the pattern of relationships between them, in this study, we calculated the coherence that remains between EEG signals, recorded (1) in the stratum oriens of the CA1 region and (2) close to the hippocampal fissure in the dentate gyrus of the right or left hippocampus, after the variations, common also for a third recording site is eliminated (partialization). We found that in both anesthetized and freely moving rats, there is a selective high correlation (coherence) between theta rhythmic activities of contralateral homonymous sites of the hippocampus. The coherence between field potentials recorded in ipsilateral superficial and deep layers was eliminated when allowance was made for any of the contralateral hippocampal recordings. On the other hand, coherence between contralateral homonymous theta dipoles did not decrease when partialized by a heteronymous hippocampal EEG signal. The present results support earlier findings on multiple hippocampal theta dipoles and indicate that they can be separated using partial coherence analysis. The left and right superficial and deep dipoles oscillate as if they formed two separate systems one extending over the superficial CA1 layers on both sides and the other consisting of the left and right deep hippocampal theta dipoles. The results also suggest an important role of the commissural projections in interhemispheric theta synchronization.",
