     "AB": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of nerve growth factor (NGF) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the higher vocal center (HVC) on singing behavior of adult male zebra finches. The results of our studies show: (a) that NGF is present in the brain of these birds and it is higher in the HVC than in the other neostriatal tissues; (b) that exogenous administration of NGF or NGF-antibody had no discernible effect on singing behavior; and (c) that NGF enhances the NPY immunoreactivity in neurons and fibers localized in HVC and other areas of the neostriatum and hippocampus whereas anti-NGF decreased NPY stained cells in the hippocampus. These studies indicate that NGF is produced in the brain of zebra finch and that it plays a role in the regulation of NPY.",
