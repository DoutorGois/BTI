     "AB": "C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is an abundant neuropeptide in the human brain and the cerebrospinal fluid. CNP is involved in anxiogenesis and exerts its effects through the natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPR-B), which is expressed in the hippocampus. Hippocampal network oscillations of distinct frequency bands like gamma (gamma)-oscillations and sharp wave-ripple complexes (SPW-Rs) are likely involved in various cognitive functions such as the storage of information and memory consolidation in vivo. Here, we tested the effects of CNP on distinct network oscillations in horizontal slices of rat hippocampus. We found that CNP decreased the power of stimulus- and ACh/physostigmine-induced gamma-oscillations. In contrast to stimulus-induced gamma-oscillations, CNP increased the frequency of ACh-induced, persistent network oscillations. Moreover, the peptide hormone reduced the incidence of LTP-associated SPW-Rs in area CA3 and CA1. Immunohistochemistry indicates that the peptide binds to receptors expressed on a subset of GAD 65-67-immunopositive cells in addition to binding to principal and other presumably non-neuronal cells. CNP caused a hyperpolarization of CA3 neurons increased their input resistance and decreased inhibitory conductance. Together, our data suggest that the effects of CNP on synchronized hippocampal network oscillations might involve effects on hippocampal interneurons.",
