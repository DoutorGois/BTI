     "AB": "The present work extends previous studies with the aim of developing the 4-vessel occlusion/internal carotid artery (4-VO/ICA) model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. The permanent occlusion of the vertebral arteries (VAs) and internal carotid arteries (ICAs) followed the sequence VA-->ICA-->ICA. The interstage interval (ISI, -->), chronicity of 4-VO/ICA, and age of the animals may determine the success of the model with regard to neurohistological and behavioral outcomes. Using middle-aged rats, the present study evaluated (i) how brain damage evolves as the ISI is reduced and duration (i.e., \"chronicity\") of 4-VO/ICA is prolonged and (ii) how the duration of 4-VO/ICA affects retrograde memory performance. Male Wistar rats (12-15 months of age) were subjected to 4-VO/ICA with an ISI of 7, 5, 4, or 3 days, and hippocampal and cortical damage was examined 7, 30, and 90 days later. Using an ISI of 4 days, retrograde memory performance was assessed in the aversive radial maze after 4-VO/ICA with a duration of 7, 30, and 90 days. The severity of brain neurodegeneration and rate of mortality progressively increased as the ISI length decreased from 7 to 3 days, an effect that was not significantly altered by the chronicity of 4-VO/ICA. Permanent 4-VO/ICA effectively caused retrograde amnesia, an effect that worsened as the chronicity of 4-VO/ICA was prolonged. The findings confirm and expand the notion that permanent, 3-stage 4-VO/ICA effectively produces extensive neurodegeneration and persistent learning/memory impairment in middle-aged rats and that the ISI length, more than the chronicity of 4-VO/ICA, determines the final results.",
