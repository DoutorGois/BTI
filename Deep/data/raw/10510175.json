     "AB": "Prostacyclin (PGI2) is a critical regulator of the cardiovascular system, via dilatation of vascular smooth muscle and inhibition of platelet aggregation (Moncada, S. 1982, Br. J. Pharmacol., 76, 3). Our previous studies demonstrated that a novel subtype of PGI2 receptor, which is clearly distinct from a peripheral subtype in terms of ligand specificity, is expressed in the rostral region of the brain, e.g. cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and striatum, and that (15R)-16-m-17,18,19,20-tetranorisocarbacyclin (15R-TIC) and 15-deoxy-16-m-17,18,19,20-tetranorisocarbacyclin (15-deoxy-TIC) specifically bind to the central nervous system (CNS)-specific PGI2 receptor. Here, we report that these CNS-specific PGI2 receptor ligands, including PGI2 itself, prevented the neuronal death. They prevented apoptotic cell death of hippocampal neurons induced by high (50%) oxygen atmosphere, xanthine + xanthine oxidase, and serum deprivation. IC50s for neuronal death were approximately 30 and 300 nM for 15-deoxy-TIC and 15R-TIC, respectively, which well correlated with the binding potency for the CNS-specific PGI2 receptor. 6-Keto-PGF1alpha (a stable metabolite of PGI2), peripheral nervous system-specific PGI2 ligands and other prostaglandins (PGs) than PGI2 did not show such neuroprotective effects. In vivo, 15R-TIC protected CA1 pyramidal neurons against ischaemic damage in gerbils. These results indicate that CNS-specific PGI2 ligands have neuronal survival-promoting activity both in vitro and in vivo, and may represent a new type of therapeutic drug for neurodegeneration.",
