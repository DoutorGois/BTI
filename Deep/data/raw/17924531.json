     "AB": "In humans, it is well established that major psychological functions are asymmetrically represented between the left and right cerebral cortices. The developmental origin of such functional lateralization remains unknown. Using the rat as a model system, we examined whether exposing neonates briefly to a novel environment can differentially affect synaptic plasticity in the left and right hippocampi during adulthood. During the first 3 weeks of life, one half of the pups from a litter spent 3 min daily away from their familiar home environment (Novel) while their littermates remained in that familiar environment (Home). At adulthood (7-months old), post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs), a very short-lasting form of plasticity, was greater among the Novel than the Home rats in both left and right hippocampi. In contrast, the novelty-induced increases in short- and long-term potentiation (STP, LTP), two relatively longer-lasting forms of plasticity, were found only in the right hippocampus. These findings demonstrate that a phase-selective asymmetry in hippocampal synaptic plasticity can be induced epigenetically by seemingly small systematic differences in early life environment. The selectivity of this asymmetry for the longer-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity suggests that the observed asymmetry in plasticity may contribute specifically to an asymmetric learning process which, in turn, may contribute to a functional asymmetry in the neocortex.",
