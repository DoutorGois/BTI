     "AB": "NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-mediated components of excitatory post-synaptic current (EPSC) were studied by in situ whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in the CA1 field of rat hippocampus. We found that the amplitudes ratio of the NMDA to the non-NMDA components can be strongly increased by blocking A1 adenosine receptors. The necessary conditions for this effect are both, increased Ca2+ and lowered Mg2+ in the external medium. The so achieved increase in the NMDA/non-NMDA ratio of EPSC components is irreversible and no longer depends on the activity of A1 adenosine receptors.",
