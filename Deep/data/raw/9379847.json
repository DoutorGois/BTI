     "AB": "RNA editing determines receptor kinetics and permeability of glutamate receptors. This post-transcriptional modification alters single nucleotides within an RNA transcript changing the codon specified by the genome resulting in the incorporation of a different amino acid, profoundly affecting the properties of the protein subunit. We have studied the three sites subject to RNA editing within the kainate-specific subunit GluR6 in the mammalian hippocampus to determine developmental changes and cell-specific variation in editing. GluR6, when measured in the whole rat hippocampus, is predominantly expressed in the unedited form at E18, with a gradual progression to the edited form during the 1st post-natal week, and remains stable from P8 through 30 months. Individual neurons from P0 through P8 rat hippocampal slices analyzed with single-cell PCR show predominant expression of fully edited GluR6, unlike the population profile. In contrast, single astrocytes from P0 hippocampal cultures show that the most common variant is partially edited. Thus, editing in neurons and glia differs, and this difference accounts for part of the disparity between single-neuron and whole-hippocampus data. Editing in astrocytes is affected by conditions in the external environment, as purified astrocytes fail to edit GluR6, although editing occurs in astrocytes from hippocampal cultures. The homogeneity of GluR6 editing between species was also determined by comparing editing in avians and mammals. Genomic and cDNA analysis of chick glutamate receptors demonstrates avian editing of GluR2 but not GluR6.",
