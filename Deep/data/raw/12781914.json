     "AB": "Natural hypothermia during hibernation results in physiological and behavioral deficits. These changes may be traced at the level of hippocampal signal transduction. We investigated synaptophysin immunoreactivity (SYN-ir) in the hippocampus after short and long periods of hypothermia and short and long periods of euthermy in hibernating ground squirrels. SYN-ir in the stratum lucidum of the hippocampus was transiently reduced during natural hypothermia. Natural hypothermia thus reduces synaptic efficacy. This may play a role in the reduced neuronal connectivity of CA3 pyramidal cell dendrites observed in hibernating ground squirrels.",
