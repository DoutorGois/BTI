     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To To investigate the changes of MicroRNA-134, CREB and p-CREB expression in epileptic rat brains in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of epilepsy, providing new ideas for clinical treatment. METHODS: Sixty-four Spraque-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into groups randomly, including control group, six hours after seizure group, 24-hour group, three-day group, one-week group, two-week group, four-week group, and eight-week group. All groups were placed under a pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model except the control group, and all rats were decapitated in different points of time. Brain specimens were taken for quantitative PCR experiments, immunohistochemistry and Western blot experiments. The results of the epilepsy model groups and the control group were compared. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the six hours after seizure group, the 24-hour group and the control group about the MicroRNA-134 levels. MicroRNA-134 in the hippocampus tissue of the three-day group significantly reduced compared with the control group; same result was observed with the one-week, two-week, four-week and eight-week groups. The CREB and p-CREB levels in the three-day group's rat hippocampus significantly increased compared with the control group; and the high levels of CREB and p-CREB were constantly maintained in the one-week, two-week, four-week and eight-week groups. CONCLUSIONS: The MicroRNA-134 level of the epileptic rat hippocampus is significantly lower than normal after three days, and continues to maintain a low level; while CREB and p-CREB levels are rsignificantly increased after three days, and continue to remain at a high level. MicroRNA-134 plays a role in inhibiting synaptic plasticity by inhibiting CREB and p-CREB expressions.",
