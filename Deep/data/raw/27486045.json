     "AB": "Post-stroke cognitive impairment is a major cause of long-term neurological disability. The prevalence of post-stroke cognitive deficits varies between 20% and 80% depending on brain region, country, and diagnostic criteria. The biochemical mechanisms underlying post-stroke cognitive impairment are not known in detail. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 is involved in neurodegeneration, and its dysregulation contributes to cognitive disorders and dementia. Here, we administered cyclin-dependent kinase 5-targeting gene therapy to the right hippocampus of ischemic rats after transient right middle cerebral artery occlusion. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 RNA interference prevented the impairment of reversal learning four months after ischemia as well as neuronal loss, tauopathy, and microglial hyperreactivity. Additionally, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 silencing increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus. Furthermore, deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation produced by excitotoxic stimulation were rescued by pharmacological blockade of cyclin-dependent kinase 5. This recovery was blocked by inhibition of the TRKB receptor. In summary, these findings demonstrate the beneficial impact of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 reduction in preventing long-term post-ischemic neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment as well as the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor/TRKB in the maintenance of normal synaptic plasticity.",
