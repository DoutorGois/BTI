     "AB": "The effects of the beta-carboline benzodiazepine receptor ligand FG 7142 upon local cerebral glucose utilization have been examined in conscious rats using the quantitative [14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiographic technique. FG 7142 (1-10 mg/kg i.v.) produced behavioural changes consistent with an anxiogenic action. At the largest dose of FG 7142 (10 mg/kg) 30% of the animals experienced overt convulsions. In the data analysis animals were divided according to the behavioural response elicited by the drug. In animals not expressing convulsions, FG 7142 (1-10 mg/kg) effected increases in glucose utilization in 33 of the 65 regions examined. The majority of changes were confined to limbic structures with pronounced effects occurring in the mammillary body, anterior thalamic nuclei, septal nuclei and the oriens and molecular layers of the hippocampus. Glucose use in other structures associated with auditory and visual processing, such as the medial and lateral geniculate body, and associated cortical areas, was also significantly increased. However, brain regions involved in motor control were minimally affected. The patterns of local cerebral glucose use in animals expressing FG 7142-induced convulsions were contrasted with those from an equivalent non-seizure group. Some limbic structures which were significantly affected by FG 7142 (non-seizure group) displayed a further increase in glucose utilization during convulsions. These included the mammillary body and septum. Many other limbic structures (anterior thalamic nuclei, CA fields of the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala) did not display this further rise in glucose utilization. In the cortical amygdala, lateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens and lateral elevations in glucose utilization were restricted to those animals experiencing overt convulsions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
