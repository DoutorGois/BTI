     "AB": "Two forms of use-dependent synaptic plasticity, called long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), can be elicited in the visual cortex following different paradigms of electrophysiological stimulation. These neurobiological phenomena often are considered as necessary components of models for the alteration in function of the nervous system that must occur at some level for the establishment and (or) maintenance of memory engrams, for learning processes, or for the consolidation of active neural connections and regression of inactive contacts in the developing brain. It has been postulated that for LTP and LTD to be produced in the hippocampus, activation of a particular subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor, the metabotropic receptor, is a critical requirement. Only recently has it become possible to test this hypothesis directly, as a new compound, (+/-)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), has been introduced and the suggestion made that it selectively antagonizes the metabotropic receptor. This substance has been tested in the present study on responses recorded from slices of rat visual cortex and has been found both to block the activation of the metabotropic receptor and to interfere selectively with the form of synaptic plasticity called LTD. It thus appears from the experiments reported in this paper as though the metabotropic receptor subtype that is blocked by MCPG is required for the expression of LTD but not for the expression of LTP, in the visual cortex of adult rats.",
