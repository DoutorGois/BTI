     "AB": "The present investigation evaluates the anti-stress activity of risperidone (RIS) in the cold restraint stress (CRS) model and related stress pathways. Rats were pretreated with RIS (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) for 21 days before subjecting to CRS. Ultra low dose of RIS (ULD; 0.1 mg/kg) in contrast to higher dose (1.0 mg/kg) significantly reduced stress in terms of ulcer index. ULD also reversed stress-induced increase in plasma corticosterone and norepinephrine levels used as markers for the function of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) respectively. ULD caused dose and brain region (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum) specific changes to stress-induced perturbations of serotonin, dopamine and its metabolites indicating modulation of brain monoaminergic system (BMS). ULD did not show any extrapyramidal side effects. Thus, the anti-stress effect ULD is probably mediated through the HPA axis, SNS and BMS. The study indicates a potential use of ULD in stress disorders.",
