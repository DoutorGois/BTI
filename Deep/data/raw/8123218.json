     "AB": "Alcoholism is often associated with brain damage and cognitive deficits. Because drinking patterns can include periods of alcohol consumption followed by abstinence, binge drinking may enhance the possibility of brain damage. Chronic administration of ethanol leads to upregulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and calcium receptors and increased release of glucocorticoids. NMDA-mediated mechanisms and glucocorticoid actions on the hippocampus are associated with brain damage. Thus, ethanol withdrawal may make the brain more vulnerable to damage from these mechanisms, especially with binge drinking. Therapeutic adjuncts for treating ethanol withdrawal, including NMDA, calcium, and glucocorticoid antagonists, may eventually prove useful in preventing further brain damage in alcoholism.",
