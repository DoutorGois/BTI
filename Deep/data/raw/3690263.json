     "AB": "The rat hippocampal slice preparation was used to evaluate the effect of increasing glucose levels in the perfusion medium on the recovery of synaptic function after a standardized hypoxic insult. Slices exposed to low glucose (5 mM) did not recover from a standard hypoxic insult (10 min of 95% N2/5% CO2 atmosphere). Following the same insult, 39% of the control (10 mM glucose) slices recovered their synaptic function, while 93% of the slices provided with high glucose level (20 mM) exhibited recovery of synaptic function. Thus, a dose-dependent effect of glucose on recovery of neuronal function following an intermediate period (10 min) of oxygen deprivation was found. The high-glucose-treated slices could tolerate a severe hypoxic insult of 15 min or even 20 min from which 94% and 81% of them recovered, respectively. Only 21% of the control (10 mM glucose) slices recovered their synaptic activity following 15 min of hypoxia, and none survived 20 min of that insult. The adverse effects of hyperglycemia reported in vivo were not seen in our study. This may be due to the sustained perfusion of the brain slice preparation, which could limit accumulation of lactic acid during hypoxia. However, treatment of slices with lactic acid prior to and during the hypoxic insult did not worsen the outcome. Alternatively, glucose may protect against the damaging effects of oxygen free radicals formed during reoxygenation. Nevertheless, the antihypoxic effect of glucose appears to be a metabolic one, since L-glucose (the non-metabolic analog of D-glucose) was innocuous in this respect.",
