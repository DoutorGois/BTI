     "AB": "Voxel-based analyses of tissue characteristics such as volume and T2 are usually carried out in isolation. However, as the images are analysed in a common voxel-based framework, it is possible to directly assess the spatial relationships of abnormalities detected by each technique. We utilize this approach in well-characterized patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). TLE is associated with potentially widespread volume and T2 signal abnormalities in MRI images but the relationship between these two aspects of tissue abnormality is not well understood. Here we use a novel approach of combined univariate and multivariate voxel-wise analysis to investigate the spatial relationship of these abnormalities. We studied 19 TLE patients and compared them to 115 control subjects. Grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume changes were assessed with voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and changes in T2 relaxation times were evaluated with voxel-based relaxometry (VBR). The volume and T2 changes obtained using the combined univariate approach were found in an extensive area, prominently in the ipsilateral hippocampus and amygdala (overlap of GM-VBM and VBR), and in the remaining temporal lobe (overlap of WM-VBR and VBR). Other cortical and subcortical areas showed isolated volume or T2 changes. The multivariate analysis based on the Hotelling T(2) statistic, indicated a similar pattern of distributed changes across the brain but with a greater degree of statistical significance in certain areas. The composite analyses appear to identify a network of affected areas not as easily appreciated by the individual analysis of volume or T2 changes.",
