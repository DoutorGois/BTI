     "AB": "Expression of synaptic plasticity involves the translation of mRNA into protein and, probably, active protein degradation via the proteasome pathway. Here, we report on the rapid activation of synthesis and degradation of a probe protein with the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral CA1 pathway. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 significantly reduced the field EPSP slope potentiation and LTP maintenance without acutely affecting basal synaptic transmission. To visualize protein dynamics, CA1 pyramidal cells of hippocampal slices were transfected with Semliki Forest virus particles expressing a recombinant RNA. This RNA contained the coding sequence for a degradable green fluorescence protein with a nuclear localization signal (NLS-d1EGFP) followed by a 3'- untranslated region dendritic targeting sequence. NLS-d1EGFP fluorescence remained stable in the low-frequency test stimulation but increased with LTP induction in the cell body and in most dendritic compartments of CA1 neurons. Applying anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, caused NLS-d1EGFP levels to decline; a proteasome inhibitor MG132 reversed this effect. In the presence of anisomycin, LTP induction accelerated the degradation of NLS-d1EGFP. When both inhibitors were present, NLS-d1EGFP levels remained unaffected by LTP induction. Moreover, LTP-induced acceleration of NLS-d1EGFP synthesis was blocked by rapamycin, which is consistent with the involvement of dendritic mammalian target of rapamycin in LTP-triggered translational activity. Our results clearly demonstrate that LTP induction not only leads to a rapid increase in the rate of protein synthesis but also accelerates protein degradation via the proteasome system.",
