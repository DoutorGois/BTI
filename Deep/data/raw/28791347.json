     "AB": "Although it has been established that recurrent or prolonged clinical seizures during infancy may cause lifelong brain damage, the underlying molecular mechanism is still not well elucidated. The present study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to investigate the expression of twenty zinc (Zn)/lipid metabolismassociated genes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rats following recurrent neonatal seizures. In the current study, 6dayold SpragueDawley rats were randomly divided into control (CONT) and recurrent neonatal seizure (RS) groups. On postnatal day 35 (P35), mossy fiber sprouting and gene expression were assessed by Timm staining and reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Of the twenty genes investigated, seven were significantly downregulated, while four were significantly upregulated in the RS group compared with CONT rats, which was observed in the hippocampus but not in the cerebral cortex. Meanwhile, aberrant mossy fiber sprouting was observed in the supragranular region of the dentate gyrus and Cornu Ammonis 3 subfield of the hippocampus in the RS group. In addition, linear correlation analysis identified significant associations between the expression of certain genes in the hippocampus, which accounted for 40% of the total fiftyfive gene pairs among the eleven regulated genes. However, only eight gene pairs in the cerebral cortex exhibited significant positive associations, which accounted for 14.5% of the total. The results of the present study indicated the importance of hippocampal Zn/lipid metabolismassociated genes in recurrent neonatal seizureinduced aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, which may aid the identification of novel potential targets during epileptogenesis.",
