     "AB": "In this study we examine the in vivo formation of the Apaf-1/cytochrome c complex and activation of caspase-9 following limbic seizures in the rat. Seizures were elicited by unilateral intraamygdala microinjection of kainic acid to induce death of CA3 neurons within the hippocampus of the rat. Apaf-1 was found to interact with cytochrome c within the injured hippocampus 0-24 h following seizures by co-immunoprecipitation analysis and immunohistochemistry demonstrated Apaf-1/cytochrome c co-localization. Cleavage of caspase-9 was detected approximately 4 h following seizure cessation within ipsilateral hippocampus and was accompanied by increased cleavage of the substrate Leu-Glu-His-Asp-p-nitroanilide (LEHDpNA) and subsequent strong caspase-9 immunoreactivity within neurons exhibiting DNA fragmentation. Finally, intracerebral infusion of z-LEHD-fluoromethyl ketone increased numbers of surviving CA3 neurons. These data suggest seizures induce formation of the Apaf-1/cytochrome c complex prior to caspase-9 activation and caspase-9 may be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of brain injury associated with seizures.",
