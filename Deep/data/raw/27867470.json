     "AB": "Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common complication after general anesthesia. Recent studies suggested that the hippocampus is involved in PONV. Hypothesising that hippocampal dopaminergic neurons are related to PONV, we examined the comprehensive mRNA profile of the hippocampus, using a sevoflurane-treated mouse model to confirm this. This study was conducted after approval from our institutional animal ethics committee, the Animal Research Center of Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine (project number: 12-033). Eight mice were assigned to two groups: a naive group and a sevoflurane group (Sev group). In the Sev group, four mice were anesthetised with 3.5% sevoflurane for 1 hour. Subsequently, mRNA was isolated from their hippocampal cells and RNA sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Mapping of the quality-controlled, filtered paired-end reads to mouse genomes and quantification of the expression levels of each gene were performed using R software. The Rtn4rl2 gene that encodes the Nogo receptor was the most up-regulated gene in the present study. The expression levels of dopamine receptor genes and the tachykinin gene were increased by sevoflurane exposure, while the genes related to serotonin receptors were not altered by sevoflurane exposure. The expression levels of LIM-homeodomain-related genes were highly down-regulated by sevoflurane. These findings suggest that sevoflurane exposure induces dopaminergic stimulation of hippocampal neurons and triggers PONV, while neuronal inflammation caused by LIM-homeodomain-related genes is down-regulated by sevoflurane.",
