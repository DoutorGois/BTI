     "AB": "Fe65 is a multimodular adaptor protein expressed mainly in the nervous system. Fe65 binds to the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the interaction is mediated via a phosphotyrosine binding domain in Fe65 and the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain of APP. Fe65 modulates trafficking and processing of APP, including production of the beta-amyloid peptide that is believed to be central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Fe65 also facilitates translocation of a carboxy-terminal fragment of APP to the nucleus and is required for APP-mediated transcription events. In addition, Fe65 functions in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell movement. Here we report the distribution profile of Fe65 immunoreactivity in adult mouse brain. Fe65 expression was found to be widespread in neurones in adult brain. The areas of highest expression included regions of the hippocampus in which the earliest abnormalities of Alzheimer's disease are detectable. Fe65 was also highly expressed in the cerebellum, thalamus and selected brain stem nuclei. Fe65 was evident in a sub-set of astrocytes within the stratum oriens and radiatum in the hippocampus. Expression of Fe65 was found to be developmentally regulated with levels reducing after embryonic day 15 and increasing again progressively from post-partum day 10 up to adulthood, a developmental pattern that partially parallels that of APP. These data indicate a widespread distribution of Fe65 in neurones throughout mouse brain and also suggest that Fe65 may have functions independent of APP and any potential role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",
