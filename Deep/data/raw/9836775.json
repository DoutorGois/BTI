     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reports suggesting the involvement of apoptosis in ischemic neuronal damage have been accumulating, and protection against apoptotic death by BCL-2 has been shown in many types of cells. Overexpression of BCL-2 has been shown to reduce infarct size after focal ischemia. The purpose of the present study was to assess whether BCL-2 exerted its effect on selective neuronal vulnerability after transient global ischemia. METHODS: Transgenic mice overexpressing BCL-2 in neurons and their littermates were subjected to transient forebrain ischemia for 12 minutes, and the hippocampus was examined 7 days later with conventional histology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling of fragmented DNA. RESULTS: Although both types of mice showed a similar degree of ischemic insult, transgenic mice showed a lesser degree of neuronal death together with DNA fragmentation in the hippocampus than their littermates. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of BCL-2 in neurons mitigates selective neuronal vulnerability in the hippocampus of transgenic mice after transient global ischemia.",
