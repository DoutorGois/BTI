     "AB": "Age-related declines in source memory have been observed for various stimuli and associated details. These impairments may be related to alterations in brain regions contributing to source memory via material-independent processes and/or regions specialized for processing specific materials. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigate the effects of aging on source memory and associated neural activity for words and objects. Source accuracy was equally impaired in older adults for both materials. Imaging data revealed both groups recruited similar networks of regions to support source memory accuracy irrespective of material, including parietal and prefrontal cortices (PFC) and the hippocampus. Age-related decreases in material-independent activity linked to postretrieval monitoring were observed in right lateral PFC. Additionally, age-related increases in source accuracy effects were shown in perirhinal cortex, which were positively correlated with performance in older adults, potentially reflecting functional compensation. In addition to group differences in material-independent regions, age-related crossover interactions for material-dependent source memory effects were observed in regions selectively engaged by objects. These results suggest that older adults' source memory impairments reflect alterations in regions making material-independent contributions to source memory retrieval, primarily the lateral PFC, but may be further impacted by changes in regions sensitive to particular materials.",
