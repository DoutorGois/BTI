     "AB": "Axonal voltage-gated potassium (Kv1) channels regulate action-potential invasion and hence transmitter release. Although evolutionarily conserved, what mediates their axonal targeting is not known. We found that Kv1 axonal targeting required its T1 tetramerization domain. When fused to unpolarized CD4 or dendritic transferrin receptor, T1 promoted their axonal surface expression. Moreover, T1 mutations eliminating Kvbeta association compromised axonal targeting, but not surface expression, of CD4-T1 fusion proteins. Thus, proper association of Kvbeta with the Kv1 T1 domain is essential for axonal targeting.",
