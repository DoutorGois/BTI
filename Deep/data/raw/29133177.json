     "AB": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health concern, especially injuries from repetitive insults. The main objective of this study was to immunocytochemically examine morphological alterations in astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus 48h following a single blast versus multiple blasts in adult C57BL/6 mice. The effects of ketamine and xylazine (KX), two common anesthetic agents used in TBI research, were also evaluated due to the confounding effect of anesthetics on injury outcome. Results showed a significant increase in hypertrophic microglia that was limited to the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, but only in the absence of KX. Although the presence or absence of KX had no effect on astrocytes following a single blast, a significant decrease in astrocytic immunoreactivity was observed in the stratum lacunosum moleculare following multiple blasts in the absence of KX. The morphological changes in astrocytes and microglia reported in this study reveal region-specific differences in the absence of KX that could have significant implications for our interpretation of glial alterations in animal models of injury.",
