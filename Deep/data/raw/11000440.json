     "AB": "Forebrain heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) immunohistochemical reactivity was investigated in rats subjected to gamma knife irradiation focusing on the right caudate putamen nucleus. The forebrain sections of all experimental animals were processed with anti-HSP70 antiserum and then by avidin-biotin peroxidase complex immunohistochemistry after gamma ray irradiation with a dose of 100Gy and they each survived for different times (from 30 min to 30 days). Some neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells were HSP70-like immunoreactivity (HSP70-LI) positive. HSP70-LI was mainly distributed in the target area of irradiation, as well as in non-target regions, e.g. the cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, etc. The expression and change of HSP70-LI from 3 h to 30 days after irradiation followed the following rules: (1) Within 3 to 24 h, the dilated vessels with HSP70-LI endothelial cells were found at first, and a few lightly stained HSP70-LI neurons and glias were observed in the target and non-target regions; (2) In 3-7 days, darkly stained HSP70-LI neurons and glias were apparently increased and formed an expression peak. From 14 to 30 days, HSP70-LI cells were distinctly decreased and became weakly stained or negative. These results suggested that although the irradiation target of the gamma knife was localized, the response to irradiation occurred extensively.",
