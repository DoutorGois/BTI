     "AB": "Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and ASK2 are both members of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family that are implicated in apoptotic cell death, stress responses, and various diseases. We have determined that NT2RI3007443, TESTI4031745, SGK341, and human MAP3K15 are all transcribed from the same genomic locus, which we designate \"ASK3 gene\" based on sequence homology to ASK1 and ASK2. NT2RI3007443, TESTI4031745, and SGK341 displayed distinct expression profiles among human tissues. TESTI4031745 was expressed in relatively high levels. The expression of TESTI4031745 was increased in rectum tumor and Alzheimer's disease hippocampus and decreased in kidney tumor and Alzheimer's disease frontal lobe. NT2RI3007443 showed moderate levels of ubiquitous expression in normal adult tissues. They did not drastically change in diseases except for increase in cirrhosis liver. Expression of SGK341 was restricted. It was highly expressed in fetal brain, and moderately expressed in normal hippocampus, pancreas, spleen, lung, and kidney. Further, its expression was dramatically increased in hepatic cirrhosis and decreased in lung tumor. Target proteins encoded by NT2RI3007443 and TESTI4031745 were translated in cell-free protein synthesis system. They exhibited protein kinase activity indicated by ATP consumption and phosphorylation of Syntide 2 as a substrate. We demonstrated that knockdown of ASK3 protected HeLa cells against cytotoxicity induced by anti-Fas monoclonal antibody, TNF-alpha, or oxidative stress. These findings suggest that \"ASK3 gene\" is a novel member of apoptosis signal-regulating kinases and that it plays a pivotal role in the signal transduction pathway implicated in apoptotic cell death triggered by cellular stresses. It can be a putative therapeutic drug target for multiple human diseases.",
