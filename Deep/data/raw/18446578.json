     "AB": "Consolidation processes were studied in the rat by using functional inactivation techniques. Previous results showed that unilateral hippocampal inactivation alters consolidation. It is not clear if bilateral treatments increase the impairment. Wistar rats were trained in the Morris water maze during 4 consecutive days. Subjects received saline or tetrodotoxin in the dorsal hippocampus 1 min after training. Results showed that bilateral as well as unilateral treatments impair consolidation to the same degree, as shown by the mean latency to reach the platform. In both cases, the impairment is only visible in the first trial of the session following the blockade.",
