     "AB": "During the past several years, evidence has accumulated suggesting a relationship between newly born cells in the hippocampus and various types of learning and memory. However, most of the evidence is correlational and some of it does not agree. This review discusses both sides of this issue, considering the effects of learning on the production of new neurons in the dentate gyrus and the question of whether newly born cells participate in learning and memory.",
