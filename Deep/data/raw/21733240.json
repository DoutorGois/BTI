     "AB": "Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved treatment for epilepsy and depression and has cognition-enhancing effects in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The hippocampus is widely recognized to be related to epilepsy, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. One possible mechanism of VNS involves its effect on the hippocampus; i.e. it increases the release of noradrenaline in the hippocampus. However, the effect of VNS on synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is unknown. To determine whether VNS modulates neurotransmission in the hippocampus, we examined the effects of VNS on perforant path (PP)-CA3 synaptic transmission electrophysiologically in anaesthetized rats. VNS induces a persistent enhancement of PP-CA3 field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs). Arc, an immediate early gene, was used to identify active brain regions after VNS. The locus coeruleus (LC), which contains the perikarya of noradrenergic projections, harboured more Arc-positive cells, as measured by in-situ hybridization, after 10-min VNS. In addition, electrical lesions of LC neurons or intraventricular administration of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist timolol prevented the enhancement of PP-CA3 responses by VNS. In conclusion, the protracted increase in PP-CA3 synaptic transmission that is induced by VNS entails activation of the LC and beta-adrenergic receptors. Our novel findings suggest that information from the periphery modulates synaptic transmission in the CA3 region of the hippocampus.",
