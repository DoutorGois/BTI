     "AB": "The amphetamine derivative methylenedioxyamphetamine selectively destroys serotoninergic terminals in the brain. We have studied the effects of this toxin upon resting cerebral function, as reflected in rates of glucose utilization. Rats were injected subcutaneously with either 1 ml/kg saline (n = 5) or 20 mg/kg methylenedioxyamphetamine (n = 5) twice daily for four days. Local cerebral glucose utilization was measured between six and nine weeks after treatment using [14C]2-deoxyglucose quantitative autoradiography. Samples of frontal cortex taken from these animals for in vitro [3H]paroxetine binding showed a 64% reduction in 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake sites. In the majority of the 31 functionally diverse brain areas analysed, no significant changes were measured, but significant (P less than 0.05) increases in glucose use were found in neocortical regions e.g. anterior cingulate cortex (+16%) and sensorimotor cortex (+21%). However, the most profound increases were found in globus pallidus (+30%) and hippocampus molecular layer (+34%). It would appear, therefore, that treatment with methylenedioxyamphetamine results in long-lasting alterations in cerebral functional activity.",
