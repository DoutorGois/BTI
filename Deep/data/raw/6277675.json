     "AB": "Specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding was determined for five brain regions in both sexes of the three Roman rat strains. Small strain differences and a large Sex-Region interaction were detected, benzodiazepine receptor binding being significantly higher in females in the two cortical areas and the cerebellum, but significantly lower in the striatum and hippocampus. These findings are discussed in the context of sex and strain differences in behavior and benzodiazepine sensitivity.",
