     "AB": "This study aimed to investigate the effect of exercise and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition on memory, anxiety, and protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and P70S6 kinase (P70S6K). Twenty-month-old rats were divided into 6 groups: a control group, 2 groups treated with l-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (25 or 100 mg/kg) for 63 days, 2 groups treated with L-NAME (25 or 100 mg/kg) for 63 days plus 2 months of exercise, and 1 group treated with exercise. Behavioral tests were conducted to determine the anxiolytic and memory-improving role of exercise and NOS inhibition. BDNF, P70S6K, and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were evaluated by Western blotting. Exercise and L-NAME (25 mg/kg) or their combination had an anxiolytic effect and improved spatial memory in old rats compared with the control or exercised group, respectively. Exercise and treatment with a low dose of L-NAME (25 mg/kg) each increased BDNF and P70S6K in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex compared with levels in control rats. In comparison with exercise alone, co-treatment with exercise and a low dose of L-NAME (25 mg/kg) also increased BDNF and P70S6K in the hippocampus. The neuronal level of cleaved caspase-3 was reduced in the L-NAME (25 mg/kg) + exercise group compared with the exercised group. The L-NAME (100 mg/kg) + exercise treatment had no positive behavioral or molecular effects compared with exercise alone. The protective role of NOS inhibition and aerobic exercise against aging is probably modulated via BDNF and P70S6K in the brain.",
