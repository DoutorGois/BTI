     "AB": "DNA damage has been postulated as a mechanism of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, genomic DNA was isolated from eight brain regions (frontal, temporal, and occipital cortex, hippocampus, caudate/putamen, thalamus, cerebellum, and midbrain) from five neuropathologically confirmed cases of Parkinson's disease and six control brains and analyzed for the presence of single and double strand breaks, melting temperature, EtBr intercalation, DNAse digestion pattern, and DNA conformations. The results showed that DNA from midbrain in PD accumulated significantly higher number of strand breaks than age-matched controls. Caudate nucleus/putamen, thalamus, and hippocampus also showed more DNA fragmentation compared to control brains. Circular dichroism studies showed that DNA conformation was altered with imprecise base stacking in midbrain, caudate nucleus/putamen, thalamus, and hippocampus in PD. However, DNA from frontal, temporal, and occipital cortex, and cerebellum was not affected significantly in PD group as compared to controls. This study provides a comprehensive database on stability, damage, and conformations of DNA in different regions in brains of PD patients.",
