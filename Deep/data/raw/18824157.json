     "AB": "A widespread population of cells in CNS is identified by specific expression of the NG2 chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan and named as oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC). OPCs may possess stem cell-like characteristics, including multipotentiality in vitro and in vivo. It was proposed that OPCs in the CNS parenchyma comprise a unique population of glia, distinct from oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. This study confirmed that NG2 immunoreactive OPCs were continuously distributed in cerebral cortex and hippocampus during different postnatal developmental stages. These cells rapidly increased in number over the postnatal 7 days and migrate extensively to populate with abundant processes both in developing cortex and hippocampus. The morphology of OPCs exhibited extremely complex changes with the distribution of long distance primary process gradually increased from neonatal to adult CNS. Immunohistochemical studies showed that OPCs exhibited the morphological properties that can be distinguished from astrocytes. The electrophysiological properties showed that OPCs expressed a small amount of inward Na(+) currents which was distinguished from Na(+) currents in neurons owing to their lower Na-to-K conductance ratio and higher command voltage step depolarized maximum Na(+) current amplitude. These observations suggest that OPCs can be identified as the third type of macroglia because of their distribution in the CNS, the morphological development in process diversity and the electrophysiological difference from astrocyte.",
