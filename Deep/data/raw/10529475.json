     "AB": "Following chronic alcohol treatment alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1 and 2 (NR1 and NR2), mRNA and protein levels have been reported. The NR1 gene undergoes alternative RNA splicing, resulting in eight splice variants, which were shown to differ in their sensitivity to alcohol. Here, we studied mRNA and protein levels of NR1 splice variants in alcohol-preferring (AA) and alcohol-nonpreferring (ANA) rat lines under basal conditions (alcohol-naive), and following chronic alcohol consumption. mRNA levels of three NR1 splice variants (NR1-1, NR1-2, NR1-4), and the protein levels of NR1 (NR1-1/NR1-2), and of NR1 alternative C-terminus (NR1-3/NR1-4) were determined in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens by competitive RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. No significant differences in NR1 mRNA, or protein levels were found in the nucleus accumbens between the two rat lines under basal conditions, or following chronic alcohol consumption. In the hippocampus of alcohol-naive rats, the NR1-4 mRNA content was significantly higher in ANA compared to AA rats, however, no significant difference could be detected at the protein level. Following chronic alcohol consumption, the protein level of the NR1 alternative C-terminus (NR1-3/NR1-4) was significantly higher in AA rats compared to the corresponding control. Taken together, these results suggest: (i) brain site-specific alterations in NMDA receptor subunit composition occur following chronic alcohol consumption. (ii) In the hippocampus, NR1 splice variant mRNA levels differ between AA and ANA rats. (iii) The mRNA levels and protein levels of NR1 splice variants are differentially affected by chronic alcohol consumption.",
