     "AB": "Neuroglobin is a nerve-specific respiratory protein that has been proposed to play an important role in the protection of brain neurons from ischemic and hypoxic injuries. Here, we investigated the regulation of neuroglobin expression after transient global ischemia in the rat brain using mRNA in situ hybridization and under hypoxic stress in cultured neuronal cell lines (PC12, HN33) by quantitative RT-PCR. While neuroglobin mRNA expression was significantly enhanced in cell culture after severe prolonged hypoxia (0-1% O2 for 24 h), we did not find any significant increases in neuroglobin mRNA levels in the rat brain after transient global ischemia. Vegf and Glut1 mRNAs showed increases in the hippocampus as expected. Therefore, it is unlikely that neuroglobin is instrumental in the acute response of neurons to hypoxic or ischemic insults, for which the mammalian brain is not adapted.",
