     "AB": "Recent observations suggest that neurocysticercosis (NCC) might act as an initial precipitating injury (IPI) causing mesial temporal lobe epilepsy associated with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS). A total of 191 patients from Brazil, a country in which NCC is endemic, were surgically treated for MTLE-HS, and subsequent findings for patients with MTLE-HS were compared with those of patients with MTLE-HS plus NCC. Seventy-one patients (37,2%) presented chronic findings of NCC (cNCC). MTLE-HS plus cNCC was significantly more common in women (O.R.=2.45; 95%CI=1.30-4.60; p=0.005), in patients with no history of classical forms of IPI (O.R.=2.67; 95%CI=1.37-5.18; p=0.004), and in those with bi-temporal interictal spikes on video-EEG (O.R.=2.00; 95%CI=1.07-3.73; p=0.03). Single cNCC lesions were observed to occur significantly more often on the same side as hippocampal sclerosis, a finding suggesting an anatomical relationship between NCC and MTLE-HS. Taken together, our results suggest that NCC may be a marker, or contributes to or even causes MTLE-HS. Based on our findings, we propose two distinct, non-excluding, and potentially synergistic mechanisms involved in the development of MTLE-HS in NCC, one of them being inflammatory-mediated, while the other is electrogenic-mediated. Taken together, our observations may provide further evidence suggesting a role of NCC in the genesis or development of MTLE-HS.",
