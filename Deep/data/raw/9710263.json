     "AB": "Adenosine has been shown to play a significant role as a modulator of neuronal activity in convulsion disorders, acting as an endogenous anticonvulsant agent. In the present study, we have investigated in mice the effect of acute tonic-clonic seizures induced by a single Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-injection (a) on the time development of adenosine uptake site binding after seizures in membranes of hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and striatum, and (b) on the regional distribution of adenosine uptake sites in the mouse brain by using \"in vitro\" quantitative autoradiography. As radioligand, the specific adenosine uptake blocker [3H]N-9-nitrobenzylthioinosine ([3H]NBI) was used. Acute seizures induced a rapid significant increase in [3H]NBI uptake site binding in hippocampus and cerebellum within 5 min, in cortex within 10 min after seizures, which reached a maximum level at 1 hr and reversed to control levels in about 150 min after seizures. On the contrary, in striatum a significant decrease of [3H]NBI uptake site binding was observed within 10 min after seizures, which reached its maximum at 1 hr and reversed to control levels at 150 min after seizures. With this single exception of striatum the \"in vitro\" quantitative autoradiography revealed a rather widespread upregulation of [3H]NBI uptake site density in the mouse brain, which was specifically enhanced in certain areas known to mediate seizure activity, such as hippocampus, specific thalamic nuclei, temporal cortex, and substantia nigra. The pattern of increases in [3H]NBI uptake site binding as they develop after acute seizures correlates well in time with the rapid enhancement of endogenous adenosine concentration released during epileptic activity. Since extracellular adenosine levels seem to be regulated by a rapid reuptake system, it seems likely that in our study, the [3H]NBI adenosine uptake system is acutely activated by seizures in order to compensate for the excess of endogenous adenosine. Furthermore, the upregulation of [3H]NBI uptake sites as revealed by the \"in vitro\" quantitative autoradiography seems to be organized in selective brain areas related to seizure propagation.",
