     "AB": "The rhythmical and pharmacological properties of carbachol-induced beta oscillation were studied using rat hippocampal slices. With the application of 30 microM carbachol, beta-range oscillations with frequencies of 13-20 Hz were recorded from the CA3 region. An AMPA receptor antagonist, CNQX, diminished the oscillations. An NMDA receptor antagonist, APV, significantly suppressed the pre-established beta oscillations. The pre-application of APV blocked the start of the carbachol-induced beta oscillations. When bicuculline (BIC), a GABAA receptor antagonist, was applied to the pre-established beta oscillations, the frequency decreased to the theta-range. When 5 microM BIC was applied with 30 microM carbachol, the beta oscillations did not start; instead, theta-like activities were induced. It has been reported that carbachol in hippocampal slices can induce theta-like activities, which are not modulated by BIC, while BIC's facilitating the start of the activities. The results of the present study suggest that the GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory transmission modulates the beta oscillation and that the transmission is needed for the start process of the oscillations. Therefore, the start and generation mechanisms of carbachol-induced beta oscillation will be different from those of carbachol-induced theta-like activities.",
