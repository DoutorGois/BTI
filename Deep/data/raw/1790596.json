     "AB": "Impairment of polyamine synthesis by treatment with difluoromehtylornithine (DFMO), an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, has been shown to alter normal brain development. In the present study we determined the effect of DFMO treatment during a discrete developmental period on polyamine levels and on the in situ activity of calpain, as reflected by the level of degradation of spectrin, in various brain regions of rat pups. DFMO treatment from postnatal days 5 to 10 produced a marked decrease in putrescine levels in every brain structure and a significant decrease in spectrin breakdown levels in hippocampus and cortex but not in cerebellum. The results indicate that the ODC/polyamine pathway partly regulates the in situ activity of calpain and that polyamines may play a role in both growth and degeneration phenomena.",
