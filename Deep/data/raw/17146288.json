     "AB": "Alzheimer disease is the most common dementia in older Americans, but its impact on blacks is not clearly understood. We examined prospectively 200 autopsy brains at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Maryland and compared the frequency and severity of Alzheimer lesions in blacks and whites. Histologic sections of the hippocampus and entorhinal and neocortices were immunostained for Abeta and tau proteins. Subjects were genotyped for ApoE. Abeta deposits were rated as none, sparse, moderate, or frequent; tau lesions were rated into 4 groups corresponding to Braak scores; and Abeta angiopathy was classified as present or absent. Outcome scores were treated as ordinal variables and analyzed by proportional odds logistic regression. Abeta plaques were present in 60% of black males, 58% of white males, 74% of black females, and 74% of white females. Tau lesions were present in 96% of black males, 88% of white males, 96% of black females, and 96% of white females. Neither race nor gender was a significant factor in the frequency or severity of Alzheimer lesions, and ApoE4 increased the risk for Alzheimer lesions similarly in blacks and whites.",
