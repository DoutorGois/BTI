     "AB": "Coscinium fenestratum is a common medicinal plant widely used in the Indochina region, but scientific data on its safety is very limited. This study aimed to observe the effect of this plant on neurotoxicity and neurobehavior. Oral administration of plant alcoholic extract at dosages of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kgBW for 14 days increased the rats body weight and decreased the neuron density in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum. The plant extract significantly increased stereotyped behavior in licking but did not cause anxiolytic activity, anti-depression, sensory motor co-ordination impairment and ataxia. It is concluded that the plant possesses neurotoxicity and is able to induce neurobehavioral changes in rats. Therefore, the application of this plant as either drug or supplementary food should be reconsidered.",
