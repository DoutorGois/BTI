     "AB": "The effect of 4 weeks of spontaneous chronic ethanol intake in drinking water and then ethanol withdrawal on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) steady-state levels and turnover rates was investigated in 15 brain areas of C57 Bl/6J alcohol-preferring mice. These mice did not display typical ethanol withdrawal convulsions. There was no statistically significant difference in the brain GABA steady-state levels among the control group, chronic ethanol-treated mice, and mice after ethanol withdrawal. In contrast, chronic ethanol treatment induced significant variations in GABA turnover rate, as measured by gabaculine-induced accumulation of GABA, in eight of 15 areas examined versus a decrease in seven brain areas [cerebellum (-29%), amygdala (-28%), olfactory tubercles (-24%), septum (-24%), striatum (-53%), frontal cortex (-21%), and hippocampus (-24%)]; an increase in turnover rate in the posterior colliculus (100%) was observed. At 26 h after ethanol withdrawal, in the seven areas in which GABA turnover rate decreased after spontaneous chronic ethanol intake, a return to the initial control value was observed; in the posterior colliculus, the turnover rate did not change, remaining higher than the control value. This persisting alteration of GABA turnover rate may be related to the absence of the ethanol withdrawal syndrome in the C57 mouse strain.",
