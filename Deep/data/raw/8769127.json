     "AB": "We have investigated the expression of the alpha-region of CREB (amino acids 88-101) in the rat brain. This region is encoded by a separate exon and has been reported to enhance the transcriptional efficiency of CREB. Light microscopic immunohistochemistry showed labeled neurons in several brain regions, such as the spinal cord, pontine reticular formation, cerebellum, hypothalamus, hippocampus and olfactory cortex. The labeling was exclusively cytoplasmic, and electron microscopy revealed that the CREB alpha-immunoreactivity was localized to the Golgi apparatus and axon terminals. Immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE showed specifically detected proteins of 21 and 160 kD. We suggest that neuronal CREB alpha-proteins represent alternatively spliced isoforms of CREB that lack the nuclear translocation signal. These isoforms may be involved in the regulation of CREB-mediated transcription.",
