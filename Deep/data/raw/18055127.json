     "PG": "1-11",
     "AB": "Although a robust relationship between sleep and increased brain protein synthesis is well-documented, there have been few reports of the effects of local application of a protein synthesis inhibitor (PSI) on sleep. In this study, we compared the effects of local microdialytic administration of the protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin (ANI) into the lateral preoptic area (LPOA), a sleep promoting area vs. the perifornical/lateral hypothalamus (PF/LH), a wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-promoting area. ANI administered to the LPOA at night resulted in an increase in stage 2 of rat non-REM sleep, whereas ANI delivered into the PF/LH during the daytime increased REM sleep. ANI microdialysis into hippocampus did not affect sleep or waking. These differential effects of local protein synthesis inhibition on sleep support a hypothesis that mechanisms controlling protein synthesis are critically involved in the regulation of both NREM sleep and REM sleep.",
