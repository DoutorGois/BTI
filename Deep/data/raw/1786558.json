     "AB": "Developing rats were either malnourished or well-nourished during the prenatal period by feeding their dams diets of low (6% casein) or adequate (25% casein) protein content 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy. All pups were well-nourished from the day of birth onwards. Male offspring aged 107 days were gradually reduced to 80% of their free-feeding weight. When weights were stable they were trained to run in an alley for food rewards given on every trial (continuous reinforcement, CR) or on a random 50% of trials (partial reinforcement, PR), then the running response was extinguished. A very clear and similar partial reinforcement extinction effect (PREE) was demonstrated in the previously malnourished and control rats when reward was discontinued. That is, PR groups showed greater persistence as compared with CR groups. During acquisition, however, differences in running speed were observed in the goal section between 6-25 PR and 25-25 PR groups, and between 6-25 CR and 25-25 CR groups. The latter may be due to differences between the nutritional groups in food motivation.",
