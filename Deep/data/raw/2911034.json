     "AB": "The effect of a single electroconvulsive shock (ECS) (30 min and 24 h after treatment) and repeated ECS (10 once-daily) on the adenosine neuromodulatory system was investigated in rat cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and striatum. The present study examined the adenosine A1 receptor using N6-[3H]cyclohexyladenosine ([3H]CHA), the A2 receptor using 5'-N-[3H]ethylcarboxyamidoadenosine ([ 3H]NECA), adenylate cyclase using [3H]forskolin, and the adenosine uptake site using [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine ([3H]NBI). At 30 min after a single ECS, the Bmax of the [3H]NBI binding in striatum was increased by 20%, which is in good agreement with the well-known postictal adenosine release. The Bmax of [3H]forskolin binding in striatum and cerebellum was increased by 60 and 20%, respectively. In contrast to earlier reported changes following chemically induced seizures, [3H]CHA binding was not altered postictally. At 24 h after a single ECS, there were no changes for any ligand in any brain region. Following repeated ECS, there was a 20% increase of [3H]CHA binding sites in cerebral cortex, which lasted for at least 14 days after the last ECS. [3H]Forskolin binding in hippocampus and striatum was 20% lowered 24 h after 10 once-daily ECS but had already returned to control levels 48 h after the last treatment. Evidence is provided that the upregulated adenosine A1 receptors are coupled to guanine nucleotide binding proteins and, furthermore, that this upregulation is not paralleled by an increase in adenylate cyclase activity as labeled by [3H]forskolin.",
