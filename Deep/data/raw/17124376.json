     "AB": "The neutral amino acid transporters SNAT1-3 and ASCT1 play critical roles in the recycling of glutamine, and subsequently glutamate, via the glutamine-glutamate cycle. Hypoxia-ischemia was induced in rat pups using the Rice-Vannucci model. Brains were harvested at 1 h, 24 h and 7 days after ischemia. The expression of NAATs was evaluated using immunoblotting, real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Results were compared with age-matched controls and shams. SNAT1 mRNA decreased at 1 h after injury in both hemispheres when compared with the control animals and correlated with a decrease in protein expression at 24 h in the hippocampus and cortex. SNAT1 protein expression increased globally at 7 days after injury and specifically in the hippocampus. Finally, SNAT2 and 3 demonstrated subtle changes in various brain regions after injury. These data suggest that neutral amino acid transporters remain largely intact after hypoxia-ischemia.",
