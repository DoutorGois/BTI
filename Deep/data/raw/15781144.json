     "AB": "Human neuronal protein 22 (hNP22) is a novel neuron-specific protein featuring numerous motifs previously described in cytoskeleton-associating and signaling proteins. Because previous studies have supported abnormalities in neuronal cytoarchitecture and/or development in the schizophrenia brain, we examined the expression of hNP22 in the anterior cingulate cortex, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic and normal control postmortem brains using high-sensitive immunohistochemistry. Seven schizophrenic and seven age- and sex-matched control brains were examined. The ratio of hNP22-immunopositive cells/total cells was significantly reduced in layer V (p=.020) and layer VI (p=.022) of the anterior cingulate cortex of schizophrenic brain compared with controls. In contrast, there were no significant changes observed in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that altered expression of hNP22 may be associated with modifications in neuronal cytoarchitecture leading to dysregulation of neural signal transduction in the anterior cingulate cortex of the schizophrenia brain.",
