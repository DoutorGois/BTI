     "AB": "This study evaluated the developmental gene and protein expression of proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs: peptide transporter, PepT1 and PepT2; peptide-histidine transporter, PhT1 and PhT2) in different regions of rodent brain, and the age-dependent uptake of a POT substrate, glycylsarcosine (GlySar), in brain slices. Slices were obtained from cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus of wildtype and PepT2 null mice, and from rats at different ages. Gene and protein expression were determined by real-time PCR and immunoblot analyses. Brain slice uptakes of radiolabeled glycylsarcosine were determined in the absence and presence of excess unlabeled glycylsarcosine or l-histidine, the latter being an inhibitor of PhT1/2 but not PepT1/2. As PepT2 and PhT1 transcripts were abundantly expressed in all three regions of mouse brain, little to no expression was observed for PepT1 and PhT2. PhT1 protein was present in brain regions of adult but not neonatal mice and expression levels increased with age in rats. Glycylsarcosine uptake, inhibition and transporter dominance did not show regional brain or species differences. However, there were clear age-related differences in functional activity, with PepT2 dominating in neonatal mice and rats, and PhT1 dominating in adult rodents. These developmental changes may markedly impact the neural activity of both endogenous and exogenous (drug) peptides/mimetics. Developmental gene and protein expression of peptide transporters was evaluated in various regions of rodent brain, along with age-dependent uptake of dipeptide. We found marked changes in protein expression and functional activity of PhT1 and PepT2, the former predominating in adult and the latter in neonate. These developmental changes may markedly impact the neural activity of endogenous and exogenous peptides/mimetics.",
