     "AB": "We have used differential display to profile and compare the mRNAs expressed in the hippocampus of freely moving animals after the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at the perforant path-dentate gyrus synapse with control rats receiving low-frequency stimulation. We have combined this with in situ hybridization and have identified A-kinase anchoring protein of 150 kDa (AKAP-150) as a gene selectively up-regulated during the maintenance phase of LTP. AKAP-150 mRNA has a biphasic modulation in the dentate gyrus following the induction of LTP. The expression of AKAP-150 was 29% lower than stimulated controls 1 h after the induction of LTP. Its expression was enhanced 3 (50%), 6 (239%) and 12 h (210%) after induction, returning to control levels by 24 h postinduction. The NMDA receptor antagonist CPP blocked the tetanus-induced modulation of AKAP-150 expression. Interestingly, strong generalized stimulation produced by electroconvulsive shock did not increase the expression of AKAP-150. This implies that the AKAP-150 harbours a novel property of selective responsiveness to the stimulation patterns that trigger NMDA-dependent LTP in vivo. Its selective up-regulation during LTP and its identified functions as a scaffold for protein kinase A, protein kinase C, calmodulin, calcineurin and ionotropic glutamate receptors suggest that AKAP-150 encodes is an important effector protein in the expression of late LTP.",
