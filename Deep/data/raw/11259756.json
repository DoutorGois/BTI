     "AB": "Chelatable zinc ions from synaptic vesicles have been suggested to be involved in neuronal death caused by stroke, epilepsy and head trauma. Elevated glucocorticoid concentration exacerbates such neuron loss, while low levels protect. We have tested the notion that the neuroprotective effect of prior glucocorticoid reduction is mediated by a reduction of zinc ions contained in zinc-enriched (ZEN) synaptic vesicles. The level of vesicular zinc ions was evaluated by toluene sulfonamide quinoline (TSQ) fluorometry and zinc autometallography (ZnS(AMG)) 10 and 30 days, respectively, after adrenalectomy. The hippocampus showed significant vesicular zinc ion depletion following adrenalectomy. After the kainate injection, adrenalectomized rats showed proconvulsive seizure behavior, i.e. shortened latency to seizure onset time and increased seizure score. Additionally they showed decreased hippocampal CA3 neuronal death as compared to control animals. The present data suggest that zinc ions released from damaged ZEN terminals are involved in seizure-induced neuronal death.",
