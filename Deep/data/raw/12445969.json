     "AB": "The effects of dexamethasone on adenosine 5'-triphosphatase (ATPase) activity and the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) were investigated in acidotic mouse brain. Dexamethasone (3 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle was administered 3 h before decapitation ischemia, and the brain concentration of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) was determined 0.5-2 min after ischemia. The effects of dexamethasone (0.3-3 mg/kg, i.p.) on Na(+),K(+)-activated ATPase (Na(+),K(+)-ATPase) and Ca(2+)-ATPase activities were evaluated at pH 7.4 and 6.8. Changes in [Ca(2+)](i) in an acidic medium were determined in hippocampal slices by microfluorometry using rhod-2 acetoxymethyl ester as a Ca(2+) marker, and the effects of dexamethasone (240 microg/l) was evaluated. Decapitation ischemia for 0.5 and 1 min reduced the brain ATP contents to 32% and 16% of the basal level, respectively. Dexamethasone slightly suppressed the extent of the decrease in the ATP level. Although dexamethasone did not affect Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity at pH 7.4, the activity was suppressed by dexamethasone (3 mg/kg) to 68% at pH 6.8. The activity of Ca(2+)-ATPase was not affected by dexamethasone at either pH 7.4 or pH 6.8. When the pH of the medium of the brain slices was changed from 7.4 to 6.8, almost no increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was observed in the control group. The dexamethasone treatment increased [Ca(2+)](i) in the CA1 field and dentate gyrus immediately after induction of the acidic medium, the effect being significant after 150 s. Because anaerobic glucose metabolism in the early stage of ischemia enhances intracellular lactic acidosis, the findings may suggest a mechanism for the aggravation of ischemic neuronal damage by glucocorticoids.",
