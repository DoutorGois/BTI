     "AB": "A monoclonal antibody, mab SMgp65, which recognises two major glycoprotein components of isolated forebrain synaptic subfractions has been raised. The mab has been used to study the cellular and subcellular localisation of these novel glycoproteins and for the partial characterisation of both molecular species. Western blots show that the mab reacts with two diffuse glycoprotein bands (gp) of apparent Mr 65,000, gp65, and 55,000, gp55. Both glycoproteins are membrane-bound, only detectable in CNS tissue and exist solely in a concanavalin A (con A) binding form. Digestion with endoglycosidase H lowers the Mr of both glycoproteins by some 5-7 kDa. Gp65 and gp55 are enriched in synaptic membrane (SM), light membrane (LM) and microsomal fractions. However, whilst gp65 is enriched in isolated postsynaptic densities (psds) gp55 is conspicuously absent from this fraction. Regional distribution studies show a marked variation in the level of gp65. Gp65 is concentrated in several forebrain regions notably cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum, is present only in low levels in cerebellum and is barely detectable in pons and medulla. In contrast gp55 is present in all regions studied, but is most concentrated in cerebellum. Immunocytochemical studies show intense staining of regions rich in gp65, but no staining of regions deficient in this glycoprotein. This suggests that the mab recognises gp65, but not gp55 in fixed tissue sections. Exposure of tissue sections to Triton X-100 increases the intensity of gp65-like immunoreactivity, but does not alter its pattern of subcellular distribution. Higher resolution studies show the immunoreactivity to be localised to subsets of neurites, many being axonal. The reaction deposits also extend into the synaptic region of the immunoreactive neurones. Cultured cerebellar granule cells, but not astrocytes express gp55. The results are discussed in terms of the molecular properties and localisation of these two novel glycoproteins.",
