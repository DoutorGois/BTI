     "AB": "This study reports the pathological findings and the distribution of viral antigen in the brains of 13 confirmed and autopsied cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in correlation with other virus-specific immunological parameters measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) antemortem. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-specific antibodies were detected in the CSF of 10 of 13 patients, JEV antigen was detected in the CSF of 7 of 13 and JEV-specific immune complexes were detected in the CSF of 3 of 11 patients. Viral antigen was localised immunocytochemically in the brain tissue of 11 of 13 cases, indicating, that viral antigen could not be cleared from the tissues by the antibody. The topographic distribution of the tissue-associated antigen in the thalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra and medulla oblongata explain the evolution of post JE sequelae.",
