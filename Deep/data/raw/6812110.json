     "PG": "351-8",
     "AB": "Passive avoidance learning was significantly impaired by atropine (5 mg/kg, IP) or scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg), but not by methyl-atropine (5 mg/kg) or methyl-scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg), from postnatal day 15 on. In contrast, an improvement was observed, not significant at 11 days and significant at 13 days, probably due to nonspecific effects. Retention of the response increased from 6 h at 13 days, to 24 h at 17 days. In treated rats, retention was abolished at 13 and 15 days, and impaired at 17 and 20 days. Acquisition of the response was also significantly impaired by bilateral injections of atropine (1, 5, and 20 micrograms) into the posteroventral hippocampo-entorhinal (VHE) area, from day 15 on. Concomitantly, extinction was accelerated. At 14 days, atropine had no influence. At 13 days, a facilitatory action was observed, with better acquisition and greater resistance to extinction, possibly linked to affective changes. The results confirm that central muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms are involved in passive avoidance learning from postnatal day 15 on, and demonstrate that some pathways of this system are located in the VHE area, become efficient at 15 days, and improve markedly between 17 and 18 days.",
