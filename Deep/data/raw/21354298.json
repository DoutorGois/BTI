     "AB": "In the current study we initially investigated the influence of antioxidants (vitamins E plus C) on the effect mediated by acute and chronic administration of methionine (Met) on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in rat hippocampus. We also verified whether the alterations on the enzyme after administration of Met and/or antioxidants were associated with changes in relative expression of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase catalytic subunits (isoforms alpha1, alpha2 and alpha3). For acute treatment, young rats received a single subcutaneous injection of Met or saline (control) and were sacrificed 12 h later. In another set of experiments, rats were pretreated for 1 week with daily intraperitoneal administration of vitamins E (40 mg/kg) and C (100 mg/kg) or saline. After that, rats received a single injection of Met or saline and were killed 12 h later. For chronic treatment, Met was administered to rats from the 6th to the 28th day of life; controls and treated rats were sacrificed 12 h after the last injection. In parallel to chronic treatment, rats received a daily intraperitoneal injection of vitamins E and C from the 6th to the 28th day of life and were killed 12 h after the last injection. Results showed that administration of antioxidants partially prevented the inhibition of enzyme activity caused by acute and chronic hypermethioninemia. Besides, we demonstrated that transcription of catalytic subunits of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase was not altered by chronic and acute exposure to Met and/or vitamins E plus C. These data strongly suggest the oxidative damage as one possible mechanism involved in the reduction of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity caused by hypermethioninemia and if confirmed in human beings, we might propose the use of antioxidants as an adjuvant therapy in hypermethioninemic patients.",
