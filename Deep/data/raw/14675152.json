Recently, caspase-12 was reported to be induced and activated by the unfolded protein response following excess endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study examined rat caspase-12 expression using the controlled cortical impact TBI model. Immunoblots of fractionalized cell lysates found elevated caspase-12 proform (approximately 60 kDa) and processed form (approximately 12 kDa), with peak induction observed within 24 h post-injury in the cortex (418% and 503%, respectively). Hippocampus caspase-12 proform induction peaked at 24 h post-injury (641%), while processed form induction peaked at 6 h (620%). Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis confirmed elevated caspase-12 mRNA levels after TBI. Injury severity (1.0, 1.2 or 1.6 mm compression) was associated with increased caspase-12 mRNA expression, peaking at 5 days in the cortex (657%, 651% and 1259%, respectively) and 6 h in the hippocampus (435%, 451% and 460%, respectively). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed caspase-12 induction in neurons in both the cortex and hippocampus as well as in astrocytes at the contusion site. This is the first report of increased expression of caspase-12 following TBI. Our results suggest that the caspase-12-mediated ER apoptotic pathway may play a role in rat TBI pathology independent of the receptor- or mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways.",
