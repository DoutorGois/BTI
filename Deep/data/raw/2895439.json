All substances, when applied in a steplike manner, induced a rapid increase in the chloride permeability of the cellular membrane which slowly desensitized. The responses to all substances were blocked by external strychnine. Cross-desensitization experiments demonstrated that all substances tested activate the same system of membrane receptors.",
