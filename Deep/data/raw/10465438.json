     "AB": "To examine the influence of chronic stress on the brain, we measured local cerebral blood flow in the hippocampus of rats which had been exposed to chronic stress by the hydrogen clearance method in the freely moving status. Rats were exposed, once a day for 12 weeks, to stress of a 15-min immersion in cold water at 4 degrees C (the stress group) or slightly handled for about 1 min (the control group). Local cerebral blood flow values in the hippocampus, which were measured after a 12-week recovery period, were lower in rats in the stress group than those of rats in the control group only in the dark cycle, but not in the light cycle. Accordingly, local cerebral blood flow in the hippocampus of rats in the stress group did not have a daily fluctuation, i.e. lower in the light cycle and higher in the dark cycle, as was shown in rats in the control group. There were no significant changes in motor activity in rats in the stress group as compared to those in the control group. Severe structural damages were observed in the CA2 and CA3 cell fields of the hippocampus of rats in the stress group. We found that an increase in local cerebral blood flow in the hippocampus in the dark cycle was blunted following chronic stress exposure, suggesting that chronic stress exposure caused hippocampal neurons to be less responsive to environmental stimuli derived from motor activity during the dark cycle.",
