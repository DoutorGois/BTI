     "AB": "Animal models are crucial to the study of the neurobiological bases of psychiatric disorders, but schizophrenia is a particularly challenging disorder to model given the complexity and heavily verbal nature of its symptoms. This unit describes a developmental surgical rodent model of schizophrenia, the neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion (NVHL) model. This widely used model produces reliable behavioral abnormalities that are comparable to those observed in patients, as well as anatomical and neurophysiological disruptions in forebrain areas that are also implicated in schizophrenia. A brief background of the development and validity of the NVHL model is discussed here, along with detailed procedures for producing the model in rats. Critical issues particular to neonatal surgery are discussed, and representative histological and behavioral results are presented. (c) 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",
