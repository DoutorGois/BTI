     "AB": "In 14 transversal hippocampal slices from rats the extracellular field-EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential) in the dendritic region of the CA1 subfield was recorded after isolating the apical dendrites from their somata by microsurgical cuts through the proximal stratum radiatum. Contrary to intact slices which, after tetanic stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals, showed long-term potentiation (LTP) until the end of registration after 8-10 h, LTP declined in the isolated dendrites to baseline values after 3 h. It is concluded that de-novo protein synthesis in postsynaptic cell bodies might be necessary for the maintenance of late phases of LTP.",
