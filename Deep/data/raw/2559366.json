     "AB": "The effects of the GABAB receptor antagonist 2-hydroxy-saclofen were studied using intracellular recording of synaptic potential from CA1 hippocampal neurons. 2-Hydroxy-saclofen (50-200 microM) reversibly blocked the late, GABAB receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) but not the early, GABAA receptor-mediated IPSP. In addition, the hyperpolarizing response to baclofen was reduced by similar concentrations of 2-hydroxy-saclofen. This suggests that 2-hydroxy-saclofen is a potent antagonist at postsynaptic GABAB receptors on hippocampal neurons.",
