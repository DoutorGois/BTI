     "AB": "The 318-amino acid, carboxy-terminal sequence of the putative brain-specific polypeptide 1B236 was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of its cloned brain-specific mRNA. Antisera raised against selected synthetic peptide fragments of this protein were used to map the cellular location of the presumptive gene product in the brains of normal or colchicine-pretreated adult rats. Antisera directed against any of three C-terminally located, but nonoverlapping, nonhomologous, synthetic peptide segments (P5, P6, or P7) produced virtually identical maps of intensely immunoreactive neuropil staining. The immunoreactivity was distributed heterogeneously and was most pronounced within olfactory, somatosensory, and limbic systems, and was more modest in certain motor and auditory structures. In colchicine-pretreated rats, large, multipolar perikarya were observed within the amygdala, caudate-putamen, cingulate, parietal, and piriform cortices, as well as in particular diencephalic and pontine nuclei. Smaller immunoreactive neurons with more limited dendritic extensions were observed in the olfactory bulb, the cerebellar cortex, and the dorsal horn and intermediolateral cell columns of the spinal cord. No immunoreactivity was observed in visceral structures innervated by the autonomic nervous system or in non-neural tissues. In addition to the virtually superimposable maps produced by antisera to all three synthetic fragments selected from the C-terminus of 1B236, some uniquely reactive sites were seen. Antisera to the most N-terminal of the three synthetic immunogens (P5) were reactive with neurons of the medial trapezoid nucleus and in nerve terminals surrounding the deep cerebellar nuclei. Antisera against the most C-terminal synthetic immunogen (P7) were reactive with neurons of the paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei. These data demonstrate that the 1B236 protein is located within selected neuronal elements within functionally related cellular circuits established more formally by other methods. Our data show that protein 1B236-immunoreactive cells share at least the expression of this protein and suggest that these cells may also be related epigenetically or evolutionarily. These data, together with other subcellular, ultrastructural, and electrophysiological properties of 1B236, suggest that this protein could be considered as a prohormone capable of yielding several final candidate transmitter products.",
