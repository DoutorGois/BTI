     "AB": "Protein phosphatase 5 is a recently discovered Ser/Thr phosphatase that is structurally related to calcineurin and protein phosphatases 1 and 2. Northern blot and in situ hybridization studies have shown that protein phosphatase 5 mRNA is present at high levels in brain and is localized to discrete regions. In the present study, we used immunocytochemistry and immunoblot analyses to examine the regional and subcellular distribution of this enzyme in brain. Our work demonstrates that protein phosphatase 5 is widely expressed throughout brain, but is not uniformly distributed. The most intense staining occurred in neurons of the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. Other areas also contained immunoreactive cell bodies, including the globus pallidus, hippocampus, thalamus, lateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus, substantia nigra and other brainstem nuclei. Staining in these cells was observed primarily in perikarya and proximal processes.",
