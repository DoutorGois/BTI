     "AB": "Gap junctions between neurons contribute to synchronous neuronal firing and may play a role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. We examined the expression of a number of gap junction subunits, including the neuronal gap junction forming protein connexin36 (Cx36), in the hippocampus at various time points following an electrically stimulated afterdischarge (AD) in freely-moving animals. Once recovered from electrode implantation, animals were tested with an escalating series of stimulations until an AD was evoked. Suprathreshold stimulation produced a brief AD with no convulsion. Groups of animals were sacrificed at 3, 12, and 24h post-stimulation, and connexin expression was assessed via semiquantitative immunoblotting. Compared to implanted non-stimulated controls, a significant decrease in Cx36 expression was observed in the stimulated dorsal hippocampus at 3h post-stimulation, which returned to control levels by 24h. No changes were seen in the ventral hippocampus. As well, no changes were seen in other selected connexin proteins including Cx26, Cx32, and Cx43, thought to be expressed primarily in glia, in either dorsal or ventral hippocampus. These data suggest that a relatively brief hypersynchronous neuronal discharge can produce rapid and specific changes in Cx36 expression, which may have implications for both normal brain function and the pathophysiology of epilepsy.",
