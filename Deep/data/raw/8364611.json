     "AB": "The hydration-electrolyte profile was studied in 18 CNS structures of dogs. The frequencies of correlation coefficients were found to be placed in diminishing order as follows: H2O/H2O, K/K, H2O/K, Na/Na, H2O/Na, Na/K. The closest relations were detected in the frontal cortex, the least number of interactions were characteristic of the spinal cord and the hippocampus. The interrelations based on functional, anatomic, embryo-phylogenetic principles were most frequently observed in the thalamic and caudate-frontal systems as well as in the cortex and in mesencephalon.",
