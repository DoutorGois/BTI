     "AB": "Insulin deficiency in type I diabetes may lead to cognitive impairment, cerebral atrophy and white matter abnormalities. We studied the impact of a novel delivery system using intranasal insulin (I-I) in a mouse model of type I diabetes (streptozotocin-induced) for direct targeting of pathological and cognitive deficits while avoiding potential adverse systemic effects. Daily I-I, subcutaneous insulin (S-I) or placebo in separate cohorts of diabetic and non-diabetic CD1 mice were delivered over 8 months of life. Radio-labelled insulin delivery revealed that I-I delivered more rapid and substantial insulin levels within the cerebrum with less systemic insulin detection when compared with S-I. I-I delivery slowed development of cognitive decline within weekly cognitive/behavioural testing, ameliorated monthly magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities, prevented quantitative morphological abnormalities in cerebrum, improved mouse mortality and reversed diabetes-mediated declines in mRNA and protein for phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and for protein levels of the transcription factors cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) within different cerebral regions. Although the murine diabetic brain was not subject to cellular loss, a diabetes-mediated loss of protein and mRNA for the synaptic elements synaptophysin and choline acetyltransferase was prevented with I-I delivery. As a mechanism of delivery, I-I accesses the brain readily and slows the development of diabetes-induced brain changes as compared to S-I delivery. This therapy and delivery mode, available in humans, may be of clinical utility for the prevention of pathological changes in the diabetic human brain.",
