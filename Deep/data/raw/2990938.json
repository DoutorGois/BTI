     "AB": "In a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, PIA had marked behavioural effects in long-sleep mice (which show a high sensitivity to ethanol, while no significant effect was observed in short sleep mice (low sensitivity to ethanol). The number of [3H]PIA binding sites in cortex and subcortical brain regions was significantly higher in long-sleep than in short-sleep mice. The KD value was higher in cortex and cerebellum in the short-sleep mice, but there were no differences in the number of hippocampal beta-adrenoceptors or in the adenosine analogue-induced increase in cyclic AMP accumulation in slices of mouse hippocampus.",
