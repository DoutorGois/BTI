     "AB": "Oxidative stress is recognized as one of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in neurodegenerative disease. However, recent evidence has suggested that regulation of cellular fate in response to oxidative stress appears to be dependent on the stress levels. In this study, using HT22 cells, we attempted to understand how an alteration in the oxidative stress levels would influence neuronal cell fate. HT22 cell viability was reduced with exposure to high levels of oxidative stress, whereas, low levels of oxidative stress promoted cell survival. Erk1/2 activation induced by a low level of oxidative stress played a role in this cell protective effect. Intriguingly, subtoxic level of H2O2 induced expression of a growth factor, progranulin (PGRN), and exogenous PGRN pretreatment attenuated HT22 cell death induced by high concentrations of H2O2 in Erk1/2-dependent manner. Together, our study indicates that two different cell protection mechanisms are activated by differing levels of oxidative stress in HT22 cells.",
