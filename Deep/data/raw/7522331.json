     "AB": "Rats were trained in a step-down inhibitory avoidance task using a 0.8-mA foot shock and tested for retention 26 days later. Three to five days prior to the retention test they were bilaterally implanted with cannulae aimed at the entorhinal cortex. Ten minutes before testing they received an infusion, into the entorhinal cortex, of vehicle, ciano-nitro-quinoxaline-dione (CNQX; 0.5 micrograms), amino-hydroxy-methyl-isoxalone-propionate (AMPA; 1.0 or 2.5 micrograms), or AMPA (1.0 micrograms) plus CNQX (0.5 micrograms). CNQX blocked memory expression; the effect lasted less than 90 min. AMPA had no effect of its own, but at the lower dose level it counteracted the depressant influence of CNQX. It is not likely that the effect of CNQX could have been due to an influence on performance: In separate sets of experiments the bilateral intraentorhinal infusion of CNQX (0.5 micrograms) 10 min before training did not affect either acquisition or retention of the avoidance task or general activity during 3 min of free exploration in the training box. The results indicate that the integrity of AMPA receptors in the entorhinal cortex is necessary for memory expression.",
