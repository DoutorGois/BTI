     "AB": "The anticonvulsant effect of 1-naphthylacetyl spermine, an analogue of Joro spider toxin (JSTX), was studied against seizures induced by quisqualate (QUIS), a non-NMDA agonist, as assessed electrophysiologically and behaviorally in freely moving rats. Electrodes were implanted into right dorsal hippocampus and an injection cannula for drugs into right ventricle. The pretreatment with JSTX analogue significantly inhibited both of QUIS-induced hippocampal discharges (80-11%) and generalized tonic clonic seizures (100-33%) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas JSTX had no effect on seizures induced by quinolinate, a NMDA agonist. The paper provides the first direct evidence that the JSTX analogue exerts a potent and selective suppression of hippocampal epileptic discharges mediated by non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) receptors.",
