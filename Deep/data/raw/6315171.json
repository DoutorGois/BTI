     "AB": "Long-lasting inhibition (up to 2 s) of the commissurally-evoked response in the CA3 region of hippocampal slices was observed following a mossy fibre or commissural conditioning stimulus. Bicuculline applied iontophoretically or by superfusion (1-5 X 10(-6) M) blocked the early phase (20-40 ms) of the post-stimulus inhibition but either had no effect or potentiated the later inhibition.",
