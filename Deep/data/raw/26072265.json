     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To reveal the role of Dnmts in the improvement of spatial learning and memory induced by erythropoietin (EPO) in SAMP8 mice. METHODS: The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to assess spatial learning and memory. Mice were administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of recombinant human EPO and hippocamppi infusion (IH) of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA). The expression of genes Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in the hippocampus was detected by real-time qPCR. The level of proteins DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B was measured by Western blotting. RESULTS: Spatial learning and memory in SAMP8 were promoted after i.p. injection of EPO (5000IU/kg/day) and expression of Dnmt3b mRNA and DNMT3B proteins in the hippocampus increased. The improved memory by EPO was blocked after IH 5-AZA. CONCLUSION: DNA methylation is necessary for EPO to enhance spatial learning and memory in SAMP8 mice.",
