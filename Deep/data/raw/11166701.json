     "AB": "The effects of virol A (VA), a toxic component of Cicuta virosa (water hemlock), on the GABA-induced Cl(-) current (I(GABA)) in acutely dissociated rat hippocampal CA1 neurons were investigated using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. VA reversibly reduced I(GABA) and the muscimol (Mus)-induced current (I(Mus)) in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC(50) values for VA against I(GABA) and I(Mus) were 9.6x10(-7) and 9.8x10(-7) M, respectively. VA shifted the EC(50) value of I(GABA) from 6.5x10(-6) to 2.1x10(-5) M, whereas it had no effect on the maximum response, thereby suggesting that VA inhibited I(GABA) in a competitive manner. VA had no apparent effect on current-voltage relationships for I(GABA), thus indicating the lack of voltage-dependency. On the other hand, application of VA (10(-6) M) did not additionally reduce the I(GABA) suppressed by >10(-5) M picrotoxin. VA but not bicuculline accelerated the decay phase of I(GABA), as was seen with picrotoxin. Moreover, pre-application of 10(-5) M VA reduced I(GABA). VA did not inhibit that induced by glycine (10(-4) M). These results indicate that VA inhibits I(GABA) by acting both on the GABA agonist site and on the Cl(-) channel of the GABA(A) receptor-channel complex. VA is a structurally novel type of compound that selectively inhibits the GABA(A) receptor-Cl(-) channel complexes in mammalian central nervous system neurons.",
