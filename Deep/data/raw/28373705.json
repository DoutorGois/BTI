     "AB": "This work reports first electrochemical preparation of exceptionally biocompatible, highly crystalline, and well exfoliated nitrogen doped graphene nanosheets (eNGS) from carbon nanosheets for the development of mighty platforms in the field of modern biosensing and other biological applications for human welfare. eNGS displayed exceptional biocompatibility. Administration of the as-synthesized eNGS to rat models did not lead to any significant deviation or inimical consequences in its functional observation battery (FOB) tests, GSH levels or the histology of the vital organs of the rat models. The pictomicrographs of myocytes nuclei and myofibrillar for heart, hippocampus (CA1) section for brain, central vein, and hepatocytes for liver and parenchyma, tubules and glomeruli for kidney also remained unaffected. Moreover, the resultant nanoelectrocatalyst displayed enhanced electrochemical performance towards real-time sensing of dopamine (DA) from human urine sample in the presence of interferences, such as ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA).",
