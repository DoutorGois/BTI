     "AB": "Stress leads to changes in homeostasis and internal balance of the body and is known to be one of important factors in the development of several diseases. In the present study, we investigated changes in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) immunoreactivity in the adult and aged gerbil hippocampus after chronic restraint stress. Serum corticosterone level was much higher in both the stress-groups than the control groups. No neuronal death was found in all hippocampal subregions of the adult and aged gerbil after chronic restraint stress. GR immunoreactivity was decreased in both the adult and aged groups after repeated restraint stress; however, GR immunoreactivity in the adult-stress-group was decreased much more than that in the aged-stress-group. Iba-1 immunoreactive microglia were hypertrophied and activated in the adult group after repeated restraint stress; in the aged-stress-group, there was no any significant change in Iba-1 immunoreactive microglia. In brief, level of GR, not Iba-1, in the hippocampus was much decreased in the adult gerbil compared to the aged gerbil following chronic restraint stress.",
