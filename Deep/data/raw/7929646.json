     "AB": "Polyamines are derived from ornithine by the actions of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which is the rate-limiting step in this pathway. Polyamines play a role in cell growth, neoplasia, differentiation, and response to injury. We have shown that transient cerebral ischemia gives rise to increased ODC mRNA and enzyme activity in the gerbil brain. ODC and polyamines are thought to be important in the generation of edema and the neuronal cell loss associated with cerebral ischemia. To test this theory, we examined the ODC activity, putrescine levels, and neuronal density in the CA1 region of the hippocampus following ischemia and reperfusion injury in the absence and presence of an inhibitor of ODC activity, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). Pretreatment of animals with DFMO resulted in attenuation of the ODC activity following 5 min of ischemia and 4 h of reperfusion. In addition, DFMO prevented the increase in polyamine levels, as determined by measurement of putrescine in the ischemic brain. These alterations were not due to changes in ODC mRNA level. Further analysis revealed that DFMO treatment blocked the delayed neuronal cell death in the CA1 region of the hippocampus that accompanies ischemia and reperfusion injury. Administration of DFMO resulted in a dose-dependent beneficial effect upon neuronal cell survival. These results suggest that ODC enzyme activity and the production of polyamines play a significant role in the response of the brain to ischemic injury.",
