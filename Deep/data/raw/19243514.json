     "AB": "The negative relationship between temperature and geographical variation in body size, or Bergmann's rule, is among the most thoroughly studied ecogeographical rules, yet the pattern and process underlying it remain controversial. Bergmann's original observations were of body size clines among endotherms, but in the last 50 years there has been increasing recognition that both Bergmann's rule and its reverse occur in many ectotherm taxa. A new study of syngnathid fish by Wilson (2009) in this issue of Molecular Ecology sheds light on intriguing alternative mechanisms that may explain variation in the direction of body size clines across taxa. Wilson shows that Bergmann's rule is found in pipefish of the genus Syngnathus, but not in seahorses of the genus Hippocampus. His results suggest that polygamy in pipefish allows fecundity selection to favour large size at low temperatures, compensating for increases in brooding time.",
