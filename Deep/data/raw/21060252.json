     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Among women and female rodents, progesterone (P) influences social affiliation and affect. These effects may be partly due to formation of its 5alpha-reduced, 3alpha- hydroxylated metabolite, 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha- THP). AIM: To elucidate whether actions of 3alpha,5alpha-THP in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) are both necessary and sufficient to enhance non-sexual and sexual social behaviors, affect, and central 3alpha,5alpha-THP metabolism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: P and 3alpha,5alpha-THP formation were unperturbed or blocked in VTA via infusions of vehicle, PK11195 (400 ng), and/or indomethacin (10 mug). Rats then received subsequent infusions of vehicle or 3alpha,5alpha-THP (100 ng) and were assessed in a battery of tasks that included open field (exploration), elevated plus maze (anxiety behavior), social interaction (social affiliation), and paced mating (sexual behavior) or were not tested. Metabolic turnover of P to its 5alpha-reduced metabolites was assessed in plasma, midbrain, hippocampus, frontal cortex, diencephalon, and remaining subcortical tissues (control interbrain). RESULTS: Infusions of any combination of inhibitors significantly reduced social and affective behavior in all tasks compared to vehicle, concomitant with reduced turnover of P to its 5alpha-reduced metabolites, in midbrain only. Subsequent infusions of 3alpha,5alpha-THP significantly reinstated/enhanced anti- anxiety behavior, lordosis, and P turnover to its 5alpha-reduced metabolites in midbrain, as well as hippocampus, cortex, and diencephalon (but not plasma or interbrain). CONCLUSIONS: These data are the first to provide direct evidence that actions of 3alpha,5alpha-THP in the VTA are both necessary and sufficient for social and affective behavior, as well as initiation of central 5alpha-reduction.",
