     "AB": "New neurones are produced in the adult hippocampus throughout life and are necessary for certain types of hippocampal learning. Little, however, is known about the control of hippocampal neurogenesis. We used primary hippocampal cultures from early post-natal rats and neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor knockout mice as well as selective neuropeptide Y receptor antagonists and agonists to demonstrate that neuropeptide Y is proliferative for nestin-positive, sphere-forming hippocampal precursor cells and beta-tubulin-positive neuroblasts and that the neuroproliferative effect of neuropeptide Y is mediated via its Y1 receptor. Immunohistochemistry confirmed Y1 receptor staining on both nestin-positive cells and beta-tubulin-positive cells in culture and short pulse 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine studies demonstrated that neuropeptide Y has a proliferative effect on both cell types. These studies suggest that the proliferation of hippocampal neuroblasts and precursor cells is increased by neuropeptide Y and, therefore, that hippocampal learning and memory may be modulated by neuropeptide Y-releasing interneurones.",
