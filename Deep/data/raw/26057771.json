     "AB": "Upregulation in calcineurin (CaN) signaling has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of FK506--a CaN inhibitor--on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced experimental dementia of the Alzheimer's type in rats. STZ was administered intracerebroventricularly to induce a cognitive deficit and oxidative stress. Nonimmunosuppressive doses (0.5 and 1 mg/kg postoperatively) of FK506 (tacrolimus) were administered for 21 day in STZ-treated rats. Cognitive functions were assessed using the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tasks. Malondialdehyde and nitrite glutathione levels, as well as acetylcholinesterase activity, were determined to evaluate oxidative stress and cholinergic functions. Lactate dehydrogenase levels were estimated and histological analysis of the dentate gyrus and the CA1 region of the hippocampus was carried out to identify degenerative changes. STZ produced significant deterioration of cognitive functions, oxidative stress, and degenerative changes in the cortical and hippocampal brain regions. FK506 dose-dependently attenuated STZ-induced cognitive deficits, oxidative stress, and degenerative changes in the cortex and hippocampus. These results suggest a potential role of CaN signaling in degenerative processes, and that inhibition of CaN may be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.",
