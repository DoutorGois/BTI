     "AB": "Patterns of progressive cortical thinning in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) remain poorly understood. We examined spatiotemporal patterns of cortical thinning and subcortical atrophy over 12 months in DLB (n = 13), compared with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 23) and healthy control subjects (HC) (n = 33). Rates of temporal thinning in DLB were relatively preserved compared with AD. Volumetric analyses subcortical changes revealed that the AD group demonstrated significantly increased hippocampal atrophy (-5.8%) relative to the HC (-1.7%; p < 0.001) and DLB groups (-2.5%, p = 0.006). Significant lateral ventricular expansion was also observed in AD (8.9%) compared with HC (4.3%; p < 0.001) and DLB (4.7%; p = 0.008) at trend level. There was no significant difference in subcortical atrophy and ventricular expansion between DLB and HC. In the DLB group, increased rates of cortical thinning in the frontal and parietal regions were significantly correlated with decline in global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination) and motor deterioration (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale 3), respectively. Overall, AD and DLB are characterized by different spatiotemporal patterns of cortical thinning over time. Our findings warrant further consideration of longitudinal cortical thinning as a potential imaging marker to differentiate DLB from AD.",
