     "AB": "The functions of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and the VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) in the nervous system are not well known. In this study, we examined the role of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 in ischemic preconditioning (IPC)-induced tolerance in the mouse hippocampus. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to either severe ischemia (SI) induced by 40 min of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) with or without IPC (5-min BCCAO) or IPC only. Cerebral blood flow was measured during ischemic periods using laser Doppler flowmetry. Neuronal damage was assessed histologically, and VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 expression levels were assessed through immunostaining. Fluoro-Jade B-labeled cells were abundant in the CA1 area 7 days after SI without IPC (sham+SI group), whereas cells were rarely labeled in mice subjected to IPC followed by SI (IPC+SI group). Similarly, the number of neuronal nuclei (NeuN)-positive cells in the CA1 area was significantly lower in the sham+SI group than in the IPC+SI group. Interestingly, we found that sublethal IPC treatment induced prominent VEGF-C expression in the CA1 pyramidal neurons and VEGFR-3 expression in the stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum moleculare after 3 days of reperfusion that were sustained for 7 days. Moreover, VEGF-C immunoreactivity was also markedly increased, whereas VEGFR-3 expression was sustained in tolerance-acquired CA1 neurons after SI. Application of a VEGFR-3 inhibitor, SAR131675, abolished the IPC-induced neuroprotection in a dose-dependent manner in the mouse hippocampus. These results suggest that VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signaling is associated with IPC-induced hippocampal tolerance to lethal ischemia.",
