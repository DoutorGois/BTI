     "AB": "Prolactin (PRL) is a hormone with multiple actions in the central nervous system (CNS) spanning from physiology to pathology. PRL exerts different actions through its receptors that can be found in both neurons and glial cells (astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes) of the brain. Even though its effects during pregnancy and lactation, stress, anxiety, and depression are well studied, recent work on this hormone has brought to light a new role of PRL: that of a protective agent against brain damage and, consequently, against neurodegeneration. The mechanisms through which this protection takes place have not been fully elucidated; however, neurogenesis and anti-apoptosis are some of the plausible mechanisms that could mediate this effect. There is substantial information that implies the involvement of glial activation in this PRL effect, as shown in various models of brain damage. Taking into account glial cell dynamics and actions in various pathological conditions, combined with the neuroprotective effect of PRL, we consider of importance the revision of all the information about the interaction between these two cell types, as it will provide comprehensive knowledge about this new target of PRL against neuropathology.",
