     "AB": "Protocadherin 11 X-linked (Pcdh11x) protein is a member of the cadherin superfamily with established roles in cell adhesion. Previous studies have shown the molecular biology and possible relevance of Pcdh11x with neurological disease in humans. However, little is known about the neurophysiological function of Pcdh11x in neural development. Here, we verified that Pcdh11x is primarily expressed in various brain areas including the cortex, hippocampus, and ventricular/subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ) at different embryonic stages. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that Pcdh11x decreased neural differentiation but increased the neural proliferation. These observations demonstrate a crucial function for Pcdh11x during the development of central nervous system.",
