     "AB": "A new pyrrolidinone derivative, valproyl-2-pyrrolidinone (VP), was synthesized, followed by evaluation as a cognitive drug. VP gave rise to a significant protective effect against cerebral anoxia together with a potent prolongation of latency time for the reversal of scopolamine induced transient disruption of the memory of a passive avoidance response in rats. The quantitative experiment using HPLC demonstrated a significant reduction of hippocampal aspartate (Asp) and glutamate (Glu) following the intraperitoneal administration of VP at a dose of 300 mg/kg.",
