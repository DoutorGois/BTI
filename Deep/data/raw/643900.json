The interference of bromocriptine on the dopaminergic central systems has been studied using behavioral (interference with the effects induced by L-dopa, 5HT, TRF or neuroleptic drugs) and electrophysiological (EEG) methods. While no clear effects of bromocriptine could be evidenced in mice, EEG recordings from the dorsal hippocampus of the rabbit showed a slight disruption of epsilon-waves after administration of 2 mg/kg i.v. of the drug or more.",
