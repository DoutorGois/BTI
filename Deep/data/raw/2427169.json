     "AB": "Binding sites for oxytocin (OXT) and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in brain of homozygous Brattleboro rats were immunocytochemically visualized after ventricular administration of the peptides by Accurel implants. Two patterns were found: 'ring type' staining in perineuronal structures was observed in CA1 and CA3 areas of ventral hippocampus and in subiculum for OXT implanted brains and a very weak staining in striatum for alpha-MSH-implanted brains; cytoplasmic staining of intracellular binding sites was observed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) in brains with OXT implants and in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (AD) and postcingulate cortex in brains with alpha-MSH implants. These localizations are different from those described for vasopressin binding sites in the same rat strain.",
