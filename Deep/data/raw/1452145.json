     "AB": "The ultrastructural changes of hippocampus and cerebral cortex neurons were derived from the rabbits kindled by coriaria lactone and from the kindled rabbits after treatment with SC1001 Na. The results of experiment showed that the hippocampus and cerebral cortex neurons in the kindled group had some degenerative changes, such as the swelling mitochondria, dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complexes when the injuries of neurons were not serious, but the seriously injured neurons were subjected to rupture of the cell membrane and solution of most organella, with only a small amount of degenerative organella. In the group treated with SC1001 Na, the ultrastructure of brain neurons demonstrated a tendency of recreation to normal which showed that SC1001 Na had cured many of the degenerative brain cells. This suggested that active treatment is very important for the epileptic patients.",
