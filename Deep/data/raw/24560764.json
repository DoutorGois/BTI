     "AB": "AIMS: ANZMTG 01.07 WBRTMel is a phase 3 randomized trial to address the role of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) after local treatment of 1-3 melanoma brain metastases. Modern radiation therapy technologies can now conformally spare the hippocampus during WBRT and therefore potentially reduce the risk of neurocognitive deficit. The aims of this study were to report the prevalence of melanoma metastases within the hippocampal sparing region and to identify variables that correlate with the presence of metastases within the hippocampal sparing region. METHODS: The pre-local treatment MRI scans of 77 eligible WBRTMel patients were used to contour the individual metastasis and the hippocampus. The volume, location and closest distance of each metastasis to the hippocampus were recorded. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess the influence of factors on the location of a metastasis within 5mm of the hippocampus. RESULTS: The median age was 61 and 66% were male. The distribution of the 115 metastases was frontal (50, 43.5%), parietal (23, 20.0%), temporal (13, 11.2%), occipital (18, 15.7%), cerebellum (10, 8.6%) and pineal gland (1, 1.0%). The median aggregate volume of the metastasis was 3516mm(3). None of the metastases were within the hippocampus. Four patients (5.2%) had metastases within 5mm of the hippocampus. The median distance from metastasis to the nearest hippocampus was 37.2mm. Only the total volume of metastases was a significant predictor for the risk of a metastasis within the hippocampal sparing region (OR 1.071, 95% CI: 1.003-1.144, p=0.040). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed a low incidence of melanoma metastasis in the hippocampal sparing region at diagnosis. Given the lack of randomized data on the safety and benefit of hippocampal sparing WBRT, the current WBRTMel trial provides the opportunity to explore the feasibility of this technique.",
