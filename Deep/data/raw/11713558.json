The norepinephrine/serotonin ratio increased in the temporal and parietal lobes, hypothalamus, and hippocampus of killer rats. The open filed behavior of aggressive rats is characterized by a long latency period, low locomotor activity, and slow movements. Exposure to constant darkness aggravated abnormal behavioral characteristics of aggressive rats. Serotonin content in the hypothalamus and visual cortex of these rats decreased by 75 and 76%, respectively.",
