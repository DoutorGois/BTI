     "AB": "The seizure-induced molecular and functional alterations of glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus have been investigated. Daily repeated epileptic seizures were induced for 12 days by intraperitoneal administration of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 4.5 mg/kg) in adult Wistar rats. The seizure symptoms were evaluated on the Racine's scale. One day after the last injection, the brains were removed for in vitro electrophysiological experiments and immunohistochemical analysis. The glutamate receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, NR2B, GluR1, GluR1(flop), GluR2, and KA-2 were studied using the histoblotting method. The semi-quantitative analysis of subunit immunoreactivities in hippocampal layers was performed with densitometry. In the hippocampus, increase of GluR1, GluR1(flop) and NR2B immunostaining was observed in most of the areas and layers. The significant decrease of GluR2 staining intensity was observed in the CA1 and dentate gyrus. Calcium permeability of hippocampal neurons was tested by a cobalt uptake assay in hippocampal slices. The uptake of cobalt increased in the CA1 area and dentate gyrus, but not in the CA3 region following 4-AP treatment. Effects of AMPA and NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) glutamate receptor antagonists (1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466) and D-APV respectively) were measured in hippocampal slices using extracellular recording. Analysis of the population spikes revealed the reduced effectiveness of the AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466, while the effect of the NMDA receptor antagonist d-(2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid was similar to controls. The results demonstrated that repeated convulsions induced structural and functional changes in AMPA receptor-mediated transmission, while NMDA and kainate receptor systems displayed only alterations in receptor subunit composition.",
