     "AB": "Further characterization of the biochemical components that contribute to calcium handling, together with advances in optical imaging of ion concentration, are providing quantitative information on the dynamics of calcium in the dendrites of neurons in tissue culture, brain slices and in vivo. It has recently been demonstrated that strong spatial gradients and transient calcium elevations result from the geometry and membrane properties of dendrites. These studies are adding to our understanding of calcium's role in synaptic plasticity and in shaping the electrophysiological properties of neurons.",
