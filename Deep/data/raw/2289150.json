     "AB": "Administration of methamphetamine (15 mg/kg) to adrenalectomized rats significantly decreased hippocampal type I and II corticosteroid receptors as well as type II receptors in the striatum. Type II receptors in the frontal cortex and hypothalamus were unaffected by methamphetamine administration. Pretreatment with MK-801, a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, antagonized the methamphetamine-induced decrease in hippocampal and striatal corticosteroid receptors. These results are in agreement with previous studies demonstrating that some of the neurobiological effects of methamphetamine may be mediated via a mechanism involving excitatory amino acids.",
