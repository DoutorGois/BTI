     "AB": "Growing evidence supports a role for soluble amyloid-beta oligomer intermediates in the synaptic dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. We found that acute treatment of cultured rat hippocampal neurons with nanomolar concentrations of Abeta oligomers reduced the recycling pool and increased the resting pool of synaptic vesicles. Endocytosis of synaptic vesicles and the regeneration of fusion-competent vesicles were also severely impaired. Furthermore, the release probability of the readily-releasable pool (RRP) was increased, and recovery of the RRP was delayed. All these effects were prevented by antibody against Abeta. Moreover reduction of the pool size was prevented by inhibiting calpain or CDK5, while the defects in endocytosis were averted by overexpressing phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-5-kinase type I-gamma, indicating that these two downstream pathways are involved in Abeta oligomers-induced presynaptic dysfunction.",
