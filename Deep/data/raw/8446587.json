     "AB": "To test the hypothesis that repeated subconvulsive stimulations required to induce kindling can permanently alter gene expression of hippocampal neurons, we used Northern and in situ hybridization analyses to measure steady-state mRNA levels encoding several phenotypic proteins. mRNA encoding a membrane-bound protein, ligatin, was significantly reduced in kindled brains relative to naive and sham control animals. This change in gene expression persisted for over 4 months after kindling, was associated with a decrease in ligatin protein expression, was not produced by single or multiple seizures that did not induce the kindling phenomena, and was blocked by MK801. These results provide direct evidence that kindling can cause persistent changes in the expression of specific genes in hippocampal neurons and suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-activated changes in gene expression may be a basic molecular mechanism underlying some of the long-lasting plasticity changes seen in kindling or models of long-term memory.",
