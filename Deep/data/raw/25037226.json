     "AB": "Elevated levels of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the human brain are linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that extracellular Abeta can bind to exosomes, which are cell-secreted nanovesicles with lipid membranes that are known to transport their cargos intercellularly. Such findings suggest that the exosomes are involved in Abeta metabolism in brain. Here, we found that neuroblastoma-derived exosomes exogenously injected into mouse brains trapped Abeta and with the associated Abeta were internalized into brain-resident phagocyte microglia. Accordingly, continuous intracerebral administration of the exosomes into amyloid-beta precursor protein transgenic mice resulted in marked reductions in Abeta levels, amyloid depositions, and Abeta-mediated synaptotoxicity in the hippocampus. In addition, we determined that glycosphingolipids (GSLs), a group of membrane glycolipids, are highly abundant in the exosomes, and the enriched glycans of the GSLs are essential for Abeta binding and assembly on the exosomes both in vitro and in vivo. Our data demonstrate that intracerebrally administered exosomes can act as potent scavengers for Abeta by carrying it on the exosome surface GSLs and suggest a role of exosomes in Abeta clearance in the central nervous system. Improving Abeta clearance by exosome administration would provide a novel therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer disease.",
