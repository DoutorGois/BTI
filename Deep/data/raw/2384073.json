     "AB": "A model of partial complex (limbic) seizures in the anesthetized rat based on the phenomenon of maximal dentate activation was used to study the effect of various known antiepileptic drugs. Maximal dentate activation consists of a distinct triad of large amplitude population spikes, associated with a rise in [K+]0 to 10 mM and a negative shift of the DC potential. Repeated stimulation produces lengthening of the duration of maximal dentate activation (mimicking the lengthening of afterdischarges that occurs during kindling) and a decrease in the time to onset of maximal dentate activation. Diazepam (3 mg/kg), carbamazepine (50 mg/kg) and phenobarbital (60 mg/kg) caused a reversible reduction in the duration of maximal dentate activation. Carbamazepine (30 mg/kg) and phenobarbital (20 mg/kg) prevented the lengthening of maximal dentate activation that occurs with repeated elicitation while phenytoin (80 mg/kg), ethosuximide (300 mg/kg) and valproic acid (300 mg/kg) had no effect. The doses of these known antiepileptic drugs agree with the doses efficacious against limbic seizures in awake rats. This suggests that the ability to shorten the duration of maximal dentate activation provides a useful means to screen compounds for activity against partial complex seizures.",
