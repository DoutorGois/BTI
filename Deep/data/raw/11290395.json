     "AB": "In the present study, we have examined the expression of voltage-gated calcium channels in a rat model of transient focal ischemia using immunohistochemistry. Increased expression of class C L-type Ca2+ channels was clearly detected in reactive astrocytes in each region of the hippocampus 7 days after ischemic injury. On the contrary, class D L-type Ca2+ channels were not expressed in reactive astrocytes under these conditions. These patterns were also observed in reactive astrocytes in the affected cerebral cortex and fiber tracts. Our study showed the spatial and temporal localization of class C L-type Ca2+ channels in reactive astrocytes in ischemic rat brain, for the first time. The present studies may provide useful data for future investigations to understand the role of Ca2+ channels in reactive astrocytes following ischemia or glutamate toxicity.",
