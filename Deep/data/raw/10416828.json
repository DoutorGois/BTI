     "AB": "This study was designed to determine in rats whether morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) produces its neuro-excitatory effects most potently in the ventral hippocampus (as has been reported previously for subanalgesic doses of opioid peptides). Guide cannulae were implanted into one of seven regions of the rat brain: lateral ventricle; ventral, CA1 and CA2-CA3 regions of the hippocampus; amygdala; striatum or cortex. After a 7 day recovery period, rats received intracerebral injections of (i) M3G (1.1 or 11 nmol) (ii) DADLE ([D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin), (45 nmol, positive controls) or (iii) vehicle (deionised water), and behavioral excitation was quantified over 80 min. High-dose M3G (11 nmol) evoked behavioral excitation in all brain regions but the onset, severity and duration of these effects varied considerably among brain regions. By contrast, low-dose M3G (1.1 nmol) evoked excitatory behaviors only when administered into the ventral hippocampus and the amygdala, with the most potent effects being observed in the ventral hippocampus. Prior administration of the nonselective opioid antagonists, naloxone and beta-funaltrexamine into the ventral hippocampus, markedly attenuated low-dose M3G's excitatory effects but did not significantly alter levels of excitation evoked by high-dose M3G. Naloxone given 10 min after M3G (1.1 or 11 nmol) did not significantly attenuate behavioral excitation. Thus, M3G's excitatory behavioral effects occur most potently in the ventral hippocampus as reported previously for subanalgesic doses of opioid peptides, and appear to be mediated through at least two mechanisms, one possibly involving excitatory opioid receptors and the other, non-opioid receptors.",
