     "AB": "It has previously been reported that rats kindled via the standard kindling procedure do not exhibit the typical profile of neuropathology following status epilepticus. We wished to determine whether a 1-day rapid kindling procedure is also neuroprotective against cell damage resulting from prolonged seizure activity. We found that rats rapidly kindled from the dorsal hippocampus were more resistant to a kainic acid challenge 21-25 days after kindling than were unkindled control rats. Kindling prior to a kainic acid challenge also provided substantial protection against status epilepticus-induced damage in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and piriform cortex in most animals. Thus, despite the short kindling time period, rapid kindling is neuroprotective against status epilepticus-induced cell damage.",
