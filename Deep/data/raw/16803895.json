     "AB": "Dendrite morphogenesis is highly dynamic and characterized by the addition and elongation of processes and also by their selective maintenance, retraction, and elimination. Glutamate can influence these events via N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. The neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal peptide and pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP38) affect neurogenesis and differentiation in the developing nervous system. We report here that the peptides and NMDA acted synergistically on dendrite and branch formation. In stage III hippocampal neurons, NMDA increased not only the addition but also the elimination of new dendrites and branches by activating Rac and Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, respectively. When applied alone, the neuropeptides did not influence dendrite or branch formation. However, they reduced the elimination of newly formed dendrites and branches caused by NMDA by preventing the NMDA-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases. This led to the formation of persistent dendrites and branches. Additional timelapse studies on the dynamics of dendrite elongation showed alternating periods of elongation and retraction. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases increased the velocities of dendrite elongation and retraction, whereas the neuropeptides prolonged the periods of elongation. By modifying NMDA-induced activation of Rho GTPases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, vasoactive intestinal peptide and PACAP38 could play an important role in the control of dendrite growth and branching during development and in response to neuronal activity.",
