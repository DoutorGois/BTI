     "AB": "To investigate the effects of a new non-NMDA antagonist on the trisynaptic pathways in the hippocampus, the author examined the kainate(KA)-induced generalized seizures in rats. A novel non-NMDA antagonist, YM90K, showed the blockade of the Schaffer collaterals in a 2-deoxyglucose study (2-DG) and that the CA1-2 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus were preserved seven days after the KA injections. On the other hand, the control and MK-801 (NMDA-antagonist) treated rats did not depress the Schaffer collaterals and showed persistent hypermetabolism of glucose in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer, where neurons were not preserved seven days later. 2-DG was useful to reveal the effects of a non-NMDA antagonist on the KA-induced generalized seizures. This suggests that YM90K is a potent non-NMDA antagonist and that it has a neuroprotective effect in rats.",
