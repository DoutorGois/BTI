     "AB": "The identification of cell type-specific molecules expressed at different developmental stages can help to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms governing the survival, differentiation, and development of cells in the central nervous system (CNS). A cell surface protein, HPC-7, was detected on rat oligodendrocytes (OL) in culture by a monoclonal antibody generated against adult rat hippocampal membranes. Adult rat brain and sciatic nerve sections showed selective labeling of white matter and other myelinated fibers in both the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS). Double-labeling of secondary cultures of OL, O-2A, and type-2 astrocytes and primary cultures of type-1 astrocytes with independent cell type-specific antibodies confirmed that HPC-7 was expressed only by the OL lineage. By using a series of OL stage-specific antigenic markers (A2B5, 04, OL-1, galactocerebroside, myelin basic protein) HPC-7 was found to appear at the time when OL precursors became A2B5 negative and began their terminal differentiation in OL. On immunoblots, anti-HPC-7 antibody recognized a single 66 kDa band in rat OL and a single band at 100 kDa in adult myelin. N-glycosidase treatment showed that the HPC-7 protein did not contain substantial amounts of N-linked carbohydrate. Thus, HPC-7 appears to be a cell surface protein of the OL lineage that marks the important transition from proliferative precursor to postmitotic OL.",
