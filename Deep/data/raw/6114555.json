     "AB": "Aggressive behavior is popularly thought to be frequently associated with the epileptic character and particularly temporal lobe disorders. However a thorough review of the literature fails to reveal any clear-cut evidence for this belief during inter-ictal periods. Some rare cases of ictal aggressive behavior have been reported but documentation has been difficult because of the previous lack of sophisticated observation equipment and because of difficulties of being present at the time of the seizure. Two rare but definite cases of epileptic aggressive behavior are presented with the help of videotape and E.E.G. recording on the scalp and with depth-electrodes.",
