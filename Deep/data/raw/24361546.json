     "AB": "Accumulating clinical evidence has shown a causal relationship between heart diseases and cognitive impairment in clinical, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, rats with myocardial infarction (MI) were used to investigate cognition-related synaptic function and proteins. Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to MI by ligating of left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the infarct size of rat heart was measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazoium chloride (TTC) staining. In this study, results showed that compared with control group, long-term potentiation was suppressed in dentate gyrus area, the contents of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde were significantly increased, whereas the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase activity and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 2B were attenuated in hippocampus of MI rats. Interestingly, it was observed that the PI3K/Akt pathway was activated in MI rats. Therefore, this study suggests that H2O2 plays an important role in cognitive dysfunction induced by MI.",
