     "AB": "The influence of microiontophoretic application of delta-sleep inducing peptide (DSIP) on a neuronal activity of sensorimotor brain cortex, dorsal hippocampus, ventral anterior thalamic nucleus and lateral hypothalamus was studied under the effects of glutamate and MK-801, a N-methyl-d-aspartate non-competitive antagonist, on male Wistar rats. DSIP microiontophoresis predominantly activated neurons of various brain regions, in particular, dorsal hippocampus and ventral anterior thalamic nucleus. A preliminary DSIP microiontophoresis prevented the augmentation of a neuronal activity in the studied structures under glutamate microiontophoresis. After MK-801 microiontophoresis the number of neurons activated by the DSIP significantly decreased. It is suggested that DSIP effects on the neuronal activity in the sensorimotor brain cortex, dorsal hippocampus, ventral anterior thalamic nucleus and lateral hypothalamus might be mediated by the NMDA-receptors.",
