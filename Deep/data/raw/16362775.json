     "AB": "We have previously shown that microdialysis perfusion of the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in rat hippocampus induces convulsions and neurodegeneration, due to the stimulation of glutamate release from synaptic terminals. Retigabine is an opener of the KCNQ2/Q3-type K+ channel that possesses antiepileptic action and may be neuroprotective, and we have therefore studied its effect on the hyperexcitation, the neuronal damage and the changes in extracellular glutamate induced by 4-AP. Retigabine and 4-AP were co-administered by microdialysis in the hippocampus of anesthetized rats, with simultaneous recording of the EEG, and the extracellular concentration of glutamate was measured in the microdialysis fractions. In 70-80% of the rats tested retigabine reduced the 4-AP-induced stimulation of glutamate release and prevented the neuronal damage observed at 24 h in the CA1 hippocampal region. However, retigabine did not block the EEG epileptic discharges and their duration was reduced in only 20-25% of the tested animals. We conclude that the neuroprotective action of retigabine is probably due to the blockade of the 4-AP-induced stimulation of glutamate release. This inhibition, however, was not sufficient to block the epileptic activity.",
