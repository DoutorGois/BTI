     "AB": "Ghrelin is an orexigenic peptide hormone that primarily regulates growth hormone secretion, food intake, and energy homeostasis. It has been shown to also play a role in numerous higher brain functions, such as the regulation of inflammation and cell proliferation. Ghrelin is the endogenous ligand of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), a G-protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in brain and detectable in some peripheral tissues. The wide distribution of ghrelin receptor and the number of tissues and cell types known to respond to ghrelin suggest that a number of systems may be affected by treatment with this hormone or its analogues. In this study, we characterized a new GHSR specific monoclonal antibody recognizing specifically the ghrelin receptor. This could be a useful tool for immunoassays aimed at obtaining insights into the physiological and pathological significance of the GHSR/ghrelin system.",
