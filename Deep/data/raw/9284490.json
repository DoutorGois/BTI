     "AB": "The present study describes changes of response enhancement of hippocampal field potentials in slices of kindled rats using different methods to induce long-lasting potentiation. Eight-week-old male Wistar rats were subjected to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling induced by intraperitoneal injection of 45 mg/kg once every 48 h until the occurrence of seizure stages 4-5. Eight to 12 days after the last kindling session, transverse hippocampus slices were prepared and maintained in an artificial medium. Evoked-field potentials were recorded in the CA1 region upon stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals. Potentiation was induced: 1. By moderate tetanic stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals, 2. by changing the perfusion medium to 0-magnesium for 30 min, and 3. by changing the medium to 4 mM Ca2+ for 7 min. In slices from kindled rats, long-term potentiation (LTP) after tetanic stimulation and increase of the evoked potential by 0-magnesium were significantly enhanced in comparison to slices from sham-kindled rats. However, Ca(2+)-induced LTP could not be induced in slices from kindled rats. The results support the assumption that PTZ kindling also induces lasting changes in the responsiveness of hippocampal structures, expressed as an enhanced ability to induce potentiation. An alteration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-coupled processes can be assumed. The inability to induce Ca(2+)-induced LTP points to more complex effects of PTZ, perhaps also on nonNMDA coupled ionic channels.",
