     "AB": "A case of 45-year-old female, who presented with temporal lobe epilepsy was reported. The patient was found to have old intracerebral hemorrhage due to capillary telangiectasis in the temporal lobe. On the intraoperative electrocorticography, frequent paroxysmal activities were recorded independently both on the medial and lateral aspects of the temporal lobe. Even after resection of the lateral temporal lobe, frequent paroxysmal discharges were noted on the hippocampus. Histologically, there are astrogliosis and hemosiderin deposits in the white matter around the telangiectasis and the old hematoma. It is postulated that the hippocampus gained secondary epileptogenicity.",
