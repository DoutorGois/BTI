The hippocampal structures were also involved in the process suggesting participation of the hippocampus in prognostication of the events. Three types of cardiovascular and respiratory responses were distinguished in the \"anticipation of the stress\" model: increased frequency, decreased frequency, relative stability of the rhythm. Prevalence of the sympathetic tonus was noticed.",
