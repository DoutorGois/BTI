     "AB": "The human cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) is comprised of magnocellular hyperchromic neurons within the septal/diagonal band complex and nucleus basalis (NB) of Meynert. CBF neurons provide the major cholinergic innervation to the hippocampus, amygdala and neocortex. They play a role in cognition and attentional behaviors, and are dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The human CBF displays a continuum of large cells that contain various cholinergic markers, nerve growth factor (NGF) and its cognate receptors, calbindin, glutamate receptors, and the estrogen receptors, ERalpha and ERbeta. Admixed with these cholinergic neuronal phenotypes are smaller interneurons containing the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChRs), NADPH-diaphorase, GABA, calcium binding proteins and several inhibitory neuropeptides including galanin (GAL), which is over expressed in AD. Studies using human autopsy material indicate an age-related dissociation of calbindin and the glutamate receptor GluR2 within CBF neurons, suggesting that these molecules act synergistically to induce excitotoxic cell death during aging, and possibly during AD. Choline acetyltrasnferease (ChAT) activity and CBF neuron number is preserved in the cholinergic basocortical system and up regulated in the septohippocampal system during prodromal as compared with end stage AD. In contrast, the number of CBF neurons containing NGF receptors is reduced early in the disease process suggesting a phenotypic silence and not a frank loss of neurons. In end stage AD, there is a selective reduction in trkA mRNA but not p75(NTR) in single CBF cells suggesting a neurotrophic defect throughout the progression of AD. These observations indicate the complexity of the chemoanatomy of the human CBF and suggest that multiple factors play different roles in its dysfunction in aging and AD.",
