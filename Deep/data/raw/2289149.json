     "AB": "The regional distribution of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) was examined in the tissue and extracellular compartment of rat brain. The tissue content of IGF-I was the highest in the pituitary gland, followed by the olfactory bulb, upper brainstem, cerebellum, striatum, hippocampus, lower brainstem, and cerebral cortex. The extracellular concentration was studied by intracerebral microdialysis technique, and the highest content was found in the hippocampus, followed by the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, cerebellum, striatum, and cerebral cortex. The tissue and extracellular contents were significantly correlated in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, cerebellum, striatum, and cerebral cortex. IGF-I might act by paracrine and/or autocrine regulatory mechanisms in these regions.",
