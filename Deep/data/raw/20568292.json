     "AB": "Previous studies have shown that progesterone modulates the activity of different kinases and the phosphorylation of Tau in the brain. These actions of progesterone may be involved in the hormonal regulation of neuronal differentiation, neuronal function, and neuroprotection. However, the action of progesterone on protein phosphatases in the nervous system has not been explored previously. In this study we have assessed the effect of the administration of progesterone to adult ovariectomized rats on protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) in the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum. Total levels of PP2A, the state of methylation of PP2A, and total levels of PTEN were unaffected by the hormone in the three brain regions studied. In contrast, progesterone significantly increased the levels of PP2A phosphorylated in tyrosine 307 in the hippocampus and the cerebellum and significantly decreased the levels of PTEN phosphorylated in serine 380 in the hypothalamus and in the hippocampus compared with control values. Estradiol priming blocked the effect of progesterone on PP2A phosphorylation in the hippocampus and on PTEN phosphorylation in the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. In contrast, the action of progesterone on PP2A phosphorylation in the cerebellum was not modified by estradiol priming. These findings suggest that the regulation of the phosphorylation of PP2A and PTEN may be involved in the effects of progesterone on the phosphorylation of Tau and on the activity of phophoinositide-3 kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase in the brain.",
