     "AB": "In adult hippocampus, neural progenitor cells give rise to neurons throughout life, and the neurogenesis is modulated by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Recent reports showed that lesion of septal cholinergic nuclei projecting to hippocampus suppressed the survival of newborn cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus. Here, we studied whether pharmacological treatment to activate or inhibit the cholinergic system could modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis. 5'-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected to label dividing cells before the drug treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed in normal rats chronically treated with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil or a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor blocker scopolamine for four weeks. Donepezil increased, but scopolamine decreased, the number of BrdU-positive cells in the DG as compared with the control. Neither drug altered the percentage of BrdU-positive cells that were also positive for a neuronal marker neuronal nuclei, nor net population of proliferative cells labeled with proliferating cell nuclear antigen. We also found that donepezil enhanced, and scopolamine suppressed, the expression level of phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which is related to cell survival, in the DG. These results indicate that donepezil enhances and scopolamine suppresses the survival of newborn cells in the DG via CREB signaling without affecting neural progenitor cell proliferation and the neuronal differentiation. This is the first evidence that pharmacological manipulation of the cholinergic system can modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",
