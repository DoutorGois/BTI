     "AB": "Activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength, such as long-term potentiation (LTP), have been proposed to underlie memory storage in the brains of all mammals, including humans. However, most forms of synaptic plasticity, including LTP, are studied almost exclusively in rodents and related species. Thus, the hypothesis that LTP is important in human memory relies on the assumption that LTP is similar in the primate and rodent brains. We have begun to test this hypothesis by studying the properties and mechanisms of LTP induction in area CA3 of hippocampal slices from cynomolgus monkeys. We have found that LTP can be induced reliably at both mossy fiber-CA3 and collateral/associational-CA3 synapses in the primate brain, and that the properties of LTP induction at these synapses are similar to what we and others have observed in experiments using hippocampal slices from rodents. Also, we have investigated the role of opioids in mossy fiber synaptic transmission and LTP and have found no effect of the opioid antagonist naloxone nor the opioid agonist dynorphin on mossy fiber synaptic transmission or potentiation. These data suggest that LTP in the primate and rat brains has a similar induction mechanism and, thus, that the rodent is a useful animal model in which to study synaptic modification such as LTP.",
