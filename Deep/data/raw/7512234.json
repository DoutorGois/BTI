     "AB": "The pharmacology and cellular mechanism by which metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation modulates cAMP formation was studied in cross-chopped hippocampal slices from neonatal (7 day old) rats. The selective mGluR agonist 1S,3R-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD), and other non-selective mGluR agonists produced concentration-related stimulation of basal cAMP formation in this tissue. The relative agonist potency order was 1S,3R-ACPD = quisqualate > ibotenate >> 1R,3S-ACPD. 1S,3R-ACPD stimulated cAMP accumulation was antagonized in a stereoselective manner by L-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionate (L-AP3), but not by higher chain homologues such as L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (L-AP4) and 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5). 1S,3R-ACPD-enhanced cAMP formation was greatly inhibited by incubation with adenosine deaminase. In the adult rat hippocampus, 1S,3R-ACPD did not appreciably increase basal cAMP, but inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation, and this effect was observed with or without adenosine deaminase. In the presence of the adenosine receptor antagonist and cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX), 1S,3R-ACPD did not enhance cAMP formation in the neonatal hippocampus, but inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP (like in the adult tissue). These results demonstrate that mGluRs that increase cAMP in the neonatal hippocampus have a unique pharmacology when compared to mGluRs that decrease cAMP accumulation and increase phosphoinositide hydrolysis. 1S,3R-ACPD stimulation of cAMP in the neonatal rat hippocampal slice involves potentiation of responses to endogenous adenosine. Negatively coupled cAMP linked mGluRs are also present in the neonatal tissue, but are masked by the predominance of the positively coupled mGluR cAMP response.",
