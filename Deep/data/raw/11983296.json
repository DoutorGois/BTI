     "AB": "The perfusion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) induces long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 synapses of hippocampal slices, whereas the perfusion of ATP plus ,-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP5) can result in the formation of long-term depression (LTD). To clarify the difference in change of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) corresponding to induction of LTP or LTD, we measured [Ca2+]i during the perfusion of ATP or ATP+AP5, while simultaneously recording evoked field potentials. In both cases, ATP (or ATP+AP5) perfusion transiently increased [Ca2+]i but the extent of increase of [Ca2+]i by ATP was larger than that caused by ATP+AP5. Thus, the larger rise in [Ca2+]i induces LTP but the smaller rise induces LTD. These results are consistent with the Ca2+ hypothesis as proposed by Lisman (Trends Neurosci. 17 (1994) 406).",
