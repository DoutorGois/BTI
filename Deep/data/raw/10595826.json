     "AB": "A controlled cortical impact model of head injury was validated with mice. Mice were randomly assigned to moderate head injury, mild head injury, and sham injury groups. Beam balancing, open field activity, slant board inclination, grasp strength, and motor coordination were assessed prior to the injury and on days 1-5 postinjury. Morris water maze performance was evaluated on days 11-15 postinjury. Moderately head-injured mice took a significantly longer time to complete the motor coordination task and to find the hidden platform on the Morris water maze and had significantly fewer successful trials on both tasks than the mildly head-injured and sham-injured mice. Mildly head-injured and sham-injured mice performed similarly on both tasks. Contusion volume at the site of impact varied with severity of injury. Moderately head-injured mice had significantly larger contusions than mice with a mild head injury, and these mice in turn had significantly larger contusions than the sham-injured mice. Both moderately and mildly head injured mice had significantly fewer surviving cells in CA1 than the sham-injured mice but did not differ from each other in this regard. Although there was a group effect, only the mildly head-injured mice had significantly fewer surviving cells in CA3.",
