     "AB": "Afterdischarge (AD) triggered by brief, daily stimulation of the amygdala progressively increases in complexity and duration and, over days, develops into generalized convulsions. This progression, called kindling, is delayed by noradrenaline (NA). When brief stimulation of the amygdala occurs too frequently (massed), there is a suppression of AD growth and little evidence of kindling. Previously we showed that depletion of NA before massed amygdala stimulation prevented the suppression of AD growth described above, and readily precipitated generalized seizures. In the present report, we examined the role of NA in maintaining this suppression of AD growth, after it was well established. We showed that suppression of AD development during the first 15 massed stimulations (interstimulus interval of 5 min) was reduced by subsequent injection of the NA alpha 2 antagonist, yohimbine, with most rats exhibiting occasional generalized convulsions. Conversely, rats exposed to the beta antagonist, propranolol, like controls, not only showed suppressed AD growth, but also elevated AD thresholds. Three weeks later, only a small positive transfer to daily kindling was observed in all groups. We conclude that alpha 2 NA receptors help maintain suppression of AD growth induced by massed stimulation of the amygdala, while beta receptors provide only a small proepileptic influence. These results and those from the 'rapid' kindling model (Lothman et al., Brain Research, 360 (1985) 83-91) are compared, and related to NA receptor subtype variations in the amygdala and hippocampus.",
