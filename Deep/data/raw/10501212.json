     "AB": "DNA fragmentation, an early event in neuronal death following traumatic brain injury, may be triggered by the 40-kDa subunit of DNA fragmentation factor (DFF40). DFF40 is typically bound to the 45-kDa subunit of DFF (DFF45), and activation of DFF40 may occur as a result of caspase-3-mediated cleavage of DFF45 into 30- and 11-kDa fragments. In this study, the intracellular distribution of DFF45 and DFF40 was examined following lateral fluid percussion brain injury of moderate severity (2.4-2.7 atm) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. In the cytosolic fraction (S1) of the injured cortex at 2 and 24 h postinjury, significant decreases in the intensities of DFF45-like proteins at 45- and 32-kDa bands and a concomitant increase in the 11-kDa bands were observed (p < 0.05 vs. uninjured controls). A significant decrease in the intensities of the 32-kDa band in the nuclear (P1) fraction of the injured cortex was observed at 30 min and 2 h postinjury (p < 0.01). Concomitantly, a decrease in DFF40 was observed in the cortical S1 fraction at 2 and 24 h (p < 0.05) and in the P1 fraction at 30 min and 2 h postinjury (p < 0.01). In the hippocampus, DFF45 decreased at 30 min in the P1 and 2 h in the S1 fraction (p < 0.05) and recovered by 24 h postinjury, whereas DFF40 was significantly decreased in the S1 and increased in the P1 fraction at both 2 and 24 h (p < 0.01), which indicated a translocation of DFF40 from cytosol to nucleus. These data are the first to demonstrate that changes in DFF proteins occur after brain trauma and suggest that these changes may play a role in apoptotic cell death via caspase-3-DFF45/DFF40-DNA cleavage observed following traumatic brain injury.",
