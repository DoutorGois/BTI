It was shown that the F1 obtained from breeding PT and CBA/Lac which have respectively large and small numbers of high rank males were of high level of dominance in micropopulations. Moreover, they had high levels of noradrenaline and dopamine in hippocampus, striatum and brain stem, and low--in hypothalamus.",
