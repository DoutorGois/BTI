     "AB": "The distribution of chromogranin A-like immunoreactivity in the hippocampus of adult humans who were free of neurological disease was examined by immunohistochemical methods. Immunoreactivity was restricted to the cytoplasm of certain neuronal populations, most notably the mossy fibers of denate granule cells (and a subset of their perikarya), and the perikarya of pyramidal cells of the cornu Ammonis 2 (CA2) sector. Additionally, staining was observed in neurons in the stratum oriens, a population of neurons at the periphery of the CA4 sector, scattered, probably short-axon perikarya in the CA1 sector, and fibers in the perforant path and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Pyramidal neurons in the CA1 and CA3 sectors were not immunoreactive. The two prominently immunoreactive neuronal populations, CA2 pyramids and dentate granule cells, are those spared in human and experimental epileptic brain damage, whereas CA1 and CA3 pyramids, lacking chromogranin, are characteristically destroyed in this condition. The known activities of chromogranin in the periphery as a calcium-binding protein and as a precursor of active peptides (autocrine inhibitory modulators) suggest that its distribution in the hippocampus may help to explain the observed pattern of resistance to epileptic brain damage.",
