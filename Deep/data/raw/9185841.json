     "AB": "Two synthetic cannabinoids, WIN 55,212-2 {R-(+)-(2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[{4-morpholinylmethyl]pyrol [1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl)(1-naphthalenyl)methanone monomethanesulfonate} (5.0 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) and CP 55,940 {[1a,2-(R)-5-(1.1-dimethylheptyl)-2-[5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxypropyl) cyclohexyl]-phenol} {[1a,2-(R)-5-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)-2-[5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxypropyl) cyclohexyl]-phenol} (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg i.p.), inhibited acetylcholine release in the rat hippocampus. The inhibition was prevented by the cannabinoid receptor antagonist, SR 141716A {N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4- chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide} HCl, at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg i.p. Higher doses of SR 141716A (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg i.p.) themselves increased hippocampal acetylcholine release, suggesting that acetylcholine output is tonically inhibited by endogenous cannabinoids. The results also suggest that the negative effects of marijuana on learning and memory may depend on cannabinoid receptor-mediated inhibition of acetylcholine release.",
