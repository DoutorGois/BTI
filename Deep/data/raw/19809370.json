     "AB": "The relationship between cerebral ischemia and Alzheimer's disease has been evaluated extensively. However, the association between cerebral ischemia and the deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) remains to be clarified. Here, we used mice bilateral common carotid artery ligation model to investigate the alterations in mRNA expression of Abeta precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1(BACE1), cathepsin B, and glutaminyl cyclase after transient global cerebral ischemia. The reverse-transcriptase PCR assay showed that the expressions of these three Abeta-metabolism-related genes were upregulated in brain with different manner. It indicates that all these three Abeta-metabolism-related genes may participate in the acute and chronic Abeta generation after transient cerebral ischemia, and will be helpful to understand the mechanisms underlying the linkage of brain ischemia and Alzheimer's disease.",
