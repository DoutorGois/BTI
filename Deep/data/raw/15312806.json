     "AB": "The opioid peptides were thought to be involved in specific types of seizures. Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ (NC) is the endogenous ligand of the nociceptin opioid peptide (NOP) receptor and may play a role in epilepsy. However, accumulated evidences indicated that NC had both anti- and pro-convulsive effects, and the direct effect of NC in modulating epilepsy in the hippocampus still remained unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of NC on penicillin-induced seizures (PIS) in rats. Seizure model was produced by intra-hippocampus injection of penicillin in anesthetized rats. The electroencephalography (EEG) was then observed and estimated by power spectrum analysis. Pretreatment of NC (intracerebroventricular, i.c.v.) depressed PIS in a dose-dependent manner at doses of 0.055, 0.55 and 5.5 nmol in 2 microl saline, respectively. [Nphe1]Nociceptin(1-13)NH2, a selective NOP receptor antagonist reversed the effect of NC against PIS, and this antagonist was inactive to PIS itself. These results indicated that NC had a receptor-specific preventive effect against PIS.",
