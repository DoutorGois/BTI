     "AB": "Protein phosphatase 2A (PP-2A) has been implicated to be crucial in neural development and the normal function of nervous system. However, little is known about its role in neuritogenesis. In this study, we reported that inhibition of PP-2A strongly suppresses the outgrowth of cell processes only during the initiation stage, while activation of PP-2A promotes extensive outgrowth of long neurites in Neura2A cells and long single axon or multiple axons in hippocampal neurons. Our results indicated that PP-2A may be an important positive regulator in neurite outgrowth, and upregulation PP-2A could be a possible target for the therapy of axonopathy in neural diseases.",
