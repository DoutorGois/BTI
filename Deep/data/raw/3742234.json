     "AB": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neuronotrophic protein. Its effects on developing peripheral sensory and sympathetic neurons have been extensively characterized, but it is not clear whether NGF plays a role during the development of central nervous system neurons. To address this point, we examined the effect of NGF on the activity of neurotransmitter enzymes in several brain regions. Intracerebroventricular injections of highly purified mouse NGF had a marked effect on the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a selective marker of cholinergic neurons. NGF elicited prominent increases in ChAT activity in the basal forebrain of neonatal rats, including the septum and a region which contains neurons of the nucleus basalis and substantia innominata. NGF also increased ChAT activity in the hippocampus and neocortex, terminal regions for the fibers of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. In analogy with the response of developing peripheral neurons, the NGF effect was shown to be selective for basal forebrain cholinergic cells and to be dose-dependent. Furthermore, septal neurons closely resembled sympathetic neurons in the time course of their response to NGF. These observations suggest that endogenous NGF does play a role in the development of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.",
