Two homogenous groups were separated: In the first group hypoxia was due to placental pathology, in the second group it was the result of umbilical cord pathology. The greatest damages of the cells in paleocortex were found in the region of Ammon's horn, in neocortex the most seriously injured were parietal and occipital lobes.",
