     "AB": "The brains of 18 female mice from two lines selectively bred for lateralization of paw preference were investigated for morphological asymmetries in 5 horizontal sections from mid-dorsoventral planes. Cortical thickness was measured at orbitofrontal, somatosensory and lateral entorhinal regions; volume measures included the hippocampal formation and the striatum. Mice of the strongly lateralized line had stronger asymmetries in 4 of the 5 variables. Discriminant analysis showed that the two mouse lines could be differentiated best by their asymmetries in orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus (P less than 0.02).",
