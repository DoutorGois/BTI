     "AB": "This study identified some neural pathways which mediate the adrenocortical responses that follow hippocampal stimulation. The increase in plasma corticosterone following dorsal hippocampus stimulation, in rats with electrodes chronically implanted under pentobarbital anesthesia, was blocked by dorsal fornix and lateral septal lesions and by small posterior hypothalamic deafferentation. Fimbria transection, lateral septal lesions, and posterior hypothalamic deafferentation, but not midbrain reticular formation lesions, also blocked the adrenocortical responses to ventral hippocampus stimulation. Our present and previous studies indicate that the dorsal and ventral hippocampal effects on the hypothalamus, which increase plasma corticosterone concentrations, are mediated by the dorsal fornix and fimbria, respectively, as well as by the lateral septum. A posterior hypothalamic input, which does not involve the medial forebrain bundle or the midbrain reticular formation is also essential for the activation of this response.",
