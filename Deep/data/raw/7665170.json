     "AB": "Protease nexin I (PNI) is the most important physiologic regulator of alpha-thrombin in tissues. PNI is highly expressed and developmentally regulated in the nervous system where it is concentrated at neuromuscular junctions and also central synapses in the hippocampus and striatum. Approximately 10% of identified proteins at mammalian neuromuscular junctions are serine protease inhibitors, consistent with their central role in balancing serine protease activity to develop, maintain, and remodel synapses. Southern blot hybridization of PNI cDNA to somatic cell hybrids placed the structural gene for PNI (locus PI7) on human chromosome 2q33-q35 and to syntenic chromosomes in the mouse (chromosome 1) and sheep (chromosome 2).",
