     "AB": "The audiogenic seizure-susceptible mouse, Frings, is genetically susceptible to sound-induced seizures and provides a reliable model of reflex epilepsy that lasts throughout the life span of the animal. We used immunohistochemistry to examine if the expression of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (GluR) subunits GluR1, GluR2, or GluR3 were altered subsequent to multiple seizures. Following a regimen of one seizure per day for 3 weeks, GluR1 immunoreactivity, but not GluR2 or GluR3, was substantially elevated in the outer shell of the nucleus accumbens in 21 of 31 chronically seized Frings mice. No other brain regions such as the hippocampus exhibited any qualitative changes in expression of these subunits. In 9 of the 21 Frings mice exhibiting increased GluR1, but in none of the controls, bilateral structural lesions were observed in the lateral hypothalamus. These results support a model where highly localized changes in the expression of GluR1 occur in response to repeated audiogenic seizure.",
