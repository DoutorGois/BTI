     "AB": "Forty-six patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder admitted to hospital for the first time were compared with 21 healthy volunteers on neuropsychological tests reflecting prefrontal and left respectively right hemisphere function. The patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder had a poorer performance on neuropsychological tests (such as Wisconsin Card Sorting) compared with healthy volunteers. Both left and right hemisphere seemed to be involved. Especially poor performance was found on somewhat complicated tests requiring ability of analysis, abstraction and memory, thus indicating dysfunction of prefrontal and temporohippocampal regions. Signs of sulcal enlargement and size of lateral ventricles on computed tomographic scan correlated with poor test performance on some tests both in patients and in healthy volunteers. No correlations were found between performance on neuropsychological test and negative symptoms.",
