     "AB": "This is a report of a patient who underwent high-resolution brain perfusion SPECT studies during and after an episode of transient global amnesia. During the attack, SPECT imaging showed increased perfusion in the left medial temporal region involving the amygdala and hippocampus. After recovery from amnesia, a follow-up SPECT examination showed slightly decreased perfusion in this region. These findings support the hypothesis that transient global amnesia is associated with transient hyperperfusion in the medial temporal brain structures, and confirm the utility of high-resolution SPECT imaging for the evaluation of the fine details of functional brain anatomy.",
