     "AB": "Synaptic responses of commissurally activated rat subicular and entorhinal neurons were studied intracellularly in vivo by stimulating the contralateral dentate gyrus. The most prominent synaptic responses in both subicular and entorhinal neurons were inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). IPSPs were generated in combination with antidromic spikes and/or excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and orthodromic spikes. No dependency between any two response types were found. Commissurally projecting subicular neurons (identified by the presence of antidromic spikes evoked by contralateral stimulation) were found, extending previous anatomical studies. Commissurally projecting entorhinal neurons were found in layer II, confirming previous anatomical studies. Positive correlations between antidromic spike latency and depth of recording sites supported the interpretation that axons projected along the fiber bundles of the hippocampal commissures and angular bundle to distribute to their targets. Possible circuits that could have mediated the excitatory and inhibitory responses of these retrohippocampal neurons are considered.",
