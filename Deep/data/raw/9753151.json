     "AB": "Early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is associated with neurodegeneration of systems within the temporal cortex, e.g. the entorhinal cortex, perforant pathway and hippocampus. The perforant pathway provides the major neuronal input to the hippocampus from the entorhinal cortex and thus relays multimodal sensory information derived from cortical zones into the hippocampus. The earliest symptoms of AD include cognitive impairments, e.g. deficits in short-term memory and attention. Consequently, we have investigated the effect of bilateral knife cut lesions to the perforant path on cognition in rats using models measuring primarily short-term memory (operant delayed match to position task), attention (serial five-choice reaction time task) and spatial learning (Morris water maze). Rats receiving bilateral perforant path lesions showed normal neurological function and a mild hyperactivity. The lesion produced little effect on attention assessed using the five-choice task. In contrast, animals with equivalent lesions showed a robust delay-dependent deficit in the delayed match to position task. Spatial learning in the water maze task was also severely impaired. The delay-dependent deficit in the match to position task was not reversed by tacrine (3 mg/kg) pretreatment. The present data support a selective impairment of cognitive function following perforant path lesions that was confined to mnemonic rather than attentional processing. These findings complement primate and human studies identifying a critical role of the perforant pathway and associated temporal lobe structures in declarative memory. Degeneration of the perforant pathway is likely to contribute to the mnemonic deficits characteristic of early AD. The failure of tacrine to ameliorate these deficits may be relevant to an emerging clinical literature suggesting that cholinomimetic therapies improve attentional rather than mnemonic function in AD.",
