     "AB": "The hippocampus is critical for spatial memory. Recently, subregional differences in the function of hippocampus have been described in a number of behavioral tasks. The present experiments assessed the effects of reversibly lesioning either the dorsal (dHip) or ventral hippocampus (vHip) on spontaneous tests of spatial recognition and temporal order memory. We report that although the dHip is necessary for spatial recognition memory (RM) (distinguishing a novel from a familiar spatial location), the vHip is involved in temporal order memory (the capacity to distinguish between two spatial locations visited at different points in time), but not RM. These findings and others are consistent with the hypothesis that temporal order memory is supported by an integrated circuit of limbic areas including the vHip and the medial prefrontal cortex.",
