     "AB": "We have previously demonstrated that L-type Ca(2+) channels are involved in post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) of GABAergic IPSCs in cultured hippocampal neurons. Here we have used intracellular Fluo-3 to detect [Ca(2+)](i) in single GABAergic boutons in response to stimulation that evokes PTP. During control stimulation of the presynaptic GABAergic neuron at 40 Hz for 1-2 s, DeltaF/F(0) increased rapidly to a peak value and started to decline shortly after the train ended, returning to baseline within 10-20 s. The L-type channel blocker, isradipine (5 microM), had no significant effect on the amplitude or kinetics of the Ca(2+) signal. Following blockade of N- and P/Q-type Ca(2+)-channels, the amplitude was reduced by 52.9+/-3%. Isradipine caused a reduction of the remaining response (by 26.6+/-5%, P<0.01), that was fully reversible on washing. The L-type channel \"agonist\", BayK 8644 (8 microM), caused a significant enhancement of the peak (by 18.7%+/-7%, P<0.05). The rising phase of the Ca(2+) signal, which is related to the rate of entry of Ca(2+) into the bouton, was decreased by isradipine (by 25.5+/-6%, P<0.05) and enhanced by BayK 8644 (by 45.2%+/-16%, P<0.05). These Ca(2+) imaging experiments support the putative role of L-type channels in PTP of GABAergic synapses on cultured hippocampal neurons. We expect L-channels to be few in number, although they may couple strongly to intracellular signalling cascades that could amplify a signal that regulates synaptic vesicle turnover in the GABAergic boutons.",
