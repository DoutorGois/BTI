     "AB": "In traditional Oriental medicine, Uncaria rhynchophylla has been used to lower blood pressure and to relieve various neurological symptoms. However, scientific evidence related to its effectiveness or precise modes of action has not been available. Thus, in the current study, we evaluated neuroprotective effects of U. rhynchophylla after transient global ischemia using 4-vessel occlusion model in rats. Methanol extract of U. rhynchophylla administered intraperitoneally (100-1000 mg/kg at 0 and 90 min after reperfusion) significantly protected hippocampal CA1 neurons against 10 min transient forebrain ischemia. Measurement of neuronal cell density in CA1 region at 7 days after ischemia by Nissl staining revealed more than 70% protection in U. rhynchophylla-treated rats compared to saline-treated animals. In U. rhynchophylla-treated animals, induction of cyclooxygenase-2 in hippocampus at 24 hr after ischemia was significantly inhibited at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, U. rhynchophylla extract inhibited TNF-alpha and nitric oxide production in BV-2 mouse microglial cells in vitro. These anti-inflammatory actions of U. rhynchophylla extract may contribute to its neuroprotective effects.",
