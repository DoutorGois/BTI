     "AB": "In order to assess the density and distribution of brain damage after pure focal ischemia uncomplicated by hypotension or hypoxia, ischemia was produced by occlusion of one and/or both common carotid arteries (CCA) temporarily or permanently in the rat, followed by 3 months recovery. The brains were perfusion-fixed with formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, subserially sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin/cresyl violet. Mild ipsilateral neuronal damage was observed after unilateral permanent occlusion, but confined only to the hippocampus. Damage of neocortical neurons began to appear after 1 day following bilateral permanent occlusion. Damage was worst over the superolateral convexity of both hemispheres, CA 4 and subiculur neurons; subsequently other sectors of hippocampus and other brain structures were affected. Some damaged neurons in the superficial cortex and CA 1 sector of hippocampus, and almost all in the other regions of brain reverted to normal profile by 3 months of recovery. All brain structures showed normal profiles, except a relative neuronal rarefication in neocortex and CA 1 sector of hippocampus after 3 months of recovery. These results suggests that only CCA occlusion causes partial/incomplete ischemia in the rat brain, where damaging effects are counterbalanced by metabolic and circulatory adjustments.",
