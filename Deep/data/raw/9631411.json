     "AB": "Rat and gerbil hippocampus exposed to a sublethal period of ischemia becomes resistant to a subsequent period of lethal ischemia induced several days later, a phenomenon referred to as ischemic preconditioning. Here we describe ischemic preconditioning induced in vitro in cultured hippocampal neurons. Mixed neuroglial hippocampal cell cultures of 14-17 DIV were exposed to a combined glucose and oxygen deprivation (GOD). Cultures subjected to 90 min, but not 60 min, of GOD showed extensive degeneration after a 1 day recovery period. An episode of 60 min of preconditioning GOD followed 1 and 2 days later by 90 min of GOD resulted in 40-60% protection. The data demonstrate that ischemic preconditioning can be mimicked in an in vitro hippocampal cell culture system.",
