     "AB": "The effect of acute cyanide intoxication on levels of transcriptional regulatory proteins Fos and c-Jun in rat cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and brain stem was studied. Western blot analysis showed a differential effect of cyanide on Fos levels in the selected brain areas. The most prominent changes were seen 60 min. following ip. injection of KCN in all brain areas except the brain stem, which showed the maximal change 120 min. following cyanide. Fos levels were doubled in cortex and cerebellum and decreased to below 70% of the control levels in hippocampus. Levels of c-Jun were not altered 60 min. following cyanide treatment. Pretreatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, prevented the cyanide-induced changes of Fos. The differential effect of cyanide on Fos levels in different brain areas and the blockade of these changes by MK-801 suggest involvement of multiple neuronal pathways, including the excitatory amino acid (EAA) neurotransmitter system. It is concluded that cyanide alters levels of the transcriptional regulatory protein Fos through activation of the EAA neurotransmitter system and, thus, may affect gene expression in neuronal or glia cells.",
