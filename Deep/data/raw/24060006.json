     "AB": "The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated developmental differences in functional connectivity associated with true and false memory retrieval. A sample of 8- to 9-year-olds and adults (N = 31) was assessed with the Deese/Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, known to induce high levels of false recognition of lures that are semantically associated with studied items. The strength of semantic association among list items was manipulated. Relative to children, adults correctly recognized more studied items and falsely recognized more critical lures. High-association lists resulted in higher recognition of both studied items and critical lures. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that, overall, true recognition was supported by coupling within two hippocampal-temporal and fronto-parietal set of regions; in contrast, coupling among more distributed hippocampal-temporal-parietal-frontal regions was observed during false recognition. Critically, adults, compared to children, exhibited stronger hippocampal/parietal coupling and stronger hippocampal/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) coupling for veridical recognition of high-associative strength items. In contrast, children, compared to adults, exhibited stronger hippocampus/ventrolateral PFC coupling and stronger bilateral middle-temporal gyrus/ventrolateral PFC coupling for high-associative strength critical lures. Our results underscored a role for the anterior hippocampus in true and false recognition, showing different functional patterns as a function of age and association strength.",
