     "AB": "Cocaine HCl (0, 10, or 50 mg/kg) was injected into adult male ICR mice ip. Thirty minutes later, the brains were removed, and nine regions were isolated: olfactory bulbs, olfactory tubercles, prefrontal cortex, septum, striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and thalamus. Using high-performance liquid chromatography, concentrations of norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and their major metabolites and the metabolite/neurotransmitter ratios were determined as an indicator of utilization. Serotonergic systems responded most dramatically. 5HIAA/5-HT decreases were seen in all the brain regions, except the septum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulbs. In most instances, the alterations were dose-dependent. The most profound changes were seen in the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, and thalamus. For noradrenergic systems, significant responses were seen only in the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus, but then only at the lower dose. The dopaminergic responses were more complex and not always dose-dependent. The DOPAC/DA ratio was decreased only in the amygdala and striatum at the lower dose, and the olfactory tubercles at the higher dose. It was increased in the septum. The HVA/DA ratios were decreased in the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus, but only at the lower dose (like MHPG/NE). The 3MT/DA ratio was decreased in the thalamus at the lower dose and in the olfactory tubercles at the higher dose, whereas it was increased in the prefrontal cortex at the lower dose. The HVA and DOPAC routes of degradation were both utilized only by the amygdala. Thus, cocaine produced its most comprehensive effects in this nucleus, as well as the greatest absolute percentage changes for all three of the monoamine systems studied.",
