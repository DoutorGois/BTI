     "AB": "Immunohistochemical staining for GD3 in adult rat brain was carried out using mouse IgM anti-GD3 monoclonal antibody (DSG-1). Neuronal cells in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and various nuclei of the thalamus were immunoreactive. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells, granule cells and also basket cells were immunoreactive. However, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the cerebrum and cerebellum were not immunoreactive. The GD3 immunoreactivity was located in the cytoplasm. These findings are of considerable interest, being the first reported demonstration of GD3 in the adult rat brain. The implications and possible significance of the presence of GD3 are discussed.",
