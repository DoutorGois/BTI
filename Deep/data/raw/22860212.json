     "AB": "Phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) is one of 16 PDEs expressed in cerebral microvessels, and may be involved in regulating blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. To assess the possible role of PDE4D in stroke-related injury in young versus aged rats, we measured microvascular PDE4D expression, parenchymal albumin immunoreactivity, and changes in the inside bore of the brain microvasculature. Ischemia caused severe hippocampal CA1 damage, associated with significant increases in vascular PDE4D and parenchymal albumin immunoreactivities. This effect was greater in the younger animals, which also had a greater increase in PDE4D expression. Ischemia significantly decreased tissue density in the perimicrovascular space in both young and aged animals. In addition, internal bore circumference and cross-sectional area of the hippocampal microvessels increased dramatically following ischemia. Increased PDE4D expression following cerebral ischemia may play a role in changing BBB permeability, which could secondarily affect ischemic outcome.",
