     "AB": "The nucleolus serves as a principal site of ribosome biogenesis but is also implicated in various non-ribosomal functions, including negative regulation of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor p53. Although disruption of the nucleolus may trigger the p53-dependent neuronal death, neurotoxic consequences of a selective impairment of ribosome production are unclear. Here, we report that in rat forebrain neuronal maturation is associated with a remarkable expansion of ribosomes despite postnatal down-regulation of ribosomal biogenesis. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, inhibition of the latter process by knockdowns of ribosomal proteins S6, S14, or L4 reduced ribosome content without disrupting nucleolar integrity, cell survival, and signaling responses to the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Moreover, reduced general protein synthesis and/or formation of RNA stress granules suggested diminished ribosome recruitment to at least some mRNAs. Such a translational insufficiency was accompanied by impairment of brain-derived neurotrophic factor-mediated dendritic growth. Finally, RNA stress granules and smaller dendritic trees were also observed when ribosomal proteins were depleted from neurons with established dendrites. Thus, a robust ribosomal apparatus is required to carry out protein synthesis that supports dendritic growth and maintenance. Consequently, deficits of ribosomal biogenesis may disturb neurodevelopment by reducing neuronal connectivity. Finally, as stress granule formation and dendritic loss occur early in neurodegenerative diseases, disrupted homeostasis of ribosomes may initiate and/or amplify neurodegeneration-associated disconnection of neuronal circuitries.",
