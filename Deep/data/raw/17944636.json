     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: The reduced oxygen content and perfusion pressure during acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) and controlled hypotension (CH) raise concerns about hypoperfusion and ischemic injury to the brain. In this study on rats, we examined the brain damage following four different degrees of ANH combined with CH. METHODS: Forty rats were randomly assigned to receive a sham operation or CH and ANH [with a hematocrit (Hct) of 30, 25, 20 or 15%]. ANH was performed after baseline physiological parameters had been monitored for 20 min; 30 min later, CH was induced using sodium nitroprusside, and the mean arterial blood pressure was maintained at 50-60 mmHg for 1 h. Rats were killed 3.5 h after hemodilution. Ultrastructural alterations in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus were observed, and serum concentrations of S100B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were measured before and after ANH. RESULTS: The serum S100B concentration increased significantly in the Hct 20% + CH and Hct 15% + CH groups. However, there were no significant differences in the serum levels of NSE between the groups. In the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus, marked ultrastructural alterations, such as mitochondrial denaturalization and nucleus distortion, were observed in the Hct 20% + CH and Hct 15% + CH groups. CONCLUSION: Severe ANH (Hct < or = 20%) combined with CH may induce cerebral damage, as confirmed by marked ultrastructural alterations in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus and significantly increased serum levels of S100B, and should be avoided.",
