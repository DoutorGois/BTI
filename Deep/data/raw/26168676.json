     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the changes over time of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) in hippocampus of status epilepticus (SE) rats. METHODS: A rat model of SE was established by an intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA). The animals were scarified 30 minutes later. And the changes of CB1lR were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot at 4 hours, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 2 months post-SE. RESULTS: CB1R in CAl area of hippocampus of SE rats increased gradually at 1 week and then decreased to normal afterward (KA vs NS: 5. 5 +/- 1. 1 vs 1.8 +/- 0. 2, 6. 4 +/- 3. 7 vs 3. 1 +/- 0. 7, 16. 9 +/- 10. 4 vs 3. 7 +/- 1. 7, 8. 8 +/- 5. 4 vs 6. 9 +/- 4. 0, 3. 2 +/- 1. 0 vs 4.4 +/- 1. 9). And CBlR in area of CA3, DG had the same trend as CAI. The IA of CBl R significantly increased at 1 week (P <0. 05) and insignificantly deceased after 1 week (P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION: There is a protective increase of CB1R in hippocampus of SE rats and then it returns to normal. Thus CB1R may he involved in the occurrences and terminations of seizures.",
