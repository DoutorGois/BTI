     "AB": "Perinatally, the first encounter between the maturing receptor and its target hormone results in hormonal imprinting, which adjusts the binding capacity of the receptor for life. In the presence of an excess of the target hormone or foreign molecules than can be bound by the receptor, faulty imprinting carries life-long consequences. In cytogenic organs, imprinting could also be provoked in other periods of life (late imprinting). Imprinting also durably influences the production of the imprinter and related hormones. In the present study, single beta-endorphin doses was given to three-week old female rats at 3 microg/animal, and the serotonin in five brain regions (frontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus and brain stem) and uterine estrogen receptor content were determined, thymic glucocorticoid receptor binding capacity was measured, and sexual behavior was tested at five months of age. Brain serotonin levels highly significantly decreased, while sexual activity (Meyerson index and lordosis quotient) increased. At the same time, uterine estrogen receptor affinity decreased. There was no change in receptor binding capacity in the thymus. We will go on to discuss interrelations between the results. The experiments demonstrate that a non-perinatal treatment with a molecule acting at receptor level (late imprinting) can also lastingly influence various indexes in non-cytogenic organs. The results call attention to the possible long-lasting influence of an endorphin surge (caused, for example, by pain) on brain serotonin content and sexual behavior.",
