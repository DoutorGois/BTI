     "AB": "The dentate gyrus (DG) engages in sustained Arc transcription for at least 8 hours following behavioral induction, and this time course may be functionally coupled to the unique role of the DG in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. The factors that regulate long-term DG Arc expression, however, remain poorly understood. Animals lacking Egr3 show less Arc expression following convulsive stimulation, but the effect of Egr3 ablation on behaviorally induced Arc remains unknown. To address this, Egr3(-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice explored novel spatial environments and were sacrificed either immediately or after 5, 60, 240, or 480 minutes, and Arc expression was quantified by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Although short-term (i.e., within 60 min) Arc expression was equivalent across genotypes, DG Arc expression was selectively reduced at 240 and 480 minutes in mice lacking Egr3. These data demonstrate the involvement of Egr3 in regulating the late protein-dependent phase of Arc expression in the DG.",
