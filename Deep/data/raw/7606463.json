     "AB": "S100 beta is a calcium-binding protein elevated in Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that S100 beta is trophic for several neuronal populations. We tested the influence of S100 beta on hippocampal neurons. The initial response included a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i similar to that elicited by S100 beta in other populations. S100 beta also substantially decreased cell death and loss of mitochondrial function resulting from glucose deprivation. Therefore, S100 beta exerts a neuroprotective influence on CNS neurons, suggesting that its elevation in neurological disorders may be a compensatory response.",
