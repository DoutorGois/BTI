     "AB": "Glutamate-induced phosphorylation of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) was investigated in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. In 32P-labeled hippocampal neurons, exposure to 10 microM glutamate induced a long lasting increase in phosphorylation of MARCKS. The long lasting increase in MARCKS phosphorylation mainly required activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Unexpectatively, the MARCKS phosphorylation after the 10-min incubation with glutamate was not inhibited by treatment with calphostin C, a potent inhibitor for protein kinase C (PKC), or down-regulation of PKC but was largely prevented by PD098059, a selective inhibitor for mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase. In contrast, the phosphorylation following the short exposure to glutamate was prevented by a combination of PD098059 and calphostin C. The phosphopeptide mapping and immunoblotting analyses confirmed that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of MARCKS was transient and the MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation was relatively persistent. Investigations of the functional properties also showed that the MARCKS phosphorylation by MAP kinase regulates its calmodulin-binding ability and its interaction with F-actin as seen in the PKC-dependent phosphorylation. These results suggest that glutamate causes a long lasting increase in MARCKS phosphorylation through activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and subsequent activation of MAP kinase in the hippocampal neurons.",
