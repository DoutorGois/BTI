     "AB": "We encountered a case of focal encephalitis. A 5-year-old boy developed high fever and he was admitted to our hospital on the third day with generalized tonic-clonic convulsions. Cerebrospinal fluid showed slight pleocytosis. CT showed diffuse low-density area in the left temporal, parietal and occipital regions. T2 weighed MRI showed swelling and hyperintense regions in the left temporal, parietal and occipital cortex. With the disappearance of generalized convulsion, the cortical swelling improved. But aphasia and intractable complex partial seizures appeared. On MRI, the atrophic findings of the left hippocampus and temporal lesion became developed. We considered this case corresponds to focal encephalitis related to \"a peculiar type of post-encephalitic/encephalopathic epilepsy\" reported by Awaya et al.",
