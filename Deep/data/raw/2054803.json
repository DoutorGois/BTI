     "AB": "Neuropathologic evaluation of two infants with thanatophoric dysplasia displayed typical gross morphologic characteristics and a distinct pattern of brain malformations, including anomalies of the temporal lobe gyri and hippocampus, neuroglial heterotopias, fiber tract hypoplasia, and dysplasia of deep nuclei. Increased numbers of horizontal cells of Cajal-Retzius were striking in frequency and distribution. The pattern of abnormalities suggests arrest of cerebral cortical ontogeny late in development. As with the mucopolysaccharidoses, a shared common metabolic pathway is a potential mechanism for development of widespread bony and somatic abnormalities and associated central nervous system anomalies.",
