     "AB": "Pathogenic stimuli induce alterations in the morphology of microglial cells. We analysed changes in lectin-stained cells on the 1st, 3rd, 7th or 14th day after transient global ischemia. Three areas differing in the degree of microglial reaction were selected for analysis: the upper cerebral cortex, the hippocampal CA1 area, and the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Nine morphological parameters, including fractal dimension, lacunarity, self-similarity range, solidity, convexity and form factor were determined. Then the resultant data were processed using principal component analysis (PCA). We found that the two first principal components together explained more than 73% of the observed variability, and may be sufficient both to describe the morphological diversity of the cells, and to determine the dynamics and direction of the changes. In both hippocampal areas, the transformation to hypertrophied and phagocytic cells was observed, but changes in the hilus were faster than in the CA1. In contrast, in the cortex, a microglial reaction was characterised by an increase in the complexity of processes. The results presented show that the quantitative morphological analysis can be an effective tool in research on the reactive behaviour of microglia and, particularly, in the detection of small and early changes in the cells.",
