     "AB": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in hippocampus and cortex is considerably reduced in Alzheimer's disease. The present study tested if lysosomal disturbances, a concomitant of brain aging, impair basal and/or induced expression of BDNF. Cultured hippocampal slices were incubated with N- CBZ-L-phenylalanyl-L-alanine-diazomethylketone (ZPAD), an inhibitor of cathepsins B and L, for 6 days and processed for in situ hybridization using radiolabeled cRNA probes against BDNF mRNA. Multiple densitometric readings were collected from each of the three principal hippocampal subdivisions. Within-slice averages were substantially lower in the ZPAD-treated group compared to controls. Treatment with the inhibitor did not change average neuron diameter or packing density. Intense stimulation of glutamate receptors with kainate for 30 min (followed by a 90-min recovery period) caused a nearly threefold increase in BDNF mRNA concentrations in the dentate gyrus while having only marginal effects in the other subdivisions. Slice averages of ZPAD-exposed cultures treated with kainate were lower than those of controls exposed to the excitotoxin; however, on a percentage basis, the kainate-induced increase in the dentate gyrus was comparable for the two groups (175 +/- 31 vs 179 +/- 39%). Kainate for 1 h (with a 5-h recovery) affected BDNF mRNA in a manner similar to that found with shorter infusions, i.e., induction in stratum granulosum but not elsewhere, lower overall slice averages with ZPAD treatment, and no evidence that ZPAD blocked the percentage increase in the dentate gyrus. These results provide evidence that lysosomal dysfunction occurring during brain aging could disrupt ongoing BDNF production without substantially impairing the neurotrophin response to intense physiological activity. The first observation suggests a plausible aging sequence leading to pathology while the second may be of interest with regard to possible therapeutics.",
