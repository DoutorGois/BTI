     "AB": "A review. Spontaneous periodic network activity is a characteristic feature of the developing nervous system. It is believed that early spontaneous activity is involved in the modulation of several processes during brain maturation, including neuronal growth and network construction. Periodic spontaneous network activity was observed and studied in detail in hippocampus, cortex, retina and spinal cord of embryos and newborn animals. Principal studies of spontaneous network activity in the developing nervous system are reviewed, and possible mechanisms of its generation are discussed.",
