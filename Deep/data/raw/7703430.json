     "AB": "Changes in AMPA receptors have been proposed to underlie changes in synaptic efficacy in hippocampus and other brain structures. Activation of calpain has also been discussed as a potential mechanism to produce lasting modifications of synaptic structure and function. We report here that preincubation of thin (10 microns) frozen rat brain sections with calcium at physiological temperature changes the immunological properties of AMPA receptors, an effect totally blocked by calpain inhibitors. Immunocytochemistry indicates that in situ calpain activation produces a decreased immunoreactivity for GluR1, and to a lesser extent for GluR2/3, in the neuropil throughout the brain and an increased immunoreactivity in cell bodies, particularly in hippocampus. Western blots of calcium-treated sections suggest that the decreased immunoreactivity for GluR subunits is due to partial proteolysis. These results strongly suggest the involvement of calpain in the regulation of glutamatergic synapses.",
