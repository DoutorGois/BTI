     "AB": "In this study, we biochemically analysed the effects of the novel metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist trans-azetidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid and examined its role in hippocampal long-term potentiation. In cell lines expressing metabotropic receptor 1 or 5 subtypes, the compound stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis with EC50 values of 189.4 +/- 6.4 and 32.2 +/- 8.3 microM, respectively. In hippocampal slices, trans-azetidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid also increased phosphoinositide hydrolysis, yet failed to show any effect on forskolin-stimulated formation of cyclic AMP, even if 1 mM azetidine was applied. Since trans-azetidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (20 mM in 5 microliters) injected cerebroventricularly prolongs long-term potentiation induced by weak tetanization, a possible interaction with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors was investigated using patch-clamp techniques. Neither facilitation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (500 microM) currents nor induction of non-specific currents was observed in the presence of 50 and 500 microM azetidine. Strong tetanus-induced long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats was not influenced by azetidine. In combination with the antagonist (R,S)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (200 mM in 5 microliters), however, the potentiation was attenuated and returned to baseline within 90 min. Blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors using 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (20 mM in 5 microliters) prevented the potentiation in controls, but not in the azetidine group, where normal potentiation was observed for both the population spike amplitude and the excitatory postsynaptic potential. These data suggest that (i) trans-azetidine-2,4- dicarboxylic acid is an agonist at glutamate metabotropic receptors; (ii) a facilitation of induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation via N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors seems unlikely; and (iii) pharmacological activation of metabotropic receptors prior to tetanization appears to bypass the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor dependence of the potentiation. In conclusion, a role for metabotropic glutamate receptors in both short-term and long-term potentiation is indicated by these data.",
