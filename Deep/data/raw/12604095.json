     "PG": "374-80",
     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are two forms of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity that are thought to be involved in learning and memory. Evidence has shown that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, is expressed in postsynaptic dendritic spines and is regulated by synaptic activity. COX-2 inhibition has been shown to directly attenuate LTP in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Also recently the p38 MAP kinase cascade, a pathway utilised by cells for COX-2 expression, has been implicated in LTD induction in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Here we demonstrate for the first time a direct role for COX-2 and p38 MAP kinase in LTD and confirm the inhibitory role of COX-2 in LTP in the rat dentate gyrus. Perfusion of the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (1 micro M) 60 min before tetanic stimulation resulted in an attenuation of LTD (84+/-5%, n=5 compared to controls of 57+/-7%, n=6, P<0.05). Prolonged exposure (2 h) to NS-398 (1 micro M) resulted in a significant reduction in LTP (71+/-8%, n=5, P<0.01 compared to controls of 170+/-11%, n=5 at 60 min post HFS). The p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB220025 (250 nM) significantly attenuated LTD (88+/-5%, n=7; P<0.01 compared to vehicle controls at 60 min, 56+/-5%, n=6) but had no significant effect on LTP. Both NS-398 and SB220025 had no significant effect on the isolated NMDA-mediated EPSP. These data demonstrate a role for COX-2 and p38 MAPK in LTD in the dentate gyrus in vitro that is independent of NMDA receptor activation.",
