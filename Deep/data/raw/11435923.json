     "AB": "The cellular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of estrogen are only beginning to be elucidated. Here we examined the role of protein kinase B (Akt) activation in 17beta-estradiol (E2) inhibition of beta-amyloid peptide (31-35) (Abeta31-35)-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Abeta31-35 (25-30 betaM) significantly decreased the total number of microtubule associated protein-2 positive cells (MAP2+). This decrease was significantly reversed by pre-treatment with 100 nM E2. Further, 100 nM E2 alone significantly increased the total number of protein kinase B and microtubule associated protein-2 positive cells compared with controls. Such E2-induced increases were inhibited by LY294002 (20 microM), a specific PI3-K inhibitor, as well as by tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist/selective estrogen receptor modulator. These results indicate that the neuroprotective effects of E2 may be mediated at least in part via estrogen receptor-mediated protein kinase B activation.",
