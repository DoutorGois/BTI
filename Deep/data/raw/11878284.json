     "AB": "Cortical interneurons connected by gap junctions can provide a synchronized inhibitory drive that can entrain pyramidal cells. This was studied in a single-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley-type model neuron that was entrained by periodic inhibitory inputs with low jitter in the input spike times (i.e. high precision), and a variable but large number of presynaptic spikes on each cycle. During entrainment the Shannon entropy of the output spike times was reduced sharply compared with its value outside entrainment. Surprisingly, however, the information transfer as measured by the mutual information between the number of inhibitory inputs in a cycle and the phase lag of the subsequent output spike was significantly increased during entrainment. This increase was due to the reduced contribution of the internal correlations to the output variability. These theoretical predictions were supported by experimental recordings from the rat neocortex and hippocampus in vitro.",
