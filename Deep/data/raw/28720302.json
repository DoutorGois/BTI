     "AB": "We sought to identify the association between clinical risk factors and the diagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy (IE) or structural epilepsy (SE) in cats, using statistical models to identify combinations of discrete parameters from the patient signalment, history and neurological examination findings that could suggest the most likely diagnosis. Data for 138 cats with recurrent seizures were reviewed, of which 110 were valid for inclusion. Seizure aetiology was classified as IE in 57% and SE in 43% of cats. Binomial logistic regression analyses demonstrated that pedigree status, older age at seizure onset (particularly >7years old), abnormal neurological examinations, and ictal vocalisation were associated with a diagnosis of SE compared to IE, and that ictal salivation was more likely to be associated with a diagnosis of IE than SE. These findings support the importance of considering inter-ictal neurological deficits and seizure history in clinical reasoning.",
