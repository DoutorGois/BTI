     "AB": "The effects of caudate and septal stimulation on hippocampal activity were studied. Sodium penicillin was intravenously injected in order to induce a steady rate of interictal epileptic activity. Penicillin injection caused significant reduction of the rate of occurrence and duration of hippocampal rhythmic slow activity (RSA). Spontaneous RSA as well as RSA-eliciting caudate and septal stimulation induced a marked inhibition on frequency of epileptiform complexes. Lesions of the medial septal nucleus made it impossible to record RSA or to observe any sort of influence on hippocampal epileptiform activity by caudate stimulation. This result suggests that the septum is important for RSA genesis in the striato-hippocampal pathway or in the reciprocal septo-hippocampal connections.",
