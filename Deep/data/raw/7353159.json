     "AB": "The effects of active and inactive enkephalin derivatives and naloxone on putative interneurons were studied in the in vitro hippocampal slice. Inhibitory interneurons were recorded from extracellularly, and identified electrophysiologically on the basis of their characteristic action potential shape and pattern of evoked firing in response to single and multiple electrical stimuli. Active enkephalin derivatives elicited a dose-dependent depression in excitability whereas inactive derivatives had no effect. Naloxone reliably and reproducibly antagonized the depressant action of active enkephalins. These data confirm the hypothesis outlined in the preceding communication, that the direct effect of enkephalins in the hippocampus is a depression of firing of inhibitory neurons, and support the hypothesis that enkephalin-induced excitations of pyramidal cells are brought about by disinhibition.",
