     "AB": "The effect of a new cognition enhancer clausenamide on regional acetylcholine (ACh) levels and anisodine-induced ACh decrease were examined in mice of memory deficits. In the mean time, the effect of (-)clausenamide on ACh was compared with that of (+)clausenamide. Animal amnesia model was induced by i.p. anisodine, brain acetylcholine content was measured by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. It was found that single administration of (-)clausenamide or (+)clausenamide(10, 20, 50 mg.kg-1, ig) showed no effect on the ACh level in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum in normal condition. However, pretreatment with (-)clausenamide (10, 20, 50 mg.kg-1, ig) significantly ameliorated the reduction of ACh in these regions induced by anisodine (10 mg.kg-1, i.p.) in a dose-dependent manner. In the meantime, (-) clausenamide ameliorate anisodine-induced memory deficits in step-through test in mice. In contrast, (+)clausenamide showed no effect on these sides. The results indicate that there is significant difference between the actions of (-)clausenamide and (+)clausenamide; The protective action of (-)clausenamide against anisodine-induced amnesia is due to its ability to reverse ACh reduction.",
