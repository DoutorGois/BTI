     "AB": "The GABAergic and dopaminergic pathways in the central nervous system (CNS) play a pivotal role in the control of emotions and in the adaptive responses to stressful stimuli. The present study was aimed at characterizing a range of biochemical markers of GABA- and dopamine-mediated neurotransmission in the CNS of Roman high-avoidance (RHA/Verh) and Roman low-avoidance (RLA/Verh) rats, two psychogenetically selected lines that differ in their level of emotionality. The stimulatory effect of GABA on 36Cl- uptake was less pronounced in the cerebral cortex of RLA/Verh rats as compared to RHA/Verh rats, whereas no line-related changes were detected in [3H]GABA and [3H]flunitrazepam binding. On the other hand, the density of D1 dopamine receptors labeled with [3H]SCH 23390 was lower in the nucleus accumbens of RLA/Verh rats as compared to their RHA/Verh counterparts, whilst no line-dependent changes were observed in the binding parameters of D1 dopamine receptors in the striatum, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. These biochemical differences may contribute to the distinct emotionality and responsiveness to the effects of psychoactive drugs of RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh rats.",
