     "AB": "Advances in medical technology have increased the number of individuals who survive cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This increased incidence of survival has created a population of patients with behavioral and physiologic impairments. We used temperature manipulations to characterize the contribution of central nervous system damage to behavioral deficits elicited by 8 minutes of cardiac arrest/CPR in a mouse model. Once sensorimotor deficits were resolved, we examined anxiety-like behavior with the elevated plus maze and social interaction with an ovariectomized female. We hypothesized that anxiety-like behavior would increase and social interaction would decrease in mice subjected to cardiac arrest/CPR and that these changes would be attributable to central nervous system damage rather than damage to peripheral organs or changes orchestrated by the administration of epinephrine. Mice that were subjected to cardiac arrest/CPR while the peripheral organs, but not the brain, were protected by hypothermia exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior and decreased social interaction, whereas mice with hypothermic brains and peripheral organs during cardiac arrest/CPR did not exhibit behavioral impairments. The present study demonstrates that central nervous system damage from cardiac arrest/CPR results in increased anxiety and decreased social interaction and that these behavioral changes are not attributed to underlying sensorimotor deficits, dynamics of arrest and CPR, or peripheral organ damage.",
