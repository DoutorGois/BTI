     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: Cognitive defects such as learning and memory impairment are amongst the most repetitious sequelae after sever and moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI). It was suggested that ellagic acid (EA), an innate phenol product, display neuroprotective properties against oxidative and inflammatory damages after brain injury. The object of the current study was therapeutic properties of EA on blood-brain barrier (BBB) interruption and elevated content of TNF-alpha in brain tissue followed by neurologic aftereffects, cognitive and brain electrophysiology deficits as outcomes of diffuse TBI in rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TBI was induced by a 200 g weight falling by a 2-m height through a free-falling tube onto the head of anesthetized rat. TBI rats treated immediately after trauma with EA (100 mg/kg, IP) once every 8 hr until 48 hr later. Neurologic outcomes, passive avoidance task (PAT), hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), BBB permeability and content of TNF-alpha in brain tissue were evaluated. RESULTS: TBI induced significant impairments in neurological score, BBB function, PAT and hippocampal LTP in TBI+Veh group in compare with Sham+Veh (P<0.001). EA treatment decreased neurologic severity score (NSS), restored increased BBB permeability, cognitive and hippocampal LTP abnormalities, and elevated brain content of TNF-alpha due to TBI significantly (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings propose that EA can restore NSS, cognitive and LTP deficits and prevent brain inflammation may by restore BBB permeability as well as lowering brain content of TNF-alpha following TBI.",
