     "AB": "The experiments described herein were designed to determine whether tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) displays a diurnal variation in various areas of the normal rat brain. TNF-alpha mRNA transcripts were detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. To monitor diurnal changes in TNF-alpha and alpha-tubulin expression, rats were sacrificed every 4 h for 24 h starting 1 h after light onset; relative mRNA levels were determined for the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and brainstem. TNF-alpha mRNA was higher during the light than in the dark phase in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. alpha-Tubulin mRNA exhibited a similar diurnal variation in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and cortex. In contrast, beta-actin mRNA was lower during the light phase than the dark phase in the hippocampus and cortex. The observed diurnal variations in TNF-alpha mRNA are consistent with the hypothesis that TNF has a physiological role in the brain.",
