     "AB": "Ghrelin is not only a modulator of feeding and energy expenditure but also regulates reproductive functions, CNS development and mood. Obesity and major depression are growing public health concerns which may derive, in part, from dysregulation of ghrelin feedback at brain regions regulating feeding and mood. We and others have previously reported that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH, pGlu-His-Pro-NH(2)) and TRH-like peptides (pGlu-X-Pro-NH(2), where \"X\" can be any amino acid residue) have neuroprotective, antidepressant, anti-epileptic, analeptic, anti-ataxic, and anorectic properties. For this reason male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected ip with 0.1mg/kg rat ghrelin or 0.9mg/kg 3-Trp-rat ghrelin. Twelve brain regions: cerebellum, medulla oblongata, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, piriform cortex and 5 peripheral tissues (adrenals, testes, epididymis, pancreas and prostate) were analyzed. Rapid and profound decreases in TRH and TRH-like peptide levels (increased release) occurred throughout brain and peripheral tissues following ip ghrelin. Because ghrelin is rapidly deacylated in vivo we also studied 3-Trp-ghrelin which cannot be deacylated. Significant increases in TRH and TRH-like peptide levels following 3-Trp-ghrelin, relative to those after ghrelin were observed in all brain regions except posterior cingulate and all peripheral tissues except prostate and testis. The rapid stimulation of TRH and TRH-like peptide release by ghrelin in contrast with the inhibition of such release by 3-Trp-TRH is consistent with TRH and TRH-like peptides modulating the downstream effects of both ghrelin and unacylated ghrelin.",
