     "AB": "Lead is an important environmental pollutant that exerts potent toxic effects on many organs. The toxic effects of lead are less well known for adult brain than for children. We investigated the morphological changes and amyloid precursor protein (APP) accumulation in the adult rat hippocampus following exposure to lead. Forty rats were divided into two groups of 20. One group was exposed to 580 parts per million (ppm) lead acetate and other group to an identical concentration of sodium acetate as a control group. After exposure to lead for 3 months, the hippocampus was examined by electron microscopy and APP levels in the hippocampus were detected using immunohistochemistry. Lead levels in the blood of rats exposed to lead were significantly higher than in the controls. The morphological changes in the hippocampus included mitochondrial degeneration, apoptosis and abnormal synapses in the rats exposed to lead. APP in hippocampus was increased significantly in the group exposed to lead compared to controls. We determined that lead exposure causes accumulation of APP and morphological changes in the adult rat hippocampus.",
