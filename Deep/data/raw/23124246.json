     "AB": "Gangliosides (sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids) play important roles in many physiological functions, including synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, which has been suggested as the basal cellular process of learning and memory in the brain. In the present study, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in CA1 hippocampal neurons and learning behavior were examined in mice treated with (D)-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol ((D)-PDMP), an inhibitor of ganglioside biosynthesis. Mice treated with (D)-PDMP, but not those treated with (L)-PDMP, showed impairment of LTP induction in hippocampal CA1 neurons without any significant change in LTD formation and also showed a failure of learning in the 4-pellet taking test. These results indicate that de novo synthesis of gangliosides in the brain is involved in synaptic plasticity of LTP in mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons and plays important roles in learning and memory.",
