     "AB": "A definition of \"forgiveness\" is chosen that emphasizes its biological and neurological components, namely the cessation of emotions connected with memories of a hurtful act. An experience of forgiveness is analyzed into seven steps and each is associated with a neurological source. The cornerstone hypothesis is that, before forgiveness takes place, memories periodically arouse fear stemming from the amygdala. This fear drives a pattern of anger and fight-or-flight readiness. Under appropriate circumstances the frontal cortex interrupts the pattern and quells the fear response in the amygdala. The resultant relaxation of muscular tension signals the cortex that forgiveness has occurred. In addition, the memory pathway from the rhinal cortex and hippocampus to the amygdala is inhibited. Finally, a tangible act confirms that the memories no longer stimulate the amygdala and the pattern of anger and stress do not recur. The relationship of the neurological model with other theoretical models is presented and some avenues for experimental testing of the model are mentioned.",
