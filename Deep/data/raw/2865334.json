     "AB": "Sprague-Dawley dams were fed either a protein-calorie deficient or control diet from day 5 to day 21 after parturition. The concentrations of seven amino acids (aspartate, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glycine, glutamine, serine, and taurine) were determined in brain regions from 17-day-old undernourished offspring and from 35-day-old rehabilitated rats. The brain regions examined were the cortex, cerebellum, corpus striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain. At 17 days of age, taurine was the amino acid with the highest concentration, whereas at 35 days glutamate had the highest concentration. This change was due to the fact that the concentration of taurine decreased significantly in all brain regions between 17 and 35 days, whereas the concentration of glutamate remained high or increased somewhat in all brain regions except the hypothalamus and brainstem. When the age-matched offspring of control and undernourished rats were compared, several interesting and significant differences were found. The concentrations of glutamate and aspartate were significantly lower (decreased 16-34%) in the cerebellum, brainstem, cortex, and midbrain in 17-day-old undernourished rats. The aspartate level was also significantly decreased in the corpus striatum and hypothalamus in 17-day-old offspring. However, the deficiencies of aspartate and glutamate were transient and reversible. In contrast, the concentration of taurine was increased in the hypothalamus (31%) and hippocampus (12-33%) at both 17 and 35 days of age and in the midbrain (17%) at 17 days. Other transient abnormalities in amino acid levels were found in undernourished offspring. The results of these experiments suggest that undernutrition during lactation causes delayed CNS development, which is manifested in altered concentrations of the neurotransmitters aspartate, glutamate, and taurine.",
