     "AB": "Hybrid clamp protocols, in which a discontinuous single electrode voltage clamp (dSEVC) amplifier is switched from current to voltage clamp during the recording, are frequently used to investigate conductance changes after high frequency trains of action potentials. This technique is advantageous because it combines physiological stimulation of the cell with the possibility of analyzing the consecutive conductance changes quantitatively. In this study an improved hybrid clamp protocol, called dynamic hybrid clamp, is developed that enables the experimenter to study tail currents after single action potentials. The protocol employs real time action potential detection to assure precise timing of the mode switch and utilizes an external sample and hold amplifier to avoid voltage steps during the switch to voltage clamp. With the use of whole-cell patch clamp recordings and high switching frequencies (> or =25 kHz), dSEVC can easily be started with a minimal delay (<1.5 ms) after single action potentials and tail currents underlying afterhyperpolarisations (AHPs) and afterdepolarisations ensuing single spikes are clearly resolved. The dynamic hybrid clamp should also be useful for analysis of spontaneously occurring events such as intrinsic or population bursts.",
