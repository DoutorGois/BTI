In 15 or 30 day old rats, AP3 and MCPG applied for 5 min immediately after tetanization inhibited LTP. AP4 was less effective. All inhibitors were ineffective against LTP in 60 day old rats. These data support the hypothesis that the role of metabotropic glutamate receptors in LTP induction is influenced by development.",
