     "AB": "In this experiment, a new model of partial status epilepticus (SE) is described which is based on the antecedent development of a kindled focus. Following kindling, the amygdala was stimulated continuously for 60 min with the previous kindling stimulus (60 Hz sine wave, 50 microA peak-to-peak). This treatment provoked SE in 22 of 35 rats. Without drug intervention, rats spontaneously recovered (SR group) from the seizure between 10 and 24 h. After recovery from SE, after discharge (AD) thresholds were elevated and remained so for the 2 weeks before sacrifice. The histologies of these SR rats indicated massive gliosis and degeneration of the ipsilateral hemisphere, extending from the medial olfactory bulb, through the amygdala-pyriform cortex to the ventral hippocampus. Damage was observed frequently in the midline thalamic nuclei and hippocampal CA1 fields. Interruption of the SE with Nembutal 30 min after the stimulation offset (30 Min group) was occasionally associated with slight gliosis at the kindled electrode, whereas interruption after 4 h of SE (4 Hr group) resulted in more extensive cell loss. The AD thresholds of the 30 Min group, like those of the rats which did not develop SE (NSE group), returned to near-normal values by 2 weeks after SE; only the NSE rats exhibited generalized seizures to their AD threshold stimulus. This model of SE results in brain pathology similar to that found in other models, but has the advantage of being uncontaminated by exogenous chemicals and toxins.",
