     "AB": "A negative patterning discrimination problem was arranged by reinforcing rats for bar pressing when either a light or tone was presented (L+/T+) but not reinforcing the response when the compound stimulus, light and tone, was presented (LT-). To solve this problem, the animal must be able to construct a unique configural representation of the compound that can be distinguished from the representations of the individual elements. We have proposed that the hippocampal formation is essential for the acquisition and retention of associations involving configural representations. Thus, our theory predicts that animals with hippocampal formation damage will not learn the negative patterning problem and that animals who learned this problem before receiving hippocampal formation damage will not retain the solution. These predictions were confirmed by the results of two experiments. The animals with hippocampal formation damage were unable to solve the negative patterning problem. These animals were able to solve a simple discrimination in which responding in the presence of a light was rewarded but responding in the presence of a tone was not rewarded. These results are discussed in relation to several other theories of hippocampal formation function.",
