     "AB": "The extracellular matrix is known to show region-specific characteristics in the adult brain. Our comparative cytochemical study is focused on the laminar organisation of major extracellular matrix constituents in the murine hippocampal formation, including the regions CA1, CA2 and CA3 of the hippocampus proper, the dentate gyrus, the subiculum and the presubiculum. Components related to chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans were detected by N-acetylgalactosamine-binding Wisteria floribunda agglutinin, colloidal iron staining, and antibodies to different proteoglycan domains, including the Cat-301 and Cat-315 epitopes of aggrecan, as well as neurocan, brevican and phosphacan. The distribution patterns of these components were correlated with the patterns revealed for hyaluronan and the brain-specific extracellular matrix glycoprotein, tenascin-R, known to be ligands of extracellular matrix proteoglycans. Lectin binding clearly labelled perineuronal nets of the extracellular matrix around interneurons, which were preferentially located within or near the principal cell layers in all regions. In the hippocampus proper, the CA2 subfield showed an intense labelling of the neuropil around pyramidal cell bodies and the neuropil zones in the strata oriens and radiatum. These patterns were also seen after immunoreaction for chondroitin proteoglycan domains, brevican and phosphacan, as well as after detection of hyaluronan and tenascin-R. Characteristic laminar and intralaminar patterns were additionally expressed in the neuropil in all regions. In the dentate gyrus, the staining intensity for brevican, phosphacan and tenascin-R was predominant in the middle molecular layer, and for Cat-315 in the inner molecular layer, whereas immunoreactivity for neurocan increased within the outer molecular layer towards the hippocampal fissure. Our findings indicate that proteoglycans, hyaluronan and tenascin-R show differential patterns of co-expression in the individual regions and laminae of the hippocampal formation. The inhomogeneous composition of these major components suggests that the extracellular matrix is specifically adapted to the functional domains of intrahippocampal connections and afferent fibre systems.",
