     "AB": "Leptin modifies the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in adult rodents and inhibits the production of glucocorticoids from human and rat adrenals in vitro. During development, high levels of circulating leptin and low levels of corticosterone secretion are observed together with adrenal hyporesponsiveness to stress. As chronic neonatal leptin administration reduced stress-induced corticotropin-releasing factor mRNA expression and ACTH secretion in pups, we determined whether elevated leptin levels enhanced the feedback effect of glucocorticoids on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In naive pups we found a highly significant inverse relationship between plasma levels of leptin and corticosterone (P < 0.01) during postnatal d 6-20. We tested the ability of dexamethasone (1 or 10 microg/kg BW, ip, -3 h before stress) to suppress ether-induced ACTH secretion in 10-d-old pups that were treated during the neonatal period (d 2-9) with either vehicle or leptin (1 or 3 mg/kg BW, ip, daily). The expressions of brain GR and MR in vehicle- or leptin-treated neonates were determined by in situ hybridization and Western blotting. Chronic leptin treatment enhanced the ability of dexamethasone to suppress ACTH secretion after stress, and the low dose of dexamethasone was discriminant. Leptin treatment increased GR mRNA levels in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (P < 0.05) and in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in a dose-dependent fashion. Hippocampal GR protein concentrations were increased by leptin treatment (P < 0.05). Expression of MR mRNA was not modified. Thus, the ability of leptin to enhance glucocorticoid feedback in pups is mediated in part by changes in brain GR. The high circulating leptin concentrations found in developing pups might be critical to regulate glucocorticoid production, GR levels, and stress responses. As leptin levels in pups vary with maternal diet, leptin might represent an important mediator of the maternal environment on the infant.",
