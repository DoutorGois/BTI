     "AB": "Occlusal disharmony is associated with increased plasma corticosterone levels, learning deficits, and morphologic alterations in the hippocampus via chronic stress. Here, we investigated the occlusal disharmony-induced impairment of hippocampal function. We first examined the effects of raising the bite on newborn cell proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) in senescence-accelerated prone mice. Raising the bite significantly decreased cell proliferation in the hippocampal DG in an age-dependent manner. Immediately after raising the bite, cell proliferation decreased abruptly in the aged mice, then gradually increased, but did not recover to control levels within 2wk. Further, learning-induced cell proliferation was impaired in aged bite-raised mice. These findings suggest that occlusal disharmony induced by raising the bite impaired cell proliferation in the hippocampal DG, leading to learning deficits.",
