     "AB": "RATIONALE: Resveratrol participates in regulating abnormal behaviors in psychostimulant-exposed animals. OBJECTIVES: To examine effects of resveratrol on relapse and anxiety-like behaviors in cocaine withdrawn rats and to investigate possible molecular mechanisms underlying resveratrol effects in hippocampus (HP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). METHODS: Conditioned place preference (CPP) assay and elevated plus maze (EPM) test were used to examine cocaine CPP behavior and anxiety-like behaviors in rats, respectively. Resveratrol was administrated to cocaine withdrawn rats. Levels of MDA, GSH and SOD were examined to evaluate oxidative status, and levels of IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF alpha were measured to examine inflammatory status and levels of caspase-3 and BAX was examined to evaluate apoptotic status in HP and PFC. SIRT expression was also examined here. RESULTS: Resveratrol did not affect cocaine CPP behaviors, but attenuated anxiety-like behaviors in cocaine withdrawn rats. Levels of MDA and TNFalpha in PFC, and levels of MDA, SOD, GSH, IL-6, IL-1beta, TNFalpha, caspase-3 and BAX in HP, but not SIRT1 expression in both regions were significantly changed during cocaine withdrawal period. Except SOD, resveratrol reversed above neurochemical changes induced by cocaine withdrawal. Furthermore, RSV induced a greater upregulation of SIRT1 expression in PFC in cocaine withdrawn rats than that in saline controls. CONCLUSIONS: Current findings suggest that resveratrol may influence behaviors in cocaine withdrawn rats. Oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and SIRT1 signaling pathway in HP or PFC might be involved in mediating effects of RSV on behaviors in cocaine withdrawn rats.",
