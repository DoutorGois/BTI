     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol abuse is a serious health problem worldwide that causes a variety of physical and mental disorders. Research has shown that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in alcohol addiction. The BDNF precursor (proBDNF) exhibits different actions than BDNF through separate receptors and pathways in the central nervous system. However, the effects of proBDNF and BDNF in alcohol addiction are not fully known. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to identify the expression patterns and effects of proBDNF and BDNF after chronic alcohol exposure. METHODS: A total of 40 male adult mice were studied. A mouse psychomotor sensitization (PS) model was established to explore the effects of BDNF and proBDNF treatment following chronic alcohol exposure. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to measure mRNA levels for BDNF, TrkB, P75NTR, and sortilin in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and dorsal striatum of Kunming mice after chronic alcohol exposure. RESULTS: In Kunming mice, chronic alcohol exposure up-regulated BDNF and TrkB mRNA levels in the prefrontal cortex, but decreased sortilin and P75 mRNA levels in the dorsal striatum. No changes in mRNA levels were found in other measured brain regions in the alcohol and control groups. CONCLUSION: Chronic alcohol exposure induced the region-specific expression of BDNF and proBDNF and their respective receptors in the brain. These results suggest that BDNF and proBDNF signaling pathways may play major roles in alcohol preference and addiction.",
