     "AB": "A study was made of the synaptic actin ultrastructural localization in the hippocampal slices at long-lasting potentiation of area CA, using myosin subfragment-1 labeling. A specific qualitative ultrastructural sign of the potentiated hippocampal synapses was revealed for the first time - the formation in spines of rodlike bundles of actin filaments resembling the cilia. They penetrate the spine stalks to pass through the spine core towards the postsynaptic densities of active zones. The thinner bridges link the filament bundles with the actin cytoskeleton meshwork, with spine apparatus cisterns and with postsynaptic membranes of the active zones. Besides the increasing density of the presynaptic actin meshwork was shown. The changes in the actin cytoskeleton being taken into consideration, its contractile properties account for some morphofunctional features of the potentiated synapses known before and predict previously unknown ones.",
