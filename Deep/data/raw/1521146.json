     "AB": "The behavioral and electroencephalographic effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA, 25 nmol/1 microliter) injection into the massa intermedia (MI) was examined in rats. The injection caused violent running/jumping and shrill vocalization without evidence of EEG seizure in the hippocampus (HP) and amygdala (AM). Animals with the injection site located in the reuniens nucleus subsequently developed generalized tonic and then clonic seizure, leading to fatal status epilepticus in some animals. Intermittent or continuous EEG discharge in the limbic system was found during clonic seizures. These findings suggest that the NMDA receptor in the reuniens nucleus in the MI participates in the generation and expression of convulsive seizure in rats.",
