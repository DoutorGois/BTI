     "AB": "The examinations of rats hippocampus were made after ischaemia (the rats vertebral and common carotid arteries were closed for 20 minutes). Serial sections of the brains were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. 24 hours after completing the experiment a small number of cells in the field CA1 was damaged. They were dark and shrunken. 120 hours after the experiment strong damages affected large groups of pyramidal cells, especially in field CA1. The changes were asymmetrical and regarded one hemisphere of the brain only.",
