     "AB": "Effects of chronic intraventricular administration of recombinant human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (rhBDNF) or recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) on presynaptic hippocampal cholinergic function in adult rats with partial fimbrial transections were measured. Partial fimbrial transections reduced synaptosomal high affinity choline uptake, choline acetyltransferase activity, and [3H] acetylcholine synthesis by approximately 50-75%. Chronic treatment with rhBDNF failed to attenuate these lesion-induced decreases. In contrast, chronic rhNGF treatment increased all three parameters by 50-90% compared to lesioned control values. Chronic treatment with rhBDNF or rhNGF attenuated weight gain of the animals. The findings failed to provide evidence for a prominent role of BDNF in the function of adult cholinergic neurons, however, they suggest an action on central neurons involved in the regulation of food intake.",
