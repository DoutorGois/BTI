     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a serious condition, often accompanied by cerebral vasospasm, which may lead to brain ischemia and neurologic deterioration. We evaluated if dexmedetomidine has neuroprotective effects in the hippocampus of vasospastic SAH rabbits or not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen New Zealand rabbits were taken. An experimental SAH model was formed by injecting 0.9 mL of autologous arterial blood per 1 kg of body weight to the cisterna magna of 12 rabbits. Craniotomy was performed in the control group (n = 6) except performing experimental SAH. Rabbits in the SAH-alone (n = 6) group were infused with 5 mL.kg(-1).h(-1) 0.9% sodium chloride, and rabbits (n = 6) in the SAH-dexmedetomidine group were infused with 5 microg.kg(-1).h(-1) dexmedetomidine for 2 hours, 48 hours after SAH was established. Rabbits of all groups were sacrificed via penthotal 24 hours after dexmedetomidine administration. Brains were removed immediately, and hippocampal tissues were blocked from the right hemisphere for histopathologic study. In addition to this, hippocampal tissues of left hemispheres were dissected for biochemical analyses to evaluate MDA levels, activity of XO, and SOD. RESULTS: The histopathologic study showed that dexmedetomidine may have a neuroprotective effect in SAH-induced hippocampal injuries. The biochemical parameters support the neuroprotective effect of dexmedetomidine (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that dexmedetomidine may have a neuroprotective effect in the hippocampus of vasospastic SAH rabbits.",
