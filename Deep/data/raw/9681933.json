     "PG": "349-56",
     "AB": "Clozapine and the novel putative, antipsychotic S 16924 ((1-(benzodioxane-5-yl)-3-[3-(4-fluorophenacyl)pyrrolidine]-1-o xapropane HCl) share significant affinity for alpha1-adrenoceptors and 5-HT1A autoreceptors in vitro and display an 'atypical' behavioural profile in in vivo models used for detecting potential neuroleptic effects. In the present study, in vivo microdialysis was used to examine the effect of clozapine and S 16924 on 5-HT overflow in the rat ventral hippocampus, and to assess the relative role of putative alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist and 5-HT1A autoreceptor agonist properties of the drugs in this regard. S 16924 (0.1-3 mg/kg, s.c.) reduced dialysate 5-HT in a dose- and time-dependent fashion by maximally approximately 70% from baseline 40-60 min after injection. Clozapine (0.1-10 mg/kg, s.c.) reduced 5-HT overflow in the same manner, with a maximum effect of approximately 60% from baseline, obtained after 60-80 min. The 5-HT decrease elicited by S 16924 (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) was significantly, though only partially, antagonized by pretreatment with the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.). The selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist cirazoline (0.02 mg/kg, i.p.) alone did not significantly attenuate the effect of S 16924 (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) on 5-HT overflow. Combined treatment with both WAY 100635 and cirazoline, however, totally reversed the 5-HT-suppressing effect of S 16924 (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.). By comparison, when given separately, neither WAY 100635 (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) nor cirazoline (0.02 mg/kg, i.p.) antagonized the clozapine (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced decrease of 5-HT in ventral hippocampus dialysates. In the presence of both WAY 100635 and cirazoline, the response to this dose of clozapine was however significantly, though modestly, attenuated. In contrast, the WAY 100635/cirazoline combination failed to antagonise the 5-HT decrease resulting from a higher dose (3.0 mg/kg, s.c.) of clozapine. We conclude that both alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist and 5-HT1A receptor agonist properties of clozapine and S 16924 contribute to the 5-HT release-reducing action of these drugs. Whereas these factors apparently explain the effect of S 16924 fully, additional mechanism(s) appear to be involved in the case of clozapine. With regard to the interplay between alpha1-adrenoceptor and 5-HT1A (auto)receptor mechanisms in the control of 5-HT release in the rat forebrain, the present data suggest that an excitation mediated by the former is outweighed by the simultaneous activation of the latter-inhibitory-receptors.",
