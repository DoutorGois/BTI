     "AB": "Substance P (SP)-containing afferents and the NK-1 tachykinin receptor to which SP binds are present in the dentate gyrus of the rat; however, direct actions of SP on principal cells have not been demonstrated in this brain region. We have examined the effect of SP on N-methyl--aspartate (NMDA) channels from acutely isolated dentate gyrus granule cells of adult rat hippocampus to assess the ability of SP to regulate glutamatergic input. SP produces a robust enhancement of single NMDA channel function that is mimicked by the NK-1-selective agonist Sar9, Met(O2)11-SP. The SP-induced prolongation of NMDA channel openings is prevented by the selective NK-1 receptor antagonist (+)-(2S, 3S)-3-(2-methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenylpiperidine (CP-99,994). Calcium influx or activation of protein kinase C were not required for the SP-induced increase in NMDA channel open durations. The dramatic enhancement of excitatory amino acid-mediated excitability by SP places this neuropeptide in a key position to gate activation of hippocampal network activity.",
