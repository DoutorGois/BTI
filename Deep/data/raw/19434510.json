     "AB": "Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are involved in diverse biological processes and methylation was regarded as a long-term epigenetic mark. Though aging represented one of the major risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, no systematic investigations had correlated the patterns of histone PTMs in the brain with aging and the roles of such concerted histone PTMs in brain aging are still unknown. In this study, enzyme digestion, nano-LC, MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis and Western blotting were combined to investigate the defined methylation of core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) in the brain of 12-month-old senescence accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8). The expression of several modified histones in the brain of 3-, and 12-month-old SAMP8 mice as well as that of the age-matched control senescence accelerated-resistant mouse (SAMR1) was compared. In the brain of 12-month-old SAMP8 mice, seven methylation sites (H3K24, H3K27, H3K36, H3K79, H3R128, H4K20 and H2A R89) were detected and most PTMs sites were located on histone H3. Mono-methylated H4K20 decreased significantly in the brain of 12-month-old SAMP8 mice. Methylated H3K27 and H3K36 coexisted in the aged brain with different methylation multiplicities. Di-methylated H3K79 expressed in the neurons of cerebral cortex and hippocampus. This study showed histone methylation patterns in the aged SAMP8 mice brain and provided the experimental evidences for further research on histone PTMs in the aged brain. We hope these results could initiate a platform for the exchange of comprehensive information concerning aging or neurodegenerative disease and help us interpret the change of gene expression and DNA repair ability at epigenetic level.",
