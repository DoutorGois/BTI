     "AB": "The effects of hemorrhagic shock on thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) levels and its receptors were studied in different regions of the rat brain. Rats were bled for 30 min from the left femoral artery, and their mean arterial pressure was kept at 40 mmHg for the following hour. The rats were killed by decapitation. Rat brains were immediately removed and dissected into 7 regions. Hemorrhagic shock decreased TRH significantly in the frontal cortex, septum, hippocampus, and hindbrain but TRH was not changed in the striatum, hypothalamus, and midbrain. Hemorrhagic shock significantly decreased TRH receptor binding in the septum and hindbrain. Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms of specific TRH binding showed that the decreased specific TRH binding in the hindbrain resulted not from an increase of the dissociation constant (Kd), but from a decrease in the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax). In the septum, the decrease in specific binding was due both to a decrease in Bmax and an increase in Kd. The findings indicate that TRH plays a role in the physiological response to hemorrhagic shock.",
