     "AB": "Activities of enzymes involved in utilization of the glycoprotein precursor L-fucose (fucokinase and fucosyltransferase) were studied in rat hippocampal tissue after acquisition of a brightness discrimination reaction. Fucokinase activity was increased immediately after training, while fucosyltransferase revealed decreased values. However, 7 hr after training fucokinase activity showed normal values, while fucosyltransferase activity rose in trained animals over active and passive controls. The results are discussed in the light of a regulatory role that fucokinase and fucosyltransferase may play in fucose utilization under altered functional conditions.",
