     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Increased T2 relaxation time is often seen in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis. Water content directly affects the effective T2 in a voxel. Our aim was to evaluate the relation between T2 values and two molecules associated with brain water homeostasis aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), as well as cellular populations in the hippocampal region of patients with TLE. METHODS: Hippocampal T2 imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were obtained from 42 drug-resistant patients with TLE and 20 healthy volunteers (radiologic controls, RCs). A similar protocol (ex vivo) was applied to hippocampal sections from the same TLE cases and 14 autopsy control hippocampi (histologic and radiologic controls, HRCs), and each hippocampal subfield was evaluated. Hippocampal sections from TLE cases and HRC controls were submitted to immunohistochemistry for neurons (neuron nuclei [NeuN]), reactive astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), activated microglia (human leukocyte antigen-D-related [HLA-DR]), polarized AQP4, and CSPG. RESULTS: Patients with TLE had higher in vivo and ex vivo hippocampal T2 relaxation time. Hippocampi from epilepsy cases had lower neuron density, higher gliosis, decreased AQP4 polarization, and increased CSPG immunoreactive area. In vivo relaxation correlated with astrogliosis in the subiculum and extracellular CSPG in the hilus. Ex vivo T2 relaxation time correlated with astrogliosis in the hilus, CA4, and subiculum, and with microgliosis in CA1. The difference between in vivo and ex vivo relaxation ratio correlated with mean diffusivity and with the immunopositive area for CSPG in the hilus. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicate that astrogliosis, microgliosis, and CSPG expression correlate with the increased T2 relaxation time seen in the hippocampi of patients with TLE.",
