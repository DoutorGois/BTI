     "AB": "AIM: To study the neuroprotective effects of dextromethorphan against transient cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. METHODS: Transient cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in gerbils was produced by temporarily clamping the common carotid arteries (CCA) for 10 min. RESULTS: Intrahippocampal (ih) injection of 2.0 microL dextromethorphan (DM, 100 mumol.L-1) 5 min before ischemia quickened the recovery of EEG changes, the total power spectra of EEG, and the power of dominant frequency following reperfusion. The total power of EEG was increased to 92 +/- 30 (P < 0.01) at 240 min following reperfusion. DM substantially reduced the severe ischemic neuronal damage (SIND) after 10 min of cerebral ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. CONCLUSION: DM has neuroprotective effects against transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury in gerbils.",
