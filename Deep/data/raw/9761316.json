     "AB": "Mobile genetic elements termed transposons have been increasingly implicated in human disease. The small transposon mariner is widespread within non-vertebrate genomes and causes mutation by replication, excision, and insertion of itself without an RNA intermediate. We find that human DNA contains about 60 copies of this gene. Mariner transcripts are abundant in RNA prepared from sclerotic epileptic hippocampi. In contrast, typically no mariner-specific RNA is detected in non-sclerotic hippocampi from other epileptic patients or from autopsies. A complete but non-functional copy was obtained using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). This human mariner transcript is approximately 45% homologous to a functional counterpart active in Drosophila, with a coding region of 1035 bases flanked by 32 base inverted terminal repeats. The differential expression of mariner transcripts within sclerotic hippocampi suggests the probable activity of an autonomous element which by mutating critical genes could establish an epileptogenic substrate in the hippocampus.",
