     "AB": "Background Calcitonin gene-related peptide and its receptor, consisting of receptor activity-modifying protein 1 and calcitonin receptor-like receptor, are of considerable interest because of the role they play in migraine and recently developed migraine therapies. Methods To better understand the function of this neuropeptide, we used immunohistochemistry to determine a detailed distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide, receptor activity-modifying protein 1 and calcitonin receptor-like receptor in the rat brain in a region of 0.5-1.5 mm lateral to the midline. We found calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity in most of the neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamic nuclei, hypothalamic nuclei and brainstem nuclei. In contrast, receptor activity-modifying protein 1 and calcitonin receptor-like receptor immunoreactivity were found almost exclusively in the neuronal processes in the investigated regions. Conclusion Overall, the degree of expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide and calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor components in the central nervous system is astonishingly complex and suggestive of many different brain functions, including a possible role in migraine. However, currently, the presence of calcitonin gene-related peptide and the nature of its receptors throughout the brain is an enigma yet to be solved.",
