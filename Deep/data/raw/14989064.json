     "AB": "In this paper, the effects of marine health food Hippocampus Capsule on the intercoursing ability of sexually-mature rats were studied. The results showed that Hippocampus Capsule could enhance the intercoursing ability of sexually-mature male rats, shorten the latency of males catching females and ejeculation after their combination. The catching rate, intercoursing rate and the ejeculation status was markedly different from the blank control group (P < 0.05). Therefore, Hippocampus Capsule can markedly enhance the intercoursing ability of the male rats and the sexual function.",
