     "AB": "The medial septal area (MSA) contains cholinergic and GABAergic neurons that send projections to the hippocampus. These neurons have both cholinergic and GABAergic receptors. This study was designed to determine the effects of intraseptal infusions of cholinergic and GABAergic drugs, which alter mnemonic processes, on hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) release. Hippocampal ACh release was assessed using in vivo microdialysis and HPLC-EC. Oxotremorine and scopolamine produced a dose-dependent decrease in hippocampal ACh release. Muscimol decreased hippocampal ACh release at both high and low doses, although not in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of scopolamine and muscimol are consistent with a role of ACh in mnemonic processing.",
