     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Volumes of hippocampus and cholinergic basal forebrain are associated with delayed recall performance and may modulate the effect of a muscarinic receptor antagonist on delayed recall in healthy volunteers. METHODS: We studied 15 older adults before and after the oral administration of a single dose of 1 or 2 mg of the preferential M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist trihexyphenidyl (Artane) or placebo in a double-blind randomized cross-over design. Hippocampus and basal forebrain volumes were measured using magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: We found a significant interaction between treatment and hippocampus volume and a trend level effect between treatment and anterior basal forebrain volume on task performance, with an attenuation of the association between volume size and performance with trihexyphenidyl. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest a reduction of delayed recall performance with increasing doses of the muscarinic antagonist that is related to an uncoupling of the association of task performance with cholinergic basal forebrain and hippocampus volumes.",
