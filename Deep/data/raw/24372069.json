     "AB": "The aim of this research proposal was to investigate the effects of tetrahydropalmatine (THP) on gene expression in a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rodent model. Eighty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the nonstressed groups or the 3-day restraint shock PTSD rodent model groups. There were four groups within the nonstressed rats (control, THP, midazolam, and midazolam with THP) and four groups within the stressed rats (control, THP, midazolam, and midazolam with THP). After injection the subjects were euthanized and the amygdala and hippocampus were sent for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction gene expression analysis. Of the genes interrogated, 17 genes in the amygdala and 18 genes in the hippocampus were found to have significant changes in gene expression and regulation. Significant transcriptional fold changes were found in important genes involved in dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter systems. The results provide quantifiable data demonstrating gene expression changes in PTSD-stressed and nonstressed rats receiving various treatments. These findings contribute important data to the limited molecular details pertaining to the neurobiology of PTSD.",
