     "AB": "Specific receptors for corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) were identified in two functionally distinct systems within the brain, the cortex and the limbic system. Autoradiographic mapping of the CRF receptors in the brain revealed high binding density throughout the neocortex and cerebellar cortex, subiculum, lateral septum, olfactory tract, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, interpeduncular nucleus and superior colliculus. Moderate to low binding was found in the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, claustrum, nucleus periventricularis thalamus, mammillary bodies, subthalamic nucleus, periaqueductal grey, locus coeruleus and nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract. As in the anterior pituitary gland, CRF receptors in the brain were shown to be coupled to adenylate cyclase. However, in contrast to the marked decrease in CRF receptors observed after adrenalectomy in the anterior pituitary gland, CRF receptor concentration in the brain and pars intermedia of the pituitary was unchanged. The presence of CRF receptors in areas involved in the control of hypothalamic and autonomic nervous system functions is consistent with the major role of CRF in the integrated response to stress.",
