     "AB": "To evaluate the role in synaptic plasticity of ryanodine receptor type 3 (RyR3), which is normally enriched in hippocampal area CA1, we generated RyR3-deficient mice. Mutant mice exhibited facilitated CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by short tetanus (100 Hz, 100 ms) stimulation. Unlike LTP in wild-type mice, this LTP was not blocked bythe NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP5 but was partially dependent on L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Long-term depression (LTD) was not induced in RyR3-deficient mice. RyR3-deficient mice also exhibited improved spatial learning on a Morris water maze task. These results suggest that in wild-type mice, in contrast to the excitatory role of Ca2+ influx, RyR3-mediated intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may inhibit hippocampal LTP and spatial learning.",
