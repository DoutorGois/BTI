     "AB": "Systemic injection of kainic acid (12 mg/kg) induces necrosis and neuronal degeneration in several brain regions. The most pronounced effects were observed in the piriform cortex, amygdaloid complex, hippocampus and septum. A good correlation between morphological changes and changes in some neurotransmitter markers was observed in these 4 areas. High affinity uptake of L-glutamate, as well as glutamate decarboxylase and choline acetyltransferase activities were reduced in the piriform cortex and amygdaloid complex whereas in the hippocampus and septum only the first two markers were reduced. No morphological changes or decrease in any of these neurotransmitter markers were observed in striatum or globus pallidus. A pronounced neuronal degeneration could be demonstrated in lateral thalamus and geniculate body, but this degeneration was not accompanied by any decrease in the transmitter markers tested.",
