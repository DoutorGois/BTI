     "AB": "In-vivo volumetric measurements of hippocampus have proven to be highly informative for studying various neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The usefulness of volumetric imaging, however, has been limited due to the poor image resolutions obtained by currently available MRI images. In this study, a new result of volumetric image measurement of the hippocampus using 7.0 T MRI images of high contrast and resolution is described. To verify the usefulness of the proposed method, its reliability and sensitivity were examined and compared with existing imaging techniques such as 1.5 T or 3.0 T MRI imaging. The results of our study with 7.0 T MRI clearly demonstrated superior boundary detection for the hippocampal head, body, and tail compared with low field MRIs. In conclusion, robust and reproducible volumetric measurements as well as 3D images of clear contrast obtained with 7.0 T suggest the usefulness of high field MR imaging and its eventual use for the accurate diagnosis of hippocampal diseases and related research.",
