     "AB": "The synthesis of a difluorofluorescein monocarboxaldehyde platform and its use for preparing ZP8, a new member of the Zinpyr family of neuronal Zn(2+) sensors, are described. By combining an aniline photoinduced electron transfer (PET) switch and an electron-withdrawing fluorescein scaffold, ZP8 displays reduced background fluorescence and improved dynamic range compared to previous ZP probes. The bright sensor undergoes an 11-fold increase in fluorescence intensity upon Zn(2+) complexation (Phi = 0.03-0.35) with high selectivity over cellular concentrations of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+). In addition, sensors in the ZP family have been utilized for optical imaging in biological samples using two-photon microscopy (TPM). The cell-permeable ZP3 probe is capable of identifying natural pools of labile Zn(2+) within the mossy fiber synapses of live hippocampal slices using TPM, establishing the application of this technique for monitoring endogenous Zn(2+) stores.",
