     "AB": "AMPA-receptor (AMPA-R) currents were recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons in situ and after acute isolation from the hippocampus of 3- to 45-day-old rats. Membrane currents were analyzed by combining the patch clamp method with fast application techniques. The complete block of receptor currents by GYKI 53655 and the absence of modulation by Concanavalin A indicated that the cells exclusively expressed non-NMDA glutamate receptors of the AMPA subtype while functional kainate receptors could not be detected. The lowest sensitivity to kainate and NBQX was observed at postnatal day (p) 18. These changes might reflect a lower abundance of GluR1 at that developmental stage. A decrease of potentiation of receptor currents by cyclothiazide (CTZ), an acceleration of the recovery from CTZ potentiation and a faster and more complete desensitization of glutamate-evoked currents suggest an up-regulation of flop splice variants with increasing age. These functional data indicate that AMPA-R expression in CA1 pyramidal neurons varies during postnatal development which can be expected to influence the kinetics of synaptic transmission and the excitotoxic vulnerability as well.",
