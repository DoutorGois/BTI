     "AB": "This study examined the relationship between expression of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and the ingrowth of cholinergic axonal projections in cerebral cortex. Patterns of expression of NT-3 (defined by beta-galactosidase reporter expression in heterozygous offspring of transgenic NT-3(lacZneo/+) mice) revealed that limbic cortical regions (including frontal, cingulate, and insular cortex, as well as the dentate gyrus) express NT-3 and that these cortical regions receive early and relatively dense cholinergic axons (stained for acetylcholinesterase, AChE). Using the dentate gyrus as a model system, studies revealed that expression of the NT-3 reporter parallels, and precedes by approximately 2 days, the ingrowth of AChE positive cholinergic axons. Studies of forebrain organotypic slice cultures demonstrate that basal forebrain-derived cholinergic axons extend into cortical regions in a pattern that mimics the pattern of expression of the NT-3 reporter. Similarly, chimeric co-cultures, combining wild type septum with a slice of hippocampus from heterozygous NT-3(lacZneo/+) mice, demonstrate that cholinergic axons grow into regions of the dentate gyrus that express the NT-3 reporter. Hemisphere slice cultures made from NT-3 knockout mice reveal cholinergic axonal growth into cortex, but these axons do not form the regional pattern characteristic of slice cultures made from wild type or heterozygous NT-3(lacZneo/+) mice. Further, chimeric co-cultures made using slices of wild type septum combined with slices of hippocampus from NT-3 knockout mice demonstrate robust cholinergic axonal growth into the hippocampus, but the cholinergic axons do not form the characteristic preterminal pattern associated with the dentate gyrus. Slice cultures from limbic cortical tissue from the NT-3 null mice do not display exaggerated levels of cell death. In aggregate, these data support the hypothesis that expression of NT-3 by cortical neurons serves to attract basal forebrain cholinergic projections to their target cells in cerebral cortex.",
