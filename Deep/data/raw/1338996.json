     "AB": "This study aims to clarify the role of cholinergic neurons in the occurrence of epileptic seizures when emotional stress is loaded. The effects of stress and drugs on hippocampal interictal discharges were compared among groups of fully kindled male Wistar rats intraperitoneally given atropine, physostigmine and saline with and without immobilization, or pituitary-adrenocortical hormones without immobilization. Hippocampal interictal discharges increased during immobilization, because hippocampal cholinergic neurons were activated by emotional stress. Pituitary-adrenocortical hormones had no effects on the discharges.",
