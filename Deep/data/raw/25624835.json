     "AB": "Seizures were induced by flurothyl inhalation. Rats were intramuscularly treated with progesterone after each seizure. Results demonstrated that glutamate transporter 2 and gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter 1 expression levels were significantly increased in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the developing rat brain following recurrent seizures. After progesterone treatment, glutamate transporter 2 protein expression was upregulated, but gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter 1 levels decreased. These results suggest that glutamate transporter 2 and gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter 1 are involved in the pathological processes of epilepsy. Progesterone can help maintain a balance between excitatory and inhibitory systems by modulating the amino acid transporter system, and protect the developing brain after recurrent seizures.",
