     "AB": "Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a major cause of cerebral palsy. However, pathogenetic mechanisms of PVL have not been fully understood. Although it has been postulated that umbilical cord compression is related to the development of PVL, no animal experiments clearly demonstrated an association of umbilical cord occlusion with 'periventricular' white matter lesions. The purpose of this study is to determine whether umbilical cord occlusions could produce periventricular white matter lesions in fetal sheep and to examine how changes in fetal cardiovascular and metabolic variables are related to the induction of brain damage. Fourteen near-term fetal sheep underwent umbilical cord occlusion (3-min total cord occlusions 5 times at 5-min intervals). Dissections performed 24 h after cord occlusion revealed that periventricular white matter lesions were produced in 7 out of 14 sheep fetuses. According to the pattern of brain damage, we classified the fetal sheep into three groups: 5 fetuses with dominant lesions in the periventricular white matter (group I), 4 fetuses with brain lesions in the cerebral cortex and thalamus (group II) and 5 fetuses with no or minimal brain lesions (group III). Group I showed higher blood pressure and higher plasma lipid peroxide levels before cord occlusion compared to the other groups, while group II showed systemic hypotension during cord occlusion. No significant differences in changes in pH, PaCO2, PaO2 and heart rate were found between the three groups. It is speculated that PVL might be produced by an association of preexisting chronic circulatory instability with an acute episode of severe repetitive cord occlusion.",
