     "AB": "Using microdialysis, we compared intracerebral and subcutaneous administration of nicotine for the effect on the levels of extracellular amino acids in the hippocampus of anesthetized rats. Administration by microdialysis of 10 mM nicotine, resulting in a nicotine concentration of 0.134 mumol/g in the hippocampus, increased the extracellular levels of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and serine by 26-60%. At 50 mM nicotine the increases in the levels of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, serine, glycine, and glutamine were between 76% and 141%. Subcutaneous administration of nicotine at a dose of 6 mumol/kg caused a 57% increase in the extracellular level of glutamic acid. After a dose of 12 mumol/kg that resulted in a nicotine level of 0.015 mumol/kg in the hippocampus, the extracellular level of glutamic acid was increased by 100%, and that of aspartic acid by 24%. Thus, higher cerebral nicotine levels were needed with intracerebral than with subcutaneous administration to obtain similar amino acid changes. Prior administration of mecamylamine or L-kynurenine prevented the subcutaneous nicotine-induced elevation of the extracellular levels of aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Our results indicate that receptor interactions modulate nicotine effects and that both nicotinic cholinergic and NMDA/glycine glutamatergic receptors participate in the action of nicotine in increasing extracellular amino acid levels.",
