     "AB": "In patients with Pick's disease (PD), high densities of tau positive Pick bodies (PB) have been observed within the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. This study investigated the spatial patterns of PB along the granule cell layer in coronal sections of the hippocampus in eight patients with PD. In all patients, there was evidence of clustering of PB within the granule cell layer; however, there was considerable variation in the pattern of clustering. In five patients, the clusters of PB were regularly distributed along the dentate gyrus, and in two of these patients, the smaller clusters were aggregated into larger superclusters. In three patients, a single large cluster of PB, more than 1200 microm in diameter, was present. Clustering of PB may reflect a primary degenerative process within the granule cells or the degeneration of pathways that project to the dentate gyrus.",
