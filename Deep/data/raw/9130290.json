     "AB": "The anti-amnesic action of RU 52583, an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, was evaluated through performance of spatial tasks in a radial maze by rats with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) lesion of the medial septal (MS) nuclei. Memory performance of lesioned or sham-operated rats was evaluated by measuring reference memory as long-term maintenance of an acquired performance and working memory or memory for recent events. The lesion: a produced significant impairments of the animals' memory performance, b) significantly reduced the sodium-dependent high-affinity choline uptake in the hippocampal formation, and c) deeply disrupted cholinergic hippocampal theta waves. Oral administration of RU 52583 at 1 and 2 mg/kg (tested doses: 1-5 mg/kg) prior to performance of the task markedly reduced memory impairments, whereas idazoxan, another alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, had no effect at tested doses (2-5 mg/kg). Cholinergic drugs--arecoline at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg (tested doses: 0.05-1 mg/kg) and physostigmine at 0.02 and 0.1 mg/kg (tested doses: 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg)-administered intraperitoneally showed a tendency to alleviate memory deficits. The present results show that the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist RU 52583 possesses cognition-enhancing properties in rats with damage to the septohippocampal system.",
