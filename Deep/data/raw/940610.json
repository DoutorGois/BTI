     "AB": "Functional characteristics of two main intrahippocampal connections (dentate fascia-field CA3 and field CA3-field CA1) were studied in unanesthetized rabbits. Electrical stimulation of FD or CA3 was used during extracellular recording of the CA3 or CA1 neuronal activity, respectively. The system CA3-CA1 is a highly effective, with a very narrow threshold zone and wide range of active frequencies. The process of recruitment during continuous rhythmic stimulation is weak, any signs of prolonged potentiation are absent. The system FD-CA3 is characterized by low effeciency, a wide threshold zone, narrow range of active frequencies. It is able of gradual building up and prolonged preservation of potentiated state. The morphological reasons of these differences and possible role of these systems in the hippocampal activity are discussed.",
