     "AB": "Previous evidence supports the view that insulin, as well as insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) provides neurotropic support for neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). In the present study we evaluated the effects of the intravenous infusion of IGF-1 on both necrosis and apoptosis in the CNS of streptozotocin induced diabetic animals before and/or following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with reperfusion. The lesion volume was used as an index of necrosis and the sensorimotor cortex (layers 5 and 6) as well as the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus were analyzed for apoptosis using TUNEL staining and Caspase-3 immunoreactivity. A large lesion volume was produced in diabetic animals after 2-h MCAO and 24-h reperfusion. Diabetic animals also had an elevated basal level of apoptotic cells that are bilaterally distributed. Apoptosis was further increased over basal after 2-h MCAO and 24-h reperfusion. The acute administration of IGF-1 30-min before or 2 h after MCAO followed by 24-h reperfusion decreased the lesion volume as well as the number of apoptotic cells in the cortical penumbra. Apoptosis as assessed by TUNEL and caspase-3 immunoreactivity was decreased in select sensorimotor cortex and hippocampal areas. We conclude that treatment with IGF-1 before or after ischemic insult significantly decreases both lesion volume and apoptosis in selected areas of the cortex and hippocampus.",
