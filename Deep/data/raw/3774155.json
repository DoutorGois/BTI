     "AB": "Evoked field potentials and extracellular unitary activity were recorded from entorhinal lateral and subicular ventral cortices under conditions of amygdala stimulation in equithesin-anesthetized rats. The stimulation of the lateral and basolateral nuclei of the amygdaloid complex evoked field potentials consisting of negative-positive waves in layers III-VI and positive-negative deflections in the superficial layers of the ventral subdivision of the entorhinal cortex. The stimulation of the lateral nucleus evoked similar potentials in the dorsal subdivision of this cortex. And the stimulation of the lateral and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala evoked negative-positive field potentials in layer III of the subicular cortex. Cellular activity of the entorhinal and subicular cells evoked by stimulation of the lateral and basolateral nuclei consisted of an excitatory response followed by a prolonged suppression period. This activation coincided with the negative potential recorded in the deeper layers of these cortices. Such observations provide support for amygdaloid projection to the entorhinal and subicular cortices as recent anatomical findings suggested. The functional significance of these observations indicate an amygdaloid influence on entorhinal-hippocampal neurotransmission as well as on the ventral subiculum which provides the major output from the hippocampus.",
