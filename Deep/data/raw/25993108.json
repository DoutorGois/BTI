     "AB": "The goal of this study is to develop a novel brain receptor imaging agent. This study reports the synthesis, characterization and the biological evaluation of 1-((2-methoxyphenyl) piperazine)ferrocenecarboxamide labeled with technetium-99 m ((99m)Tc-MP). The (99m)Tc-MP was obtained quickly (radiolabelling time < 5 min), in 90% yield. The (99m)Tc-complex, characterized by HPLC (20-50% ACN of 0 at 5 min then 50% ACN of 5 at 17 min to finally with 50 at 20% ACN of 17 at 20 min), is stable, neutral and lipophilic enough to cross the blood-brain barrier which was confirmed by octanol/water partition coefficient (LogP = 1.82). In vivo biodistribution indicated that this complex had exceptional brain uptake (2.47% ID/g at 5 min and 0.75% ID/g at 60 min). The distribution of the activity at 15 min post-injection in various rat brain regions showed a higher accumulation in the hippocampus area. After blocking with 8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino) tetralin, the uptake of hippocampus was decreased significantly from 0.87% ID/g to 0.21% ID/g at 15 min p.i., while the cerebellum had no significant decrease. The new (99m)Tc-cyclopentadienyltricarbonyl technetium complex reported here showed promising biological results, making it an interesting starting point for the development of a new (99m)Tc-complex as brain receptor imaging agent.",
