     "AB": "Hippocampal tissue from embryonic day 15-17 fetal mice, euploid or trisomic for chromosome 16, was transplanted into the striatum or the lateral ventricle of 6-8 week old female C57B1/6 mice. After 6-14 months of survival, host brains were sectioned and the grafts were examined by histochemical techniques and by immunocytochemistry for antigens present in pathological brain structures of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Nissl-stained grafts contained aggregations of neurons similar to the pyramidal or the granule cell layers of the normal adult mouse hippocampus. No obvious morphological difference was detected between trisomic and control transplants. The monoclonal antibody Alz-50, which recognizes the paired helical filaments characteristic of AD, or an antibody raised to beta-amyloid peptide, did not reveal neurodegeneration in these grafts. Antibodies against ubiquitin, 200 kDa subunit of neurofilament, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin and tau also did not demonstrate AD-type immunoreactivity in the trisomic or control grafts. Thioflavin S- or silver stained-sections were also negative. We conclude that transplanted hippocampal tissue from the trisomy 16 mouse does not represent an animal model for AD-type neurodegeneration. These results differ from those of Richards et al., EMBO J. (10) (1991) 297-303, who reported AD-type degeneration in trisomy 16 hippocampal transplants.",
