     "AB": "This study evaluates the effect of blood volume and hematocrit changes on brain tissue during temporary global ischemia. Normal saline was administered intravenously to 55 gerbils to achieve hypo-, normo-, and hypervolemic hemodilution and uniform 30% hematocrit reduction. Each group had unilateral carotid artery ligation and temporary (20 minute) contralateral carotid occlusion. After ten days or death, brains were harvested, preserved in formalin, sectioned in a manner which provided adequate samples of both cortex and hippocampus, and stained with H&E and luxol fast blue. They were then examined and staged microscopically for white and gray matter infarction, edema, and neuronal injury and loss. Histologic studies were performed in a randomized and blinded manner and were classified by one of four categories: normal, minimal, moderate, and severe changes. Three of ten (30%) controls survived ten days but had severe neuronal loss, minimal cerebral edema and a minimal to moderate number of white matter strokes. Survival was best in animals treated with hypovolemic hemodilution (43%). Other rates were: normovolemic (33%), controls (30%), and hypervolemic (8.3%). The degree of brain tissue damage was markedly less in the normovolemic group. In this model, normovolemic hemodilution followed by hypovolemic hemodilution offered the best overall cerebral protection during global ischemia.",
