     "AB": "Hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) is characterized by neuronal plasticity processes in adulthood, and polysialylation of NCAM promotes neuronal plasticity. In previous investigations we found that alpha-tocopherol increased the PSA-NCAM-positive granule cell number in adult rat DG, suggesting that alpha-tocopherol may enhance neuronal plasticity. To verify this hypothesis, in the present study, structural remodeling in adult rat DG was investigated under alpha-tocopherol supplementation conditions. PSA-NCAM expression was evaluated by Western blotting, evaluation of PSA-NCAM-positive granule cell density, and morphometric analysis of PSA-NCAM-positive processes. In addition, the optical density of synaptophysin immunoreactivity and the synaptic profile density, examined by electron microscopy, were evaluated. Moreover, considering that PSA-NCAM expression has been found to be related to PKCdelta activity and alpha-tocopherol has been shown to inhibit PKC activity in vitro, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry followed by densitometry were used to analyze PKC. Our results demonstrated that an increase in PSA-NCAM expression and optical density of DG molecular layer synaptophysin immunoreactivity occurred in alpha-tocopherol-treated rats. Electron microscopy analysis showed that the increase in synaptophysin expression was related to an increase in synaptic profile density. In addition, Western blotting revealed a decrease in phospho-PKC Pan and phospho-PKCdelta, demonstrating that alpha-tocopherol is also able to inhibit PKC activity in vivo. Likewise, immunoreactivity for the active form of PKCdelta was lower in alpha-tocopherol-treated rats than in controls, while no changes were found in PKCdelta expression. These results demonstrate that alpha-tocopherol is an exogenous factor affecting neuronal plasticity in adult rat DG, possibly through PKCdelta inhibition.",
