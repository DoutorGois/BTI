Cerebrolysin exercised in vitro an effect, which is related to charge only trifling. The cerebrolysin effect is essential related to the concentration/medium. High concentration of cerebrolysin decreases the growth of nerve fibers. Migration of non-neuronal cells increases. A stimulation of nerve fibers growth resembling to NGF was not seen. The density of cells or number of cells/volume unit, rate of mitosis and phases of mitotic non-neuronal cells is changed by cerebrolysin. The effect of cerebrolysin in vitro is compared to the tested aminoacidsolution and brainextract resembling. NGF may be important selectiv for stimulation of the activity of sympathetic and sensoric ganglia. Brainextract and brainhydrolysat and aminoacidsolution influenced in vitro PNS- and CNS-tissue cultures.",
