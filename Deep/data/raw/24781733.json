     "AB": "Recently, the abuse of recreational drugs has become an important problem in many countries. Among these psychoactive substances are synthetic cathinones, a group of compounds derived from the alkaloid cathinone, that have gained widespread popularity. Many cathinones have demonstrated neurotoxic effects. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of 3-fluoromethcathinone, a structural analog of mephedrone, on HT22 mouse hippocampal cells. Cell viability was assessed using the sulforhodamine B assay. Flow cytometry was used to study the cell cycle distribution. We found that 3-fluoromethcathinone inhibits growth of HT22 cells. Our results also revealed that it induces G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the cytotoxic action of 3-fluoromethcathinone. Our findings suggest that abuse of this cathinone derivative may not be without risk.",
