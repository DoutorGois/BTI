     "AB": "A 19-year-old right-handed male with normal peripheral hearing bilaterally, was tested on the SSW and dichotic digits before and after commissurotomy. SSW results showed a definite deficit for words presented to the left ear in both the competing and noncompeting conditions. Dichotic digit results showed complete inability on the part of the subject to report the digits presented to the left ear. These findings are similar to other dichotic test results previously reported on split-brain patients.",
