     "AB": "The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) has been implicated in the Alzheimer's disease pathology of abnormal tau phosphorylation leading to neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation, as well as in amyloid precursor protein alpha-secretase processing. In the present study, we determined whether [3H]cAMP binding to cytosolic and particulate PKA showed any relationship to the extent of Alzheimer's disease pathology at post-mortem. Autoradiographic [3H]cAMP binding to cytosolic and particulate PKA was measured in sections of entorhinal cortex/hippocampal formation from 23 cases that had been staged for Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary changes and amyloid deposits according to Braak and Braak [H. Braak, E. Braak, Neuropathological staging of Alzheimer's-related changes, Acta Neuropathol. 82 (1991) 239-259]. [3H]cAMP binding to cytosolic PKA showed statistically significant reductions in the entorhinal cortex (P<0.01, ANOVA) with respect to neurofibrillary changes. Post-hoc analysis with Fisher's PLSD test showed significant reductions of [3H]cAMP binding to cytosolic PKA at the isocortical stages (V and VI), compared to the non-pathological (O) (by 55%, P<0.01), transentorhinal (I and II) (by 58%, P<0.001) and limbic (III and IV) (by 45%, P<0.05) stages. A significant reduction (by 25%, P<0.05) was also seen in the transentorhinal compared to the limbic stages. [3H]cAMP binding to cytosolic PKA showed no significant alterations with respect to neurofibrillary changes in either the subiculum, CA1-CA4 subfields of the hippocampus or the dentate gyrus. [3H]cAMP binding to cytosolic PKA also showed significant declines in the entorhinal cortex (P<0.01) and subiculum (P<0.05) with respect to staging for amyloid deposits. Post-hoc analysis with Fisher's PLSD test showed significant reductions of [3H]cAMP binding to cytosolic PKA in the entorhinal cortex at amyloid stage C compared to stages O (by 41%, P<0.01) and A (by 38%, P<0.01). In the subiculum, there were significant reductions of [3H]cAMP binding at stages C (by 41%, P<0.01) and B (by 40%, P<0.05), respectively, compared to stage O. [3H]cAMP binding to particulate PKA did not show significant relationships to staging for either neurofibrillary changes or amyloid deposits in either the entorhinal cortex or any of the hippocampal subregions. These findings suggest that whereas [3H]cAMP binding to cytosolic PKA in the entorhinal cortex is reduced with progression of neurofibrillary and amyloid pathology, other hippocampal regions show a preservation of cytosolic and particulate PKA even in late stage pathologies.",
