     "AB": "The effects of intraperitoneal and intrahippocampal administration of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone were assessed regarding ethanol-induced anxiolysis in the elevated plus-maze in rats. Animals pretreated with systemic injections of dexamethasone (0.5, 1. 0, or 2.0 mg/kg, IP) 15 min before ethanol (1.2 g/kg, 14% w/v, IP) administration showed a significant dose-dependent attenuation of the increased percentage of frequency and time spent on open arms of the maze. However, IP dexamethasone treatment 4 h before the test had no effect. Unilateral intrahippocampal injection of dexamethasone (2 and 20 nmol in 0.5 microl) also significantly attenuated the increased exploration of the open arms induced by ethanol. The results are interpreted in terms of the modulation of the anxiolytic effects of ethanol by glucocorticoids and the possible involvement of hippocampus in this response. The rapid blockade of ethanol induced anxiolysis by dexamethasone strengthens the suggestion that a nongenomic mechanism may underlie this response.",
