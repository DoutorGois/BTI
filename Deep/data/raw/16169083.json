     "AB": "Although lead is widely known as a potent neurotoxin, the effect of lead exposure on the expression of the polysialic acid linked neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) remains unclear. We exposed Wistar rat pups to 0.2% lead acetate from postnatal day (PND) 1 to PND 30. This exposure protocol resulted in pup blood lead levels, which increased to 29.3+/-5.0 mg/dl on PND 15, and subsequently rose to 34.2+/-5.8 mg/dl at weaning. Corresponding brain tissue lead levels were 456+/-23 ng/g on PND 15 and 781+/-87 ng/g on PND 30. Animals were sacrificed on PND 80, when the blood and brain lead concentrations did not differ from those of the control group. Lead exposure induced a significant increase in the total number of PSA-NCAM expressing cells, compared to the control group (p<0.01), and did not change the proportion of cells co-expressing PSA-NCAM with glial or neuronal markers (calbindin, TuJ1, GFAP). These results suggest that early post-natal lead exposure induces persistent changes in the number of PSA-NCAM expressing cells, which could be, at least, partly the basis of impairments in the learning and memory formation, which follows low-level lead exposure.",
