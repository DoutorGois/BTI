     "AB": "Hypoxic postconditioning using episodes of mild hypobaric hypoxia is a new neuroprotective technique. We compared the neuroprotective efficacy of hypoxic postconditioning and cerebrolysin in a model of posthypoxic pathology in rats. Animals that survived the severe hypoxia (180 Torr, 3 h) were exposed to hypoxic postconditioning or received cerebrolysin. Postconditioning prevented the injury and loss of hippocampal (fields CA1, CA4) and neocortical neurons whereas cerebrolysin was protective only for CA4 and the neocortex. Besides that, postconditioning, unlike cerebrolysin, led to the complete functional rehabilitation from the severe hypoxia by normalizing the level of anxiety and the pituitary-adrenal axis activity. The findings demonstrate that the elaborated postconditioning technique might provide useful tool for therapy of posthypoxic pathology and stroke.",
