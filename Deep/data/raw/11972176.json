     "AB": "The effects of glutamate on the transient outward potassium current of dissociated hippocampal CA(1) neurons of 7-10 d rats were studied by the whole-cell patch clamp technique. It was found that glutamate could block the transient potassium current in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The effect was partly voltage-dependent. These results suggest that glutamate may decrease the membrane conductance of K(+) channels in hippocampal neurons.",
