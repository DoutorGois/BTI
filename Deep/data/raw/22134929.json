     "AB": "DNA methylation is an epigenetic regulatory mechanism commonly associated with transcriptional silencing. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are a family of related proteins that both catalyze the de novo formation of 5-methylcytosine and maintain these methylation marks in cell-specific patterns in virtually all mitotic cells of the body. In the adult brain, methylation occurs in progenitor cells of the neurogenic zones and in postmitotic neurons. Of the DNMTs, DNMT1 and DNMT3a are most highly expressed in postmitotic neurons. While it has been commonly thought all postmitotic neurons and glia express DNMTs at comparable levels, the coexpression of selected DNMTs with markers of distinct neurotransmitter phenotypes has not been previously examined in detail in the mouse. To this end, we analyzed the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a along with GAD67 in the brains of the glutamic acid decarboxylase67-enhanced green fluorescent protein (GAD67-GFP) knockin mice. After first confirming that GFP-immunopositive neurons were also GAD67-positive, we showed that in the motor cortex, piriform cortex, striatum, CA1 region of the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and basolateral amygdala (BLA), GFP immunofluorescence coincided with the signal corresponding to DNMT1 and DNMT3a. A detailed examination of cortical neurons, showed that approximately 30% of NeuN-immunopositive neurons were also DNMT1-positive. These data do not exclude the expression of DNMT1 or DNMT3a in glutamatergic neurons and glia. However, they suggest that their expression is low compared with the levels present in GABAergic neurons.",
