     "AB": "Acute hypertension may transiently open the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To determine whether such temporary exposure of the brain parenchyma to plasma constituents may lead to permanent morphological alterations, acute hypertension was induced by i.v. adrenaline in conscious rates given Evan's blue and horseradish peroxidase as tracers. The brain were perfused in situ 24 h later: 17 of 21 brains showed multifocal sites of extravasation of the tracers and of endogenous plasma albumin, fibrinogen and fibronectin identified by immunohistochemistry. The proteins spread locally in the parenchyma and were taken up by neurons. Within the leaking sites in the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and basal ganglia some shrunken and grossly distorted acidophilic neurons were present. Focal areas of sponginess were observed in the subpial and subependymal zones. Thus, a transient opening of the BBB may lead to neuronal damage.",
