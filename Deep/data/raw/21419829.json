     "AB": "Sialic acid in glycoconjugates participates in important cellular functions associated with normal development, growth, and communication. Therefore we evaluated the sialylation pattern and memory deficits caused by the injection of Abeta((25-35)) into the hippocampus (Hp) of rats. The eight-arm maze spatial-learning and memory test indicated that the injection of Abeta((25-35)) into subfield CA1 of the Hp impaired both learning and memory. The sialylation pattern was examined using sialic acid-specific lectins. Our results showed that Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA, specific for Neu5Acalpha2,3Gal) showed reactivity in the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) subfields of the Hp mainly in the group injected with vehicle, whereas Macrobrachium rosenbergii lectin (MRL, specific for Neu5,9,7Ac) and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA, specific for Neu5Acalpha2,6Gal-GalNAc) had increased reactivity in the CA1 and DG subfields of the Hp in the Abeta((25-35))-injected group. The staining pattern of the antibody specific for polysialic acid (a linear homopolymer of alpha-2,8-linked sialic acid) increased in the CA1 and DG subfields of the Hp of the Abeta((25-35)) group compared to the control group. Our results suggest that injection of Abeta((25-35)) causes impairment in spatial memory and alters the sialylation pattern in response to compensatory reorganization and-or sprouting of dendrites and axons of the surviving neurons.",
