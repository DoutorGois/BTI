Brain sections containing the dorsal part of hippocampal formation were immunostained for S-100beta protein and subjected to autoradiography to visualize proliferating astrocytes. Microscopical observations revealed age-dependent changes in the number and distribution of proliferating astrocytes. The changes were considered as being related to the neurogenetic gradient characteristic to the hippocampal formation.",
