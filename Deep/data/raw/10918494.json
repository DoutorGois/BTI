     "AB": "The proto-oncogene bcl-2 is known as an anti-apoptotic gene that confers the ability to block neuronal cell death after transient ischemia. In order to examine whether the bcl-2 gene can be used for protection of ischemic brain injury, we generated adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors capable of expressing human bcl-2. Replication-defective AAV vectors were found effectively to transfer and express bcl-2 gene in the gerbil hippocampal neurons. Transduction with AAV bcl-2 5 days before forebrain ischemia prevented the DNA fragmentation in the CA1 neurons that is commonly associated with ischemia-induced cell death. Furthermore, the application of AAV bcl-2 as late as 1 h following an ischemic insult also prevented DNA fragmentation in CA1 neurons. These results suggest that the bcl-2 protein has neuroprotective functions that inhibit ischemic cell death and demonstrate the potential of AAV bcl-2 for use in post-ischemic gene therapy in the brain.
