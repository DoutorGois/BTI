     "AB": "The effect of veratridine depolarization on the activity of 3 choline-O-acetyltransferase (ChAT) fractions in rat hippocampal tissue was investigated. Those concentrations of veratridine which augmented acetylcholine (ACh) release also increased the activity of water and detergent soluble ChAT fractions. These results may suggest that the depolarization induced release of ACh is linked to an activation of ChAT activity.",
