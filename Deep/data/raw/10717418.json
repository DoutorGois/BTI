     "AB": "Sigma(1) (sigma(1)) receptor mRNA expression was studied in the prefrontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum of rat brain by northern blot and in situ hybridization. The effects of a chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol and clozapine), and with E-5842, a sigma(1) receptor ligand and putative atypical antipsychotic on sigma(1) receptor expression were examined. A significant increase in the levels of sigma(1) receptor mRNA in the prefrontal cortex and striatum after E-5842 administration was observed, while no apparent changes were seen with either haloperidol or clozapine. Our results suggest a long-term adaptation of the sigma(1) receptor at the level of mRNA expression in specific areas of the brain as a response to a sustained treatment with E-5842.",
