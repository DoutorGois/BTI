     "AB": "Previous studies have demonstrated regional variation in the anatomical organization and physiological properties of the hippocampus along its septotemporal (dorsoventral) axis. In this study, regional variation of the supragranular projection of the mossy fiber pathway in the dentate gyrus of normal and kindled rats was characterized with a scoring method for assessment of the distribution of mossy fiber synaptic terminals detected by Timm histochemistry. In normal rats, there was a sparse projection of the mossy fiber pathway into the supragranular region near the tips and crest of the dentate gyrus along the entire septotemporal axis, and a prominent projection into the supragranular region at the temporal pole. Kindling of the perforant path, amygdala, and olfactory bulb induced synaptic reorganization of the mossy fiber pathway into the supragranular region along the entire septotemporal axis of the dentate gyrus. There was regional variation of the seizure-induced synaptic reorganization along this axis, and distinct septotemporal patterns were observed as a function of the site of kindling stimulation. Kindling of the perforant path induced mossy fiber synaptic reorganization that was relatively more prominent in the septal pole than in the temporal pole of the dentate gyrus. In contrast, rats that received kindling stimulation of the amygdala had a more uniform distribution of synaptic reorganization along the septotemporal axis. As there is regional variation of the anatomical and physiological properties of the human epileptic hippocampus, these observations could be pertinent to human epilepsy.",
