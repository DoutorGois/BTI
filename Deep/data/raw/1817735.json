Cysteine, tyrosine and tryptophan were increased in cortex and striatum at 0.5 h, returning afterwards to normal. Uric acid was increased, whereas ascorbic acid and glutathione were correspondingly decreased. Although changes can be explained primarily by energy failure they are also consistent with free radical activity during early stages of ischemia.",
