     "AB": "Hippocampal evoked potentials were recorded using the P3 tonal oddball paradigm in 30 patients with unilateral temporal lobe seizure focus. Spectral power of the evoked potentials was decreased on the side of seizure focus, but this reduction was much greater when the focus was on the left. The effect of left/right focus does not appear to be due to group differences in age, sex, seizure duration, or operative pathology. Remote or finer left/right structural differences or differential left/right hippocampal processing for the sequential tonal task are possible explanations.",
