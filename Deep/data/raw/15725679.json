     "AB": "The Ca(2+) channel alpha(1B) subunit is a pore-forming component capable of generating N-type Ca(2+) channel activity. Although the N-type Ca(2+) channel plays a role in a variety of neuronal functions, alpha(1B)-deficient mice with a CBA/JN genetic background show no apparent behavioral or anatomical-histological abnormality, presumably owing to compensation by other Ca(2+) channels. In this study, we examined the mRNA expression of the alpha(1A), alpha(1C), alpha(1D), alpha(1E), beta(1), beta(2), beta(3) and beta(4) subunits in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of alpha(1B)-deficient mice. We found that the mRNA expression levels of the alpha(1A), alpha(1C), alpha(1D), alpha(1E), beta(1), beta(2), beta(3) and beta(4) subunits were the same in the olfactory bulbs of wild, heterozygous and homozygous alpha(1B)-deficient mice. In the cerebral cortex, alpha(1A) mRNA in homozygous alpha(1B)-deficient mice was expressed at a higher level than in wild or heterozygous mice, but no difference in the expression levels of the alpha(1C), alpha(1D), alpha(1E), beta(1), beta(2), beta(3) and beta(4) subunits was found among wild, heterozygous and homozygous mice. In hippocampus and cerebellum, beta(4) mRNA in homozygous alpha(1B)-deficient mice was expressed at a higher level than in wild or heterozygous mice, but no difference in the expression levels of the alpha(1A), alpha(1C), alpha(1D), alpha(1E), beta(1), beta(2) and beta(3) subunits was found among wild, heterozygous and homozygous mice. These results suggest that the compensatory mechanisms differ in different brain regions of alpha(1B)-deficient mice with a CBA/JN genetic background.",
