     "AB": "The immunocytochemical distribution of manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) was determined in the rat hippocampus. The enzyme was localized in the mitochondria. CA1 pyramidal cells were weakly immunostained, whereas CA3 pyramidal cells were strongly reactive. These differences in the intensity of the Mn-SOD immunostaining reactions may relate to variations in the sensitivity of subfields of the hippocampus to ischemia.",
