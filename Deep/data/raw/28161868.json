     "AB": "Accumulating evidence has suggested resveratrol as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of epilepsy. To validate this, we tested the protective effect of resveratrol on a kainic acid (KA)-induced epilepsy model in rats and investigated the underlying mechanism. We found that acute resveratrol application partially inhibited evoked epileptiform discharges in the hippocampal CA1 region. During acute, silent and chronic phases of epilepsy, the expression of hippocampal kainate glutamate receptor (GluK2) and the GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit (GABAAR-alpha1) was up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. Resveratrol reversed these effects and induced an antiepileptic effect. Furthermore, in the chronic phase, resveratrol treatment inhibited the KA-induced increased glutamate/GABA ratio in the hippocampus. The antiepileptic effects of resveratrol may be partially attributed to the reduction of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and the enhancement in GABAergic inhibition.",
