     "AB": "Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO; 100% oxygen at 2 atmospheres absolute) was administered for 1 h to male Mongolian gerbils either for a single session or every other day for five sessions. Two days after HBO pretreatment, the gerbils were subjected to 5 min of forebrain ischemia by occlusion of both common carotid arteries under anesthesia. Seven days after recirculation, neuronal density per 1-mm length of the CA1 sector in the hippocampus was significantly better preserved in the five-session HBO pretreatment group (n = 10: 175.7 (47.8/mm, 54.9% of normal) than in the ischemic control group (n = 10: 26.2 (11.6/mm, 8.0% of normal) and in the single-session HBO pretreatment group (n = 7: 37.3 (21.7/mm, 11.4% of normal). Immunohistochemical staining for the 72-kDa heat-shock protein (HSP-72) in the CA1 sector performed 2 days following pretreatment revealed that the five-session HBO pretreatment increased the amount of HSP-72 present compared with that in the ischemic control group and in the single HBO pretreatment group. These results suggest that tolerance against ischemic neuronal damage was induced by repeated HBO pretreatment, which is thought to occur through the induction of HSP-72 synthesis.",
