     "AB": "Adult male rats had electrolytic lesions placed bilaterally in the medial forebrain bundle and were subsequently implanted with stimulating electrodes in one of the following limbic regions: (1) dorsal hippocampus; (2) ventral hippocampus; (3) medial septal nucleus; (4) basolateral amygdala; (5) mesencephalic reticular formation. Following electrical stimulation, blood was drawn by acute venesection, under either, for plasma corticosterone determinations. In non-lesioned animals, electrical stimulation in all of the limbic regions led to elevated plasma corticosterone levels. In rats with lesions in the medial forebrain bundles, the adrenocortical response to stimulation in the dorsal hippocampus, the basolateral amygdala or the reticular formation was markedly attenuated. On the contrary, the same lesions were without effect upon the corticosterone secretory response to medial septal stimulation, and had only a slight inhibitory effect upon the response to electrical stimulation in the ventral hippocampus. The results demonstrate that the medial forebrain bundle plays a major role in the transmission of impulses to the mediobasal hypothalamus, originating in the dorsal hippocampus, basolateral amygdala or mesencephalic reticular formation, which activate adrenocortical secretion; its role in the transmission of cues arising in the ventral hippocampus or medial septum is, however, minor.",
