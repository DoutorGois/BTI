     "AB": "PURPOSE: To evaluate neurochemical and structural changes in the patients with newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) by MR spectroscopy (MRS), T2 relaxometry, and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Following the acquisition of routine cranial MR, MRS, T2 relaxometry, and DWI images; spectroscopic metabolite ratios and DWI-T2 relaxometry findings of the thalami, hippocampi, frontal white matter (FWM) and frontal cortex of 24 OSAS patients and 9 controls were statistically compared. The relationship between two groups was evaluated with Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Spectroscopic measurements in the frontal cortex and frontal white matter of the OSAS patients revealed significantly lower NAA/Cr ratios than those of the control group (P=0.004 and P=0.006, respectively). The measurements in the frontal white matter of the OSAS patients exhibited significantly lower NAA/Cho ratios compared with those of the control group (P=0.005). Thalamic Cho/Cr ratios of the patient group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P=0.002). In terms of the ADC-T2 relaxometry values, there was no significant relationship between the patient and the control groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: MRS is a useful and non-invasive modality in showing neurochemical changes in various regions of the brain but our data does not show any change on diffusion weighting or T2 quantification in the OSAS group. DWI and T2 relaxometry appear to be not effective techniques to evaluate the brain structural changes of the patients with newly diagnosed OSAS.",
