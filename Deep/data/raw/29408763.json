     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and mainly affects cognitive function of the aged populations. Aluminium, a neurotoxic metal, has been suggested as a contributing factor of AD. Caesalpinia crista is a medicinal plant known for its anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. The present study was conducted in order to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of methanolic extracts of C. crista (MECC) on aluminium-induced neurodegeneration in rats. Co-administration with MECC significantly and dose dependently ameliorated the aluminium-dependent cognitive impairment, AChE hyperactivity and oxidative stress in the hippocampus and in the frontal cortex of rat brain. Moreover, MECC reduced the neuronal injury induced by aluminium as shown by the diminution of neuron loss and pyknosis in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. From this study, it is inferred that MECC protect against aluminium-induced behavioral alterations, cognitive function, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in vivo. Therefore, this plant may serve as a source of natural products having multiple functions and could be utilized as an anti-AD preparation.",
