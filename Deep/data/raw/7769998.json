     "AB": "5-HT1a receptors in the hippocampus play a critical role in modulating limbic system output. The activity and level of 5-HT1a receptors are modulated by glucocorticoid levels. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that glucocorticoids attenuate the transcriptional activity of the 5-HT1a receptor gene. Using in situ hybridization and RNase protection assays, we observed a substantial increase in 5-HT1a mRNA expression after adrenalectomy in the same hippocampal regions in which 5-HT1a binding sites are increased. This increase in 5-HT1a mRNA expression occurs as early as 1 h after adrenalectomy and precedes the increase in receptor binding sites. Further in situ hybridization analysis showed that 5-HT1a mRNA is increased within individual hippocampal cells after adrenalectomy. Administration of dexamethasone completely prevents the adrenalectomy-induced elevation in hippocampal 5-HT1a receptor mRNA. Nuclear run-on assays showed that the rate of transcription of 5-HT1a mRNA after adrenalectomy increased 70% above the rate from control preparations and could be reduced to basal levels by the administration of dexamethasone. Adrenalectomy did not cause an increase in functional coupling of 5-HT1a receptors to adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C. These results suggest that transcription of hippocampal 5-HT1a receptor mRNA is under negative regulation by corticosteroid hormones.",
