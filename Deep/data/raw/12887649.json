     "AB": "To determine the efficacy of antioxidants in reducing amyloid-beta-induced oxidative stress, and the neuroinflammatory response in the central nervous system (CNS) in vivo, three injections of fibrillar amyloid-beta (fAbeta) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) into the CA1 region of the hippocampus of the rat were made. Concomitantly, one of the three free radical scavengers, i.e. melatonin, vitamin C, or vitamin E was also administered. Besides being a free radical scavenger, melatonin also has immunomodulatory functions. Antioxidant treatment reduced significantly oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines. There were no marked differences between melatonin, vitamin C, and vitamin E regarding their capacity to reduce nitrites and lipoperoxides. However, melatonin exhibited a superior capacity to reduce the pro-inflammatory response induced by fAbeta.",
