     "AB": "The Multiple T-maze (MTM) and the Barnes maze (BM) are land mazes used for the evaluation of spatial memory. The observation that mice are performing differently in individual mazes made us test the hypothesis that differences in cognitive performances in the two land mazes would be accompanied by differences in hippocampal protein levels. C57BL/6J mice were tested in the BM and in the MTM, hippocampi were extirpated 6 h following the probe trials each, and proteins were extracted for gel-based proteomic analysis. Mice learned the task in both paradigms. Levels of hippocampal proteins from several pathways including signaling, chaperone, and metabolic cascades were significantly different between the two spatial memory tasks. Protein levels were linked to spatial memory specifically as yoked controls were used.",
