     "AB": "Effects of thyroid hormone deficiency on 5-HT1A receptors, 5-HT2A receptors and serotonin transporter in the brain were studied in thyroidectomised Wistar rats receiving an iodine-free diet and receiving 15 micrograms/kg of thyroxine for 21 days. Binding of 3H-8-OH-DPAT to 5-HT1A receptors and 3H-cytalopram to serotonin transporter were unchanged in hypothyroid rats as compared to the control. 3H-ketanserin binding to 5-HT2A receptors was significantly decreased in the frontal cortex in hypothyroid rats. The cortical 3H-ketanserin binding in thyroidectomised rats was normalised after thyroxine replacement. The data suggest that the decrease in the cortical 5-HT2A receptors is the main consequence of impairing effect of hypothyroidism on serotonin neurotransmission.",
