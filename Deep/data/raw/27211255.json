     "AB": "We analyzed, in an integrative fashion, the morphometry and structural integrity of the bilateral hippocampi and amygdalas in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using T1-weighted images and diffusion tensor images (DTIs). We detected significant hippocampal and amygdalar volumetric atrophies in AD relative to healthy controls (HCs). Shape analysis revealed significant region-specific atrophies with the hippocampal atrophy mainly being concentrated on the CA1 and CA2 while the amygdalar atrophy was concentrated on the basolateral and basomedial. In all structures, the structural integrity displayed a significantly decreased mean fractional anisotropy (FA) value and an increased mean trace value in AD. In addition to the inter-group comparisons, we systematically evaluated the discriminative power of our three types of features (volume, shape, and DTI), both individually and in their possible combinations, when differentiating between AD and HCs. We found the volume features to be redundant when the more sophisticated shape features were available. A combination of the shape and DTI features of the right hippocampus, with classification automatically performed by support vector machine, yielded the strongest classification result (overall accuracy, 94.6%; sensitivity, 95.5%; specificity, 93.3%).",
