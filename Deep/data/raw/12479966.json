     "AB": "Chronic gestational cocaine administration has been correlated with high levels of postpartum maternal aggression towards intruders and altered levels of oxytocin in the amygdala. Cocaine may alter both oxytocin and maternal aggression either directly or indirectly through changes in monoamine levels in relevant brain regions. In this study, pregnant female rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups; three cocaine dose groups (7.5, 15 or 30 mg/kg), or a saline-treated group (0.9% normal saline) and given subcutaneous injections twice daily (total volume 2 ml/kg) throughout gestation. Behavioral responses to an inanimate object placed in the homecage were assessed on Postpartum Day (PPD) 6. Immediately following testing, animals were sacrificed and four brain regions implicated in maternal/aggressive behavior (medial preoptic area [MPOA], ventral tegmental area [VTA], hippocampus, and amygdala) were removed for monoamine level analyses using high-performance liquid chromatography. Dams given 30 mg/kg cocaine throughout gestation had significantly higher levels of dopamine (DA) and nonsignificantly elevated serotonin (5-HT) levels relative to saline-treated controls. These dams also exhibited higher frequencies of defensive behavior toward an inanimate object compared to saline-treated controls. Potential mechanisms mediating cocaine-induced increases in responding are proposed.",
