     "AB": "The synaptic delivery of neurotransmitter receptors, such as GluA1 AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors, mediates important processes in cognitive function, including memory acquisition and retention. Understanding the roles of these receptors has been hampered by the lack of a method to inactivate them in vivo with high spatiotemporal precision. We developed a technique to inactivate synaptic GluA1 AMPA receptors in vivo using chromophore-assisted light inactivation (CALI). We raised a monoclonal antibody specific for the extracellular domain of GluA1 that induced effective CALI when conjugated with a photosensitizer (eosin). Mice that had been injected in the CA1 hippocampal region with the antibody conjugate underwent a fear memory task. Exposing the hippocampus to green light using an implanted cannula erased acquired fear memory in the animals by inactivation of synaptic GluA1. Our optical technique for inactivating synaptic proteins will enable elucidation of their physiological roles in cognition.",
