     "AB": "Adult neurogenesis and synaptic remodeling persist as a unique form of structural and functional plasticity in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles due to the existence of neural stem cells (NSCs). Transplantation of NSCs may represent a promising approach for the recovery of neural circuits. Here, we aimed to examine effects of highly neuronal differentiation of NSCs transplantation on hippocampal neurogenesis, metabolic changes and synaptic formation in APP/PS1 mice. 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice were used for behavioral tests, immunohistochemistry, western blot, transmission electron microscopy and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). The results showed that N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and Glutamate (Glu) levels were increased in the Tg-NSC mice compared with the Tg-PBS and Tg-AD mice 10 weeks after NSCs transplantation. NSC-induced an increase in expression of synaptophysin and postsynaptic protein-95, and the number of neurons with normal synapses was significantly increased in Tg-NSC mice. More doublecortin-, BrdU/NeuN- and Nestin-positive neurons were observed in the hippocampal DG and SVZ of the Tg-NSC mice. This is the first demonstration that engrafted NSCs with a high differentiation rate to neurons can enhance neurogenesis in a mouse model of AD and can be detected by 1H-MRS in vivo. It is suggested that engraft of NSCs can restore memory and promote endogenous neurogenesis and synaptic remodeling, moreover, 1H-MRS can detect metabolite changes in AD mice in vivo. The observed changes in NAA/creatine (Cr) and glutamate (Glu)/Cr may be correlated with newborn neurons and new synapse formation.",
