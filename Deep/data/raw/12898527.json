     "AB": "Ror1 and Ror2 are two novel receptor tyrosine kinases that have been implicated in neuronal differentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans. As a first step toward elucidating their role in the mammalian brain, we analyzed their expression and localization patterns in hippocampal neurons. Our results showed that both receptors are expressed from early stages of development and that their protein levels peak during periods of active synapse formation. Immunocytochemical analysis indicated that Ror1 and Ror2 are highly concentrated in the growth cones of immature neurons and are present throughout the somatodendritic compartment of mature hippocampal cells. Further analysis indicated that they are present not only in the cell membrane but also in Triton- and saponin-insoluble fractions, suggesting that they may be associated with both the cytoskeleton and membrane-bound organelles. Taken collectively, our results suggest that Ror1 and Ror2 might play a role during early stages of development in mammalian central neurons.",
