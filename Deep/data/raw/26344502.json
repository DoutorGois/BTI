     "AB": "Many stress-related psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men. We aimed to determine how female rats respond to maternal separation (MS; removal of the dam from the litter for 3 h/day from postnatal day (P) 2-14)). A subset of MS females were also exposed to chronic constant light for 3 weeks during adolescence (P42-63) to investigate whether the antidepressant effect of light treatment, previously observed in male rats, could be seen in female rats. Ultrasonic vocalizations (22 kHz) were recorded and the forced swim test was conducted immediately after light exposure (P65-67) and 33 days later (P98-99) to determine depressive-like behaviour. Key proteins in the MAPK signal transduction pathway (MKP-1, phospho-ERK, total ERK) and a synaptosomal marker (synaptophysin) were measured in the ventral hippocampus. We found that MS decreased the duration of 22 kHz vocalizations at P65 which was reversed by subsequent light. Light exposure increased time spent in the inner zone of the open field and the number of 22 kHz calls in response to novelty at P98. MS decreased the time females spent immobile and increased time actively swimming in the forced swim test at P67 but not at P99. MKP-1 and synaptophysin levels remained unchanged while MS decreased phospho-ERK levels in the ventral hippocampus. In contrast to clinical findings, the results suggest that female rats may be resistant to MS-induced depression-like behaviour. The behavioural effects of MS and light treatment in female rats may involve the MAPK/ERK signal transduction pathway.",
