     "AB": "Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and their receptor (RAGE) are molecules related to oxidative stress demonstrated in aging and in several pathological disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aging has been considered the main risk factor for AD. Amyloid deposits (Abeta-D) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are pathological changes related to AD involving hippocampal regions. Different degrees of AD pathology have been described according to distribution of NFTs in different topographical regions of hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The hippocampus shows a selective vulnerability under several noxes especially those including hypoxia. Hypoxia in the nervous tissue induces oxidative stress. In an attempt to find out more about anatomical distribution of the oxidative stress through hippocampal regions in AD, a collection of brains were studied. Samples from deceased patients who had suffered from AD and from age-matched controls were immunohistochemically studied with AGE and RAGE antibodies according to a topographical division of the hippocampus and brain cortical regions. Results suggest that an oxidative stress pathway starts in the CA3 sector progresses to CA1 and then continues to other hippocampal and cortical areas building a pathoclitic pathway for Alzheimer's disease progression.",
