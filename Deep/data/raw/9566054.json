     "AB": "The behavioral and biochemical effects of EMD 57445, a selective sigma receptor ligand with potential antipsychotic activity, on the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) system were studied in rats and mice. The drug influence was investigated in three behavioral tests: 8-OH-DPAT (5-HT1A agonist)-induced behavioral syndrome in rats, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP, 5-HT1B agonist)-induced hypothermia in mice and L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP)-induced head twitches (5-HT2A stimulation) in rats. EMD 57445 did not show any activity in all three behavioral models. In biochemical studies, no changes in the 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in rat brain cortex, nucleus accumbens, striatum, hypothalamus and hippocampus were found. The results indicate that EMD 57445 does not interact with 5-HT (5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A) receptor subpopulations and does not affect 5-HT metabolism.",
