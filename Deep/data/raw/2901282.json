     "AB": "The present study was conducted for two purposes: the first was to evaluate whether activation of nicotinic receptors in the hippocampal formation in vitro (slice) preparation was capable of producing type 2 (atropine-sensitive) theta rhythm. The cholinergic nature and involvement of muscarinic receptors in this type of theta has been previously well documented. The second purpose was to determine whether perfusion of a number of (other) putative neurotransmitters shown to be present in the hippocampal formation could elicit type 1 (atropine-resistant) theta in the slice preparation. Further experiments were conducted to determine if these agents interacted in any manner with cholinergically-induced type 2 theta. Electroencephalic (EEG) theta activity was not induced by nicotine, providing evidence for an exclusive muscarinic receptor involvement in this cholinergically-induced type 2 theta. In addition, theta activity was not elicited by the application of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, norepinephrine, dopamine or serotonin. The application of any of these agents did not significantly alter the production of cholinergically-induced theta. These results suggest that type 1 theta originates in regions extrinsic to the hippocampus, or is the result of the interaction of several neurotransmitters on different receptors.",
