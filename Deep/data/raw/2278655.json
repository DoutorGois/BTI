     "AB": "Microinjections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) into the fornix-fimbria (FF) reduced dorsal hippocampal [3]5-HT uptake to 40% of control levels. The FF 5,7-DHT lesions increased nocturnal activity in photocell cages, but reduced central ambulation in diurnal open field tests. The lesions also disrupted both habituation of rearing across days in the open field and alternation in a Y-maze. Hence FF-derived hippocampal 5-HT terminals participate in controlling activity, but their role depends on the test apparatus and procedures.",
