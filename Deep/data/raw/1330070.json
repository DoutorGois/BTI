     "AB": "It was shown in the experiments on rats that intracerebroventricular administration of kainic acid (0.01, 0.05 microgram) after brain trauma, resulted in the occurrence of behavioral and electrographic convulsive disturbances; maximal expression of epileptic activity was obtained in entorhinal cortex and ventral hippocampus. Kainic acid induced epileptic reactions in nontraumatized rats only if injected in dose 0.1 microgram. Brain trauma did not lead to changes in seizures intensity induced by systemic picrotoxin administration. It is concluded that the formation of generator of pathologically enhanced excitation in limbic structures via increase of excitor glutamatergic neurotransmission is the important mechanism of traumatic epilepsy.",
