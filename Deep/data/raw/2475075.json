     "AB": "Idebenone, 6-(10-hydroxydecyl)-2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, at a dose of 100 mg/kg (i.p.) markedly increased the level of 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) in several brain regions without affecting monoamine contents in normal rats. In rats with cerebral ischemia, idebenone (10 mg/kg, i.p.) normalized the decreased levels of 5-HIAA in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, diencephalon and brain stem. A 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT) biosynthesis inhibitor, DL-p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 150 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased the levels of 5-HT to one-third of the control level 24 h after administration. Idebenone (10, 30, or 100 mg/kg, i.p.), administered 24 h after the treatment with PCPA, accelerated the PCPA-induced 5-HT decreased in the hippocampus, diencephalon and brain stem in a dose-dependent manner. Idebenone (100 mg/kg, i.p.) stimulated the release of 5-HT in the dorsal hippocampus as determined by in vivo differential pulse voltammetry. Idebenone, like p-chloroamphetamine (PCA), stimulated 5-HT release from slices of hippocampus and diencephalon, and the formation of cyclic AMP in a concentration-dependent manner in rat diencephalon slice. This stimulation was almost completely blocked by methysergide, a 5-HT receptor blocker. Idebenone slightly and PCA markedly inhibited 5-HT uptake into hippocampus slices. The mechanism of the 5-HT releasing actions of idebenone in the hippocampal slices may be mediated through endogenous calcium. These results suggest that idebenone has an enhancing effect on the turnover of 5-HT in the hippocampus, diencephalon, and brain stem of rats.",
