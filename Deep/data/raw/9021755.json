     "AB": "The rate of 5-HT synthesis was determined in discrete rat brain regions 4 days after a single dose of reserpine (10 mg/kg) or reserpine carrier (controls), using an autoradiographic method with labelled alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan as a tracer. The results show that the rate of 5-HT synthesis was unchanged in the dorsal and median raphe, significantly decreased in the raphe magnus, and significantly increased in areas rich in serotonergic nerve terminals (i.e., hypothalamus, hippocampus, median geniculate body, parietal and visual cortices). An increase in tryptophan hydroxylase activity could account for the increase in the rate of serotonin synthesis seen in some regions. Since the 5-HT synthesis rate showed regional variability there seems to be a need for regional studies of the effect of drugs on the 5-HT synthesis. In addition, the 5-HT synthesis rate was not significantly different from that in controls in many of the brain regions.",
