     "AB": "The present investigation was carried out to study the possible effects of quinacrine in modulating cytoplasmic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) mRNA levels in rat hippocampus after kainate treatment. Injections of kainate into the right lateral ventricle resulted in significant increases in cPLA(2) mRNA levels in the hippocampus, at 3 days and 7 days after injection. The elevation in cPLA(2) mRNA levels is consistent with previous observations of increased cPLA(2) immunoreactivity in degenerating neurons and astrocytes at these times. Rats that received once daily intraperitoneal injections of quinacrine (5 mg/kg) after the intracerebroventricular kainate injections showed almost complete attenuation of increased cPLA(2) expression, at both 3 and 7 days after kainate injection. These results show that in addition to its well-known effect of inhibition of PLA(2) activity, quinacrine could also inhibit cPLA(2) expression, and further supports a role for PLA(2) in kainate-induced neuronal injury.",
