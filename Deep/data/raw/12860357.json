     "PG": "25-31",
     "AB": "One of the major differences between the atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine and olanzapine is that clozapine has a two-fold higher affinity for the alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors. As clozapine can have therapeutic benefits in individuals that do not respond to other antipsychotic drugs, this raises the possibility that changes in the alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors could be a marker for a predisposition to treatment resistance. A methodology has been optimised to measure the binding of [3H]RX 821002 to alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors in human postmortem CNS and has shown that these receptors are not altered in Brodmann's area 9 from subjects with schizophrenia. These data add to those of one other study that showed the alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors were not altered in Brodmann's area 10 and the hippocampus from subjects with schizophrenia, and do not support the hypothesis that changes in alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors are a marker for treatment resistance in schizophrenia.",
