     "AB": "We have tested an acidic oligopeptide-based targeting system for delivery of enzymes to tissues, especially bone and brain, in a murine mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII) model. This strategy is based upon tagging a short peptide consisting of acidic amino acids (AAA) to N terminus of human beta-glucuronidase (GUS). The pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and the pathological effect on MPS VII mouse after 12 weekly infusions were determined for recombinant human untagged and tagged GUS. The tagged GUS was taken up by MPS VII fibroblasts in a mannose 6-phosphate receptor-dependent manner. Intravenously injected AAA-tagged enzyme had five times more prolonged blood clearance compared with the untagged enzyme. The tagged enzyme was delivered effectively to bone, bone marrow, and brain in MPS VII mice and was effective in reversing the storage pathology. The storage in osteoblasts was cleared similarly with both enzyme types. However, cartilage showed a little response to any of the enzymes. The tagged enzyme reduced storage in cortical neurons, hippocampus, and glia cells. A highly sensitive method of tandem mass spectrometry on serum indicated that the concentration of serum dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate in mice treated with the tagged enzyme decreased more than the untagged enzyme. These preclinical studies suggest that this AAA-based targeting system may enhance enzyme-replacement therapy.",
