     "AB": "Abnormalities of temporal lobe structure and frontal lobe function occur in schizophrenia. There have been few studies of young people with schizophrenia and little is known about temporo-frontal connectivity in the disease. Therefore, the cross-sectional area of the body of the fornix was measured on MR images from 17 young people with schizophrenia, nine with other serious psychiatric illnesses and eight without illness. The mean age of each group was 16-17 years. The mean cross-sectional fornix area in subjects with schizophrenia was significantly larger than that in subjects without illness ( approximately 40%) and psychiatric controls ( approximately 26%). There was no such significant difference between subjects without illness and psychiatric controls. The nature of the larger fornix in early-onset schizophrenia, whether it persists and whether it occurs in schizophrenia presenting in adulthood, remain to be elucidated.",
