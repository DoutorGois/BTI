     "AB": "The neurotoxic effects of chronic ethanol exposure were investigated in rat hippocampus by electrophysiological analysis of the Schaffer collateral-commissural input to stratum radiatum of CA1. Experimental animals were fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet for 20 weeks but were withdrawn from the special diet at least eight weeks prior to acute electrophysiological recordings. Ethanol treatment had no effect on input-output relationships for either the population EPSP or the population spike (PS). During paired-pulse stimulation, the ethanol group exhibited a greater facilitation of the test pulse PS relative to the control group, although potentiation of the EPSP was unchanged. In addition, the ethanol group showed a trend toward greater facilitation of the PS during 5 and 10 Hz tetani. No differences between groups were observed in the magnitude or duration of the long-term potentiation produced by 5, 10 or 100 Hz stimulus trains. Ethanol treatment did significantly reduce the transient spike depression after low frequency stimulation. This pattern of results is similar to that found for treatments which reduce hippocampal recurrent inhibition. Thus, chronic ethanol treatment may produce a lasting disruption of intrinsic inhibitory neurotransmission in the rat hippocampus.",
