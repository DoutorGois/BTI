Wet dog shaking elicited by systemic administration of kainic acid is eliminated by bilateral destruction of ventral dentate granule cells but unaffected by bilateral destruction of dorsal dentate granule cells. This implies that ventral dentate granule cells are essential for the generation of kainic acid-induced wet dog shakes.",
