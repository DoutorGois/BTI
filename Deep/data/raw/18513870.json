     "AB": "This study was aimed to determine the effect of unilateral hippocampal inactivation on spatial memory retrieval in male and female Wistar rats. Subjects were chronically implanted with a stainless-steel cannula that enabled unilateral intrahippocampal injections of tetrodotoxin, a sodium channel blocker. Rats were trained during eight consecutive days on the Morris water maze task. On day 1, subjects received a visible platform session. From day 2 to day 7 the hidden platform was located in North quadrant and on day 8 the hidden platform changed to the opposite location. Subjects were randomly distributed into four groups: male saline, male TTX, female saline, female TTX. Saline or TTX was applied 30min before training but only on days 7 and 8. Results showed that males outperform females during the initial training (days 2-6). After TTX injection, both male and female rats were impaired. However, a detailed analysis revealed that the impairment in females was more pronounced, both during the retrieval session (day 7) as well as during reversal (day 8). This data points to a different role of the hippocampus or a different distribution of memories in both sexes.",
