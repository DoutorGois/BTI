     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: Dual pathology is reported in 5-30% of temporal lobe resections performed in pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Dual pathology may be of importance for surgical planning and also for the understanding of the pathogenesis of epilepsy. We describe the frequency of dual or multiple pathology, i.e. more than one histopathological diagnosis, in adults with temporal lobe resections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Surgical specimens from 33 consecutive patients with resections including mesial as well as neocortical temporal structures were reviewed. All histopathological findings were recorded. Post-mortem specimens from 11 control subjects were also reviewed. RESULTS: Dual or multiple pathology was found in almost half of the epilepsy patients (48%). Hippocampal sclerosis was found in 25 patients (76%), malformations of cortical development in 15 (46%), of which 12 (36%) were microdysgenesis, and low-grade tumours in seven (21%). Apart from mild gliosis, there were no histopathological changes in the control specimens. CONCLUSION: Dual or multiple pathology was a common finding in this group of adults with temporal lobe resections. In order to increase our understanding of how aetiological factors may combine in the development of seizures, we consider it relevant and important to report all histopathological findings in epilepsy surgery series.",
