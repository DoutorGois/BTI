     "AB": "Behavioral and neuroanatomical effects of hippocampal injections of kainic acid (KA) and tetanus toxin (TT) were investigated in rats. Injections of KA resulted in both local and distant neuroanatomical damage, but not in clear signs of epilepsy; injections of TT on the other hand were followed (in some of the rats) by prolonged seizure attacks, but not by neuronal damage. Based on these results it is suggested that the widespread neuronal damage following KA lesions cannot be primarily attributed to orthodromic activation of epileptic discharges. Instead, specific properties of KA and their interactions with certain transmitters may provoke widespread neuroanatomical damage.",
