     "AB": "Bilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (4 micrograms/2 microL) into the caudal medulla of rats reduced spinal noradrenaline (NA) to 6% of control values. No significant NA depletion was observed in the hippocampus, cortex, or cerebellum, and a small loss of NA was found in the hypothalamus. These lesions were found to elevate significantly threshold shock levels necessary to elicit jump responses, and they also abolished the reflexive alternating motor movements produced by decapitation. These data support the hypothesis that spinal NA mechanisms modulate reflexive motor movements. However, no significant effect of these lesions was found on either spontaneous or amphetamine-induced locomotor activity, suggesting that spinal NA does not play a significant role in these behaviours.",
