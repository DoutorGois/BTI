     "AB": "There are many indications that focal brain ischemia may alter the properties of remote brain tissue. We investigated whether changes of neuronal properties can be observed in the unlesioned ipsilateral hippocampus following cortical photothrombosis in the somatosensory cortex of rats. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to investigate calcium current properties of hippocampal neurons (CA1 and CA3) 7 days after infarct induction. A significant alteration in the half-maximal potential of inactivation (V(h,i)) could be demonstrated, when comparing lesioned with sham operated animals, while other current parameters remained unchanged. The alterations of the V(h,i) in the CA1 and CA3 regions were of opposite directions: V(h,i) in CA1 neurons was shifted negatively by 5.6 mV, and positively by 5.0 mV in neurons from the CA3 region. It has been speculated that these differential alterations may be due to different subunit compositions of calcium channels in these two brain areas. The data indicate that small cortical lesions can lead to widespread alterations of the neuronal network's excitability in the hippocampal formation.",
