     "AB": "Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), isolated for the first time from bovine and human parathyroid, is a G-protein-coupled receptors that has been involved in diverse physiological functions. At present a complete in vivo work on the identification of CaSR mRNA-expressing cells in the adult brain lacks and this investigation was undertaken in order to acquire more information on cell type expressing CaSR mRNA in the rat brain and to analyse for the first time its expression in different experimental models of brain injury. The expression of CaSR mRNAs was found mainly in scattered cells throughout almost all the brain regions. A double labeling analysis showed a colocalization of CaSR mRNA expression in neurons and oligodendrocytes, whereas it was not found expressed both in the microglia and in astrocytes. One week after kainate-induced seizure CaSR was found in the injured CA3 region of the hippocampus and very interestingly it was found up-regulated in the neurons of CA1-CA2 and dentate gyrus. Similarly, 1 week following ibotenic acid injection in the hippocampus, CaSR mRNA expression was increased in oligodendrocytes both in the lesioned area and in the contralateral CA1-CA3 pyramidal cell layers and dentate gyrus. One week after needle-induced mechanical lesion an increase of labeled cells expressing CaSR mRNA was observed along the needle track. In conclusion, the present results contribute to extend available data on cell type-expressing CaSR in normal and injured brain and could spur to understand the role of CaSR in repairing processes of brain injury.",
