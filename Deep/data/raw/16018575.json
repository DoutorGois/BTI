     "AB": "Wistar rats treated with alpha-methyl-DL-p-tyrosine methylester showed significant level of inhibition in the activity of Na+, K+ -ATPase, Mg2+ -ATPase and Ca2+ -ATPase enzymes in different regions of the brain. The enzyme activity was assayed in cerebral hemispheres, hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and septum at proestrous (12 h), estrous (25 h), metestrous (38 h) and diestrous periods (92 h) of the rat. The Na+, K+ -ATPase activity was significantly inhibited in most of the brain regions after treated with alpha-methyl-DL-p-tyrosine methylester (MPT) and this indicated that MPT affected the active transport system and nerve impulse transmission. Mg2+ -ATPase and Ca2+ -ATPase was also significantly (P < 0.001) reduced in different regions of the brain. The results revealed that MPT affected active transport system and nerve impulse transmission by inhibiting Na+, K+ -ATPase and Ca2+ -ATPase. It has induced energy crisis by inhibiting Mg2+ -ATPase and all these cumulative effects of MPT have adversely affected the female Wistar rats. These effects have been manifested in the form of aberrations in the behavior of MPT treated female rats, which have shown their inability to perform their normal sexual activity.",
