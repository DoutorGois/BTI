     "AB": "Hyperthyroidism is often associated with behavioral disorders, and thyroid hormones modify receptor sensitivity as well as the synthesis and/or turnover rate of many neurotransmitters. We evaluated the influence in adult rats of triiodothyronine (T3), administered s.c. (100 micrograms/kg) acutely (once only) or chronically (once a day for 3 or 7 consecutive days), on brain serotonin concentration and on the density and affinity of two brain serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes mainly involved in behavioral effects. After both acute and chronic T3 treatment, serotonin levels increased in the cerebral cortex but not in the hippocampus. The density and affinity of 5-HT1A receptors (using [3H]-8-OH-DPAT as ligand) were not affected, while there was a significant decrease in the number of 5-HT2 receptors in the cerebral cortex (using [3H]ketanserin as ligand). This observation might indicate that thyroid hormones enhance 5-HT concentration in certain brain areas, thus causing a down-regulation of 5-HT2 receptors. The serotonergic system could be involved in the complex brain-neurotransmitter imbalance underlying hyperthyroidism-linked behavioral changes.",
