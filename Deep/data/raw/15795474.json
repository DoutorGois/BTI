     "AB": "Synapsins are the neuronal phosphoproteins which play very important role in processes of synaptic neurotransmission. They are physiological substrates for Ser/Thr protein kinases. The reversible phosphorylation of synapsins may be modified by several compounds including steroid hormones. The aim of our study was to investigate, if the one of neuroactive steroid--17beta-estradiol--could modulate the phosphorylation of synapsins by PKA, CaM-PK and PKC in rat brain and what type of mechanism of their action is possible. The activity of kinases was evaluated as phosphorylation of synapsin in cerebral cortex and hippocampus in vivo and in vitro conditions. We conclude that 17E2 has inhibitory effect on synapsins phosphorylation by all tested kinases in vitro and in vivo conditions. The lack of nuclei in synaptosomal membrane fraction and short time of hormone exposure can be evidence of direct, non-genomic mechanism of estradiol action.",
