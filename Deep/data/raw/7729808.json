     "AB": "It has become customary to distinguish between so-called \"genomic\" actions of steroid hormones involving intracellular receptors and \"non-genomic\" effects of steroids that involve putative cell surface receptors. Whereas there is no doubt that this distinction has considerable validity, it does not go far enough in addressing the variety of mechanisms that steroid hormones use to produce their effects on cells. This is because cell surface receptors may signal changes in gene expression, while genomic actions sometimes affect neuronal excitability, often doing so quite rapidly. Moreover, steroid hormones and neurotransmitters may operate together to produce effects, and sometimes these effects involve collaborations between groups of neurons. As illustrations, evidence is reviewed in this article that a number of steroid actions in the hippocampus involves the co-participation of excitatory amino acids. These interactions are evident for the regulation of synaptogenesis by estradiol in the CA1 pyramidal neurons of hippocampus and for the induction of dendritic atrophy of CA3 neurons by repeated stress as well as by glucocorticoid injections. In addition, neurogenesis in the adult and developing dentate gyrus is \"contained\" by adrenal steroids as well as by excitatory amino acids. In each of these three examples, NMDA receptors are involved. These results not only point to a high degree of interdependency between certain neurotransmitters and the actions of steroid hormones but also emphasize the degree to which structural plasticity is an important aspect of steroid hormone action in the adult as well as developing nervous system.",
