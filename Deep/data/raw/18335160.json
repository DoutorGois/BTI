     "AB": "Neurotrophins [e.g. nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3)] and neuropeptides such as corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) are reported to contribute to the action of antidepressants (ADs). Norepinephrine transporter (NET) knockout (NETKO) mice represent a model of chronic AD treatment. In the present study, we examined brain-region-specific regulations of NT-3, NGF, BDNF and CRF at the mRNA and protein level in NET wild-type (NETWT) and NETKO mice by means of quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), respectively. NETKO-induced changes were detected for NT-3 in olfactory bulb, brainstem and whole brain at the mRNA and for olfactory bulb at the protein level, for NGF mRNA and protein in olfactory bulb, cerebellum and brainstem and for CRF mRNA and protein in the hippocampus. In contrast, BDNF levels remained unaltered. Our results suggest that NETKO mice represent a useful model to examine gene regulation of downstream targets potentially involved in the action of ADs. We could delineate NT-3, NGF and CRF as being regulated in distinct brain regions by KO of the NET.",
