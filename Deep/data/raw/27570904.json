     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Difficulties of walking and deficits of cognitive functions appear to be associated in the elderly. Thus, clinical assessment in geriatry and neurology should focus on: (1) diagnostic approaches covering both domains of everyday functioning; (2) therapeutic interventions that take into account possible interactions and synergies of both domains. DISCUSSION: In order to assess the capability for motor-cognitive interactions in the elderly it is recommended to investigate walking patterns during dual-tasks (e.g. walking and counting backwards, walking and naming words) and to examine clinical tests of everyday mobility tasks, such as the Timed-up-and-go-Test and spatial navigation tasks. Patients with cognitive disorders often perform inferior with a reduction of walking speed and an increase of stepping variability. Dual-task performance appears to be a reliable parameter for long-term observations of the course of the disease. Moreover, it might improve the quality of the gait examination during diagnostic or therapeutic interventions (e.g. the spinal tap test in patients with NPH). Several studies further highlight gait deficits during dual-task walking as a marker for the everyday functioning and the quality of life in elderly persons and patients with cognitive disorders.Therapeutic approaches in this context comprise complex motor-cognitive interventions, such as Thai Chi and Dalcroze rhythmic exercises. These interventions appear to act synergistically in motor and cognitive domains. First evidence for the efficacy for improving executive functions and reducing the fall risk of patients with cognitive impairments is given, thought randomized, controlled trials are rare.",
