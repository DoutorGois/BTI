     "AB": "Manganese (Mn(2+))-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging studies of the neuronal pathways of the hypothalamus showed that information about the regulation of food intake and energy balance circulate through specific hypothalamic nuclei. The dehydration-induced anorexia (DIA) model demonstrated to be appropriate for studying the hypothalamus with Mn(2+)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Manganese is involved in the normal functioning of a variety of physiological processes and is associated with enzymes contributing to neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism. It also induces psychiatric and motor disturbances. The molecular mechanisms by which Mn(2+) produces alterations of the hypothalamic physiological processes are not well understood. (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements of the rodent hypothalamus are challenging due to the distant location of the hypothalamus resulting in limited measurement sensitivity. The present study proposed to investigate the effects of Mn(2+) on the neurochemical profile of the hypothalamus in normal, DIA, and overnight fasted female rats at 14.1 T. Results provide evidence that gamma-aminobutyric acid has an essential role in the maintenance of energy homeostasis in the hypothalamus but is not condition specific. On the contrary, glutamine, glutamate, and taurine appear to respond more accurately to Mn(2+) exposure. An increase in glutamine levels could also be a characteristic response of the hypothalamus to DIA.",
