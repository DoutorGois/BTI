     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: The surgery of epilepsy is expanding considerably all over the world. It is becoming a standard treatment in patients who are resistant to conventional medical treatment. DEVELOPMENT: In this article we explain the methodology used by the authors and suggest concepts regarding the epileptogenous area. We also explain the procedures used in neuroimaging and neurophysiology studies. CONCLUSIONS: Good methodology, such as that used by the authors, results in up to 65% of the patients in whom amygdalo-hippocampectomy is done becoming completely seizure-free. Amygdalo-campectomy is the most specific indication in mesolimbic temporal epilepsy, which is also the main indication for the surgery of epilepsy.",
