     "AB": "The present experiments were directed to determine the proportions of the cholinergic and GABAergic septo-hippocampal projection neurons in NMRI mice. For the labeling of the septal neurons we used a double immunocytochemical method combined with retrograde transport of wheatgerm agglutinin apo-horseradish peroxidase-gold (WAHG) injected unilaterally into the hippocampus. Monoclonal antibodies against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and parvalbumin (PARV) were used as markers for cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in the medial septum/diagonal band complex (MS/DB). Both antibodies were visualized in the same section using the ABC detection system with diaminobenzidine and 4-chloro-1-naphtol as chromogens. Cholinergic and PARV-containing neurons are coexisting in the MS/DB. About 38% of all retrogradely labeled neurons were ChAT-positive whereas only 10% of all retrogradely labeled cells were immunostained for PARV. On the other hand, 40% of all ChAT-positive neurons and about 24% of all PARV-positive neurons were retrogradely labeled. No double immunolabeled neurons were detected. The proportion of GABAergic neurons may have been underestimated because immunostaining for PARV only labels a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons. The present results were compared with those of previous studies in rats. They may serve as a basis of further comparative studies in mice.",
