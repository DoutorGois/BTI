     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the human entorhinal area using 50 Hz pulses has revealed conflicting results regarding memory performance. Moreover, its impact on memory-related hippocampal potentials has not yet been investigated. METHODS: We recorded data from seven epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampal cortex. Entorhinal DBS (bipolar, biphasic 50 Hz pulses, on- and off-cycles of 15 s) was applied with low amplitude (0.1 mA) to resemble physiologic conditions. During DBS on- and off-periods, patients learned noun-color associations that were later tested. RESULTS: During entorhinal DBS we observed more positive deflections of event-related potentials (ranging from 700 to 950 ms) in the anterior hippocampus for the on- vs. off-condition. We detected no effects in the amygdala, mid hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex. On the behavioral level, no differences in memory performance (item and source memory) were apparent in the on- vs. off-condition, neither across all trials nor across patients. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that entorhinal DBS with low amplitude has an impact on memory encoding-related potentials within the anterior hippocampus, but not on memory performance per se.",
