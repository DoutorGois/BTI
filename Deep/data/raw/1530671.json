     "AB": "Phenobarbital (CAS 50-06-6) is widely used as an effective anticonvulsant drug. Many attempts have been made to elucidate the neurochemical basis of its therapeutic action, but with little success. In the present paper, research has been focused on analyzing the effect of phenobarbital administration on two neuropeptide-degrading enzymes, the Lys- and Leu-aminopeptidases, in several brain areas of the rat. The study was performed by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of the substrates Lys- and Leu-2-naphthylamides, by neutral and basic aminopeptidase activities, respectively. Significant increases after phenobarbital administration, for both kinds of aminopeptidase activities, in the frontal, parietal and occipital cortices and the hippocampus were observed. It is suggested that these enzymes play a part in the neurochemical mechanism of the barbiturate, possibly by regulating the activity of several neuroactive peptides in the above mentioned cerebral regions.",
