     "AB": "The functions of the presenilin-1 (PS-1) protein remain largely unknown. In adult brain PS-1 is expressed principally in neurons. However during development PS-1 is expressed more widely including in embryonic neural progenitors. To determine if PS-1 is expressed in neural progenitors in adult hippocampus we used bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling combined with immunostaining for BrdU, PS-1 and markers of neuronal or glial differentiation. Most BrdU labeled cells also expressed PS-1 at a time when few BrdU labeled cells expressed the early neuronal markers beta-III tubulin or TOAD-64 and none expressed mature neuronal (NeuN or calbindin) or astrocytic (GFAP) markers. Cells expressing PS-1 and the neural progenitor marker nestin were also found. Thus PS-1 is expressed in neural progenitor cells in adult hippocampus implying its possible role in neurogenesis in adult brain.",
