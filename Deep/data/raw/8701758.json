     "AB": "AIM: To study the protective effect of ginsenosides (Gin) against anoxic injury in brain cells. METHODS: On d 12 after plating of the hippocampal cells from newborn rat, the cultures were exposed to anoxic atmosphere (95% N2 + 5% CO2) for 4-24 h. The cellular morphology, survival rate, and effluxes of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and K+ from cells were observed. RESULTS: After 24-h anoxia, the survival rate of cells was decreased from 92% +/- 4% before anoxia to 1.0% +/- 2.0%; the effluxes of LDH and K+ were increased from 2.3 +/- 0.6 U L-1 and 5.56 +/- 0.16 mmol L-1 before anoxia to 36 +/- 5 U L-1 and 8.5 +/- 0.7 mmol L-1, respectively. In the Gin group exposed anoxia for 24 h, the survival rate of cells was 4% +/- 4%; the effluxes of LDH and K+ were 30 +/- 3 U L-1 and 7.9 +/- 0.8 mmol L-1, respectively. All these changes were lower in Gin group than those of control. CONCLUSION: Under anoxia the cultured hippocampal neurons were seriously damaged, which may be protected by Gin.",
