     "AB": "Experiments on male albino rats were carried out in order to study the effects of diazepam and medazepam on the clonic-tonic convulsions in kindling phenomena evoked by multiple injections of a subconvulsive dose (40 mg/kg) pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). In the two doses used, both diazepam (0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg) and medazepam (2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg) manifest a marked anticonvulsive effect on the clonic-tonic convulsions in PTZ-kindled rats, with a marked dose-effect dependence. The evidence in the literature that the hippocampus plays the role of a pathologically determining structure in the realization of the PTZ kindling and that neurotransmission in the inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus is achieved by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), gives grounds to accept that the anticonvulsive effects of diazepam and medazepam, observed in PTZ kindling, occur through GABA-ergic mechanisms, because the facilitating effect of benzodiazepines on the GABA-ergic neurotransmission is well known.",
