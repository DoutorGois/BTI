     "AB": "The neuropeptide galanin (GAL) is involved in the control of hormone secretion, nociception, feeding behavior, attention, learning and memory. The anatomical localization of galanin receptors in the brain has been described using autoradiography and immunohistochemistry, but both techniques are limited by the availability of specific radioligands or antibodies. Functional autoradiography provides an alternative method by combining anatomical resolution and information of the activity mediated by G-protein coupled receptors. The present study analyzes the functional GAL receptors coupled to Gi/o-proteins in human and rat brain nuclei using [(35)S]GTPgammaS autoradiography. The results show the anatomical distribution of Gi/o-proteins activated by GAL receptors that trigger intracellular signaling mechanisms. The activity mediated by GAL receptors in human and rat brain showed a good correlation of the net stimulation in areas such as spinal cord, periaqueductal gray, putamen, CA3 layers of hippocampus, substantia nigra and diverse thalamic nuclei. The functional GAL receptors coupled to Gi/o-proteins showed a similar pattern for both species in most of the areas analyzed, but some discrete nuclei showed differences in the activity mediated by GAL, such as the ventroposteromedial thalamic nucleus, or areas that regulate learning and memory processes in the hippocampus. Taken into consideration the present results, the rat could be used as an experimental model for the study of the physiological role of GAL-mediated neurotransmission and the modulation of GAL receptors activity in the human CNS.",
