     "AB": "The protective effect of hypothermia on DNA fragmentation following transient forebrain ischemia in mongolian gerbils was investigated. The DNA fragmentation demonstrated in situ in gerbil hippocampal CA1 was compared between intra- and post-ischemic hypothermia. Intra-ischemic hypothermia prevented the DNA fragmentation in hippocampal CA1 completely, while severe DNA damage was observed in post-ischemic hypothermia group. the degree of DNA fragmentation of hippocampal CA1 in the post-ischemic hypothermia group was equal to that in the ischemic control group. The results suggest that hypothermia during a transient forebrain ischemia exerts a protective effect on the post-ischemic hippocampal damage by preventing the DNA fragmentation in CA1 neurons.",
