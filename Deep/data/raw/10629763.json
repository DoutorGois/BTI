     "AB": "Modulation of GTPase and adenylate cyclase (ATP pyrophosphate-lyase, EC 4.6.1.1) activity by Alzheimer's disease related amyloid beta-peptide, A beta (1-42), and its shorter fragments, A beta (12-28), A beta (25-35), were studied in isolated membranes from rat ventral hippocampus and frontal cortex. In both tissues, the activity of GTPase and adenylate cyclase was upregulated by A beta (25-35), whereas A beta (12-28) did not have any significant effect on the GTPase activity and only weakly influenced adenylate cyclase. A beta (1-42), similar to A beta (25-35), stimulated the GTPase activity in both tissues and adenylate cyclase activity in ventral hippocampal membranes. Surprisingly, A beta (1-42) did not have a significant effect on adenylate cyclase activity in the cortical membranes. At high concentrations of A beta (25-35) and A beta (1-42), decreased or no activation of adenylate cyclase was observed. The activation of GTPase at high concentrations of A beta (25-35) was pertussis toxin sensitive, suggesting that this effect is mediated by Gi/G(o) proteins. Addition of glutathione and N-acetyl-L-cysteine, two well-known antioxidants, at 1.5 and 0.5 mM, respectively, decreased A beta (25-35) stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in both tissues. Lys-A beta (16-20), a hexapeptide shown previously to bind to the same sequence in A beta-peptide, and prevent fibril formation, decreased stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by A beta (25-35), however, NMR diffusion measurements with the two peptides showed that this effect was not due to interactions between the two and that A beta (25-35) was active in a monomeric form. Our data strongly suggest that A beta and its fragments may affect G-protein coupled signal transduction systems, although the mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood.",
