     "AB": "Glucose capture in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus was studied after administration of [3H]2-deoxy-D-glucose in ketamine-anesthetized rats, using film and fine-grain emulsion autoradiography. On films, the densest label distribution occurred over the distal one-third of CA1 apical dendrites in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. The molecular layer of the dentate gyrus was also heavily labeled. On fine-grain emulsions, grain counts in the neuropil of these regions were significantly higher than over CA1 pyramidal cells or dentate granule cell bodies. It is suggested that the greatest label accumulation in the hippocampus occurs in perisynaptic sites in stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1.",
