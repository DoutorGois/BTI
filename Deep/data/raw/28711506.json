     "AB": "Accumulating evidences show that selenium dietary intake is inversely associated with the mortality of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sodium selenate has been reported to reduce neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the tauopathic mouse models, but its effects on the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and APP processing remain unknown during AD formation. In this paper, triple transgenic AD mice (3xTg-AD) had been treated with sodium selenate in drinking water for 10month before the detection of hippocampal pathology. Increased Abeta generation, tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis were found in the hippocampus of AD model mouse. Down-regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is closely associated with the alteration of AD pathology. Treatment with sodium selenate significantly promoted the activity of protein phosphatases of type 2A (PP2A) and repressed the hallmarks of AD. Activation of PP2A by sodium selenate could increase active beta-catenin level and inhibit GSK3beta activity in the hippocampal tissue and primarily cultured neurons of AD model mouse, leading to activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and transactivation of target genes, including positively-regulated genes c-myc, survivin, TXNRD2 and negatively-regulated gene BACE1. Meanwhile, APP phosphorylation was also reduced on the Thr668 residue after selenate treatment, causing the decreases of APP cleavage and Abeta generation. These findings reveal that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is a potential target for prevention of AD and sodium selenate may be developed as a new drug for AD treatment.",
