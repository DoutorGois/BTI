     "AB": "The reduction of hippocampal volume was frequently reported in schizophrenia, but not in bipolar disorder This volume reduction is associated with clinical features of schizophrenia, in particular with working and verbal memory impairments. Schizoaffective disorder, as a specific disorder sharing clinical features of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is rarely analyzed as a separate disorder in neurobiological studies. The aim of this study was to compare hippocampal volumes in separate groups of patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective and bipolar disorder. Hippocampal volumes were estimated using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging in 60 subjects, 15 subjects in each patient and one healthy volunteer (control) group. There were no significant differences in hippocampal volume between bipolar disorder and control group. Hippocampal volume was statistically significantly reduced in the group of patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, compared to either bipolar disorder or control group, thus supporting the hypothesis that hippocampal volume reduction could be considered as a possible neurobiological basis for clinical aspects of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder associated with working and verbal memory impairment.",
