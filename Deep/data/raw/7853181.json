     "PG": "673-80",
     "AB": "The peptide YY (PYY)-derivatives [Leu31,Pro34]PYY and PYY3-36 were respectively developed as selective Y1 and Y2 radioligands devoid of affinity for the Y3 receptor subtype. Each analog was iodinated by the chloramine T method after a purification by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Both radioligands bind with high affinity, low capacity and in a time-dependent and saturable manner to specific sites present in rat frontoparietal cortical or hippocampal membrane preparations. [125I][Leu31,Pro34]PYY demonstrated apparent affinities (Kd) of 0.42 +/- 0.07 and 0.22 +/- 0.08 nM and maximal capacities (Bmax) of 185 +/- 14 and 33 +/- 4 fmol/mg of protein to a single class of sites in cortical and hippocampal membrane homogenates, respectively. Conversely, [125I]PYY3-36 apparently bound to a greater amount of sites in hippocampal (Bmax of 109 +/- 13 fmol/mg of protein; Kd of 0.13 +/- 0.03 mM) compared with cortical (Bmax of 33 +/- 5 fmol/mg of protein; Kd of 0.37 +/- 0.06 nM) membrane preparations, which suggests the differential enrichment of these two brain regions with a given neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor subtype. The comparative ligand selectivity profile of these two radiolabeled PYY derivatives confirmed this hypothesis and revealed that, although the rat frontoparietal cortex is enriched with Y1 sites, Y2, receptor binding sites are most abundant in the hippocampus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
