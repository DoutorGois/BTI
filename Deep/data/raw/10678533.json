     "AB": "Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) is a transient suppression of the inhibitory synaptic transmission, observed in the hippocampus and the cerebellum, upon postsynaptic depolarization. Using rat hippocampal cultures, we examined whether DSI is confined to the inhibitory synapses on the depolarized neuron or, if DSI can spread to those on neighboring non-depolarized neurons. Whole-cell recordings were performed in 108 neuronal pairs with the following synaptic responses. Stimulation of one neuron evoked the inhibitory autaptic currents (IACs) recurrently in that neuron and also elicited the inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) orthodromically in the other neuron. In 38 of 108 pairs, the postsynaptic depolarization caused transient suppression of IPSCs (homosynaptic DSI). In 11 of the 38 pairs exhibiting the homosynaptic DSI, the depolarization also induced suppression of IACs (heterosynaptic DSI). The heterosynaptic DSI, like the homosynaptic DSI, depended on depolarizing pulse duration and was blocked by a phorbol ester. These results suggest that DSI can spread to the synapses on a neighboring non-depolarized neuron in rat hippocampal cultures.",
