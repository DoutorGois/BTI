     "AB": "We explored the associations between early life experience, endocrine regulation, psychological health, and hippocampal integrity in 37 elderly volunteers. Specifically, a neurodevelopmental and psychological mediation model was tested: Retrospective early life parental care was hypothesized to influence hippocampal integrity and the development of self-esteem. In turn, hippocampal volume (via modulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis negative feedback) and self-esteem (via modulation of stress vulnerability) were suggested to influence the cortisol stress response. Results supported the two-mediator model. We propose that early life parental care impacts on an individual's developing brain and personality, which consequently contribute to the shaping of neuroendocrine stress responsivity.",
