     "AB": "Pyroglutamate (pGlu)-modified amyloid peptides have been identified in sporadic and familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the inherited disorders familial British and Danish Dementia (FBD and FDD). In this study, we characterized the aggregation of amyloid-beta protein Abeta37, Abeta38, Abeta40, Abeta42 and ADan species in vitro, which were modified by N-terminal pGlu (pGlu-Abeta3-x, pGlu-ADan) or possess the intact N-terminus (Abeta1-x, ADan). The pGlu-modification confers rapid formation of oligomers and short fibrillar aggregates. In accordance with these observations, the pGlu-modified Abeta38, Alphabeta40 and Alphabeta42 species inhibit hippocampal long term potentiation of synaptic response, but pGlu-Abeta3-42 showing the highest effect. Among the unmodified Abeta peptides, only Abeta1-42 exhibites such propensity, which was similar to pGlu-Abeta3-38 and pGlu-Abeta3-40. Likewise, the amyloidogenic peptide pGlu-ADan impaired synaptic potentiation more pronounced than N-terminal unmodified ADan. The results were validated using conditioned media from cultivated HEK293 cells, which express APP variants favoring the formation of Abeta1-x, Abeta3-x or N-truncated pGlu-Abeta3-x species. Hence, we show that the ability of different amyloid peptides to impair synaptic function apparently correlates to their potential to form oligomers as a common mechanism. The pGlu-modification is apparently mediating a higher surface hydrophobicity, as shown by 1-anilinonaphtalene-8-sulfonate fluorescence, which enforces potential to interfere with neuronal physiology.",
