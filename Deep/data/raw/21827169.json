     "AB": "To improve optical imaging of Ca(2+) and to make available a distinct color window for multicolor imaging, we designed and synthesized CaSiR-1, a far-red to near-infrared fluorescence probe for Ca(2+), using Si-rhodamine (SiR) as the fluorophore and the well-known Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA. This wavelength region is advantageous, affording higher tissue penetration, lower background autofluorescence, and lower phototoxicity in comparison with the UV to visible range. CaSiR-1 has a high fluorescence off/on ratio of over 1000. We demonstrate its usefulness for multicolor fluorescence imaging of action potentials (visualized as increases in intracellular Ca(2+)) in brain slices loaded with sulforhodamine 101 (red color; specific for astrocytes) that were prepared from transgenic mice in which some neurons expressed green fluorescent protein.",
