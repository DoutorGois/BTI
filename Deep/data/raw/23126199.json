     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regulating effect of Ginkgo biloba extract 50 (GBE50) on pre-inflammatory factors interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and anti-inflammatory factors interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-10 (IL-10) of hippocampus in senile rats, in order to explore the protective mechanism of GBE50 on central nervous system of senile animals. METHOD: SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: the normal group, the model group, the GBE50 group and the EGB761 group. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with 100 mg x kg(-1) D-galactose every day for 42 days to establish the senile rat model. At the 21st day, the GBE50 group and the EGB761 group were orally administered with 60 mg x kg(-1) for 21 days. IL-1beta mRNA and TNF-alpha mRNA expressions were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR assay, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha protein expressions were detected by immunohistochemistry, IL-4 and IL-10 protein contents were detected by ELISA. RESULT: D-galactose caused imbalance between pre-inflammatory factors and anti-inflammatory factors of hippocampus in senile rats, GBE50 and EGB761 reduced IL-1beta mRNA expression (P < 0.05) and TNF-alpha and IL-1beta protein level (P < 0.01) and up-regulated IL-10 protein content (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The mechanism of GBE50 in protecting central nervous system is probably related to its effect in mitigating inflammatory of central nervous system.",
