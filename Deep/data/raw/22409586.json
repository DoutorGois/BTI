     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Inflammation in brain plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment. Anti-inflammatory therapy may thus constitute a novel approach for associated cognitive dysfunction. The present study investigated the effects of parecoxib in the prevention of cognitive impairments induced by sevoflurane in aged rats. METHODS: Sixty-six aged rats were divided randomly into three groups: control group (n = 22, sham anesthesia), sevoflurane group (n = 22, received 2% sevoflurane for 5 h) and parecoxib group (n = 22, received intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg parecoxib and then exposed to 2% sevoflurane for 5 h). Spatial learning performance was tested by Morris water maze. The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 protein and ultrastructure of synapse in hippocampus were measured. RESULTS: Sevoflurane anesthesia impaired the spatial learning and memory in aged rats. Compared with sevoflurane group, parecoxib group showed shorter escape latency and more number of crossings over the previous platform area. Furthermore, parecoxib treatment also significantly prevented the synaptic changes induced by sevoflurane. CONCLUSION: Parecoxib mitigates spatial memory impairment induced by sevoflurane anesthesia in aged rats. The synaptic morphometry change may be one of the mechanisms involved in learning and memory deficit.",
