     "AB": "The effects of lesions of the limbic-hypothalamic structures on the pyruvate metabolic responses to daily repeated cold exposures in the liver of rabbits have been investigated. The experimental results were as follows: The metabolic pattern of pyruvate and the pyruvate metabolic responses to the 1st cold exposure (cold exposure on the 1st day) were altered by lesions of periventricular arcuate nucleus (ARC), ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), stria terminalis (ST) and dorsal fornix (FX). The pyruvate metabolic responses to cold exposure were completely abolished by seven times repetition of daily cold exposures in rabbits with lesions of ARC, VMH and FX, as well as in each sham-operated group. In rabbits with ST lesions, the pyruvate metabolic responses to cold exposure remained even after the seven times repetition of daily cold exposures. From these results, it might be suggested that the ARC, VMH, amygdala (AMYG)-ST system and dorsal hippocampus (HPC)-FX system played a certain role in the metabolic regulation of pyruvate and in the mechanisms of pyruvate metabolic responses to the 1st cold exposure, but that only the AMYG-ST system participated in the process of pyruvate metabolic adaptation to daily repeated cold exposures.",
