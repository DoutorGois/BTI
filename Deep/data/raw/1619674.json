     "AB": "The present study evaluated the effect of the nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid U74006F, an inhibitor of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, on the development of regional cerebral edema after lateral fluid-percussion (FP) brain injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 40) were anesthetized and subjected to FP brain injury of moderate severity centered over the left parietal cortex (2.5-2.6 atms). Fifteen minutes after brain injury, animals randomly received an i.v. bolus of either U74006F (3 mg/kg, n = 21) followed by a second bolus (3 mg/kg) at 3 hr or buffered sodium citrate vehicle (equal volume, n = 15). An additional group of 12 surgically prepared but uninjured animals served as preinjury controls. At 48 hr after injury, animals were sacrificed and brain tissue assayed for water content and regional cation concentrations. With the use of specific gravimetric techniques, no significant differences were observed in posttraumatic cerebral edema between drug- and control-treated animals. However, using wet weight/dry weight methodology, we found that administration of U74006F significantly reduced water content in the right hippocampus (contralateral to the site of injury) compared to saline-treated animals (p less than 0.05). U74006F also significantly prevented the postinjury increase in sodium concentrations in the ipsilateral hippocampus (p less than 0.05) and thalamus (p less than 0.03). Regional concentrations of potassium were unaltered after drug treatment. Administration of U74006F significantly reduced postinjury mortality, from 28% in control animals to zero in treated animals (p = 0.01). These results suggest that lipid peroxidation may be involved in the pathophysiological sequelae of brain injury and that 21-aminosteroids may be beneficial in the treatment of brain injury.",
