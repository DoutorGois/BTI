     "AB": "Loss of intraventricular fluid melatonin explains why Alzheimer's disease neuropathology has a laminar, regional and neural-system-specific pattern, which includes the entorhinal cortex, CA1 of the hippocampus, the dorsal raphe nucleus and the locus ceruleus. High metabolic activity may be part of the neuronal vulnerability. Without elevated levels of ventricular fluid melatonin, the hydroxyl radical damages the mitochondria of the most active neurons, causing apoptosis, with resultant failure of the memory system. General brain atrophy follows in the absence of new memory formation.",
