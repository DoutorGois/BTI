     "AB": "We tested the effects of dehydroevodiamine.Cl (DHED) on field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked by the electrical stimulation of Schaffer collaterals-commissural fibres in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. Bath applications of 10 microM DHED for 20 or 40 min induced long-lasting facilitation of fEPSPs, which outlasted the presence of DHED. A 10 min treatment with a higher concentration (100 microM) also induced long-lasting facilitation. The long-lasting facilitation was blocked either by 10 microM atropine, the muscarinic receptor antagonist, or by 50 microM D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5), an NMDA receptor antagonist. These results show that DHED produces long-lasting facilitation of synaptic transmission, and that this facilitation depends upon the activation of both the muscarinic and NMDA receptors.",
