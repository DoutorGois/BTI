     "AB": "Male albino rats were exposed to daily emotional painful stress (EPS) for 4 weeks. The arterial blood pressure of the stressed animals increased and the dynamics of the heart rate changed after functional loading (hypokinesis during one or two hours) as compared with the control group. The increase of the heart weight and activation of cytochrome oxidase activity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rats exposed to EPS were also demonstrated. The use of 20% ethyl alcohol instead of drinking water during EPS partially prevented vegetative disturbances and activation of hippocampal cytochrome oxidase and fully prevented the heart hypertrophy and activation of the enzyme in the cortex. Alcoholization resulted in the increased weight of the spleen and brown adipose tissue and thymus involution. A possible mechanism of the antistress action of alcohol linked with normalization of intensified lipid peroxidation under stress is discussed.",
