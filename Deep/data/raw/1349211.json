     "AB": "We used tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH) to mark dopaminergic fibers in cerebral tissue from adult persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the PD cases we found a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), severely reduced TH fibers in dopaminergic terminal fields (particularly in the hippocampal perforant pathway) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), that occurred only in the perforant pathway. In contrast, AD cases were characterized by a lack of significant neuron loss in the VTA and by mild loss of TH fibers. A decreased dopaminergic innervation of the perforant pathway in cases of PD appears to be associated with the occurrence of NFT in these structures.",
