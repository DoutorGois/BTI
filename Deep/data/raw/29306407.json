     "AB": "Physio-pathological conditions such as neuroinflammation can modulate neurogenesis in the hippocampus. The aim of this study is to follow the time course of inflammation-induced effects on the neurogenic niche and the counter-effects of an anti-inflammatory drug. Rats received intracerebroventricular injections of lipopolysaccharide/endotoxin (ET) and intraperitoneal injections of 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, then perfused at different time intervals. At day 3, ET injection resulted in thermal hyperalgesia accompanied by a significant decrease in neurogenesis. A rebound of neurogenesis was detected at day 6 and levels were back to basal at day 9. Daily treatment with Piroxicam alleviated the ET-induced effects.",
