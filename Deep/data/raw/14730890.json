     "AB": "AIM: To study mRNA expression alteration of two-pore potassium channels in the brain of beta-amyloid peptide25-35 (beta-AP25-35)-induced memory impaired rats. METHODS: Memory impairments induced in rats by single icv injection of beta-AP25-35 (2 mmol.L-1) 5 microL were assessed in the Morris water maze test. The mRNA expression levels of three two-pore potassium channels TREK-1, TREK-2 and TRAAK were detected in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In the Morris water maze test, the escape latencies of the beta-AP25-35-treated rats were longer than those of the control group in 1st, 2nd and 4th training day, suggesting that the memory of beta-AP25-35-treated rats was obviously impaired. Compared with the control group, the mRNA levels of TREK-1, TREK-2 and TRAAK in the hippocampus of the beta-AP25-35-treated rats were increased by 40.0%, 27.9% and 18.9%, respectively; while no significant change of TREK-1, TREK-2 and TRAAK mRNA levels was observed in the cortex. CONCLUSION: The mRNA expression levels of two-pore potassium channels were increased significantly in the brain of beta-AP25-35-induced memory impaired rats.",
