     "AB": "We have screened a rat genomic library using DNA probes derived from the sequence of a recently cloned canine histamine H2 receptor (Gantz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1991, 88, 429-433). An intronless gene, encoding a 358 amino acid protein displaying all major features of G protein-coupled receptors and a 82% overall homology with the canine histamine H2 receptor, was isolated. Northern blot analysis, performed with a probe derived from the rat sequence, revealed a single approximately 6.0 kb transcript in various rat tissues. In the brain, this transcript is highly expressed in brainstem and, to a lesser extent, cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus. These localizations are consistent with the distribution of the H2 receptor in this species. Among peripheral tissues, the stomach highly expresses the transcript which could not be detected in various other organs. All these features, together with the expression of the cloned gene in mammalian cells (Traiffort et al., submitted), are consistent with the idea that a single rat H2 receptor is encoded by the cloned gene.",
