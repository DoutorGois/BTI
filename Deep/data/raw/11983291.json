     "AB": "Overexpression and abnormal aggregation of a small heat shock protein, B-crystallin, in reactive astrocytes has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors. To investigate the potential involvement of glial activation in stress-induced hippocampal damage, we analyzed B-crystallin gene expression in the hippocampus of immobilized rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to single or repeated immobilization stress. Both single and repeated immobilization markedly increased the level of B-crystallin mRNA in the hippocampus. Repeated immobilization notably accumulated B-crystallin protein, with a substantial portion in the insoluble fraction. Treatment of primary cortical astrocytes with stress-related glucocorticoid resulted in considerable elevation of B-crystallin expression. The accumulation of B-crystallin may serve as one of the important pathogenic mechanisms involved in hippocampal degeneration associated with stress.",
