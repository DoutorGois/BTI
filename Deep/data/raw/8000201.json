     "AB": "Organ perfusion with bloodless solutions is an established clinical method for protecting the heart against ischemic damage. In our study, we evaluated the effects of intraischemic bloodless brain perfusion on postischemic ultrastructural neuronal changes in a model of severe incomplete forebrain ischemia produced by hemorrhagic hypotension combined with temporary carotid occlusion in the rat. Four groups of rats were compared. During an ischemic insult of 30 min, the brains of two groups were perfused via both external carotids with either a normosmolar normothermic magnesium-enriched perfusate (MgSO4, 30 mM; NaCl, 37 mM; mannitol, 180 mM; n = 10) or a normothermic normal saline solution (n = 9) at a rate of 6 ml/h. Two other groups (ischemia without perfusion, n = 8; no ischemia and no perfusion, n = 7) served as controls. After 30 min of ischemia, withdrawn blood for hemorrhagic hypotension was reinfused, the carotid arteries reopened, and the brains reperfused for 2 h. After perfusion-fixation, qualitative and quantitative evaluation of postischemic cell changes of hippocampal CA1 neurons was performed by electron microscopy. Brain perfusion with the magnesium-containing solution significantly protected neurons against ischemic cell changes and provided an ultrastructural pattern similar to that seen in the nonischemic control group. In contrast, brain perfusion with normal saline solution did not result in neuronal protection. We conclude that intraischemic intracarotid brain perfusion with magnesium-enriched perfusate protects hippocampal neurons significantly against ischemic cell changes in the early reperfusion period after transient severe forebrain ischemia.",
