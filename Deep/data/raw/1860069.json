     "AB": "Effects of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) on short-term potentiation (STP) of evoked potential were investigated in Schaffer/commissural-CA1 pyramidal cell synapses of rat hippocampal slices. Perfusion of hEGF (6-60 ng/ml) significantly enhanced the STP induced by shorter tetanus (11 impulses at 100 Hz) in a concentration-dependent manner and the effect resulted in generation of long-term potentiation (LTP). The results suggest that hEGF can activate the mechanisms related to induction of LTP.",
