     "AB": "We demonstrate the expression of the co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP) in the nuclei of a large number of neurons and glial structures in the rat brain and spinal cord. Immunoblotting of nuclear extracts revealed a single band at 265 kDa, the size of CBP. We found that CBP immunoreactivity was localized to cholecystokinin mRNA-expressing neurons in the hippocampus and the thalamus, suggesting that CBP may be involved in long-term memory and modulation of cortical activity. However, CBP-labeling was not ubiquitous, and many brain regions, including several mesencephalic and diencephalic nuclei, showed sparse labeling. Further, the number of neurons displaying intense CBP-labeling varied across animals in some regions, e.g., the hippocampus and the amygdala. Since competition for limited amounts of CBP and CBP-related molecules has been shown to be important for the integration of intracellular signaling pathways with transcriptional regulation, the present results suggest that varying endogenous levels of CBP in post-mitotic neurons is an important parameter in neuronal transcriptional regulation.",
