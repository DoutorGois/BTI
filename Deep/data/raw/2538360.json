     "AB": "By using monoiodinated radioligands of both intact neuropeptide Y (NPY) and of a long C-terminal fragment, NPY13-36, two subtypes of binding sites, which differ in affinity and specificity, have been characterized. The Y1 type of binding site, characterized on a human neuroblastoma cell line, MC-IXC, and a rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC-12, binds NPY with a dissociation constant (Kd) of a few nanomolar but does not bind NPY13-36. The Y2 type of binding site, characterized on porcine hippocampal membranes and on another human neuroblastoma cell line, SMS-MSN, is of higher affinity and binds both NPY and NPY13-36. None of the binding sites distinguish between NPY and the homologous peptide YY (PYY). It is concluded that NPY/PYY-binding sites occur in two subtypes which may represent two types of physiological receptors.",
