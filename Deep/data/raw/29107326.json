     "AB": "Neuropathic pain manifested by a number of sensory symptoms is often accompanied by disorders of higher nervous activity, such as memory impairment, depression, anxiety, anhedonia, etc. This emphasizes the involvement of supraspinal structures including the hippocampus in neuropathic pain pathogenesis. In the present study, we focused on the impact of chronic neuropathic pain on hippocampal neurogenesis and microglial state. In addition, we test the effect of alkyl glycerol ethers on hippocampal neuronal and microglial plasticity as well as behavioral parameters. Neuropathic pain was induced using the model of sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury. We found an impairment of working memory and locomotor activity in animals with neuropathic pain, which was prevented by alkyl glycerol ethers treatment. Sciatic nerve ligation in mice contributed to the decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis intensity. Alkyl glycerol ethers administration significantly reduced this effect. Neuropathic pain-associated neurogenesis reduction was accompanied by an increased percentage of Iba1-labeled area in the CA1 hippocampal region on the 14th and 28th days after surgery. In addition, we observed a decrease in hippocampal pro-inflammatory microglia marker CD86 immunostaining on day 28 after surgery in alkyl glycerol ethers-treated mice with sciatic nerve ligation. These results are consistent with data on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines expression in the hippocampus. Alkyl glycerol ethers administration increased IL-10 and decreased IL-1beta hippocampal expression in animals with neuropathic pain. Taken together, these data suggest that neuropathic pain-behavior in rodents is accompanied by changes in microglia polarization, thereby contributing to neurogenesis impairment and cognitive disturbances. Alkyl glycerol ethers prevented M1 microglial activation, contributing to the maintenance of normal neurogenesis levels within the hippocampus and normalizing working memory.",
