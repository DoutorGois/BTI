     "AB": "The effects of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker pindolol and the calcium antagonist verapamil administered alone or in combination on retention in step-down- and shuttle-box-trained rats and on the biogenic monoamine levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus were examined. The chronic oral treatment with pindolol impaired retention in step-down- and shuttle-box-trained rats, decreasing the dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) levels and increasing the serotonin (5-HT) levels in the cortex and hippocampus. Verapamil did not influence retention in step-down- and shuttle-box avoidance situation and the biogenic monoamine levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. It should, however, be noted that the chronic oral treatment with verapamil completely abolished the retention-impairing effect of pindolol, restoring to normal DA, NA and 5-HT levels. These findings might be of interest to clinical practice and suggest the necessity for using a combination of beta-blockers with Ca2+ antagonists in case of prolonged treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",
