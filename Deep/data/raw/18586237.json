     "AB": "We investigated the mechanism underlying the anxiolytic actions of the neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) with an elevated plus-maze test. In mice, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusions of N/OFQ (0.1 and 0.32 nmol) led to an increase in time spent in the open arms (anxiolytic-like effects). A non-peptidyl N/OFQ receptor (NOP) antagonist, J-113397(1-{(3R,4R)-1-cyclooctylmethyl-3-hydroxymethyl-4-piperidyl}-3-ethyl-1,3-d ihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one), (1.0 and 3.2 mg/kg, s.c.) blocked the increase induced by N/OFQ. On the other hand, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and a GABAA receptor antagonist, (+)-bicuculline, (5.6 mg/kg, i.p.) also inhibited the increase induced by N/OFQ. In rats, microinfusions of N/OFQ (10 and 32 pmol) into the amygdala led to an increase in time spent in the open arms. However, intracranial infusions of N/OFQ (10-100 pmol) into the dorsal hippocampus did not affect the time spent in the open arms. These findings suggest that the anxiolytic-like effects of N/OFQ may be related to the GABA/benzodiazepine system in the amygdala.",
