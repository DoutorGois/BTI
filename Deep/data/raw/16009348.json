     "AB": "Memory formation, maintenance, and retrieval are a dynamic process, reflecting a combined outcome of new memory formation on one hand, and older memory suppression/clearance on the other. Although much knowledge has been gained regarding new memory formation, less is known about the molecular components and processes that serve the function of memory suppression/clearance. Here, we report the identification of a novel protein, termed hippyragranin (HGN), that is expressed in the rat hippocampus and its expression is reduced by hippocampal denervation. Inhibition of HGN by antisense oligonucleotide in area CA1 results in enhanced performance in Morris water maze, as well as elevated long-term potentiation. These results suggest that HGN is involved in negative memory regulation.",
