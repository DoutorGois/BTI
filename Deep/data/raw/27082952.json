     "AB": "The complex etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has limited progression in the identification of effective therapeutic agents. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin1 (PS1) are always overexpressed in AD, and are considered to be the initiators of the formation of betaamyloid plaques and the symptoms of AD. In the present study, a transgenic AD model, constructed via the overexpression of APP and PS1, was used to verify the protective effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on memory performance and synaptic plasticity. AD mice (6monthold) were treated via intraperitoneal injection of 0.110 mg/kg ginsenoside Rg1. Longterm memory, synaptic plasticity, and the levels of ADassociated and synaptic plasticityassociated proteins were measured following treatment. Memory was measured using a fear conditioning task and protein expression levels were investigated using western blotting. All the data was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance or ttest. Following 30 days of consecutive treatment, memory in the AD mouse model was ameliorated in the 10 mg/kg ginsenoside Rg1 treatment group. As demonstrated by biochemical experiments, ginsenoside Rg1 treatment reduced the accumulations of betaamyloid 142 and phosphorylated (p)Tau in the AD model. Additionally, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and pTrkB synaptic plasticityassociated proteins were upregulated following ginsenoside Rg1 application. Correspondingly, longterm potentiation (LTP) was restored following ginsenoside Rg1 application in the AD mice model. Taken together, ginsenoside Rg1 repaired hippocampal LTP and memory, likely through facilitating the clearance of ADassociated proteins and through activation of the BDNFTrkB pathway. Therefore, ginsenoside Rg1 may be a candidate drug for the treatment of AD.",
