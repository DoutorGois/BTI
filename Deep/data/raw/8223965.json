     "AB": "We investigated the postischemic alterations in dopamine D1 receptor and Ca2+/calmodulin independent cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) selective phosphodiesterase in gerbils and examined the effect of pentobarbital on these alterations. [3H]SCH 23390 and [3H]rolipram, respectively, were used to label dopamine D1 receptor and Ca2+/calmodulin independent cyclic-AMP selective phosphodiesterase. Transient cerebral ischemia was induced for 10 min, and pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 30 min prior to ischemia. 5 h after ischemia, [3H]rolipram binding decreased significantly in the striatum and hippocampus, whereas no significant change was found in [3H]SCH 23390 binding. 7 days after ischemia, however, there was a marked reduction in both [3H]SCH 23390 and [3H]rolipram binding in the striatum and hippocampus, where histological neuronal damage was found. Pentobarbital significantly ameliorated postischemic decreases in [3H]rolipram binding both 5 h and 7 days after recirculation in most areas studied. Furthermore, this drug significantly prevented postischemic reduction in [3H]SCH 23390 binding (only) 7 days after ischemia. These results suggest that alteration of cyclic AMP selective phosphodiesterase is more sensitive at an earlier stage after ischemic insult than that of dopamine D1 receptors. Our results also demonstrate that pentobarbital reduces the alteration in [3H]SCH 23390 and [3H]rolipram binding after cerebral ischemia.",
