     "AB": "RATIONALE: Depression associated with obesity remains an interesting area to study the biological mechanisms and novel therapeutic intervention. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigates the effect of a novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist 3-methoxy-N-p-tolylquinoxalin-2-carboxamide (QCM-4) on several pathogenic markers of depression associated with obesity such as plasma insulin resistance, hippocampal cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), serotonin (5-HT) concentrations, hippocampal neuronal damage, and p53 protein expression in high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice. METHODS: Obesity was experimentally induced in mice by feeding with HFD for 14 weeks followed by administration of QCM-4 (1 and 2 mg/kg, p.o.)/standard escitalopram (ESC) (10 mg/kg, p.o.)/vehicle (10 ml/kg, p.o.) for 28 days. Behavioral assays such as sucrose preference test (SPT); forced swim test (FST); elevated plus maze (EPM); biochemical assays including oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), insulin, cAMP, BDNF, and 5-HT concentrations; and molecular assays mainly histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of p53 protein in the dentate gyrus (DG), CA1, and CA3 regions of hippocampus in HFD fed mice were performed. RESULTS: Chronic treatment with QCM-4 in HFD-fed mice reversed the behavioral alterations in SPT, FST, and EPM. QCM-4 showed poor sensitivity for plasma glucose, improved insulin sensitivity, increased hippocampal cAMP, BDNF, and 5-HT concentrations. In the hippocampal DG, CA1, and CA3 regions, QCM-4 treatment improved the neuronal morphology in the histopathology and inhibited p53 protein expression in IHC assay in HFD-fed mice. CONCLUSION: QCM-4 attenuated the depressive-like phenotype in HFD-fed mice by improving behavioral, biochemical, and molecular alterations through serotonergic neuromodulation.",
