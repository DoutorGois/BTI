     "AB": "NMDA receptors play a critical role in neurotransmission and are also involved in the occurrence of excitotoxic nerve cell death. Synthetic halogenated analogs of the endogenous broad spectrum excitatory amino acid receptor blocker kynurenic acid are among the most potent and selective antagonists of the glycine co-agonist site of the NMDA receptor complex. Pharmacological blockade of this site provides neuroprotection in animal models of cerebral ischemia, epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders, and does not appear to be associated with some of the undesirable side effects linked to classic competitive and non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists. Here we demonstrate the neuroprotective quantities of 7-chloro-kynurenic acid (7-Cl-KYNA), one of the most selective and well-studied glycine site antagonists, can be synthesized in the brain from its bioprecursor L-4-chlorokynurenine (4-Cl-KYN). Intracerebral infusion of 4-Cl-KYN dose-dependently reduced quinolinate neurotoxicity in the rat hippocampus after enzymatic conversion to 7-Cl-KYNA by kynurenine aminotransferase. In accordance with previous studies demonstrating that kynurenine aminotransferase is preferentially localized in astrocytes, both the enzymatic formation of 7-Cl-KYNA and the neuroprotective potency of 4-Cl-KYN were substantially reduced following an intrahippocampal injection of the gliotoxin fluorocitrate. In situ produced 7-Cl-KYNA offers a novel neuroprotective strategy for targeting the glycine/NMDA site while avoiding excessive receptor blockade and reducing the clinical risks associated with conventional NMDA receptor antagonism.",
