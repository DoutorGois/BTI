     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is associated with marked behavior changes, but hallucinations and delusions are rare. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of FTD with early and persistent delusions, including de Clerambault syndrome. DESIGN: We describe the clinical, neuroradiologic, and neuropathologic findings of a 76-year-old woman with an 11-year course of FTD with bizarre delusions and hallucinations. RESULTS: The patient's autopsy examination of the brain revealed pathology consistent with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive and transactive response (TAR)-DNA-binding protein-43-positive inclusions and hippocampal sclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: Delusions and hallucinations can occur in proven frontotemporal pathology.",
