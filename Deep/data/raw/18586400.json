     "AB": "The atypical serine/threonine protein kinase, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), is believed to be essential to the regulation of cell growth and the functions of the central nervous system. By using calcium imaging and patch-clamping techniques to study the role of this signaling pathway in the activity of cultured hippocampal neurons, we found that rapamycin significantly reduces the spontaneous activities of network neurons as well as the efficacy of synaptic transmission through insulin-mTOR signaling pathway. Our study sheds light on understanding the role of mTOR signaling pathway in controlling the information processing of network neurons.",
