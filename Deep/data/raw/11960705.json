     "AB": "The TRIM family members are defined by the presence of the tripartite motif (RING, B-box and coiled-coil domains or RBCC). They have been implicated in a variety of processes, such as regulation of development and oncogenesis. We report the expression analysis of a member of this family, TRIM9. Its expression is mainly confined to the central nervous system. The developing neocortex, the dorsal thalamus, the midbrain, the basal area of the hindbrain and spinal cord show high level of expression during embryogenesis. In adult brain, TRIM9 is detected in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, in the hippocampus, and in the cortex.",
