     "AB": "Excessive Abeta deposition in the brain is associated with the formation of senile plaques, and their diffuse distribution is related to Alzheimer's disease. Thirty rats (EG) were irradiated with light-emitting diode (photobiomodulation (PBM)) in the frontal region of the skull after being inoculated with the Abeta toxin in the hippocampus; 30 rats were used as the control group (CG). The analysis was conducted at 7, 14, and 21 days after irradiation. We observed a decreased in Abeta deposits in treated animals compared with animals in the CG. The behavioral and motor assessment revealed that the EG group covered a larger ground distance and explored the open field than the CG group on days 14 and 21 (p < 0.05). The EG group was statistically significant in the spatial memory test compared to the CG group on day 14. The use of PBM significantly reduced the presence of Abeta plaques and improved spatial memory and behavioral and motor skills in treated animals on day 21.",
