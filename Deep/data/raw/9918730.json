     "AB": "In an effort to examine the functional neuroanatomy of semantic memory, we studied the relative cerebral blood flow of eight healthy young subjects using 15O-water positron emission tomography (PET). Relative to a visual baseline control condition, each of four visual matching-to-sample tasks activated components of the ventral visual processing stream, including the inferior occipital and temporal cortices. Contrasting the task with the highest semantic component, a variation on the Pyramids and Palm Trees paradigm, with a size discrimination task resulted in focal activation in the anterior inferior temporal lobe, focused in the parahippocampal gyrus. There was additional activation in BA47 of the inferior frontal cortex. These data replicate and extend previously reported results using similar paradigms, and are consistent with cognitive neuropsychological models that stress the executive role of BA47 in semantic processing tasks.",
