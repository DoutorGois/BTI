     "AB": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is effective in reducing axonal damage associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI), and has immunomodulatory properties. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an important mediator of the innate immune response. It significantly contributes to neuroinflammation induced by brain injury. However, it remains unknown whether exogenous PACAP can modulate TBI through the TLR4/adapter protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. In this study, we investigated the potential neuroprotective mechanisms of PACAP pretreatment in a weight-drop model of TBI. PACAP38 was microinjected intracerebroventricularly before TBI. Brain samples were extracted from the pericontusional area in the cortex and hippocampus. We found that TBI induced significant upregulation of TLR4, with peak expression occurring 24 h post-trauma, and that pretreatment with PACAP significantly improved motor and cognitive dysfunction, attenuated neuronal apoptosis, and decreased brain edema. Pretreatment with PACAP inhibited upregulation of TLR4 and its downstream signaling molecules MyD88, p-IkappaB, and NF-kappaB, and suppressed increases in the levels of the downstream inflammatory agents interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), in the brain tissue around the injured cortex and in the hippocampus. Administration of PACAP both in vitro and in vivo attenuated the ability of the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to increase TLR4 protein levels. Therefore, PACAP exerts a neuroprotective effect in this rat model of TBI, by inhibiting a secondary inflammatory response mediated by the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling pathway in microglia and neurons, thereby reducing neuronal death and improving the outcome following TBI.",
