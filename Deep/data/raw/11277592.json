     "AB": "We have identified a novel splice variant of the metabotropic GABA(B) receptor (R) subunit I, designated GABA(B)R1f, from a rat hippocampus cDNA library screen. GABA(B)R1f shares sequence homology with rat GABA(B)R1a, with the exception of an in-frame deletion of exon 4, resulting in a 21 bp deletion in the coding sequence of the N-terminal extracellular domain. In addition, GABA(B)R1f also contains a 93 bp in-frame insertion in a region of the sequence corresponding to the second extracellular loop and the fifth transmembrane domain, similar to that found in rat GABA(B)R1c. While being ubiquitously (but variably) expressed, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the GABA(B)R1f isoform to be most prevalent in peripheral vs central tissues, suggesting a potential role for this novel isoform in either the mediation of inhibitory transmission in these various tissues, or in as yet defined actions unrelated to central synaptic regulatory mechanisms attributable to GABA(B)R.",
