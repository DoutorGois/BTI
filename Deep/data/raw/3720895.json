     "AB": "A combined electrophysiological and neurochemical study was performed on the CA1 area of hippocampal slices in an attempt to identify changes in presynaptic nerve terminal function in long-term potentiation (LTP). After controlled induction of LTP in CA1, the activated region was subjected to subcellular fractionation followed by 45Ca2+ uptake determinations. Synaptosomes prepared from slices in which LTP has been induced showed a faster risetime and a higher level of saturation for K+-induced Ca-uptake than those derived from unstimulated and stimulated control slices. These findings point to a participation of presynaptic terminals in long-term potentiation.",
