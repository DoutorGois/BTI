     "AB": "The distribution of the VIP receptor in the human hippocampus was studied by receptor autoradiography using [3-iodotyrosyl-125I]Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) as a ligand, and the relationship of receptor distribution to the distribution of the peptide (visualized by immunocytochemistry) was examined in hippocampi surgically removed from patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and hippocampi obtained at autopsy from neurologically normal subjects. In the autopsy hippocampi and hippocampi from TLE patients with extrahippocampal temporal lobe lesions [125I]VIP binding was highest in the dentate molecular layer, with lower levels in the fields of Ammon's Horn (CA fields) and the subiculum. In hippocampi from patients with no temporal lobe lesions but considerable hippocampal neuronal loss there were significant elevations in the levels of ligand binding in all CA fields and the subiculum. Ligand binding densities in all CA fields of the patient hippocampi were strongly negatively correlated with neuronal numbers. Immunocytochemical localization of VIP shows no obvious change in the distribution patters of VIP immunoreactivity in the patient groups. This is the first demonstration of VIP and its receptor distribution in the human hippocampus. It is suggested that the elevated levels of receptor binding in the hippocampal seizure focus may indicate a mechanism for greater excitability of neurons and/or for their survivability in the face of the increased excitation and potential for injury in a seizure focus.",
