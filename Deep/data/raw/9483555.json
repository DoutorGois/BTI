     "AB": "Long-term depression, depotentiation and long-term potentiation of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the CA1 field of the hippocampus were studied in slices from two-, 12-, 24- and 36-week-old rats. Long-term potentiation was induced by stimulating afferent fibres for 1 s at 100 Hz. Long-term depression was induced either by stimulating the afferent pathways twice for 15 min at 1 Hz (protocol 1), giving in total 1800 pulses, or by stimulating the fibres at 5 min intervals twice at 1 Hz for 5 min followed by 5 min stimulation at 5 Hz (protocol 2), giving in total 2100 pulses. We found significant long-term depression in slices of all groups stimulated with protocol 1; however, the magnitude of long-term depression in slices from 24- and 36-week-old rats was significantly lower than that in slices from two- and 12-week old rats, although there was no such difference in the magnitude of long-term potentiation between slices. Stimulation protocol 2 induced long-term depression only in slices from two- and 12-week-old rats. Comparison of the dynamic range of transmission plasticity in slices from two- and 36-week-old rats, calculated as the difference between the nearly saturated long-term potentiation and nearly saturated depotentiation, revealed a significantly smaller dynamic range in slices from 36-week-old rats in comparison with slices from two-week-old animals. The decrease in the dynamic range in slices from 36-week-old rats was due to a diminished capacity to depotentiate the nearly saturated long-term potentiation and not due to a decreased long-term potentiation expression in these slices. In contrast to long-term depression, in which the slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials consistently and significantly decreased below the baseline level, the nearly saturated depotentiation did not decrease below the original, pre-long potentiation baseline level. The results demonstrate that increasing age reduces expression of long-term depression and the dynamic range of transmission plasticity.",
