     "AB": "Accumulating evidence suggests that anti-inflammatory agents and antioxidants have neuroprotective properties and may be beneficial in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, the possible neuroprotective properties of tolmetin and sulindac were investigated using quinolinic acid (QA)-induced neurotoxicity as well as behavioral studies. QA, a metabolite of the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway, significantly induces lipid peroxidation, superoxide anion generation and decreases cell viability in primary hippocampal neurons established from one day old rat pups. However, co-incubation of the neurons with tolmetin or sulindac markedly reduces oxidative stress and enhances cell viability. Animals were trained in a Morris water maze for four consecutive days and thereafter received 0.6 micromol of QA intrahippocampally. The animals were divided into groups and were treated with either tolmetin or sulindac (5 mg/kg twice a day for five days). During test trials, the time taken for each rat to find the submerged platform was recorded over a period of two weeks. Animals were thereafter sacrificed and the hippocampi analyzed for protein carbonyl and glutathione content. The results show that both sulindac and tolmetin reduce the QA-induced spatial memory deficit and sulindac treated animals respond better in the water maze compared to the tolmetin treated animals. Both agents also reduce protein oxidation in rat hippocampus and attenuate the decrease in hippocampal glutathione content induced by QA. This study indicates that the antioxidant properties of tolmetin and sulindac may be beneficial in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.",
