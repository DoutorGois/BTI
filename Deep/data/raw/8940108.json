     "AB": "Cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (Il-1) are produced in the brain during development and during inflammatory processes that result from lesions or disease. One function of Il-1 in the brain appears to be the stimulation of astrocytes to proliferate and produce a variety of cytokines and trophic factors, including nerve growth factor. The mechanisms by which Il-1 exerts its actions on astrocytes remain poorly defined. We present evidence that this cytokine elicits activation of the NFkappaB transcription factor and that this transcription factor mediates effects of Il-1 on nerve growth factor mRNA expression. Elucidation of the processes by which cytokines activate astrocytes and influence trophic factor expression may provide insight into mechanisms governing inflammatory processes within the central nervous system.",
