     "AB": "The norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) contents were measured radioenzymatically in seven anatomically defined regions (frontal cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons-medulla oblongata, cerebellum and spinal cord) in adult normal animals, after treatment with the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA), and after the intraventricular administration of either 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT). The effects of p-CPA seemed not restricted to 5-HT, since reductions in catecholamine (CA) content were detected in several regions. After 5,7-DHT given under desimipramine (DMI) protection, comparable reductions in 5-HT levels were obtained but the changes in CA were less severe than after p-CPA. The neurotoxin 6-OHDA decreased the CA in all regions but also 5-HT content in hippocampus, hypothalamus and pons-medulla. The significance and the interpretation of these changes are discussed in relation to the specificity of the drugs employed, together with an assessment of the local monoamine turnover and the possible functional effects of monoamine interactions in the CNS.",
