     "AB": "The presence of GABA(A)-receptors on astrocytes was studied in explant and primary cultures of rat cerebellum, hippocampus and spinal cord by means of immunohistochemistry. For these studies we have used the monoclonal antibody bd 17 against the beta2- and beta3-subunits of GABA(A)-receptor. In explant cultures many neurones were intensely stained with the GABA(A)-receptor antibody whereas adjacent astrocytes revealed little or no immunoreactivity. In the far outgrowth zone of explant culture, however, many immunostained astrocytes were observed. In primary astrocyte cultures, only a few cells were stained by the antibody. Astrocytes which became reactive after producing an artificial scar or after addition of certain compounds such as dibutyryl cyclic AMP, interleukin-6, basic fibroblast growth factor and kainic acid, also revealed GABA(A)-receptor immunoreactivity. Furthermore, these astrocytes were intensely stained for glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin. From our studies we conclude that only a sub-population of normal astrocytes are immunopositive for the GABA(A)-receptor antibody whereas astrocytes which become reactive following injury of the tissue or after addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP, the cytokine interleukin-6, fibroblast growth factor or the neurotoxin kainic acid express GABA(A)-sites.",
