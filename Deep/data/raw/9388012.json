     "AB": "Estrogen plays a profound role in regulating the structure and function of many neuronal systems in the adult rat brain. The actions of estrogen were thought to be mediated by a single nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) until the recent cloning of a novel ER (ER-beta). To ascertain which ER is involved in the regulation of different brain regions, the present study compared the distribution of the classical (ER-alpha) and novel (ER-beta) forms of ER mRNA-expressing neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) of the rat with in situ hybridization histochemistry. Female rat brain, spinal cord, and eyes were frozen, and cryostat sections were collected on slides, hybridized with [35S]-labeled antisense riboprobes complimentary to ER-alpha or ER-beta mRNA, stringently washed, and opposed to emulsion. The results of these studies revealed the presence of ER-alpha and ER-beta mRNA throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the brain and spinal cord. Neurons of the olfactory bulb, supraoptic, paraventricular, suprachiasmatic, and tuberal hypothalamic nuclei, zona incerta, ventral tegmental area, cerebellum (Purkinje cells), laminae III-V, VIII, and IX of the spinal cord, and pineal gland contained exclusively ER-beta mRNA. In contrast, only ER-alpha hybridization signal was seen in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and subfornical organ. Perikarya in other brain regions, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial and cortical amygdaloid nuclei, preoptic area, lateral habenula, periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, locus ceruleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus and superficial laminae of the spinal cord, contained both forms of ER mRNA. Although the cerebral cortex and hippocampus contained both ER mRNAs, the hybridization signal for ER-alpha mRNA was very weak compared with ER-beta mRNA. The results of these in situ hybridization studies provide detailed information about the distribution of ER-alpha and ER-beta mRNAs in the rat CNS. In addition, this comparative study provides evidence that the region-specific expression of ER-alpha, ER-beta, or both may be important in determining the physiological responses of neuronal populations to estrogen action.",
