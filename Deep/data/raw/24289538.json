This study explored the mechanisms underlying the antiamnesic effect of SV in AD using behavior tests, histological examination, western blot analysis, and electrophysiological recording technique in AD model mice created by intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v.) of Abeta25-35 . RESULTS: Chronic administration of SV (40 mg/kg/day) for 11 days after Abeta25-35 -injection ameliorated the impairment of acquisition performance and probe trail test in Morris water maze task and alternation behavior in Y maze task in Abeta25-35 -mice. Abeta25-35 -induced apoptosis of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and Abeta25-35 -impaired high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) induction in hippocampal Schaffer collaterale-CA1 synapse were rescued by SV-treatment. SV prevented Abeta25-35 -inhibited protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal-related kinase-2 (ERK2) phosphorylation, which was sensitive to alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) antagonist MLA. SV-induced neuroprotection was attenuated by MLA or phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) antagonist LY294002. SV-rescued LTP induction was blocked by alpha7nAChR, PI3K or MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) antagonist. Finally, the antiamnesia of SV in Abeta25-35 -mice was attenuated by blockage of SV-induced neuroprotection or SV-rescued LTP induction. CONCLUSION: The antiamnesia of SV in Abeta25-35 -mice depends on its neuroprotection and synaptic plasticity improvement.",
