     "AB": "Early microglial reaction following mild ischemic injury caused by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion has been investigated in rats. The ischemic insults lasted for 10, 15 and 20 min without recirculation, and with several reperfusion intervals from 1 h to 3 days. The resting and activated microglial cells were visualized with immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies raised against the CR3 complement receptor, the MHC class I and class II antigens, the macrophage common antigen and with Bandeiiraea simplicifolia lectin-histochemistry. The neuroprotective effect of hypothermia on the early microglial activation was also studied. Ten minutes bilateral common carotid artery occlusion in hypothermic rats without reperfusion caused a mild microglial reaction in the hippocampus. Strong reaction was seen following 20 min insult without reperfusion. Ischemia followed by recirculation caused milder reaction than without reperfusion. Our results suggest that the microglial cells are very sensitive indicators of a mild, transient ischemic insult that does not result in neuronal cell death.",
