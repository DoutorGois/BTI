     "AB": "Lactation is a temporary but complex physiological condition in which hormones and neurogenic stimulation from suckling cause maternal brain plasticity. It has been shown that lactation prevents cell damage induced by excitotoxicity in the dorsal hippocampus of the dam after peripheral administration of kainic acid (KA). The aim of this study was to determine whether lactation protects the maternal hippocampus against damage induced by intracerebral application (ICV) of KA and if lactation decreases, or only delays, this damaging effect of KA. Cell damage was assessed by Fluoro-Jade C staining in the hippocampus of virgin and lactating rats 24 or 72 h after ICV KA. Lactation prevented cell damage of the pyramidal layers of the hippocampus (CA1, CA3, and CA4), as compared to virgin rats. The longer period of KA exposure increased the difference in cell damage between these two conditions. The present results confirm that lactation is a natural model for neuroprotection, since it effectively prevents acute and chronic cell damage of the hippocampus induced by exposure to KA.",
