     "AB": "Neuromedin S (NMS) has been found to be involved in the regulation of the reproductive, endocrine, and immune systems in mammals. However, its function in pigs is currently not well understood. Thus, it is essential and important to characterize the central distribution of NMS mRNA and its receptor, neuromedin U receptor-2 (NMU2R), in pigs for clarifying its physiological functions. In this study, we found that NMS mRNA were densely distributed in the hypothalamus, hypophysis, hippocampus, and brain stem of pigs by in situ hybridization. Moreover, NMS and NMU2R mRNAs was also expressed in the alimentary organs, endocrine and lymphatic organs, and ovaries by semi-Q RT-PCR. All these results suggest that the NMS/NMU2R system plays an important role in modulating various physiological functions in pigs. This research provides useful information for predicting the physiological functions of the NMS/NMU2R system in pigs.",
