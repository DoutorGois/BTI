After intraventricular injection of L-[3H]-leucine the most pronounced increase in relative specific activity was found for several soluble acidic protein-band complexes as well as for solubilized slow-migrating non-myelin proteins obtained from hippocampus of trained animals over the data obtained for active and passive controls.",
