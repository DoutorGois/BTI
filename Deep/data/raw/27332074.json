     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence demonstrates that oxidative stress and inflammatory are involved in amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced memory impairments. Ursolic acid (UA), a triterpenoid compound, has potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, it remains unclear whether UA attenuates Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. METHOD: The aggregated Abeta25-35 was intracerebroventricularly administered to mice. RESULTS: We found that UA significantly reversed the Abeta25-35-induced learning and memory deficits. Our results indicated that one of the potential mechanisms of the neuroprotective effect was attenuating the Abeta25-35-induced accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and depletion of glutathione (GSH) in the hippocampus. Furthermore, UA significantly suppressed the upregulation of IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis-alpha factor levels in the hippocampus of Abeta25-35-treated mice. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that UA prevents memory impairment through amelioration of oxidative stress, inflammatory response and may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",
