     "AB": "Concentrations of the norepinephrine (NE) glycol metabolites MHPG (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol) and DHPG (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol) were examined in 13 brain regions of amygdala-kindled and yoked control rats. The subjects were killed 2 months after the kindled rats had exhibited their sixth 'stage 4-5' generalized seizure. In experiment 1, small but statistically significant decreases in total MHPG levels were found in the right hippocampus (91.6% of control) and hypothalamus (90.7% of control). When the study was repeated with 2 additional control groups, non-kindled, electrically stimulated controls and maximal electroshock convulsion controls, however, these small changes were not seen. The data suggest that since amygdala kindling does not produce any consistent, long-lasting alterations in brain regional NE glycol metabolite levels, there are no consistent, long-term changes in central NE neuronal activity.",
