     "AB": "The changes in ganglioside composition and metabolism of deafferentiated rat hippocampus were estimated after septal lesion. A significant decrease in total ganglioside concentration was found 7 days after the lesion. The reduced level of total gangliosides persisted at 17 and 25 days. Relative increase in the proportion of GD1b and GX (O-acetylated GT1b) and decrease in GM1 were found in hippocampus only at 25 days post-lesion. The incorporation of 3H-N-acetylmannoseamine into gangliosides was examined in rats whose hippocampi were lesioned 25 days prior to radioprecursor injection. Differences in the labeling pattern of total and individual gangliosides were found. Increases in the label in GM1, GD3, and GD1a and decreases in GT1b and GQ1b were found 10 hr after isotope injection. However, decreases in the specific activity of all gangliosides except GT1b and GQ1b were observed 24 hr after 3H-N-acetylomannosamine injection, suggesting the activated turnover of gangliosides in postlesioned hippocampus. The significance of these changes has been discussed in terms of cellular damage and repair in the hippocampal tissue.",
