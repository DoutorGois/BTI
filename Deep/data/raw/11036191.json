     "AB": "Dendrotoxins, important pharmacological tools for studying K(+) channels, are potently convulsant in the central nervous system and evidence suggests that different members of the dendrotoxin family may act at pre- or post-synaptic sites. Using a combination of intrahippocampal infusion, microdialysis and electroencephalograph (EEG) recording, we have compared the effects of alpha-dendrotoxin and dendrotoxin K on extracellular levels of excitatory amino acids in anaesthetised rats. Our findings show that although infusion of 35 pmol of both peptides was associated with elevated extracellular aspartate and glutamate, these increased levels were more sustained with dendrotoxin K. Furthermore, there was EEG evidence of an associated transient functional change consistent with an action on pre-synaptic K(+) channels. In contrast, infusion of alpha-dendrotoxin produced only a brief effect on amino acid levels and no evidence of a functional consequence.",
