     "AB": "One of the major phenomena related to the stress response is the activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. This axis consists of corticotropin releasing factor-41 in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), which in response to a variety of stimuli is released into the portal circulation and stimulates pituitary ACTH secretion and subsequently adrenocortical discharge. The mechanisms involved in the activation are not uniform and the responses to various stimuli are mediated by different neural pathways. Since extrahypothalamic limbic structures play a significant role in the HPA function, it is the purpose of this review to describe the neural pathways between the hippocampus, septum and amygdala and the hypothalamus in relation to adrenocortical activity and the differential role of the medial forebrain bundle as well as the effects of various hypothalamic deafferentation on the transmission of the neural impulses to the hypothalamus. Also, the importance of norepinephrine and serotonin in the activation of the HPA axis will be delineated.",
