     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The GluN2B subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) modulates many physiological processes including learning, memory, and pain. Excessive increase in NMDAr/GluN2B activity has been associated with various disorders such neuropathic pain and neuronal death following hypoxia. Thus there is an interest in identifying NMDAr antagonists that interact specifically with the GluN2B subunit. Recently based on structural analysis between the GluN2B subunit and conantokin-G, a toxin that interacts selectively with the GluN2B subunit, we designed various peptides that are predicted to act as NMDAr antagonists by interacting with the GluN2B subunit. In this study we tested this prediction for two of these peptides EAR16 and EAR18. RESULTS: The effects of EAR16 and EAR18 in NMDA-evoked currents were measured in cultured rat embryonic hippocampal neurons and in HEK-293 cells expressing recombinant NMDAr comprised of GluN1a-GluN2A or GluN1a-GluN2B subunits. In hippocampal neurons, EAR16 and EAR18 reduced the NMDA-evoked calcium currents in a dose-dependent and reversible manner with comparable IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) values of 241 and 176 microM, respectively. At 500 microM, EAR16 blocked more strongly the NMDA-evoked currents mediated by the GluN1a-GluN2B (84%) than those mediated by the GluN1a-GluN2A (50%) subunits. At 500 microM, EAR18 blocked to a similar extent the NMDA-evoked currents mediated by the GluN1a-GluN2B (62%) and the GluN1a-GluN2A (55%) subunits. CONCLUSIONS: The newly designed EAR16 and EAR18 peptides were shown to block in reversible manner NMDA-evoked currents, and EAR16 showed a stronger selectivity for GluN2B than for GluN2A.",
