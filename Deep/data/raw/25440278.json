     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Children with congenital heart disease are often operated at a very young age. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has become indispensable for these sometimes very complex operations, but one cannot neglect a possible negative impact of CPB on organ function. Traditionally, CPB was developed with non-pulsatile flow but there are clinical observations that pulsatile flow might be superior with improved patient outcomes. Therefore, we attempted to elucidate whether CPB with pulsatile flow preserves organ integrity compared with nonpulsatile flow. METHODS: We studied 27 piglets of 4 weeks age and divided them into 3 experimental groups: control group (no CPB); non-pulsatile and pulsatile-CBP with 90-minutes CPB and 120-minutes recovery and reperfusion. Thereafter, histology of kidney, liver, and hippocampus was performed. Moreover, we measured adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content in these organs. RESULTS: Histologic evaluation revealed that laminar flow produced significant cellular edema in the kidney and hippocampus. Additionally, markers for hypoxia, apoptosis, and nitrosative stress were elevated but predominately in the hippocampus and proximal tubules of the kidney. Most of these alterations were reduced to or near control levels with pulsatile CPB. Moreover, ATP content of all 3 organs examined was higher and kidney and liver enzymes were lower in the pulsatile group compared with the non-pulsatile CPB. With regard to histologic changes, the liver seemed to be a less sensitive organ. CONCLUSIONS: In our study during pulsatile CPB, organ damage was significantly attenuated as compared with non-pulsatile CPB. Therefore, in pediatric patients pulsatile CPB may improve clinical outcomes.",
