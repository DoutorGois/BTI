     "AB": "Intracellular recordings were made from dentate and CA1 pyramidal cells of the mouse hippocampal slice preparation. N-methyl-DL-aspartate (NMDLA), quisqualate and kainate and the anaesthetic agent, ketamine, were applied by microelectrophoresis. Excitation by NMDLA but not by the other amino acids, was associated with increased outward rectification. Ketamine had no effect on the resting potential or current/voltage relation of the cells, but selectively antagonised the responses to NMDLA. Action potentials evoked by NMDLA were characteristically broader than those evoked by the other amino acids or by the passage of depolarising current through the electrode.",
