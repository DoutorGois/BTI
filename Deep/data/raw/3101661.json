     "AB": "The experiments examined the contributions of forebrain noradrenaline and environmental enrichment to recovery of place navigation ability in rats after hemidecortication in infancy or adulthood. Noradrenaline depletion did not affect recovery from neonatal hemidecortication, although the early hemidecortications did allow sparing of function relative to adult operates. Noradrenaline depletion also failed to attenuate the positive effects of enriched housing on otherwise normal rats. Noradrenaline depletion did retard recovery of adult hemidecorticate rats housed in standard laboratory cages, but it did not retard recovery of adult hemidecorticate rats housed in enriched environments. The results suggest that noradrenaline is importantly involved in enhancing recovery from brain damage when other sources of compensation (e.g., neonatal injury, enriched environment) are absent.",
