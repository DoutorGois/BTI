     "AB": "Severe stress potentiates methamphetamine (MA) neurotoxicity. However, whether moderate stress increases or decreases the neurotoxic effects of MA is unknown. We assessed the effects of MA (4 x 10 mg/kg at 2 h intervals) in combination with prior barren-cage housing in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats on monoamines and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) in one cohort and spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze in another cohort. MA reduced dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens, 5-HT in the hippocampus, and increased GFAP in neostriatum and nucleus accumbens compared with saline controls. In neostriatum, barren-cage housing protected against MA-induced increases in GFAP, but it did not prevent DA and 5-HT reductions, although it did increase hippocampal norepinephrine. MA impaired spatial learning during acquisition, reversal, and shift phases and impaired reference memory on reversal and shift probe trials. Barren-cage housing enhanced performance during acquisition but not during reversal or shift or on probe trials. The data indicate that prior barren-cage housing moderates MA-induced neostriatal astrogliosis and initial spatial learning, but has no protective effect when the platform is smaller and relocated and therefore requires cognitive flexibility in relearning.",
