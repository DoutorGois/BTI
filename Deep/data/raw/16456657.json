     "AB": "RATIONALE: Schizophrenia patients display an excessive rate of smoking compared to the general population. Nicotine increases acoustic prepulse inhibition (PPI) in animals as well as healthy humans, suggesting that smoking may provide a way of restoring deficient sensorimotor gating in schizophrenia. No previous study has examined the neural mechanisms of the effect of nicotine on PPI in humans. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether nicotine enhances tactile PPI in healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia employing a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design and, if so, what are the neural correlates of nicotine-induced modulation of PPI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In experiment 1, 12 healthy smokers, 12 healthy non-smokers and nine smoking schizophrenia patients underwent testing for tactile PPI on two occasions, 14 days apart, once after receiving (subcutaneously) 12 microg/kg body weight of nicotine and once after receiving saline (placebo). In experiment 2, six healthy subjects and five schizophrenia patients of the original sample (all male smokers) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under the same drug conditions and the same tactile PPI paradigm as in experiment 1. RESULTS: Nicotine enhanced PPI in both groups. A comparison of patterns of brain activation on nicotine vs placebo conditions showed increased activation of limbic regions and striatum in both groups after nicotine administration. Subsequent correlational analyses demonstrated that the PPI-enhancing effect of nicotine was related to increased hippocampal activity in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine enhances tactile PPI in both healthy and schizophrenia groups. Our preliminary fMRI findings reveal that this effect is modulated by increased limbic activity.",
