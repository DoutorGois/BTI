     "AB": "We studied the cognitive performance of rats with colchicine-induced lesions of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) on a range of spatial, non-spatial and mixed spatial/procedural tasks. Rats were assigned to three experimental groups receiving large colchicine lesions (7 microg per hippocampus), small colchicine lesions (1.75 microg per hippocampus) or sham lesions. Stereological estimates of cell density indicated that the colchicine treatments induced dose-dependent damage to the DG, while sparing in large part other hippocampal subfields. Remarkably, the behavioural results showed that the colchicine lesions did not affect the performance of rats in an object discrimination task, in an object-place associative task in which a familiar object was displaced from a given position nor in a spontaneous spatial discrimination task performed in the T-maze. However, rats in both lesion groups were severely impaired in a reinforced non-matching-to-position working memory task conducted in the T-maze. Importantly, performance in the working memory task correlated strongly with cell density in the DG but not with cell density in the CA1 and CA3 areas. Only rats with large-lesions showed a transient deficit in a reinforced rule-based conditional discrimination task. These data demonstrated that rats with selective lesions of the DG readily acquire and retain neural representations relative to objects and places but are specifically impaired in their ability to update rapidly and flexibly spatial information that is essential to guide goal-directed actions.",
