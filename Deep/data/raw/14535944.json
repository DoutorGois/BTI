     "AB": "Previously, we found that amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)1-42 exhibits neurotoxicity, while Abeta1-40 serves as an antioxidant molecule by quenching metal ions and inhibiting metal-mediated oxygen radical generation. Here, we show another neuroprotective action of nonamyloidogenic Abeta1-40 against Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity in culture and in vivo. Neuronal death was induced by Abeta1-42 at concentrations higher than 2 microm, which was prevented by concurrent treatment with Abeta1-40 in a dose-dependent manner. However, metal chelators did not prevent Abeta1-42-induced neuronal death. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that Abeta1-40 inhibited the beta-sheet transformation of Abeta1-42. Thioflavin-T assay and electron microscopy analysis revealed that Abeta1-40 inhibited the fibril formation of Abeta1-42. In contrast, Abeta1-16, Abeta25-35, and Abeta40-1 did not inhibit the fibril formation of Abeta1-42 nor prevent Abeta1-42-induced neuronal death. Abeta1-42 injection into the rat entorhinal cortex (EC) caused the hyperphosphorylation of tau on both sides of EC and hippocampus and increased the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes in the ipsilateral EC, which were prevented by the concurrent injection of Abeta1-40. These results indicate that Abeta1-40 protects neurons from Abeta1-42-induced neuronal damage in vitro and in vivo, not by sequestrating metals, but by inhibiting the beta-sheet transformation and fibril formation of Abeta1-42. Our data suggest a mechanism by which elevated Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio accelerates the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in familial AD.",
