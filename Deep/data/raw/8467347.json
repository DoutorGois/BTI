     "AB": "We have proposed a testable model of the physiological and biochemical events underlying LTP that offers the following novel features. (1) The focus is not on a single mechanism or synaptic site, but rather on the integration and interaction of mechanisms occurring on both sides of the synapse, (2) beta PKC plays a critical presynaptic role in LTP, while gamma PKC functions postsynaptically. (3) These stages can be ordered in a time-delimited sequence of post- then presynaptic molecular events based on the period of effectiveness of inhibitor compounds. (4) The distinction is made between the time when kinase activation occurs and the time when the potentiated response requiring this kinase activation is observed.",
