     "AB": "Interference microscopy was used to measure dry mass of pyramidal neurones of hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas in control and hypothyroid rats aged 14 and 21 days and 2 months. Hypothyrosis was induced in the newborn by intraperitoneal injection of methylthiouracil to the lactating female during the lactation period (for 1 month). Hypothyrosis caused a considerable retardation of the animals' growth. A significant decrease in he concentration of dry substances was detected only in the cytoplasm of Ca1 area neurones in the group of 2-month-old hypothyroid animals. The measurements have demonstrated that hypothyrosis gives rise to pronounced retardation of the neuronal build-up and accumulation of protein products in the cytoplasma of hippocampal pyramidal cells in all the animal groups examined. The size and dry weight of neuronal nuclei of both the hyppocampal areas substantially diminish in the group of 2-month-old hypothyroid animals.",
