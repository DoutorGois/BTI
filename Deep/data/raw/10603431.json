     "AB": "Trimethyltin (TMT) is a neurotoxicant that causes the death of granule cells and degrades highly polysialylated NCAM (PSA-NCAM) in the dentate gyrus. To investigate the role of the tPA-plasmin system in the degradation of PSA-NCAM, we injected trimethyltin (TMT) into mice. As a result, tPA activity was significantly increased in CA1-CA4 and the dentate gyrus after TMT injection. These results suggest that up-regulated tPA may contribute to the degradation of PSA-NCAM.",
