     "AB": "Results of recent studies dedicated to the mechanisms of neurotransmission at a single inhibitory synaptic terminal in cultured neurones support the hypothesis that multiple quanta of neurotransmitter are released during excitation of inhibitory and excitatory central synapses. This is an important consideration as previous less direct measurements have suggested that a synapse can release no more than one quantum. Neurotransmitter release during long stimuli may occur at certain times with maximal probability, keeping the mean inter-release interval constant. This interval is not determined directly by vesicle depletion and moreover, each release event is independent of previous ones. The recent data also suggest that constant Ca(2+) influx is an important determinant of neurotransmitter release. It is speculated that the neurotransmitter release is regulated by a superposition of two processes: a continuous homogeneous process, (i.e. background Ca(2+) influx), and a periodic process that acts as a synchronizing factor of the release at definite moments.",
