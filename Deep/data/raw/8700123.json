     "AB": "Activation of kappa-opioid receptors on mossy fiber terminals in the hippocampus inhibits excitatory amino acid release. The mechanism of presynaptic inhibition at the mossy fiber synapse was investigated through whole-cell voltage-clamp of CA3 pyramidal cells. The application of a kappa-opioid agonist, U69593, reduced the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic current response, and this effect was reversed with a k receptor antagonist. Presynaptic potassium channels were blocked by bath application of channel toxins, and the effect of kappa receptor activation was tested. The inhibition caused by U69593 was blocked by low doses of 4-aminopyridine (30 microM) and the selective peptide toxins dendrotoxin and mast cell degranulating peptide. The inhibition was not blocked by low doses of tetraethylammonium chloride (1 mM), barium, or glibenclamide. Thus, we conclude that presynaptic kappa-opioid receptors are coupled to a Shaker-type voltage-dependent potassium channel that is sensitive to dendrotoxin and mast cell degranulating peptide. An increase in presynaptic potassium conductance would enhance the rate of repolarization after action potential invasion, thereby limiting calcium influx and neurotransmitter release. This is the first physiological demonstration of the involvement of a dendrotoxin-sensitive potassium current in presynaptic inhibition mediated by a G protein-coupled receptor.",
