     "AB": "To study whether Lrp11 is involved in stress response and find its expression regulatory network, the model of stress has been built using C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2 (D2) mice. Western blotting, qPCR and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate the expression variation of Lrp11 in amygdala tissue after exposure to stress. We found the quantity of Lrp11 was more obvious in stress models than that in normal mice (P<0.05) which suggests Lrp11 might participate in the process of stress response. The expression of Lrp11 is controlled by a cis-acting quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL). We identified four genes that are regulated by Lrp11 and the expression of 66 genes highly correlated with Lrp11, seven of which have previously been implicated in stress pathways. To evaluate the relationship between Lrp11 and its downstream genes or network members, we transfected HEK 293T cells and SH-SY5Y cells with Lrp11 siRNA leading to down-regulation of Lrp11mRNA and were able to confirm a significant influence of Lrp11 depletion on the expression of Xpnpep1, Maneal, Pgap1 and Uprt. These validated downstream targets and members of Lrp11 gene network provide new insight into the biological role of Lrp11 and may be an important risk factor in the development of stress.",
