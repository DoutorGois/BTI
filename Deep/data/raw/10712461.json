     "AB": "Interstitial ionic shifts that accompany ouabain-induced spreading depression (SD) were studied in rat hippocampal and cortical slices in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca(2+). A double-barreled ion-selective microelectrode specific for H(+), K(+), Na(+), or Ca(2+) was placed in the CA1 stratum radiatum or midcortical layer. Superfusion of 100 microM ouabain caused a rapid, negative, interstitial voltage shift (2-10 mV) after 3-5 min. The negativity was accompanied by a rapid alkaline transient followed by prolonged acidosis. In media containing 3 mM Ca(2+), the alkalosis induced by ouabain averaged 0.07 +/- 0.01 unit pH. In media with no added Ca(2+) and 2 mM EGTA, the alkaline shift was not significantly different (0.09 +/- 0.02 unit pH). The alkaline transient was unaffected by inhibiting Na(+)-H(+) exchange with ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) or by blocking endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) uptake with thapsigargin or cyclopiazonic acid. Alkaline transients were also observed in Ca(2+)-free media when SD was induced by microinjecting high K(+). The late acidification accompanying ouabain-induced SD was significantly reduced in Ca(2+)-free media and in solutions containing EIPA. The ouabain-induced SD was associated with a rapid but relatively modest increase in [K(+)](o). In the presence of 3 mM external Ca(2+), the mean peak elevation of [K(+)](o) was 12 +/- 0.62 mM. In Ca(2+)-free media, the elevation of [K(+)](o) had a more gradual onset and reached a significantly larger peak value, which averaged 22 +/- 1.1 mM. The decrease in [Na(+)](o) that accompanied ouabain-induced SD was somewhat greater. The [Na(+)](o) decreased by averages of 40 +/- 7 and 33 +/- 3 mM in Ca(2+) and Ca(2+)-free media, respectively. In media containing 1.2 mM Ca(2+), ouabain-induced SD was associated with a substantial decrease in [Ca(2+)](o) that averaged 0.73 +/- 0. 07 mM. These data demonstrate that in comparison with conventional SD, ouabain-induced SD exhibits ion shifts that are qualitatively similar but quantitatively diminished. The presence of external Ca(2+) can modulate the phenomenon but is irrelevant to the generation of the SD and its accompanying alkaline pH transient. Significance of these results is discussed in reference to the propagation of SD and the generation of interstitial pH changes.",
