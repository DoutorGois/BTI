     "AB": "The hippocampus is one of the target areas of neurosteroidal action. Expression of cytochrome P450scc (P450scc, CYP11A1), one of the key enzymes in steroid metabolism, results in de novo synthesis of the neurosteroid pregnenolone. We used a competitive RT-PCR assay to quantify the amount of P450scc mRNA in hippocampal tissue specimens obtained at neurosurgery from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). P450scc mRNA is expressed approximately 200 times lower in the hippocampus than in adrenal tissue known for high P450scc expression. P450scc mRNA concentrations were significantly higher in the hippocampus of women (1.72 +/- 0.36 aU, arbitrary units; mean +/- s.e.m.) than of men (0.92 +/- 0.15 aU, p < 0.004). Our data show for the first time the sex-dependent expression of P450scc mRNA in the hippocampus of patients with TLE.",
