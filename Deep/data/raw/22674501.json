     "AB": "The current study investigated the effects of neonatal infection with Chlamydia muridarum bacteria on glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors in the adult mouse hippocampus. In male adults infected at birth, circulating corticosterone was significantly increased when compared to same sex controls; while neonatal infection resulted in female adults with significantly increased GR mRNA compared to same sex controls. When comparing males and females after neonatal infection, males had significantly less GR protein than females. Interestingly, after control treatment, males had significantly more GR mRNA, MR mRNA, and GR protein with significantly lower corticosterone than females. Neonatal respiratory infection significantly impacts adult hippocampal GR and MR, and circulating corticosterone in a sex-specific manner potentially altering stress responsivity.",
