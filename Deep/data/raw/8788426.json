     "AB": "Perfusion of neither the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD), nor arachidonic acid caused any long-term enhancement of synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slice. However, co-perfusion of ACPD (50 microM) and arachidonic acid (10 microM) for 5 min induced a rapidly evoked and long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission. This enhancement persisted in the presence of D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (40 microM) and is therefore independent of NMDA receptor activation. The potentiation was mimicked by perfusion of the phospholipase A2 activator melittin (10 micrograms/ml) for 5 or 10 min, or exogenous phospholipase A2 (1 microgram/ml) for 5 min, immediately before ACPD application. We propose a role for arachidonic acid in the induction of synaptic potentiation, possibly as a retrograde transmitter substance.",
