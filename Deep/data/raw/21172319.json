     "AB": "Multiple applications of direct gene transfer into neurons require restricting expression to glutamatergic neurons, or specific subclasses of glutamatergic neurons. Thus, it is desirable to develop and analyze promoters that support glutamatergic-specific expression. The three vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) are found in different populations of neurons, and VGLUT1 is the predominant VGLUT in the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex. We previously reported on a plasmid (amplicon) Herpes Simplex Virus vector that contains a VGLUT1 promoter. This vector supports long-term expression in VGLUT1-containing glutamatergic neurons in rat postrhinal (POR) cortex, but does not support expression in VGLUT2-containing glutamatergic neurons in the ventral medial hypothalamus. This VGLUT1 promoter contains both the VGLUT1 upstream promoter and the VGLUT1 first intron. In this study, we begin to isolate and analyze the glutamatergic-specific regulatory elements in this VGLUT1 promoter. We show that the VGLUT1 upstream promoter and first intron each support glutamatergic-specific expression. We isolated a small, basal VGLUT1 promoter that does not support glutamatergic-specific expression. Next, we fused either the VGLUT1 upstream promoter or the first intron to this basal promoter. The VGLUT1 upstream promoter or the first intron, fused to the basal promoter, each supported glutamatergic-specific expression in POR cortex.",
