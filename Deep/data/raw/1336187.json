     "AB": "Specific binding of 125I-[D-Ala6-CH3-Leu7-Pro9,NHET]LHRH, a LHRH agonist, to hippocampal membranes prepared from ovariectomized female rates was examined. One high affinity binding site was observed with a Kd of 0.12 +/- 0.01 nM and an apparent Bmax of 13.0 +/- 3.8 fmol/mg. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and the behaviorally active Ac-LHRH(5-10) were able to compete for the agonist binding site. Native LHRH had an apparent Ki of 1.73 nM, while AC-LHRH(5-10) was 30 times less potent. Competition studies examined over the rat estrous cycle revealed an eighteenfold decrease in apparent affinity during diestrus I and estrus compared with ovariectomized animals. Tissue from animals in proestrus had a Ki of 5.0 nM. Specific binding studies indicate that receptor concentration is highest in proestrus (6.11 +/- 0.90 fmol/mg) and significantly lower during estrus (2.4 +/- 0.29 fmol/mg). These data suggest that at least one fragment of native LHRH can interact with neuronal LHRH receptors and that these receptors, like those in the pituitary, can be modulated by circulating steroid hormones.",
