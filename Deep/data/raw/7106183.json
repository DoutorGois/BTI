     "AB": "The binding of radiolabelled choline to lysed rat hippocampal synaptosomes was investigated. A portion of the binding sites was (a) detectable only when sodium ions were present, (b) sensitive to low concentrations of hemicholinium-3 (KD less than or equal to 70 nM), and (c) significantly reduced following electrolytic lesion of the septum. The similarity between this component of choline binding and the requirements of the sodium-dependent high affinity choline uptake process suggests that these binding sites are related to the choline transport system.",
