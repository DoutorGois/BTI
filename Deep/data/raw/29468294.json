     "AB": "RATIONALE: GLT-1 is the major glutamate transporter in the brain and is expressed predominantly in astrocytes but is also present in excitatory axon terminals. To understand the functional significance of GLT-1 expressed in neurons, we generated a conditional GLT-1 knockout mouse and inactivated GLT-1 in neurons using Cre-recombinase expressed under the synapsin 1 promoter, (synGLT-1 KO). OBJECTIVES: Abnormalities of glutamate homeostasis have been shown to affect hippocampal-related behaviors including learning and memory as well as responses to drugs of abuse. Here, we asked whether deletion of GLT-1 specifically from neurons would affect behaviors that assessed locomotor activity, cognitive function, sensorimotor gating, social interaction, as well as amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity. METHODS/RESULTS: We found that the neuronal GLT-1 KO mice performed similarly to littermate controls in the behavioral tests we studied. Although performance in open field testing was normal, the acute locomotor response to amphetamine was significantly blunted in the synGLT-1 KO (40% of control). We found no change in amphetamine-stimulated extracellular dopamine in the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens, no change in electrically stimulated or amphetamine-induced dopamine release, and no change in dopamine tissue content. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the view that GLT-1 expression in neurons is required for amphetamine-induced behavioral activation, and suggest that this phenotype is not produced through a change in dopamine uptake or release. Although GLT-1 is highly expressed in neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, the tests used in this study were not able to detect a behavioral phenotype referable to hippocampal dysfunction.",
