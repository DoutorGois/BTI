     "AB": "The effects of short and long-term haloperidol treatment on somatostatin concentration and specific binding in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus were examined using the binding ligand 125I-Tyr1-somatostatin. Haloperidol treatment did not affect the concentration of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity in the two brain areas. Nevertheless, long-term, and not short-term, haloperidol treatment decreased the number of somatostatin receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. No significant differences in the apparent binding affinity values were seen after haloperidol treatment. When added at the time of the binding assay haloperidol 34.2 microM produced a 42% and 27% decrease in cerebrocortical and hippocampal membrane somatostatin receptors respectively.",
