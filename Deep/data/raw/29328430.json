     "AB": "4-Hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (vanillin), contained in a number of species of plant, has been reported to display beneficial effects against brain injuries. In the present study, the impact of vanillin on scopolamineinduced alterations in cognition and the expression of DNA binding protein inhibitor ID1 (ID1), one of the inhibitors of DNA binding/differentiation proteins that regulate gene transcription, in the mouse hippocampus. Mice were treated with 1 mg/kg scopolamine with or without 40 mg/kg vanillin once daily for 4 weeks. Scopolamineinduced cognitive impairment was observed from 1 week and was deemed to be severe 4 weeks following the administration of scopolamine. However, treatment with vanillin in scopolaminetreated mice markedly attenuated cognitive impairment 4 weeks following treatment with scopolamine. ID1immunoreactive cells were revealed in the hippocampus of vehicletreated mice, and were hardly detected 4 weeks following treatment with scopolamine. However, treatment with vanillin in scopolaminetreated mice markedly restored ID1immunoreactive cells and expression 4 weeks subsequent to treatment. The results of the present study suggested that vanillin may be beneficial for cognitive impairment, by preventing the reduction of ID1 expression which may be associated with cognitive impairment.",
