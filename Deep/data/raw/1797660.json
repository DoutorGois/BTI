     "AB": "The effect of intraventricularly administered GABA on hippocampus was investigated by recording its electrical activity after chronic implantation of cannulae and bipolar electrode in five male beagle dogs. GABA was introduced in 40 mg/Kg b. weight so as to exceed its physiological levels in CSF. Recordings were made within two hours after microinjection in third ventricle. The predominant pattern of EEG depicted synchronization. The progressing synchronization of EEG suggests induction of functional lesion which might be playing a protective role in the regulation of metabolic behaviour.",
