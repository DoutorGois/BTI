     "AB": "Developmental change of GABA(A)ergic inhibitory postsynaptic current in rat hippocampal CA3 region was examined using patch-clamp recording method. Spontaneous and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents were recorded from acute hippocampal slices of neonates (postnatal days 2-4) and adults (days 18-38). Decay kinetics of the spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current was slower in neonates than in adults. Application of 500 nM zolpidem increased decay time-constants of the inhibitory postsynaptic currents in both groups with a stronger effect on adults. Zinc (50 microM) inhibited the neonatal inhibitory postsynaptic currents but the inhibition was weaker in adults. Modification of the GABA(A)ergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents by furosemide (0.6 mM) or diazepam (100 nM) did not cause marked differences between the neonate and adult groups. These results demonstrate that GABA(A)ergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells change developmentally and indicate that different receptor isoforms are functionally expressed between neonates and adults.",
