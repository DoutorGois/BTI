     "AB": "Calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels play a central role in regulating multiple physiological processes, from the control of blood flow to neuronal excitability. Coordinated regulation of BK channel activity by changes in actin cytoskeleton dynamics has been implicated in several of these processes and related disease states such as epilepsy and stroke. However, how BK channels interact with the actin cytoskeleton is essentially unknown. Here we demonstrate noncanonical Src homology domain 3 (SH3) binding site motifs in the intracellular C terminus of the BK channel pore-forming alpha-subunit that are conserved from fish to humans. These noncanonical motifs target multiple SH3 domain cellular signaling proteins to BK channels, including the SH3 adapter protein cortactin (EMS1). We demonstrate that cortactin provides a molecular bridge between BK channels and the cortical actin cytoskeleton in cells. Disruption of the SH3-mediated interaction prevents the regulation of BK channel activity controlled by changes in actin cytoskeletal dynamics. Targeting of cortactin to BK channels via a novel, noncanonical SH3 domain binding motif has important implications for the coordination of BK channel function in normal physiology and disease.",
