     "AB": "Rats were subjected to transient cerebral ischemia by four-vessel occlusion of 30 min duration, followed by 2, 4, 8 or 24 h of recovery. Total RNA was isolated from the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Hsp40 mRNA levels of samples were evaluated by quantitative PCR. Transient cerebral ischemia caused a marked increase in hsp40 mRNA levels to about 250% and 500% of control in the cortex and hippocampus respectively. Since hsp40 exerts a critical regulatory function in the HSC70/HSP70 ATPase cycle, an ischemia-induced rise of hsp40 mRNA levels could mark the onset of the recovery process after transient ischemia. On the other hand, the inhibitory action of hsp40 on P58 (a protein that activates protein synthesis by blocking the interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR) implies that the rise in hsp40 expression may equally well contribute to the post-ischemic suppression of protein synthesis.",
