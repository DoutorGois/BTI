     "AB": "To define relations between trophic molecules and known sexually dimorphic traits in brain, we examined possible sex differences in nerve growth factor (NGF) and NGF receptor (NGF-R) gene expression in the rat cholinergic basal forebrain (BF)-hippocampal system. Hippocampal NGF mRNA levels did not differ between sexes; in contrast, BF NGF-R mRNA levels were greater in neonatal females than males, paralleling the known dimorphic development of cholinergic enzyme activity. Cerebellar NGF-R mRNA levels were also dimorphic in the neonate, suggesting that sex-specific influences may regulate trophic receptor gene expression in diverse brain systems.",
