     "AB": "Serotonin amacrine cells have been described in the retina of vertebrates, except mouse and rat. Moreover, serotonin immunoreactive fibers have been reported in the optic nerve of rodents, frog and stingray. The purpose of this work was to study serotonin dorsal raphe nucleus projections to the retina, and to determine whether this pathway occurs in teleosts. The existence of specific connections was investigated in the rat and in the goldfish by the use of the neurotoxic substance 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine followed by monoamines determination in the retina by HPLC. The administration of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the central or the lateral area of the rat dorsal raphe nucleus decreased serotonin levels in the raphe area and in the hippocampus, but only the bilateral injection into the dorsal raphe nucleus decreased it in the retina. In the goldfish, the injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the optic tectum decreased serotonin concentration in situ and in the retina. The binding of [3H]paroxetine, a marker of serotonin transporter, was reduced in the retina of both species after the central treatment with the neurotoxic substance. In addition, the administration of the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan into the optic tectum increased serotonin levels in the site of the injection and in the retina. The intraocular administration of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine produced a big decrease in the content of retinal serotonin. This indoleamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were detected in the optic nerves of rat and goldfish. The results indicate the existence of serotonergic retinopetal fibers in the rat and in the goldfish, a pathway that was not specifically demonstrated for the rat and was not previously proposed for the fish. The study of these serotonergic projections from the brain to the retina could be of interest in the understanding of the functional role of serotonin in the retina.",
