A 50-year-old man presented with forgetfulness and severe memory disturbance after suffering multiple oral and genital aphthous ulcers with erythema nodosum. A neurological examination and a neuropsychological assessment revealed prominent anterograde memory impairment without focal neurological deficits. On brain MRI there were high signal intensity lesions involving right anterior thalamus, left posterior basal ganglia, and left hippocampus. This is a quite selective anterogrde memory deficit in a case of neuro-Behcet's disease caused by parenchymal lesions in the thalamus and hippocampus.",
