     "AB": "Methylphenidate (MPH) is frequently prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. It was previously demonstrated that MPH altered brain metabolic activity. Most cell energy is obtained through oxidative phosphorylation, in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. However, there are still few studies about MPH effects on the brain of adult rats. Thus, in the present study we evaluated the effect of acute or chronic administration of MPH on the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I-IV in the brain of adult rats. For acute administration, a single injection of MPH was given to 60-day-old rats. For chronic administration, MPH injections were given to 60-day-old rats once daily for 28 days. Our results showed that complexes I, II, III and IV were inhibited after acute or chronic MPH administration in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, striatum and cerebral cortex. On the other hand, cerebellum was not affected.",
