     "AB": "Self-stimulation (SS) rewarding experience induced structural changes in CA3 hippocampal and layer V motor cortical pyramidal neurons in adult male Wistar rats has been demonstrated. In the present study, whether these structural changes are transient or of a permanent nature was evaluated. Self-stimulation experience was provided for 1 h daily over a period of 10 days through bilaterally implanted bipolar electrodes in the lateral hypothalamus and the substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area. Following 10 days of SS experience, the rats were sacrificed after an interval of 30 and 60 days for the quantitative analysis of the dendritic morphology in Golgi stained CA3 hippocampal and layer V motor cortical pyramidal neurons. The results revealed a significant increase in the dendritic branching points and intersections in apical and basal dendrites in both types of neurons in 30 days post-SS group compared to sham control. The total number of apical and basal dendrites were significantly increased in both 30 and 60 days post-SS groups of rats. This study suggests that SS experience induced structural changes are sustainable, even in the absence of rewarding experience.",
