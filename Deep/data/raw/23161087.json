     "AB": "Classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, first identified in the immune system, is also expressed in the developing and adult central nervous system (CNS). Although the MHC class I molecules have been found to be expressed in the CNS of different species, a necessary step to elucidate the temporal and spatial expression patterns of MHC class I molecules in the brain development has never been taken. Frozen sections were made from the brains of embryonic and postnatal C57BL/6 J mice, and the expression of H-2D(b) mRNA was examined by in situ hybridization. Immunofluorescence was also performed to define the cell types that express H2-D(b) in P15 mice. At E10.5, the earliest stage we examined, H2-D(b) was expressed in neuroepithelium of the brain vesicles. From E12.5 to P0, H2-D(b) expression was mainly located at cerebral cortex, neuroepithelium of the lateral ventricle, neuroepithelium of aquaeductus and developing cerebellum. From P4 to adult, H2-D(b) mRNA was detected at olfactory bulb, hippocampus, cerebellum and some nerve nuclei. The major cell types expressing H-2D(b) in P15 hippocampus, cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb were neuron. H2-K(b) signal paralleled that of H2-D(b) and the expression levels of the two molecules were comparable throughout the brain. The investigation of the expression pattern of H-2D(b) at both embryonic and postnatal stages is important for further understanding the physiological and pathological roles of H2-D(b) in the developing CNS.",
