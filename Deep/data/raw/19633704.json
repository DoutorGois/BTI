     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Presynaptic voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels mediate rapid Ca(2+) influx into the synaptic terminal which triggers synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release. The FM 1-43 dye was firstly introduced as a fluorescence probe by Betz and his colleagues in 1992, and has been used to monitor exocytosis, endocytosis and endosomal traffic in a variety of cell types. The present study aims to investigate the feasibility of applying the FM 1-43 dye in the functional analysis of calcium channel-mediated exocytosis in synaptic terminals. METHODS: The hippocampi were isolated from embryos of pregnant rats, and hippocampal neurons were then transfected with Ds-Red conjugated plasmid. The neurons were then loaded with 8 micromol/L FM 1-43 and 47 mmol/L KCl for 90 s after transfection. After that, 90 mmol/L KCl was employed to induce FM dye destaining, which was recorded by FM imaging system. RESULTS: The neuron synaptic terminals of rat hippocampus could be effectively stained by the FM 1-43 dye. Besides, the destaining of the labeled neuron terminals was in accordance with the transmitter release, which could be blocked by the application of nifedipine (inhibitor for L-type calcium channel). CONCLUSION: The FM imaging technique is an advanced and effective method for analyzing synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release, and can be applied in various synaptic functional studies.",
