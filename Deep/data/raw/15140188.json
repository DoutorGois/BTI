     "PG": "886-96",
     "AB": "The functional properties of GABA(B) receptors were examined in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the hippocampus of knock-out mice devoid of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT-/-) or the 5-HT(1A) receptor (5-HT(1A)-/-). Electrophysiological recordings in brain slices showed that the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen caused a lower hyperpolarization and neuronal firing inhibition of DRN 5-HT cells in 5-HTT-/- versus 5-HTT+/+ mice. In addition, [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding induced by GABA(B) receptor stimulation in the DRN was approximately 40% less in these mutants compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, GABA(B) receptors appeared functionally intact in the hippocampus of 5-HTT-/-, and in both this area and the DRN of 5-HT(1A)-knock-out mice. The unique functional changes of DRN GABA(B) receptors closely resembled those of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors in 5-HTT-/- mice, further supporting the idea that both receptor types are coupled to a common pool of G-proteins in serotoninergic neurons.",
