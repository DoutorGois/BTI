     "AB": "The present study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects and underlying mechanisms of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on global ischemic hypoxic brain injury. Cells collected from the femurs and tibias of male Sprague Dawley rats were used to generate BMSCs following three culture passages. A rate model of cardiac arrest (CA) was induced by asphyxia. One hour following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), BMSCs were transplanted through injection into the tail vein. Neurological status was assessed using modified neurological severity score (mNSS) tests 1, 3 and 7 days following ROSC. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) expression in the hippocampus. Furthermore, double-fluorescent labeling of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and IGF-1 was used to detect the IGF-1 expression in transplanted BMSCs. Serum levels of protein S100-B were examined using ELISA. GFP-labeled BMSCs were observed in the hippocampus at 1, 3 and 7 days post transplantation through fluorescent microscopy. BMSC transplantation resulted in reduced protein S100-B levels. The mNSS of the BMSC-treatment group was significantly reduced compared with that of the CA group. The RT-qPCR analysis and immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that BMSC treatment significantly increased IGF-1 expression in the hippocampus. In addition, the double-fluorescent labeling results demonstrated that transplanted BMSCs expressed IGF-1 in the hippocampus. The results of the present study suggest that BMSC treatment promotes the recovery of cerebral function following CA in rats possibly through the secretion of IGF-1.",
