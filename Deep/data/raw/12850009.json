     "AB": "We describe a computational model of spatial navigation based on experimental studies conducted with human participants. The model builds and uses a hierarchical cognitive map of a large environment. Computer simulations show that the model correctly describes experimental results including hierarchical organization of space and distance estimation. Furthermore, the model predicts that reaction time for distance estimation varies nonlinearly with distance.",
