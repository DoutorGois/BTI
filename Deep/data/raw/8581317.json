     "AB": "Neurogenesis is restricted to discrete germinal zones within the developing and the adult central nervous systems. With few exceptions, cells that migrate away from these zones and into the parenchyma no longer participate in the generation of new neurons. In this work, we have found that basic fibroblast growth factor is able to stimulate the proliferation of neuronal and glial progenitors isolated from the septum and striatum of adult rats. These progenitors are indistinguishable from those isolated from the adult hippocampus and subventricular zone, two regions that generate neurons well into adult life. Although a variety of cell types are initially isolated from each brain region, the progenitor-like cells from all four regions are capable of considerable proliferation and, with limited serial passage, can be cultured as enriched populations of immature cells that are capable of differentiating into mature glia and neurons following density arrest and growth factor withdrawal. The fact that cells isolated from the septum and striatum proliferate and have the ability to differentiate into neurons once they are removed from their local environment indicates that neurogenesis may be restricted to discrete areas of the developing and the adult brain by regional differences in regulatory signals rather than from an absence of progenitors capable of responding to neurogenic cues.",
