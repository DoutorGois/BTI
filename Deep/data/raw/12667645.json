     "AB": "The hypothesis that inflammation and beta amyloid deposition are causally linked in Alzheimer's disease (AD) was tested in a transgenic mouse model. Untreated beta amyloid plaque-bearing Tg2576 mice did not differ from wild type animals in brain levels of most inflammatory mediators. Indomethacin treatment suppressed brain levels of prostaglandins by 90%, but reduced hippocampal beta amyloid by only 20%, with no effect on cortical beta amyloid. The discordant effects on beta amyloid and cyclooxygenase (COX) suggest that these effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not causally linked. Further evidence against a causal relationship is seen in an unexpected trend to lower levels of beta amyloid after an inflammatory stimulus [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)].",
