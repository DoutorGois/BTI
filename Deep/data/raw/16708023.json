     "AB": "We have previously shown that homozygous PDAPP mice, a transgenic model of Alzheimer's-like amyloidosis, have abnormal corpus callosi and anterior hippocampi. Now, we investigated the extent to which these morphological abnormalities are correlated with mutant gene dose in a larger, independent, and substantially younger cohort. Homozygous and heterozygous PDAPP mice had significantly smaller callosal commissure length and anterior hippocampal area than controls. Reductions correlated with mutant APP gene dose, with homozygotes showing the greatest reduction, and were present at 2 months of age. These findings and previous work with APP knockouts suggest that PDAPP mice have impaired white matter development due to interference with native murine APP.",
