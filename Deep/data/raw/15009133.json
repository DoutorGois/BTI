     "AB": "EFA6A is a guanine nucleotide exchange protein (GEP) that can specifically activate ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) in vitro. A recent study has demonstrated that ARF6 is involved in the dendritic formation of developing hippocampal neurons [Hernandez-Deviez et al. (2002) Nature Neurosci., 5, 623-624]. This study examined a potential role for EFA6A in hippocampal development in Wistar rats. Our results provided definitive evidence for somatodendritic localization of EFA6A mRNA in both cultured and in vivo hippocampal neurons by nonradioactive in situ hybridization. During postnatal development, EFA6A mRNA was dramatically increased and its dendritic localization was most evident between P7 and P14. In contrast, ARF6 mRNA was confined to the neuronal layers of the hippocampus throughout development. In addition, the overexpression of a GEP-defective mutant of EFA6A enhanced the dendritic formation of the primary hippocampal neurons. The present findings suggest that EFA6A is intimately involved in the regulation of the dendritic development of hippocampal neurons.",
