     "AB": "The hippocampus is a critical deep brain structure in several aspects. It is directly related to the formation of new long-term declarative memory. The malfunction of the hippocampus closely relates to various disease and pathological conditions. It is also a model structure for the study of cortical function and synaptic plasticity in general because of its special neuro-anatomical structure and intrinsic connections within the hippocampus formation. Both the understanding of roles that the hippocampus plays in recognition memory and the study of neural plasticity require simultaneously recording of neural activities from multiple sub-regions of the hippocampus from behavioral animals. However the distribution of cells in the hippocampus make the recording from multiple sub-regions a big challenge with the traditional uni-length micro-wire arrays. Well-designed electrode arrays are required to reach multiple regions simultaneously because of the distinctive double C shape of the hippocampus cell body layers. In this work, we designed a multi-shanks electrode which uses Parylene C, a highly biocompatible and flexible polymer, as a base and has multiple recording sites specially positioned along the longitudinal axis to fit the curvy shape of the rat hippocampus.",
