     "AB": "The cyclic 3'-5' adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) content of the rat hippocampal formation doubles during the week following a medial septal lesion and remains elevated for at least 1 month, the longest time period studied. This elevation in cyclic AMP does not result from sympathetic ingrowth, as neither superior cervical ganglion stimulation nor ganglionectomy influences hippocampal cyclic AMP content after lesions. Interruption of the cholinergic septohippocampal pathway in the fornix did not elevate hippocampal cyclic AMP content. Further, treatment of septal-lesioned animals with oxotremorine or of normal animals with atropine did not influence hippocampal cyclic AMP content. Finally, neither locus ceruleus lesions nor treatment with propranolol affected hippocampal cyclic AMP content. We believe this to be the first report of a sustained elevation in hippocampal cyclic AMP content. Like other long-term events, it is likely to have profound effects on hippocampal function and represents a remarkable brain adaptation to remote injury.",
