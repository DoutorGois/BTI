     "AB": "The aim of our study was to investigate the level of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the brains of rats after chronic mild stress. Using Western blotting procedure we showed that the level of mGluR5 receptor protein was increased in CA1 and decreased in CA3 region of the hippocampus. Our results indicate that mGluR5 can possibly be engaged in the mechanism of depression.",
