     "AB": "SUMMARY: Rats exposed during prenatal life to methylazoxymethanol (MAM) display in postnatal age structural and behavioral deficits resembling those observed in schizophrenic patients. These deficits are associated with significant changes in brain nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), particularly in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. In the present study, we used the MAM model to investigate in young rats the effect of antipsychotics, Clozapine and Haloperidol, on brain and blood NGF and BDNF presence. Young animals were used because administration of antipsychotics during adolescence is a common feature of intervention. The results showed that administration of Clozapine and Haloperidol causes significant changes in the concentration of NGF and BDNF in the brain and bloodstream of MAM-treated rats. These findings indicate that these drugs may affect the synthesis and release of neurotrophins in the central nervous system and in the blood circulation. In addition, the MAM model can be a useful tool to investigate the biochemical and molecular mechanisms regarding the effects of antipsychotics.",
