     "AB": "The cellular basis of kindling was studied electrophysiologically with slices of guinea pig hippocampus. Normally, epileptiform activity can be induced in the slices only by combined exposure to elevated potassium levels and a chemical convulsant such as penicillin. In hippocampal slices from pentylenetetrazole-kindled animals, however, elevated potassium alone can induce seizures. These data suggest that kindling elicits long-term changes in neuronal excitability that may involve ionic mechanisms.",
