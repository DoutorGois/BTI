Somatostatin binding was reduced in the striatum, frontal cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus of the 8-month-old rats compared to the 1-month-old group. 3. Somatostatin binding was reduced in the striatum, frontal cortex and hippocampus of the 18-month-old rats compared to the 1-month-old group. 4. The reduction (40%) was most striking in the frontal cortex. 5. In no area of the brain did changes in SLI differ significantly between the different age groups.",
