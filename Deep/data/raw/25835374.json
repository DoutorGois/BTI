     "AB": "Timing of radiotherapy for low-grade gliomas is still controversial due to concerns of possible adverse late effects. Prevention of possible late cognitive sequelae by hippocampal avoidance has shown promise in phase II trials. A patient with progressive low-grade glioma with gradual dedifferentiation into anaplastic astrocytoma is presented along with description of radiotherapy planning process attempting to spare the hippocampus. To our knowledge, this is the first described case using volumetric modulated arc technique to spare hippocampus during transformed low-grade glioma radiotherapy. Using modern intensity-modulated radiotherapy systems it is possible to selectively spare hippocampus together with other standard organs at risk. For selected patients, an attempt to spare hippocampus can be considered as long as other dose characteristics are not significantly compromised compared to standard treatment plan created without any effort to avoid hippocampus.",
