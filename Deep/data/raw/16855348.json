     "AB": "The use of cell-based therapy is a valid therapeutic approach to ischemic brain injury. Endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) have been identified in the central nervous system where they reside largely in the subventricular zone and in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. Endogenous NSCs are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into functional brain cells. This paper summarizes the evidence recently gathered in support of a therapeutic role for endogenous NSCs in acute experimental stroke.",
