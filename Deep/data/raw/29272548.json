     "AB": "Prolonged seizure activity or status epilepticus (SE) is one of the most critical manifestations of organophosphate (OP) exposure. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that oxidative stress is a critical mediator of SE-induced neuronal injury. The goal of this study was to determine if diisopropylflurorphoshate (DFP) exposure in rats resulted in oxidative stress and whether scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) attenuated DFP-induced neurotoxicity. DFP treatment increased indices of oxidative stress in a time- and region- dependent manner. Neuronal loss measured by Fluoro-Jade B staining was significantly increased in the hippocampus, piriform cortex and amygdala following DFP. Similarly, levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-alpha, IL-6 and KC/GRO were significantly increased in the piriform cortex and in the hippocampus following DFP treatment. The catalytic antioxidant AEOL10150, when treatment was initiated 5 min after DFP-induced status epilepticus (SE), significantly attenuated indices of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. This study suggests that catalytic antioxidant treatment may be useful as a novel therapy to attenuate secondary neuronal injury following OP exposure.",
