     "AB": "Previous neuroimaging studies of the cortical representation of gustatory and olfactory stimuli have often delivered tastants to the mouth in very small quantities or stimulated olfaction orthonasally. In studies of retro-nasal olfaction, swallowing was generally delayed to reduce head motion artefacts. The present fMRI study aims to improve upon such methodological limitations to allow investigation of the cortical representation of flavour (taste and aroma combination) as it typically occurs during the consumption of liquid foods. For this purpose we used (1) a novel, automated, sprayed stimulus delivery system and a larger volume of liquid sample (containing sweet tastants and banana/pear aroma volatiles) to achieve more extensive stimulation of the oral cavity taste receptors, (2) a pseudo-natural delivery paradigm that included prompt swallowing after each sample delivery to obtain physiological retro-nasal olfactory stimulation, (3) fMRI acquisition with wide brain coverage and double-echo EPI to improve sensitivity. We validated our paradigm for the delivery of volatiles using atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry. This showed that the main retro-nasal delivery of volatiles in the paradigm occurs immediately after the swallow. Several brain areas were found to be activated, including the insula, frontal operculum, rolandic operculum/parietal lobe, piriform, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, ventro-medial thalamus, hippocampus and medial orbitofrontal cortex.",
