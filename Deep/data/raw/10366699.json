     "AB": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophin family, and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a member of the neurocytokine family, are known to have synergistic effects on motoneurons, but such synergistic effect has not been studied in detail especially in the brain. In the present study, we examined the synergistic effects of BDNF and CNTF on the survival of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons cultured from postnatal 2-week-old (P2w) rats. Although BDNF is well-known to promote the survival of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in P2w culture, CNTF had little effect on the survival of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons and did not increase ChAT activity in the culture. However, CNTF enhanced BDNF-mediated promotion of cell survival of cholinergic neurons when added concomitantly. BDNF alone induced only a three-fold increase in ChAT activity in control cultures, but the concomitant addition of CNTF resulted in an eight-fold increase. CNTF did not enhance BDNF-mediated cell survival of total neurons from the basal forebrain, hippocampus or cerebellum, suggesting that the synergistic effects of CNTF on the BDNF-mediated increase of viability might be strong in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. CNTF also enhanced the neurotrophin-4/5-mediated increase of ChAT activity, but not the nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated one. Furthermore, the BDNF-mediated increase was also enhanced by leukemia inhibitory factor but not by interleukin-6. Similar synergistic pattern between neurotrophins and cytokines were also observed in the induction of ChAT activity in embryonic basal forebrain culture. These results suggest that TrkB, a functional high-affinity receptor of BDNF and NT-4/5, and LIFR beta, a receptor component contained in CNTF and LIF receptor complex, might be involved in the observed synergistic effects.",
