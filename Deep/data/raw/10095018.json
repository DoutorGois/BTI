     "AB": "We have cloned and sequenced a full length rabbit GLUT 1 and partial rabbit GLUT 3 cDNAs. The derived rabbit GLUT 3 peptide revealed 84% homology to the mouse, 82% to the rat, human, dog, and sheep, and 69% to the chicken GLUT 3 peptides. Using Northern blot analysis, we investigated the tissue and brain cellular distribution of GLUT 1 and GLUT 3 expression. In addition, we examined the effect of development and hypoxic-ischemia upon brain GLUT 1 and GLUT 3 mRNA levels. While GLUT 1 mRNA was observed in most tissues, GLUT 3 was expressed predominantly in the brain, placenta, stomach, and lung with minor amounts in the heart, kidney and skeletal muscle. In the brain, both GLUT 1 and GLUT 3 were noted in neuron- and glial-enriched cultures. Both GLUT 1 and GLUT 3 mRNA levels demonstrated a similar developmental progression (p<0.05) secondary to post-transcriptional mechanisms. Further, while hypoxic-ischemia did not significantly affect brain GLUT 1 mRNA and protein, it altered GLUT 3 mRNA levels in a region-specific manner, with a three-fold increase in the cerebral cortex, a two-fold increase in the hippocampus, and a 50% increase in the caudate nucleus (p<0.05). We conclude, that the rabbit GLUT 3 peptide sequence exhibits 82-84% homology to that of other species in the coding region with a 62-89% sequence identity in the 3'-untranslated region. The tissue-specific expression of rabbit GLUT 3 mimics that of the human closely. Postnatal development and hypoxic-ischemia with reperfusion injury cause an increase in brain GLUT 3 expression, as a response to synaptogenesis and substrate deprivation, respectively.",
