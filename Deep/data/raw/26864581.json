     "AB": "Amyloid-beta deposition is thought to be associated with memory deficits, neuroinflammation, apoptotic responses, and progressive neuronal death manifested in Alzheimer's disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) is a transcription factor with potent anti-inflammatory effect. In the current study, the effect of GW0742, a selective PPARdelta agonist, on Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity was investigated in the hippocampus of mice. Intra-hippocampal infusion of aggregated Abeta1-42 oligomer (410pmol/mouse) remarkably damaged learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests, accompanied by decreased expression of PPARdelta in the hippocampus as confirmed by Western blot. Intra-hippocampal infusion of GW0742 (1.06 mM/mouse) significantly improved Abeta1-42-induced memory deficits in mice, reversed Abeta1-42-induced hippocampal PPARdelta down-regulation and repressed Abeta1-42-triggered neuroinflammatory and apoptotic responses, indicated by decreased nuclear NF-kappaB p65, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta as well as a decrease in cleaved caspase-3 and increased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in the hippocampus. These results suggest that PPARdelta activation ameliorates Abeta1-42-induced hippocampal neurotoxicity, and it might play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease.",
