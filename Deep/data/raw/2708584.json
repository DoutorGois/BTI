     "AB": "The temporal patterns of neurogenesis of cells showing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactivity were determined in the area dentata of the mouse. Pregnant C57Bl mice received pulse injections of (3H)thymidine from E11 through E17 (E0 being the day of mating). The distribution of (3H)thymidine-labeled, GAD-positive neurons in the hilus and in the different strata of the fascia dentata (stratum infragranulosum, stratum granulosum, stratum moleculare) were recorded in adult animals. A radial gradient of neurogenesis of GAD-positive cells in the area dentata was not apparent. In the transverse axis, neurogenesis of GAD-positive cells seemed to follow a faint suprapyramidal to infrapyramidal gradient, which was due to differential timing of neurogenesis of GAD-positive cells destined for the stratum infragranulosum of the suprapyramidal and infrapyramidal blades of the fascia dentata. GABAergic neurons in the fascia dentata comprise a limited number of well-defined cell types. All of the different morphologic types of GAD-positive neurons present in the area dentata were generated prenatally. These diverse forms did not have specific times of neurogenesis. These results support the concept that the adult morphology of GAD-positive cells in the area dentata of the mouse do not bear any relationship to their times of origin.",
