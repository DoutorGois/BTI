     "AB": "Flavonoids are a class of polyphenolic compounds present in fruits and vegetables. Several studies have demonstrated a relationship between the consumption of flavonoid-rich diets and the prevention of human diseases including neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, we assessed the effect of quercetin (3,3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) on oxidative stress and memory retrieval using a step-through passive avoidance task in kindled rats. Quercetin (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) before pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) every other day prior to the training. Retention tests were performed to assess memory in rats. Compared to control, pretreatment with 50 mg/kg of quercetin could attenuate seizure severity from the beginning of the kindling experiment by lowering the mean seizure stages. Moreover, quercetin 50 mg/kg significantly increased the step-through latency of the passive avoidance response compared to the control in the retention test. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly increased in the quercetin groups compared to the PTZ group in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex following PTZ kindling. In the quercetin groups, higher sulfhydryl (SH) contents were not observed compared to the PTZ group. These results indicate that quercetin at a specific dose results in decreased seizure severity during kindling and performance improvement in a passive avoidance task in kindled rats. All doses of quercetin led to increased oxidative stress in the hippocampi and cerebral cortices of kindled rats.",
