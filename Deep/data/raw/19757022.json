     "AB": "In order to understand the synaptic remodeling in the course of axonal regeneration, the synaptic remodeling of the perforant path in hippocampus was investigated in the present study with entorhino-hippocampal coculture, DiI DiOlistic assay and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that the regeneration of the perforant pathway occurred in entorhino-hippocampal slice coculture, and putative synaptic contacts formed between the regenerated fibers and dendritic spines of granule cells. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed the formation of new synaptic contacts. In conclusion, the synaptic formation implicated in the neuroregeneration could integrate into the network in CNS.",
