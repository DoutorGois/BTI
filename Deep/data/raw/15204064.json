     "AB": "Dopamine cells derived from neural stem cells were transplanted into the dopamine-denervated striatum in the rat. Survival of the dopamine cells, gliosis, and immunological reaction were examined by immunostaining. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH+) cells were seen in the needle tract, walls of the lateral ventricle, thalamus, hippocampus, and external and internal capsules for up to 3 weeks examination. Most TH+ cells had mature-looking polygonal shapes with processes. Some cells migrated into the striatum. Behavioral improvement was not seen",
