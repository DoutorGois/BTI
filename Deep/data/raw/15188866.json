     "AB": "Self-regulation of slow cortical potentials (SCPs) has been successfully used to prevent epileptic seizures as well as to communicate with completely paralyzed patients. The thought translation device (TTD) is a brain-computer interface (BCI) that was developed for training and application of SCP self-regulation. To investigate the neurophysiological mechanisms of SCP regulation the TTD was combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The technical aspects and pitfalls of combined fMRI data acquisition and EEG neurofeedback are discussed. First data of SCP feedback during fMRI are presented.",
