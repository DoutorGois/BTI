     "AB": "Glutamate excitotoxicity has been involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Normal functioning of glutamate transporters clears the synaptically released glutamate to prevent excitotoxic neuronal death. Using densitometric immunohistochemical analysis, we examined the temporal expression of the neuronal glutamate transporter (EAAC1) in the lithium-pilocarpine rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy. During the acute period of lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, EAAC1 transporter expression increased in the pyramidal neurons of cornus ammonis (CA)1, CA2 and CA3 (fields of the hippocampus), in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells and in olfactory tubercle (Tu). During the latent period, EAAC1 expression was strongly expressed in the DG granular and molecular layers, Tu, cerebral cortex and septum, and went back to control levels in CA1, CA2 and CA3 layers. The overexpression of EAAC1 occurred mainly in structures prone to develop Fluoro-Jade-B-positive degenerating neurons. It is, however, not clear to what extent the overexpression of EAAC1 contributes to epileptogenesis and in which area it may represent a preventive or compensatory or response to injury.",
