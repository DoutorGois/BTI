     "AB": "Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) is an incretin hormone that rises rapidly in response to nutrient ingestion. The GIP receptor is widely expressed in the brain including the brain stem, telencephalon, diencephalon, olfactory bulb, pituitary, and cerebellum. Until recently it was not clear what the endogenous ligand for this receptor was because no GIP expression had been demonstrated in the brain. GIP synthesis has now been documented in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. To define GIP effects on behavior we utilized a mouse model a GIP-overexpressing transgenic mouse (GIP Tg). Specifically, anxiety-related behavior, exploration, memory, and nociception were examined. Compared to age-matched adult male C57BI/6 controls GIP Tg mice displayed enhanced exploratory behavior in the open-field locomotor activity test. GIP Tg mice also demonstrated increased performance in some of the motor function tests. These data suggest that the GIP receptor plays a role in the regulation of locomotor activity and exploration. To our knowledge, this is the first report of effects of GIP on behavior.",
