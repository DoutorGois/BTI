     "AB": "Programmed cell death has been linked to AMPA-receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. The intent of this study was to investigate the roles of caspase-dependent and independent nuclear death-related factors in mediating AMPA-induced nuclear changes in PyNs by use of immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Data indicate increases in the nuclear levels of caspase-activated acinus and DNase and Endonuclease G (a caspase-independent endonuclease) in CA1 and CA3 PyN nuclei with different temporal patterns following an AMPA-insult. Hoechst staining and TEM confirm AMPA-induced chromatin condensation. The presence of active acinus in nuclei suggests it mediates chromatin condensation. Interestingly, a DNA fragmentation labeling protocol showed that there was no chromatin cleavage up to 90 min after AMPA-insult. Overall, we conclude that: 1) AMPA-induced excitotoxicity increases nuclear immunoreactivity of pro-death enzymes from multiple programmed cell death pathways, 2) differential chromatin condensation patterns occur between CA1 and CA3, and 3) there is no chromatin cleavage within our experimental timeframe.",
