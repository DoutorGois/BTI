     "AB": "The physiological characteristics of rat and murine hippocampal neurons are widely studied, especially because of the involvement of the hippocampus in learning, memory, and neurological functions. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons are commonly used to discover cellular and molecular mechanisms in neurobiology. By isolating and culturing individual hippocampal neurons, neuroscientists are able to investigate the activity of neurons at the individual cell and single synapse level, and to analyze properties related to cellular structure, cellular trafficking, and individual protein subcellular localization or protein-protein interaction using a variety of biochemical techniques. Conclusions addressed from such research are critical for testing theories related to memory, learning, and neurological functions. Here, we will describe how to isolate and culture primary hippocampal cells from newborn mice. The hippocampus may be isolated from newborn mice in as short as 2 min, and the cell cultures can be maintained for up to 2 weeks, and then ready for investigation of subcellular localization of K(+) channel proteins and interaction with SUMO-specific protease 2 (SENP2). The protocol provides a fast and efficient technique for the culture of neuronal cells from mouce hippocampal tissue, and will ensure the immunocytochemistry detection of subcellular localization or protein-protein interactions in neurological research.",
