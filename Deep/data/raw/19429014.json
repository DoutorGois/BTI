     "AB": "The ketogenic diet (KD) prevents kainic acid (KA)-induced hippocampal cell death. There are reports that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation regulates the intracellular signaling pathways involved in cellular survival or apoptotic cell death. In this study, we investigated the effect of the KD consumption on the expression of signaling pathway proteins AMPK and ACC, and heat shock protein (HSP) 70 in mouse hippocampus after KA treatment. Mice were fed the KD for 6 weeks and then sacrificed 48h after KA (30mg/kg) injection. The marked cell death found commonly in normal diet (ND)-fed mice treated with KA was not observed in the KD-fed KA-treated mice. Western blot analysis revealed that phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC was increased after KA treatment. However, phosphorylation of these proteins was reduced in those animals that received the KD. In addition, increased expression of HSP70 in the hippocampus of KA-treated mice was decreased in animals receiving the KD. These results indicate that the KD promotes neuroprotective effects through suppression of the AMPK cascade and that HSP70 is involved in neuronal cell death or oxidative stress.",
