     "AB": "Six basic problems of attention are described in terms of the dominant focus by Ukhtomsky, which is simulated as a system of phase transitions in the brain. Theoretical and experimental arguments in favor of the existence of metastable states in the brain with the life time of about a second or more are deduced. This forms an approach to resolution of all the problems of interaction between attention and memory, binding, and central control. A neurobiological model of attention and memory is advanced, which integrates the system properties of dominanta by A.A. Ukhtomsky and comparator function of the hippocampus by O.S. Vinogradova. New literature evidence is given for the existence of the brain system of information processing with the hippocampus as a central executive.",
