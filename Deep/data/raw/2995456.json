     "AB": "The extent to which transplants of embryonic cortical tissue can be used to replace damaged cortical projections has been examined. Embryonic entorhinal cortex was implanted into the entorhinal region of young adult rats that had previously received a lesion through the angular bundle. Projections between transplant and host were examined by using WGA-HRP and the fluorescent dye Fast Blue. Implants selectively innervated areas of the host hippocampus and amygdala which normally receive entorhinal afferents. Implants were innervated by cells in the host diagonal band and, in one case, by cells in the contralateral entorhinal and/or presubicular cortex. In most cases, host fibers were differentially distributed within transplants, possibly reflecting an ability of host fibers to recognize and selectively innervate their appropriate targets even though the cellular organization of the implant is different from that present during normal development. These data suggest that homotypic implants of embryonic entorhinal cortex can, in some ways, replace severed cortical projections and may eventually be able to reconstitute normal cortical circuitry.",
