     "AB": "Changes in vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (VGAT) expression in the gerbil hippocampus after treatment with baclofen (GABA(B) receptor agonist) or phaclofen (GABA(B) receptor antagonist) were investigated to identify the GABA(B) receptor-mediated regulation of VGAT expression. In the baclofen-treated seizure-resistant gerbils, VGAT expression was significantly reduced, as compared with the control animals, thus the VGAT immunoreactive pattern in these gerbils was similar to that in control seizure-sensitive (SS) gerbils. In the phaclofen-treated SS gerbils, VGAT expression was dramatically elevated, compared to SS gerbil controls. Our findings demonstrated that GABA(B) receptor-mediated regulation of VGAT expression may be another mechanisms for presynaptic GABA release, which is accompanied by a reduction in Ca(2+) conductance by the inhibition of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels.",
