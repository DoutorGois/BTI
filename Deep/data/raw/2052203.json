     "AB": "The use of in vitro brain slice preparations has increased in the past ten years, particularly the hippocampal slice because of the dissection ease, well-defined cell layers, and self-contained afferent systems. Developing the slice as a model for screening neurotoxins is of particular interest because of the sensitivity of hippocampal neurons to chemical or metabolic insult and the need to keep animal usage to a minimum. Experiments where the slice has been used to study the neurotoxin trimethyltin are discussed, along with its use as a model for investigating the neurodegenerative problems associated with hypoxia, ischemia, and epilepsy.",
