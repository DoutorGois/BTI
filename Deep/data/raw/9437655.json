     "AB": "Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neuronal cytoskeletal damage were evaluated in two commonly used rat models of traumatic brain injury. Adult rats received a lateral cortical impact (CI) or lateral fluid percussion (FP) injury of mild or moderate severity or a sham procedure. Six hours after trauma, the brains were removed and analyzed with immunocytochemical techniques for alterations in the serum protein, IgG, and the cytoskeletal protein, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). Both models induced profound alterations in these proteins in the ipsilateral cortex and hippocampus compared to sham-injured controls. Following an injury of moderate severity, the CI injury resulted in greater IgG extravasation in the cortex and hippocampus than the FP injury. Conversely, after a mild injury, IgG extravasation in the hippocampus was greater for FP than CI. All of the animals in the CI group and most of the FP group showed a loss of MAP2 in the hippocampus. The specific subregions within the cortex and hippocampus that were affected by the injury varied between models, despite having identical impact sites. These data demonstrate that there are both similarities and differences between a CI and FP injury on vascular and neuronal cystoskeletal integrity, which should be considered when utilizing these animal models to study selected features of human head injury.",
