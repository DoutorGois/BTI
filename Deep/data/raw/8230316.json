     "AB": "The synthesis of nerve growth factor (NGF) by the hippocampus raises the possibility that NGF may play a role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA). Subchronic cold stress has been shown to activate the HPAA in a mild noninvasive manner, to stimulate serum glucocorticoid levels, and to perturb NGF binding in hippocampus and basal forebrain. One or repeated episodes of cold stress increased NGF mRNA levels in the hippocampus and p75NGFR mRNA levels in the basal forebrain. These changes were not due to elevated serum glucocorticoid levels since treatment with exogenous corticosterone had no effect on NGF and p75NGFR mRNA levels. Adrenalectomy did not prevent the stress induced increases in NGF and p75NGFR mRNA.",
