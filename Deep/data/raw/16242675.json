     "AB": "Zinc chelation and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been explored as potential neuroprotective agents. However, it remains unknown whether NSAIDs and zinc chelation may converge on a similar cellular process. Using two-photon microscopy to observe hippocampal neurons labeled with a zinc-sensitive dye, we provide evidence that three chemically unrelated NSAIDs, niflumic acid, ibuprofen, and naproxen, acutely increase intracellular zinc stores from extracellular metal pools. Phospholipase A2 inhibitors triggered similar responses, suggesting that NSAIDs likely control zinc stores by their activity as cyclooxygenase inhibitors. These results provide evidence for a new link between cyclooxygenase metabolites and the mechanisms controlling neuronal zinc pools.",
