     "AB": "This study investigated the effects of microinfusion of scopolamine into the medial septum (MS Scp) on hippocampal neurophysiology and learning of the rabbit's classically conditioned jaw movement response. The percentage of hippocampal theta slow waves (2-8 Hz) decreased after drug infusion in the MS Scp group but did not change in control groups that received infusion of saline into the MS or scopolamine into the cortex. Unit recordings from the MS Scp group showed significantly smaller conditioning-related hippocampal neural responses than seen in controls, and during conditioning, rabbits in the MS Scp group took significantly longer to reach learning criterion than either control group. Thus, the neural and behavioral impairments previously reported for systemic muscarinic blockade were reproduced by microinfusions restricted to the medial septal nucleus.",
