     "AB": "Taurine release in mouse hippocampal slices is regulated by several neurotransmitter receptor systems. The ionotropic glutamate receptors and the adenosine receptor A(1) are the most effective. The effect of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors is mediated via activation of the pathway involving nitric oxide and 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate. The activation of excitatory amino acid receptors causes at the same time an increase in taurine release. The activation of adenosine A(1) receptors also potentiates taurine release. The taurine released may counteract any excitotoxic effects of glutamate, particularly in the developing hippocampus.",
