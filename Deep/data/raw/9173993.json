     "AB": "The density of diffuse, primitive, classic and compact beta-amyloid (beta/A4) deposits was studied in the medial temporal lobe in 12 cases of Down's syndrome (DS) from 38 to 67 years of age. Total beta/A4 deposit density was greater in the adjacent cortex compared with regions of the hippocampus, and these differences were similar within each age group of patients. The ratio of the primitive to diffuse deposits was greater in the hippocampus than in the adjacent cortex. Total beta/A4 density did not vary significantly with patient age. However, the density of the diffuse deposits exhibited a parabolic, and the primitive, classic and compact deposits an inverted parabolic, response with age. Hence, in DS, (1) beta/A4 density remains relatively constant with age, (2) differences in beta/A4 density between the hippocampus and adjacent cortex are established at an early age, and (3) mature beta/A4 subtype formation depends on brain region and patient age.",
