     "AB": "Radiosurgical treatment of intractable epilepsy has emerged as a noninvasive alternative to resection. Although gamma knife surgery (GKS) reportedly is effective when the radiation dose is sufficient to cause a destructive reaction in the targeted medial temporal lobe, the optimal target area and dose distribution are largely unknown. Some investigators have suggested that focused irradiation from a nondestructive dose is also effective. In this article the authors report two cases of medial temporal lobe epilepsy in which the patients underwent GKS performed using a 50% marginal dose of 18 Gy covering the amygdala. hippocampal head and body, and parahippocampal gyrus. In both cases this procedure failed to control seizures. Both patients became seizure free after undergoing anterior temporal lobectomy 30 and 16 months, respectively, after radiosurgery.",
