     "AB": "Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex is a measure of sensorimotor gating that is reduced in humans with certain neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, and in rats after manipulations of limbic cortico-striato-pallido-pontine circuitry. We have reported that PPI is reduced after specific manipulations of the hippocampal complex (HPC) in rats, but the mechanisms for these effects remain poorly understood. For example, dopaminergic substrates clearly regulate PPI, but the PPI-disruptive effects of intra-HPC carbachol or NMDA are not reversed by D2 receptor antagonists. This study examined the anatomical specificity within the hippocampal complex of the PPI-disruptive effects of NMDA infusion. Startle magnitude and PPI were assessed after acute bilateral infusion of NMDA (0, 0.4 or 0.8 microg) into the dorsal subiculum (DS), region CA1, the ventral subiculum (VS), the rostral entorhinal cortex (ECr) and the caudal entorhinal cortex (ECc). A dorsal-ventral gradient for NMDA effects was observed, with a dose-dependent disruption of PPI after NMDA infusion into the VS or EC, but not the DS, and with intermediate level effects observed after NMDA infusion into CA1. A second set of studies confirmed that the failure of NMDA effects in the DS did not reflect site-related differences in startle magnitude or baseline levels of PPI. These findings demonstrate the importance of the ventral, but not the dorsal HPC, in the glutamatergic regulation of PPI.",
