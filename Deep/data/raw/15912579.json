     "AB": "One of the roles of the hippocampus is viewed as modifying episodic memory so that it can contribute to form semantic memory. In this paper, we show that pattern completion ability of the hippocampal CA3 and symmetric spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP) induce memory modification so that the hippocampal CA3 can memorize invariable parts of repetitive episodes as essential elements and forget variable parts of them as unnecessary ones.",
