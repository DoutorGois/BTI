     "AB": "Mirtazapine (MIR) is a novel antidepressant, reported to raise extracellular noradrenaline (NA) through blockade of alpha2-autoreceptors and serotonin (5-HT) output via (1) indirect activation of facilitatory alpha1-adrenoceptors on the cell bodies of ascending 5-HT neurones and (2) blockade of presynaptic release-modulating alpha2-heteroreceptors on 5-HT terminals in the forebrain. To further assess the effect of MIR on NA/5-HT system interplay, including putative regional differences in the effects of the drug on 5-HT release in rat forebrain, we used in vivo microdialysis in anaesthetised rats. Probes were implanted in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and frontal cortex (FCx), representing median and dorsal raphe 5-HT projection areas, respectively. In the DH, MIR (10 mg/kg s.c.) completely blocked the 5-HT release-suppressing action of the selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (0.1 mg/kg s.c.), but had no effect per se on the 5-HT output. Neither drug significantly changed the 5-HT levels in the FCx. MIR perfused locally (10 microM via reverse-dialysis) also failed to significantly elevate 5-HT output, and did not affect the clonidine response in either brain area. Thus, the data confirm the basic alpha2-adrenoceptor-blocking properties of MIR, but are only partly concordant with previous studies reporting an increase of 5-HT output after MIR alone. Moreover, we find no elevation in 5-HT by the reference alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (0.3-1.0 mg/kg s.c.). The discrepancies encountered, and the potential ability of alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists in general to raise the output of 5-HT, are discussed with particular reference to methodological and other factors that may influence the experimental outcome (e.g., brain regional aspects, different alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes, potential differences in adrenoceptor tone under varying experimental conditions).",
