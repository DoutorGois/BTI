     "AB": "The present study indicates that in kindled rats there are no differences in the total number or affinity of the binding sites in the temporal cortex and a slight increase in the total number of binding sites in the cortex when compared with controls. These results, in view of our other observations, suggest that in the kindled rat brain there may be an increased release of SRIF but no down-regulation of SRIF receptors in the temporal cortex and cortex. There appears to be a significant decrease in the number of SRIF receptors in kindled hippocampus. The mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear.",
