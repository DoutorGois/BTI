     "AB": "Both ethanol and desipramine influence beta-adrenoceptor regulation. We reported previously that ethanol partially counteracted desipramine's effects on beta-adrenoceptor. Previous studies utilized beta-adrenoceptor radioligands that also bind to 5-HT1B receptors, thus, changes in 5-HT1B receptors could have confounded the results. The effects of chronic ethanol, desipramine and ethanol/desipramine treatment on beta-adrenoceptor coupling efficiency to Gs protein in rat brain were examined using 125I-iodocyanopindolol after blocking binding to 5-HT1B receptors. In the frontal cortex, ethanol uncoupled beta-adrenoceptor from GS. Desipramine decreased beta-adrenoceptor density, particularly in the high-conformational state, with no effect on coupling. In combined treatment, desipramine prevented ethanol-induced uncoupling. In the hippocampus, desipramine enhanced beta-adrenoceptor coupling, but ethanol had no effect. In combination with desipramine, ethanol enhanced desipramine-induced decrease in beta-adrenoceptor density in the high-conformational state, but uncoupled beta-adrenoceptors, an effect not observed with ethanol alone. These results suggest a complex interplay between ethanol and antidepressants in modulating beta-adrenoceptor function.",
