     "AB": "We investigated the effects of permanent bilateral occlusion of the internal carotid arteries (2ICAO) on the learning and memory performances in rats to evaluate the permanent 2ICAO rats as a model for vascular dementia. The learning and memory performance was tested by a step-through passive avoidance task and an 8-arm radial maze task. Permanent 2ICAO decreased cerebral blood flows in the cortex and hippocampus by 46.3 +/- 3.3 and 21.1 +/- 4.6%, respectively, when measured at 15 min after occlusion. In the passive avoidance task, the 2ICAO rats showed no impairment of learning or of memory retention when tested 1 h after learning trial, while they showed a shorter latency than sham-operated rats when tested 24 h after learning trial. In the radial maze learning task, the non-pretrained 2ICAO rats showed impairment. The pretrained 2ICAO rats had no deficit in the radial maze retention task but they showed impaired performance when a 3-min delay was interposed in the task. These results suggest that permanent 2ICAO is a useful animal model for studying vascular dementia.",
