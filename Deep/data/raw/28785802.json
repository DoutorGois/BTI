     "AB": "Tight coupling of neuronal metabolism to synaptic activity is critical to ensure that the supply of metabolic substrates meets the demands of neuronal signaling. Given the impact of temperature on metabolism, and the wide fluctuations of brain temperature observed during clinical hypothermia, we examined the effect of temperature on neurometabolic coupling. Intrinsic fluorescence signals of the oxidized form of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and their ratios, were measured to assess neural metabolic state and local field potentials were recorded to measure synaptic activity in the mouse brain. Brain slice preparations were used to remove the potential impacts of blood flow. Tight coupling between metabolic signals and local field potential amplitudes was observed at a range of temperatures below 29 degrees C. However, above 29 degrees C, the metabolic and synaptic signatures diverged such that FAD signals were diminished, but local field potentials retained their amplitude. It was also observed that the declines in the FAD signals seen at high temperatures (and hence the decoupling between synaptic and metabolic events) are driven by low FAD availability at high temperatures. These data suggest that neurometabolic coupling, thought to be critical for ensuring the metabolic health of the brain, may show temperature dependence, and is related to temperature-dependent changes in FAD supplies.",
