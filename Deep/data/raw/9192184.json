     "AB": "Patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) have asymmetric hippocampal volumes with atrophy that sometimes by visual inspection appears to favor different regions along the longitudinal axis of the affected hippocampus. Histological studies suggest that cell loss may affect the anterior hippocampus preferentially, and that hippocampal sclerosis (HS) limited to the anterior of the hippocampus may indicate better surgical outcome. We used volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): (1) to objectively describe the distribution of volume loss in HS; and (2) to relate this distribution to outcome of temporal lobectomy. Hippocampal volumes and anterior and posterior subvolumes (AHV, PHV) were measured from MP-RAGE MRI in 43 temporal lobectomy patients with MTLE determined by pathological findings of HS and compared to 23 age-matched controls. Atrophy was defined as 'anterior', 'diffuse', 'posterior', or 'normal' depending on position of AHV and PHV relative to the mean +/- 2 S.D. of regional volumes of control hippocampi. Anterior to posterior ratios (APR = AHV/PHV) were also calculated. Mean APR of hippocampi ipsilateral to lobectomy cannot be distinguished from hippocampi contralateral to lobectomy or from controls. AHV and PHV from hippocampi contralateral to temporal lobectomy were smaller than controls but larger than hippocampi ipsilateral to lobectomy. Surgical outcome was independent of longitudinal distribution of atrophy. We determined that overall volume loss in HS is diffuse, neither clearly favoring the head nor body-tail. Surgical outcome for MTLE is not related to the longitudinal distribution of atrophy revealed by volumetric MRI.",
