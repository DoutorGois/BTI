     "AB": "The histochemical distribution of some aminotransferases at various levels through the midbrain and cerebrum and in the peripheral nervous system of the rat has been described. The selective localization of the reaction product in the neurons and the neuropil was the same for the aminotransferases studied. There was a difference in the intensity of the enzyme activity. The white matter was negative, and only the glial cells and the blood vessels exhibit transaminase activity. Some nuclei showed an intensive reaction in the neurons and neuropil: nuel. ruber, substantia nigra, hypothalamic nuclei, Ammon's horn. A high activity was observed in the ganglion cell, and the nerve fibres were negative. There was a great similarity between the pattern of distribution for aminotransferases and that for some dehydrogenases.",
