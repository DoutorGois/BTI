     "AB": "The septo-hippocampal connections appear to be a key element in the neuromodulatory cholinergic control of the hippocampal neurons. The cholinergic neuromodulation is well established in shifting behavioral states of the brain. The pacemaker role of medial septum in the limbic theta rhythm is demonstrated by lesions and pharmacological manipulations of GABAergic neurons, yet the link between the activity of different septal neuronal classes and limbic theta rhythm is not fully understood. We know even less about the information transfer between the medial septum and hippocampus--is there a particular kind of processed information that septo-hippocampal pathways transmit? This review encompasses fundamental findings together with the latest data of septo-hippocampal signal processing to tackle the frontiers of our understanding about the functional significance of medial septum to the hippocampal formation.",
