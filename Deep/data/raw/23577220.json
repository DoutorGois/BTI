     "AB": "2-[(2,6-Dichlorobenzylidene)amino]-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[b]thiophene-3-carbon itrile, 5TIO1, is a new 2-aminothiophene derivative with promising pharmacological activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate its antioxidant activity in different areas of mice central nervous system. Male Swiss adult mice were intraperitoneally treated with Tween 80 dissolved in 0.9% saline (control group) and 5TIO1 (0.1, 1, and 10 mg kg(-1)). Brain homogenates-hippocampus, striatum, frontal cortex, and cerebellum-were obtained after 24 h of observation. Superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, lipid peroxidation and nitrite content were measured using spectrophotometrical methods. To clarify the 5TIO1's mechanism on oxidative stress, western blot analysis of superoxide dismutase and catalase was also performed. 5TIO1 decreased lipid peroxidation and nitrite content in all brain areas and increased the antioxidant enzymatic activities, specially, in cerebellum. The data of Western blot analysis did not demonstrate evidence of the upregulation of these enzymes after the administration of this compound. Our findings strongly support that 5TIO1 can protect the brain against neuronal damages regularly observed during neuropathologies.",
