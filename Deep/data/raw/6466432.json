     "AB": "In cat the relation between various behaviours and the spectral properties of the hippocampal EEG was investigated. Both EEG and behaviour were quantified and results were evaluated statistically. Significant relationships were found between the properties of the hippocampal EEG and motor acts (walking, sitting, eating, stepping and eye movements). These results were compared with those obtained in dog under similar experimental circumstances. Species differences were found particularly regarding the fact that in the cat a dissociation between frequency and amplitude parameters was obtained for some behaviours; this may explain why appreciable differences in the visual interpretation of EEG records of different species are often reported. A simple model of the modulation of hippocampal EEG by brainstem inputs is presented. Particular attention is paid to species differences regarding the anatomy and physiology of the pathways involved in this modulation. It is concluded that in cat a strong relation exists between the modulation of spectral properties of hippocampal EEG and vestibular inputs and/or eye movements. The effects of body acceleration on hippocampal EEG are put in evidence and related to theories of hippocampal function.",
