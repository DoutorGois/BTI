     "AB": "DL-Fenfluramine (20 mg/kg) releasing serotonin and amphetamine (2 mg/kg) releasing dopamine were given to adult rats trained to bar press for electrical stimulation to the medial forebrain bundle. Amphetamine treatment enhanced lever-pressing for 1-2 h. A single fenfluramine treatment rapidly suppressed self-stimulation with slow recovery in 5-7 days to a rate below the initial basal rate. A second treatment a week later again suppressed response rate and rates returned to a still lower baseline. Combined fenfluramine-amphetamine treatment at this time transiently abolished lever pressing for 1-3 h followed by 9-11 h of enhanced responding. The serotonin antagonist, ketanserine (0.1 mg/kg), but not cyproheptadine (0.1 mg/kg i.p.), partially protected against the effects of fenfluramine. The serotonin agonist, quipazine (0.5 mg/kg), but not dimethoxyiodophenylisopropylamine (DOI) (2.2 mg/kg), partially substituted for fenfluramine in the combined treatment. Fenfluramine markedly depleted serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in frontal cortex, hippocampus, and caudate putamen. Ventral and midline midbrain regions were less affected. Combined fenfluramine and amphetamine treatment elevated dopamine levels in frontal cortex, hippocampus and caudate-putamen, but not in midbrain. These findings support a serotonin-dopamine interaction in self-stimulation behavior and suggest that repeated fenfluramine treatment results in chronic low level serotonergic stimulation and diminished serotonin storage capacity.",
