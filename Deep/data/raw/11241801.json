     "AB": "Borna disease virus (BDV) is unique amongst animal RNA viruses in its molecular biology and capacity to cause persistent, noncytolytic CNS-infection in a wide variety of host species. Unlike other non-segmented negative-strand RNA animal viruses, BDV replicates in the nucleus of the host cell where splicing is employed for expression of a very compact genome. Epidemiological studies indicate a broad host range and geographical distribution, and some investigators have proposed that human infection may result in neuropsychiatric disorders. Experimental Borna disease in neonatal and adult rats provides an intriguing model for immune-mediated disturbances of brain development and function.",
