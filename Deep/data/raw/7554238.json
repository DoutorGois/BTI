     "AB": "The activity of the polyamine interconversion pathway was investigated in the hippocampus and piriform cortex after systemic KA administration in juvenile rats. Pretreatment of 7-day-old rats with the polyamine oxidase inhibitor, MDL 72527, induced a similar accumulation of N-acetylspermidine and N-acetylspermine in control and kainate-treated animals. The results indicate that KA-induced seizure activity has no effect on the polyamine interconversion pathway in developing rat brain.",
