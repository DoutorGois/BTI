     "AB": "Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) is a newly developed noninvasive imaging technique of brain activities. The signal intensity of MEMRI reflects cumulative activities of the neurons. To validate the use of MEMRI technique to investigate the neural mechanisms of learning and memory, we tried to map brain areas involved in the retrieval of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) memory. CTAs were established to saccharin (conditioned stimulus: CS) by pairing its ingestion with an i.p. injection of LiCl (unconditioned stimulus: US). LiCl solutions (as a robust aversion chemical) of 0.15 M were injected i.p. 15 min after drinking the saccharine solution (CS). After the two times conditionings, these rats showed a robust aversion to the saccharine solution (CS). Rats of the control group were injected saline i.p. instead of LiCl solutions. The MRI signal intensities at the gustatory cortex (GC), the core subregion of the nucleus accumbens (NAcC), the shell subregion of the nucleus accumbens (NAcSh), the ventral pallidum (VP), the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA), the lateral hypothalamus (LH), and the basolateral nucleus of amygdala (BLA) of the conditioned group were higher than those of the control group. There were no significant differences between the conditioned and the control groups in the intensities for other regions, such as the striatum area, motor cortex, cingulate cortex, interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure and hippocampus. These indicate that the GC, NAcC, NAcSh, VP, CeA, LH and BLA have important roles in the memory retrieval of CTA.",
