     "AB": "The mechanism underlying impaired learning and memory in Alzheimer's disease is not fully elucidated. The phosphorylation of cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (pCREB) in the hippocampus is thought to be a critical initiating step in the formation of long-term memories. Here, we tested CRE-driven gene expression following learning in mice harboring the familial Alzheimer's disease-linked APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mutations using CRE-beta galactosidase reporter. We show that young adult APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice exhibit impaired recognition memory and reduced levels of pCREB, and its cofactors CREB binding protein (CBP) and p-300 following a learning task, compared to their wild type littermate counterparts. Impairments in learning-induced activation of CREB in these mice are manifested by reduced CRE-driven gene transcription. Importantly, expression of the CRE-driven immediate early gene, Egr-1 (Zif268) is decreased in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. These studies implicate defective CREB-dependent plasticity in the mechanism underlying learning and memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease.",
