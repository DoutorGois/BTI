     "AB": "Serotonergic fibers have a general feature of extending diffusely throughout the brain and appear to innervate broad areas rather uniformly. The present study revealed marked regional difference in their immunoreactivities against serotonin transporter by using two antibodies that recognize either N- or C-terminal domain of the transporter. C-terminal-specific labeling was ubiquitous, whereas N-terminal-specific labeling was confined to hippocampal CA1 region, somatosensory cortex, and other areas, suggesting novel non-uniformity in the serotonergic system.",
