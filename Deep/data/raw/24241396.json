     "AB": "Limited neuronal migration into host brain tissue is a key challenge in neural transplantation. We found that one important mechanism underlying this phenomenon is an intrinsic chemotactic interaction between the grafted neural precursor cells (NPCs) and their neuronal progeny. NPCs secrete the receptor tyrosine kinase ligands FGF2 and VEGF, which act as chemoattractants for neurons. Interference with these signaling pathways resulted in enhanced migration of human neurons from neural clusters.",
