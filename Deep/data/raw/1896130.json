     "AB": "Quantitative evaluation of octadecaneuropeptide-like immunoreactivity (ODN-Li) was carried out in hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum of group-reared or three month isolated male Wistar rats, whether muricidal or not. ODN-Li was lower in cortex and cerebellum of isolated animals, (mainly in muricidal) than of group-reared ones. A similar trend was apparent in the hippocampus. No significant differences were observed between muricidal and non-muricidal animals. The results are discussed in terms of the involvement of the endogenous ligands of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex in the integrations related to mood and behaviour.",
