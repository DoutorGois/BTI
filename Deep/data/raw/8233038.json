     "AB": "L-Amino-3-phosphonopropionate (L-AP3), a putative antagonist of metabotropic glutamate receptors, inhibited the formation of [3H]inositol phosphates induced by (1S,3R)1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid in rat hippocampal slices. The inhibition was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of [3H]phosphatidylinositols ([3H]PIs). Preincubation of slices with L-AP3 inhibited the incorporation of [3H]myo-inositol into PI fractions. The effects of L-AP3 was in contrast with those of a typical receptor antagonist, atropine; atropine inhibited carbachol-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis, but the levels of [3H]PIs were not affected. These findings suggest that the inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by L-AP3 is not due to the receptor antagonism but may be caused by the inhibition of synthesis of PIs.",
