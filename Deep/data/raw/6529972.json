     "AB": "In previous studies we suggested that corticosterone may modulate hippocampal functioning during memory formation. To test this assumption, we studied the effects of posttrial administration of corticosterone (1 microgram) injected bilaterally in the hippocampus. The treatment was applied at different time intervals after the learning session and the retention session took place 24 h later. Using appetitive operant conditioning tasks in a Skinner box, we found that the posttrial treatment 1) did not affect the retention of a continuously reinforced schedule, 2) improved the retention of a successive discrimination learning task, and 3) was still effective when given 3 h after the acquisition of this task, but not after 6 h. Taken together, the results suggest that corticosterone modulates the hippocampal mechanisms involved in behavioral suppression during memory formation.",
