     "AB": "The effect of prenatal malnutrition, produced by protein deprivation, on postnatal neurogenesis of granule cells in the fascia dentata of the rat hippocampal formation was examined by injecting tritiated thymidine on P8 and P15 and sacrificing the pups on P30, or by injecting on P30 and sacrificing on P90. The number of labeled granule cells was significantly decreased in prenatally malnourished rats injected on P8, and unaffected in those injected on P15. In contrast, the number of labeled granule cells in prenatally malnourished rats was significantly increased in animals injected in P30. The study shows that prenatal malnutrition significantly alters the postnatal pattern of granule cell neurogenesis in rat hippocampal formation and that the effect persists despite nutritional rehabilitation at birth.",
