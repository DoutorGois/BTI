     "AB": "The supramammillary nucleus (SUM) of the hypothalamus sends neural projections to the hippocampus and is supposed to be involved in learning and memory. To test the possibility that SUM afferents modulate hippocampal functions, we investigated the effect of electrical stimulation of the SUM on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at medial perforant path (PP)--granule cell synapses in the dentate gyrus (DG) of anaesthetized rats. High-frequency stimulation of the SUM (100 pulses at 100 Hz) alone did not change PP--DG field potentials. However, when the SUM stimulation was applied simultaneously with weak tetanic stimulation of the PP (20 pulses at 20 Hz) which alone did not induce any potentiation, it produced a long-lasting potentiation of the population spike, without an accompanying increase in the population excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). The EPSP-spike (E-S) potentiation induced by pairing SUM and PP stimulation was abolished by lesions of the fimbria--fornix, a major pathway of SUM afferents. SUM stimulation applied 1 s before or after PP stimulation failed to produce E-S potentiation, and SUM stimulation augmented PP--DG field potentials during tetanic stimulation. Furthermore, the E-S potentiation was abolished by blocking GABAergic neurotransmission with picrotoxin. These results suggest that coactivation of SUM and PP inputs produces a long-lasting increase of granule cell excitability by modulating GABAergic inhibition. SUM afferents may contribute to associative memory processing by modulating hippocampal excitability.",
