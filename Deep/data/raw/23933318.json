     "AB": "Although much recent evidence has demonstrated that neuroinflammation contributes to volatile anesthetic-induced cognitive deficits, there are few existing mechanistic explanations for this inflammatory process. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of the volatile anesthetic isoflurane on canonical nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling, and to explore its association with hippocampal interleukin (IL)-1beta levels and anesthetic-related cognitive changes in aged rats. After a 4-h exposure to 1.5% isoflurane in 20-month-old rats, increases in IkappaB kinase and IkappaB phosphorylation, as well as a reduction in the NF-kappaB inhibitory protein (IkappaBalpha), were observed in the hippocampi of isoflurane-exposed rats compared with control rats. These events were accompanied by an increase in NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation at 6h after isoflurane exposure and hippocampal IL-1beta elevation from 1 to 6h after isoflurane exposure. Nevertheless, no significant neuroglia activation was observed. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate markedly suppressed the IL-1beta increase and NF-kappaB signaling, and also mitigated the severity of cognitive deficits in the Morris water maze task. Overall, our results demonstrate that isoflurane-induced cognitive deficits may stem from upregulation of hippocampal IL-1beta, partially via activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway, in aged rats.",
