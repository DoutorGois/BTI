     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Surgical extirpation of medial temporal (AVMs) arteriovenous malformations has been one of the most challenging issues in neurosurgery. Yasargil classified mediobasal AVM into four subtypes: amygdala, anterior hippocampal, middle hippocampal, and posterior hippocampal lesions. The lesions around the trigone extending forward to the temporal horn, and medially adjacent to the midbrain, can be referred to as posterior hippocampal AVMs. The therapeutic indications and operative approaches for these lesions remain controversial. METHODS: Nine patients underwent surgical resection for AVMs of the posterior hippocampus using a laterobasal approach. RESULTS: In four patients, AVMs were located chiefly within the lateral ventricle, and the lesions were resected using a laterobasal approach through the occipitotemporal sulcus, or through a hematoma cavity within the fusiform gyrus. Clinical improvement followed the procedure in three of four patients. In the remaining five patients, the nidi were located chiefly within the ambient cistern, extending upward to the basal ganglia. Contralateral hemiparesis occurred in three patients. Two patients showed marked improvement following an initial decline in neurologic status. CONCLUSIONS: A laterobasal transventricular approach is suitable for ventricular AVMs, whereas only limited exposure can be afforded through a transventricular, transchoroidal fissure route for the AVMs within the ambient cistern. For these lesions, a conventional subtemporal approach to the tentorial incisura is preferable.",
