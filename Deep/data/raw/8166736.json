     "AB": "We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding human hippocalcin from a human hippocampus cDNA library. This clone (hHLP1) consists of 840 nucleotides, including the entire open reading frame of 582 nucleotides, 10 nucleotides of the 5' leader and 248 nucleotides of the 3' noncoding regions. Comparison of the human hippocalcin sequence with the corresponding rat sequence revealed an amino acid identity of 100% and nucleotide identity of 92%. Northern blot analysis showed that a single transcript at a position corresponding to 2.0 kb was detected only in the brain. The human hippocalcin gene was mapped to chromosome 1 by amplification of human hippocalcin-specific DNA fragment on DNA from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids by using the polymerase chain reaction.",
