     "AB": "The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has recently emerged as a possible molecular mediator of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. Long-term potentiation (LTP) within the hippocampus and hippocampally dependent behaviors has been the primary model for examining the role of BDNF in learning and memory. However, these studies are limited by an incomplete understanding of the complex behavioral function of hippocampal circuitry, making it difficult to unravel the molecular machinery responsible for the formation and storage of these memories. In contrast, the amygdala and its role in Pavlovian fear conditioning promise to provide us with new insights into the mechanisms of BDNF-mediated synaptic plasticity during the learning and memory process. This article reviews the different levels of research on BDNF in learning and memory. The focus is primarily on the use of Pavlovian fear conditioning as a learning model that allows for the examination of the role of BDNF in the amygdala, following a single learning session and within a well-understood neural circuit.",
