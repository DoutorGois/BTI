     "AB": "Delayed neuronal death in the CA1 of the hippocampus following global ischemia has been evoked by both the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NR) and the generate reactive oxygen species in the neurons. In the present study, we investigated whether oxidative DNA damages may be correlated with NR subunits (NR1 and NR2A/B) expression following ischemia insults in vivo. Thirty minutes after ischemia-reperfusion, the intensities of both NR and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) immunoreactivities were markedly increased in neurons of CA1. However, NR2A/B and 8-OHdG immunoreactivities were enhanced in CA1 over 24 h after ischemia although NR1 immunoreactivity was decreased. These results suggest that oxidative stress and excitotoxicity in the CA1 may simultaneously trigger neuronal damages at early time after ischemia, and free radical damage including oxidative DNA damage may eventually promote the delayed neuronal death in this region.",
