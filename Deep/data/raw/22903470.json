     "AB": "Cold restraint stress (CRS) model exerts similar effect as physiological stress because it combines emotional stress (escape reaction) and physical stress (muscle work). It is well established that various responses to stress are regulated by sympathoadrenal system, brain monoaminergic systems and oxidative processes. Nardostachys jatamansi (NJE) is known to possess soothing and sedative action on the central nervous system. The present investigation was performed to explore the anti-stress activity of NJE on CRS model, through its effect on biochemical and neurochemical alterations. The rats were restrained in metallic chambers for 3 h at 4 degrees C was followed by sacrifice and assessment of stress related alterations. Hydro-ethanolic (30:70) extract of NJE was administrated orally at the doses of 200 and 500 mg/kg for 14 days and compared with vehicle control and Panax ginseng (100 mg/kg). Effects of NJE on CRS induced oxidative stress including reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-s-transferase were estimated. Dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid were measured in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus by HPLC electrochemical detector. NJE at both doses significantly inhibited CRS induced oxidative stress. It significantly mitigated CRS induced altered level of neurotransmitters in different brain regions. The study implied that NJE has the ability to provide protection against CRS induced oxidative stress and neurochemical alterations. Findings indicated that NJE revealed potent anti-stress effect implicating its therapeutic importance in stress-related disorders.",
