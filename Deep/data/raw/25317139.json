     "AB": "Genistein is one of several isoflavones that has a structure similar to 17beta-estradiol, has a strong antioxidant effect, and a high affinity to estrogen receptors. At 15 weeks after ovariectomy, the expression of Bcl-2 in the hippocampus of rats decreased and Bax expression increased, with an obvious upregulation of apoptosis. However, intraperitoneal injection of genistein or 17beta-estradiol for 15 consecutive weeks from the second day after operation upregulated Bcl-2 protein expression, downregulated Bax protein expression, and attenuated hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Our experimental findings indicate that long-term intervention with genistein can lead to a decrease in apoptosis in hippocampal neurons following ovariectomy, upregulate the expression of Bcl-2, and downregulate the expression of Bax. In addition, genistein and 17beta-estradiol play equal anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective roles.",
