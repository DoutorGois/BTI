     "AB": "This study reports the changes in lipids and proteins of different brain areas of nicotine, D+-amphetamine, and nicotine and D+-amphetamine treated rats by monitoring lipid peroxidation and protein beta-sheet formation using infrared microspectroscopy. Compared with the untreated brain samples, the peroxide level is relatively higher in the amphetamine-treated brain sections, both in the cortex and hippocampus area. However, this peroxide increase is attenuated when administering amphetamine plus nicotine. Analogous drug-dependent trends for protein beta-sheet content are observed, which suggests a connection between lipid oxidation involved in oxidative stress and beta-sheet protein structure generally present in neurodegenerative diseases. The above property of nicotine is of interest, in the sense that it might reduce the production of beta-amyloid proteins in Alzheimer's disease.",
