     "AB": "Because long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are thought to be involved in learning and memory, it is important to delineate factors that modulate their induction and persistence, especially as studied in freely moving animals. Here, we investigated the effects of rat strain, circadian cycle, and high-frequency stimulation (HFS) pattern on LTP and concurrently induced LTD in the dentate gyrus (DG). Comparison of two commonly used rat strains revealed that medial perforant path field EPSP-population spike (E-S) coupling and LTP were greater in Long-Evans than Sprague-Dawley rats. Circadian cycle experiments conducted in Long-Evans rats revealed greater E-S coupling and enhanced LTP during the dark phase. Interestingly, concurrent LTD in the lateral perforant path did not significantly differ across strains or circadian cycle. Testing HFS protocols during the dark phase revealed that theta burst stimulation (100 Hz bursts at 5 Hz intervals) was ineffective in eliciting either LTP or concurrent LTD in DG, whereas 400 Hz bursts delivered at theta (5 Hz) or delta (1 Hz) frequencies produced substantial LTP and concurrent LTD. Thus, these natural and experimental factors regulate granule cell excitability, and differentially affect LTP and concurrent LTD in the DG of freely moving rats. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",
