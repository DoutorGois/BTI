     "AB": "Adrenalectomy alters endogenous phosphorylation of the presynaptic protein, B50, in the hippocampus. Three and four days following adrenalectomy decreases are seen, relative to control values, in the in vitro phosphorylation of B50 when a synaptic plasma membrane fraction from the hippocampus is incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP. At four days post-adrenalectomy, the percent decrease in B50 phosphorylation is -49.8 +/- 6.8%. No alteration is seen in the level of B50 phosphorylation when comparing hippocampal membrane preparations from sham-operated and intact animals. Fourteen days following adrenalectomy, hippocampal B50 phosphorylation was restored to normal levels. Hypophysectomy did not alter the degree of in vitro B50 phosphorylation, but the effect of adrenalectomy occurred in hypophysectomized rats. Following adrenalectomy, no differences are seen in the phosphorylation of any hippocampal cytosolic proteins. Changes in B50 phosphorylation seen in hypothalamic synaptic plasma membranes are likely due to the effects of sham-operation. The results indicate that a transient neurochemical or neuroendocrine event following adrenalectomy modulates in vivo the degree of B50 phosphorylation in hippocampal synaptic membranes.",
