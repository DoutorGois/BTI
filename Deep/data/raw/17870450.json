     "AB": "To determine if the inhibitory effects of ketamine on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 are involved in reduction of the hyperglycemia-exaggerated cerebral ischemic lesion, rats with normoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or hyperglycemia supplemented with ketamine were subjected to 15 min of forebrain ischemia, and then, reperfusion for 0.5, 1, and 3h. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the brain tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. In rats with normoglycemia, we demonstrated a moderate increase of the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the cingulum cortex and hippocampus CA3 following an ischemic intervention. It quickly dropped to control levels after reperfusion for 0.5h. In rats with hyperglycemia, however, the increase of the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in these areas was significantly higher in all animals reperfused. The neuronal death, detected by the TdT-mediated-dUTP nick end labeling assays, was found in the cingulum cortex (5.23+/-2.34, per high power feild) and hippocampus CA3 areas (6.29+/-3.68, per 1mm(2)) in hyperglycemic group after reperfusion for 3h. With ketamine treatment, the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cingulum cortex and hippocampus CA1 and CA3 areas was found to be the same as that in normoglycemia rats. Our results suggest that hyperglycemia may increase the ischemic insult through modulation of the signal transduction pathways involving ERK1/2. The inhibitory effects of ketamine on the hyperglycemia-activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation are probably through inhibition of the N-methyl d-aspartate-mediated calcium influx, which subsequently reduce the hyperglycemia-exaggerated cerebral damage.",
