     "AB": "PURPOSES: To determine (1)H-MRSI metabolites changes in interictal and postictal phases of patients suffering from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis and lateralization of seizure foci. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR spectroscopic imaging was performed in 5 adult patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy interictally and immediately after the seizure and in 4 adult control subjects. All patients underwent MR imaging and VideoEEG Monitoring. RESULTS: The results showed statistically significant decreases in N-acetylaspartate/Creatine, N-acetylaspartate/Choline and N-acetylaspartate/(creatine+choline) immediately after ictus in ipsilateral hippocampus as compared with control data and contralateral hippocampus of patients while no statistically significant difference was presented in interictal phase. CONCLUSION: The present study clearly indicates (1)H-MRS abnormalities following an ictus of temporal lobe epilepsy with metabolite recovery in interictal phase. This finding suggests postictal (1)H-MRS as a possible useful tool to assist in lateralizing and localizing of seizure foci in epileptic patients with structural lesions.",
