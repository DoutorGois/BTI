     "AB": "We studied the effects of nitric oxide (NO) on the Ca2+-dependent KCl-evoked release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by rat hippocampal synaptosomes, measured in the presence of 1-(2-(((diphenyl-methylene)amino)oxy)ethyl)-1,2,5, 6-tetrahydro-3-pyridine-carboxylic acid (NNC-711), which blocks the GABA carrier. Under these conditions, the NO donor, hydroxylamine, up to 1 mM, inhibited the Ca2+-dependent exocytotic GABA release, but did not affect the basal release. However, in the absence of NNC-711, hydroxylamine concentrations higher than 30 microM caused a two-fold increase in the basal release of GABA, and the KCl-evoked release of GABA was higher than in the presence of NNC-711 because both exocytotic and carrier-mediated release occur. Thus, it is expected that when both release mechanisms are operative, NO inhibits the exocytotic release and stimulates the carrier-mediated release, and the overall effect is an increased liberation of the neurotransmitter from the nerve terminals.",
