     "AB": "Search for indicators of neurodegenerative disorders is a hot topic where much research remains to be done. Our aim was to determine proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectra of brain metabolites in the trimethyltin (TMT) model of neurodegeneration. Male Wistar rats were subjected to TMT or saline and were sacrificed on day 3 or 24 after administration. (1)H-NMR spectrum was measured on the 600 MHz Varian VNMRS spectrometer in nano-probe in the volume of 40 mul of hippocampal extracts. TMT administration resulted in reduction of the hippocampal weight on day 24. Of the sixteen identified metabolite spectra, decreased aspartate and increased glutamine contents were observed in the initial asymptomatic stage of neurodegeneration on day 3 in hippocampal extracts of TMT exposed rats compared to sham animals. Increased myo-inositol content was observed on day 24. The presented data provide further knowledge about this experimental model and putative indicators of neuronal damage.",
