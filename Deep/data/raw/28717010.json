     "AB": "Synaptic strength at excitatory synapses is determined by the presence of glutamate receptors (i.e. AMPA, NMDA, and kainate receptors) at the synapse. Synaptic strength is modulated by multiple factors including assembly of different receptor subunits, interaction with auxiliary subunits, and post-translational modifications of either the receptors or their auxiliary subunits. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the intracellular region of neuropilin and tolloid-like proteins (Neto) 1 and Neto2, the auxiliary subunits of kainate receptor (KARs), are phosphorylated by multiple kinases in vitro Specifically, Neto2 was phosphorylated at serine 409 (Ser-409) by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase A (PKA) both in vitro and in heterologous cells. Interestingly, we observed a substantial increase in Neto2 Ser-409 phosphorylation in the presence of CaMKII, and this phosphorylation was reduced in the presence of the KAR subunit GluK1 or GluK2. We also found endogenous phosphorylation of Neto2 at Ser-409 in the brain. Moreover, Neto2 Ser-409 phosphorylation inhibited synaptic targeting of GluK1 because, unlike WT Neto2 and the phosphodeficient mutant Neto2 S409A, the Neto2 S409D phosphomimetic mutant impeded GluK1 trafficking to synapses. These results support a molecular mechanism by which Neto2 phosphorylation at Ser-409 helps restrict GluK1 targeting to the synapse.",
