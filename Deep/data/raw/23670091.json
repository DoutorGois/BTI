     "AB": "The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of (2S)-5, 2', 5'-trihydroxy-7-methoxyflavanone (TMF), a natural product from Abacopteris penangiana (Hook.) Ching, in oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration models in vitro and in vivo. In PC12 cells, preincubation of TMF (3-20 muM) for 24 h decreased the dopamine-induced toxicity and attenuated the redox imbalance in PC12 cells through regulating the ratio of reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), which is a sensitive marker of oxidative stress. Additionally, long-term intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of TMF (4 or 8 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks significantly improved the behavioral performance of D-galactose (D-gal) treated mice in a Morris water maze test. Biochemical analysis revealed that TMF inhibited the activation of AP-1 (activator protein-1) and upregulated the level of BDNF (brain derived neurophic factor) as well as the ratio of GSH/GSSG in the hippocampus of D-gal treated mice. Furthermore, western blotting analysis indicated that TMF increased phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Therefore, the natural product TMF possessed a potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",
