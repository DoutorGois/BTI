     "AB": "Whole-transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) has been used to analyze changes in the expression of dopaminergic genes that encode proteins involved in the synthesis, inactivation, and neurotransmission of dopamine in the striatum, ventral tegmental area, raphe nuclei of the midbrain, hypothalamus, and hippocampus of male mice subjected to chronic social defeat. The expression of Th, Ddc, and Slc6A3 (Dat1) was upregulated, while that of Ppp1r1b and Sncg was downregulated in the ventral tegmental area; the expression of Th, Ddc, Drd2, and Sncg was downregulated in the raphe nuclei of midbrain; the expression of Th, Aldh2, and Ppp1r1b was upregulated, while that of capital EM, Cyrillicsmall a, Cyrillicsmall o, Cyrillicsmall a, Cyrillic was downregulated in the hypothalamus; Drd1 and Snca expression was downregulated and that of Sncb was upregulated in the striatum, and Sncb expression was upregulated in the hippocampus. There were no statistically significant changes in the expression of Comt, Maob, Drd3, Drd4, or Drd5 in the brain areas analyzed in stressed male mice (compared to control animals). Thus, the number of differentially expressed dopaminergic genes and the direction of expression changes in male mice experiencing chronic stress are specific to regions of the brain.",
