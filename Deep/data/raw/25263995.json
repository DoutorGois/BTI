     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Abnormal structural/functional connectivity has been proposed to underlie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, the biochemical basis of abnormal connectivity remains undefined. METHODS: We undertook a shotgun lipidomic analysis of over 700 lipids across 26 lipid subclasses in the frontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects and hippocampus of G72/G30 transgenic mice. RESULTS: We demonstrate that glycosphingolipids and choline plasmalogens, structural lipid pools in myelin, are significantly elevated in the frontal cortex obtained from patients suffering from schizophrenia and the hippocampus of G72/G30 transgenic mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that structural lipid alterations in oligodendrocyte glycosynapses are responsible for dysconnectivity in schizophrenia and that increased expression of G72 protein may play a role in the development of abnormal glycosynapses.",
