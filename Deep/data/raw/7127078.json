     "AB": "Des-enkephalin-gamma-endorphin (beta-endorphin6-17; DE gamma E) causes a significant reduction of the serotonin concentration of the raphe area of the mesencephalon and of the dorsal hippocampus of the rat. DE gamma E does not, however, alter the pargyline-induced accumulation of serotonin in either of these two brain regions or in the mediobasal hypothalamus. Des-Tyr1-a-endorphin (beta-endorphin2-16; DTaE), on the other hand, inhibits the accumulation of serotonin following MAO-inhibition by pargyline in all 3 brain regions, while, in addition to causing a transient reduction in the serotonin concentration of the raphe area, it decreases the serotonin concentration of the mediobasal hypothalamus. These results indicate that DE gamma E and DTaE, which have been shown to exert opposite effects on behavior in various behavioral tests, both affect regional serotonin metabolism in rat brain and that they do so differently.",
