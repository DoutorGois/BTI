     "AB": "Melanocortin receptor four (MC4R) is implicated in regulation of stress-related functions. We previously demonstrated that intranasal infusion of MC4R antagonist HS014, shortly before single prolonged stress (SPS) animal model of post-traumatic stress disorder, lessened the development of anxiety- and depression-like behavior depending on the dose. Here, we evaluated effects of HS014 on SPS-elicited changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and expression of several genes of interest in mediobasal hypothalamus, hippocampus, and locus coeruleus. Rats were given intranasal infusion of HS014 (3.5 ng or 100 mug) and 30 min later subjected to SPS stressors. Short-term responses of HS014 rats in comparison with vehicle-treated, evident 30 min following SPS stressors, included smaller rise in plasma corticosterone (100 mug HS014), absence of induction of corticotrophin-releasing hormone mRNA in mediobasal hypothalamus and of mRNA for tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta hydroxylase in locus coeruleus. Long-term responses found 7 days after SPS stressors, included lower induction corticotrophin-releasing hormone mRNA levels in the mediobasal hypothalamus without effect on mRNAs for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5), a component of GR co-chaperone complex; and no induction of GR protein in ventral hippocampus. Thus, antagonism of MC4R prior to SPS attenuates development of several abnormalities in gene expression in regions implicated in post-traumatic stress disorder. Blockade of brain melanocortine receptor 4 (MC4R) with intranasal infusion of the MC4R antagonist HS014 to rats prior to single prolonged stress (SPS) leads to faster termination of stress responses (30 min later) and prevents or attenuates SPS-triggered abnormal gene expression related to post-traumatic stress disorder (7 days later). Targeting of brain MC4R is a promising strategy to protect HPA axis, LC-NE (locus coeruleus-norepinephrine) systems and hippocampus from overstimulation.",
