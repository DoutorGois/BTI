     "AB": "Recent studies have proposed that chronic treatment with antidepressants increases neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. However, the effect of antidepressants on fetal neural stem cells (NSCs) has not been well defined. Our study shows the dose-dependent effects of fluoxetine on the proliferation and neural differentiation of NSCs. Fluoxetine, even at nanomolar concentrations, stimulated proliferation of NSCs and increased the number of betaIII-tubulin (Tuj 1)- and neural nucleus marker (NeuN)-positive cells, but not glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells. These results suggest that fluoxetine can enhance neuronal differentiation. In addition, fluoxetine has protective effects against cell death induced by oligomeric amyloid beta (Abeta(42)) peptides. Taken together, these results clearly show that fluoxetine promotes both the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSCs and exerts protective effects against Abeta(42)-induced cytotoxicities in NSCs, which suggest that the use of fluoxetine is applicable for cell therapy for various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases by its actions in NSCs.",
