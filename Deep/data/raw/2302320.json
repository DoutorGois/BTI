     "AB": "The experiments examine the effects of cortical lesions on a variety of behaviours in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus). Gerbils with either large anterior or posterior lesions were compared with normal gerbils by administering a battery of tests of rodent behaviours such as grooming, eating, social interaction, ventral marking and foot-stomping. In a second experiment, a more detailed investigation was carried out of the effects of focal cortical lesions on ventral marking. The results of these experiments suggest that anterior cortical lesions in gerbils give rise to a number of different deficits in behaviour. The results further suggest that cingulate cortex is part of the neural substrate for ventral marking behaviour. The implications of these results for contemporary theories of frontal lobe function are discussed.",
