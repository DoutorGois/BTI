     "AB": "The pyruvate metabolic response to the 1st exposure (exposure on the 1st day) to immobilization stress (IMO) were considerably altered by lesions of the periventricular arcuate nucleus (ARC), ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), stria terminalis (ST) and dorsal fornix (FX). The pyruvate metabolic responses to IMO were completely abolished by seven times repetition of exposure to IMO in the rabbits with lesions of ARC and VMH; they were similar to sham-operated groups. In rabbits with lesions of ST and FX, the pyruvate metabolic responses to the 7th exposure (exposure on the 7th day) to IMO were almost the same as those after the 1st exposure to IMO, but these metabolic responses were completely abolished by the seven times repetition of exposure to IMO in the sham-operated animals. These results suggest that firstly the ARC, VMH, amygdala (AMYG)-ST system and dorsal hippocampus (HPC)-FX system are involved in the pyruvate metabolic responses to the 1st exposure to IMO, and secondly, that the AMYG-ST system and the HPC-FX system are involved in the disappearance process of pyruvate metabolic responses to IMO by the daily repetition of exposure to IMO.",
