In this work we present the results of fMRI time-series analysis performed to identify the process of dysregulation of dynamic interaction between different limbic system regions in healthy adults in state of increased anxiety. The results obtain for 65 healthy adults using nonlinear dynamics methods like fractal dimension confirm the key roles of the bilateral amygdala, bilateral hippocampus, BA9 (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and BA45 (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) in modulating emotional response in healthy adults. For different regions of interest (ROIs) significant correlations were found not only for the neutral respective rest but also for fear and angry contrasts.",
