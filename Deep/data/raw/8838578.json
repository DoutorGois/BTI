     "AB": "The actin-binding protein drebrin is localized in postsynaptic terminals in adult brain and is considered to be related to synaptic plasticity. Immunocytochemical study demonstrated that widespread drebrin immunoreactivity was observed in hippocampal formations of control human brains, while Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains showed remarkable reductions in this immunoreactivity. Western blot analysis demonstrated that drebrin E (116kD) as well as drebrin A (125 kD) presented in adult human brains, and that these isoforms were decreased in parallel in AD brains. On the other hand, synaptic vesicle-specific 38-kD protein (SVP-38), a presynaptic marker was not so changed in AD brains in comparison with control brains by both techniques. These findings suggest that drebrin E and A in the adult human brain may be co-localized in postsynaptic terminals, and that drebrin may be more sensitive as a marker of synaptic damage than SVP-38, and that the disappearance of drebrin may contribute to the pathogenesis of memory disturbance in AD.",
