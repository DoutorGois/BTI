     "AB": "Regional brain glucose utilization was investigated in lean and fatty Zucker rats when feeding status was changed. Ad-lib-fed fat rats exhibited lower glucose utilization in the central amygdala than ad-lib-fed lean rats. Food deprivation for 72 h enhanced glucose utilization in the ventromedial hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamic area of both phenotypes, hippocampus of fat rats, mammillary body and ventral tegmental area of leans. These results suggest association of the central amygdala with the development of genetic obesity and of the latter 5 areas with hunger-motivated behaviors.",
