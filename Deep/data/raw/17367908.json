     "AB": "Some studies suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction may be related to the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. In this work, we evaluated the activity of citrate synthase in rats, and the effects of the treatment with mood stabilizers (lithium and valproate) on the enzyme activity. In the first experiment (reversal treatment), amphetamine or saline were administered to rats for 14 days, and between day 8 and 14, rats were treated with either lithium, valproate or saline. In the second experiment (prevention treatment), rats were pretreated with lithium, valproate or saline, and between day 8 and 14, rats were administered amphetamine or saline. In reversal and prevention models, amphetamine administration significantly inhibited citrate synthase activity in rat hippocampus. In amphetamine-pretreated animals, valproate administration reversed citrate synthase activity inhibition induced by amphetamine. In the prevention model, pretreatment with lithium prevented amphetamine-induced citrate synthase inhibition. Our results showed that amphetamine inhibited citrate synthase activity and that valproate reversed and lithium prevented the enzyme inhibition.",
