     "AB": "While dopamine is likely to modulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity, there has been little information about how dopamine affects synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. The expression of IEGs including c-fos has been associated with late phase LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The induction of c-fos by dopaminergic receptor activation in the rat hippocampus was investigated by using semiquantitative RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. The hippocampal slices which were not treated with dopamine showed little expression of c-fos mRNA. However, the induction of c-fos mRNA was detected as early as 5 min after dopamine treatment, peaked at 60 min, and remained elevated 5 h after treatment. Temporal profiles of increases in c-fos mRNA by R(+)-SKF-38393 (50 microM) and forskolin (50 microM) were similar to that of dopamine. An increase in [cAMP] was observed in dopamine-, SKF-, or forskolin-treated hippocampal slices. By immunocytochemical studies, control hippocampal cells showed little expression of c-Fos immunoreactivity. However, when cells were treated with dopamine, an increase in the expression of c-Fos immunoreactivity was observed after treatment for 2 h. The treatment of hippocampal neurons with R(+)-SKF38393 (50 microM) or forskolin (50 microM) also induced a significant increase in c-Fos expression. These results indicate that the dopamine D1 receptor-mediated cAMP dependent pathway is associated with the expression of c-Fos in the hippocampal neurons. These data are consistent with the possible role of endogenous dopamine on synaptic plasticity via the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, these results imply that dopamine might control the process of memory storage in the hippocampus through gene expression.",
