     "AB": "A vital potential-dependent dye was used to conduct optical recording of the electrical activity of the hippocampal formation in living slices of the rat brain including the hippocampal formation and the entorhinal cortex. These studies showed that single electrical stimuli applied to the entorhinal cortex, subiculum. and dentate gyrus produced responses in which waves of excitation passed across the hippocampal formation sequentially from the dentate gyrus, through CA3, to the CA1 field of the hippocampus. When GABAergic inhibition was partially blocked with picrotoxin, the first wave of excitation was immediately followed by several further waves in all zones of the hippocampal formation, with a constant shift in latency, which increased from the dentate gyrus to CA3 and CA1. Reverberation of excitation in the \"hippocampal formation-entorhinal cortex\" structure is regarded as the most probable cause for the appearance of these sequences of waves.",
