     "AB": "The increment of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis elicited by ibotenic acid (IBO) is greater in hippocampal slices prepared from brain of rats receiving single or repeated hippocampal electrical stimulation or electrically induced amygdala kindling. In the latter group of rats, a potentiation of IBO stimulation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis was associated with stage 3-4 of kindling according to Racine's scale. This increment returned to normal within one month after withdrawal from electrical stimulations. In both control and stimulated animals, 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid antagonized the increment of inositol phospholipid metabolism elicited by IBO. The stimulation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis elicited by carbamylcholine and norepinephrine was virtually unaffected by amygdala kindling.",
