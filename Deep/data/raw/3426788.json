     "AB": "Three experiments examined the behavioural effects of bilateral ablation of the avian hippocampus-area parahippocampalis (Hp-APH), a region which is considered to be the homologue of the mammalian hippocampal formation. Pigeons with lesions of the Hp-APH were impaired in learning the reversal (but not the acquisition) of a position (left/right) discrimination (Expt. 1). In contrast, lesion birds were unimpaired relative to controls in both the acquisition and reversal of a visual (pattern) discrimination (Expt. 2) in terms of errors to criterion; there was evidence, however, that the pattern of responding differed between groups during reversal. Finally, Hp-APH pigeons were impaired in the acquisition of a conditional discrimination (Expt. 3). The results are compared with the effects of hippocampal ablation in mammals, and their implications for a behavioural homology between the avian Hp-APH and the mammalian hippocampal formation are considered.",
