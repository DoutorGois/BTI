     "AB": "The results of a dose-response study of the effects of nicotine on exploratory behavior in male rats is reported. Nicotine at 0.5 mg/kg elevated locomotor activity without significantly changing other parameters of exploration. Low-dose nicotine (0.2 mg/kg) did not produce any effect on exploration measures, while high-dose nicotine (0.8 mg/kg) produced a state of ataxia in animals and decreased most exploration measures in general. Additional, nicotine at high doses seems to reduce the animal's state of fear/anxiety, while at low dose the drug seems to increase the animal's level of curiosity in a novel environment. Biochemically, nicotine has been found to accelerate dopamine synthesis and norepinephrine turnover, and to decrease serotonin turnover. More importantly, the amino acid precursors tyrosine and tryptophan were found to be the neurochemical measures most related to the behavioral changes produced by nicotine.",
