     "AB": "This investigation gives a detailed analysis of oxidative stress conditions generated following chronic aluminum exposure (10 mg Al/kg body weight per day) for a period of 4 weeks. We observed a significant enhancement in the levels of lipid peroxidation at the completion of aluminium treatment. The antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were seen to decrease following aluminum exposure. A significant decrease in the nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) group status was also observed along with a decreased NPSH:disulfide ratio, thus further accentuating the oxidative insult to tissue. In vitro addition of desferrioxamine was shown to reverse aluminum induced lipid peroxidation, suggesting the probable therapeutic role of the drug against aluminum neurotoxicity.",
