     "AB": "This study is to investigate the protective effect of (-) clausenamide against the neurotoxicity of okadaic acid in SH-SY5Y cell line, and injection beta-amyloid peptide25-35 (Abeta25-35) to the cerebral ventricle in ovariectomy (OVX) rats. MTT assay, LDH assay, and Hoechst 33258 staining were used to detect the effect of (-) clausenamide on the toxicity of okadaic acid in SH-SY5Y cell line. The animal model was induced by ovariectomized and injection of Abeta25-35 in the cerebroventricle of rats. The effect of (-) clausenamide on learning and memory deficiency was observed by step-through test. Electron microscope, Nissl body staining, and HE staining were used to examine the morphological changes in hippocampus and cerebral cortex neurons. Pretreatment of (-) clausenamide and LiCl decreased the rate of cell death from MTT, LDH release, and apoptosis from Hoechst 33258 staining in SH-SY5Y cell line. The step-through tests showed (-) clausenamide could improve the ability of learning and memory. The Nissl body staining and HE staining experiments also showed the neuroprotective effects of (-) clausenamide on the neurons of hippocampus and cerebral cortex. (-) Clausenamide has the protective effects against the neurotoxicity induced by okadaic acid and Abeta25-35.",
