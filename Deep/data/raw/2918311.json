     "AB": "Combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry have been used to identify and quantify tryptoline, methtryptoline, 5-hydroxytryptoline, and 5-hydroxymethtryptoline as their heptafluorobutyryl derivatives in extracts of rat brain. Tryptoline and methtryptoline were identified on the basis of their retention times and mass spectral characteristics: they were reliably detected in brain tissue extracts without interference from artifactual formation; their whole brain concentrations ranged between 0.2 and 3 ng/g; and they had a similar neuroanatomical distribution, with the highest concentrations in the cerebellum and the cortex. Smaller quantities of 5-hydroxytryptoline and 5-hydroxymethtryptoline were also identified on the basis of their retention times and mass spectral characteristics. However, the significance of this finding is unclear, because these two compounds were accompanied by larger quantities of their tetradeuterated analogues formed from tetradeuterated-5-hydroxytryptamine added at the time of tissue homogenization; this result suggests that formation of 5-hydroxytryptoline and 5-hydroxymethtryptoline occurred during tissue homogenization, sample preparation, or both.",
