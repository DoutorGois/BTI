     "AB": "Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is abundantly expressed in the brain and is critical for the normal function of synapses. cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor which initiates the expression of proteins that related to the regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory function. Studies have shown that UCH-L1 can influence the expression and activity of CREB, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we used UCH-L1 inhibitor LDN to treat mice hippocampal slices and found that UCH-L1 inhibition caused the dephosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 site. Meanwhile, hyperphosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein tau; increased expression of synaptic protein components of PSD-95 and synapsin-1, and decreased activity of tyrosine kinase Fyn were observed after UCH-L1 inhibition. Moreover, all these alternations have an influence on the normal function of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor NR2B subunit which is likely to result in the dephosphorylation of CREB. We also found that LDN treatment mediated protein kinase A (PKA) deactivation was involved in the dephosphorylation of CREB. Thus, our study introduces a novel possible mechanism for elaborating the effects of UCH-L1 inhibition on the CREB activity and the implicated signaling pathways.",
