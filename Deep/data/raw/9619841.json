     "AB": "Injection of paraquat, a redox-cycling compound, into the rat hippocampus produces limbic seizures and hippocampal damage. Here we report that a proportion of the neuronal cell death caused by the herbicide occurs via an apoptotic mechanism which appears to be mediated by oxygen free radicals. Adult male Wistar rats (n=12) received a single dose of paraquat (25 nmol/0.5 microl; 0.5 microl/min rate) and were sacrificed 24 h later. Paraquat caused DNA fragmentation, nuclear chromatin marginalization and compaction in all hippocampal subsectors, 24 h after its injection, as revealed by both the TUNEL procedure and hematoxylin eosin staining of coronal brain tissue sections. Pre-treatment with the free radical scavenger lazaroid U74389G (30 mg/kg given i.p. 30 min beforehand) significantly reduced paraquat-induced apoptosis, but did not protect against non apoptotic neuronal cell loss caused by the herbicide.",
