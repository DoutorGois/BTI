     "AB": "This study investigated the potential utility of fMRI as a neuroimaging technique to examine drug dependence using a robust animal model of drug withdrawal. Two groups of rats chronically pretreated with incremental doses of morphine sulfate (2, 7, 15, 30, 40, 50, 50, and 50 mg/kg--subcutaneous injection) were subjected to opioid precipitated withdrawal (using the opioid antagonist, naloxone) and subsequently behaviorally assessed or gradient-echo imaged under urethane anesthesia. Whole brain, group statistical parametric maps revealed statistically significant changes in signal intensity following administration of 1 mg/kg naloxone (corrected for multiple comparisons: P < 0.05, T > 5.03). Control groups within the fully crossed designs did not exhibit any statistically significant changes in behavior or signal intensity changes. Regional patterns of modulated activity include the retrosplenial, piriform, insular, entorhinal, cingulate, visual and auditory cortices, posterior fields of the hippocampus, and in particular the dentate gyrus. Such areas are consistent with biochemical correlates of morphine withdrawal and time profiles derived from our behavioral observations (P < 0.02). A notable lack of signal intensity changes in a number of subcortical areas suggests a possible confound associated with fMRI under anesthesia. This paper reports the first whole brain fMRI examination of an animal model of drug withdrawal, we believe there is considerable scope for extrapolation of our methods to a multitude of pharmacological applications-most notably in conjunction with other techniques in the development of potential therapeutic agents for drug dependence.",
