     "AB": "The production of new neurons continues throughout adulthood in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation, and is believed to play a role in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Seizure-induced changes in adult neurogenesis have been examined primarily in convulsive rodent seizure models, but not in models of nonconvulsive absence seizures. This study examined progenitor cell proliferation in the gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) model of typical absence seizures and the AY-9944 model of atypical absence seizures, and compared these results with changes seen in the rat amygdala kindling model. Kindled subjects were found to have 189% more proliferating cells than sham-kindled control subjects, whereas no significant difference was found between the GHB or AY-9944 model and control subjects. These results suggest that changes in adult neurogenesis in models of absence seizures do not occur, and that seizure-induced enhancement of neurogenesis could depend on the characteristics of the seizure discharge.",
