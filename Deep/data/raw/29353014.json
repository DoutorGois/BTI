     "AB": "Lead (Pb) intoxication is a prevalent type of environmental toxicity as well as minimal amount of lead exposure is liable for neurobehavioral or perhaps intelligence defects. The present study was undertaken to investigate the beneficial effects of morin in protecting the lead acetate (PbAc)-induced oxidative stress in rat brain. PbAc intoxication resulted in motor deficit, memory impairment and oxidative stress Further, PbAc administration alters Bax/Bcl-2 expression thereby increases cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. Treatment with morin at a dose of 40mg/kg b.wt. significantly restored back the abnormal changes that were noticed in PbAc intoxicated rats. Histopathological sections of cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus showed the extent of neuronal loss in PbAc induced rats and its restoration upon administration of morin. These outcomes imply that morin might be employed therapeutically to chelate toxic metals like Pb, thus possibly lowering PbAc-induced neurotoxicity and tissue damage.",
