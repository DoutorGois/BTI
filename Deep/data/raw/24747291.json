     "AB": "Gap junctions (GJs) were discovered more than five decades ago, and since that time enormous strides have been made in understanding their structure and function. Despite the voluminous literature concerning the function of GJs, the involvement of these membrane structures in the central mechanisms underlying oscillations and synchrony in the neuronal network is still a matter of intensive debate. This review summarizes what is known concerning the involvement of GJs as electrical synapses in mechanisms underlying the generation of theta band oscillations. The first part of the chapter discusses the role of GJs in mechanisms of oscillations and synchrony. Following this, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments concerning the involvement of GJs in the generation of hippocampal formation theta in rats are reviewed.",
