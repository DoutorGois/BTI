The temporal lobe at the level 25 mm above the orbitomeatal line showed the amygdala, hippocampus and hippocampal gyrus medially, and the T1, T2 and T3 neocortices laterally. The focus locations in these structures were divided into mesial, lateral and combined groups on the PECT images. This classification showed a close correlation between the clinical symptoms and the anatomical focus sites.",
