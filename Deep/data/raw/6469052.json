     "AB": "Series of fetuses from two inbred mouse strains, BALB/cCF and C57BL/6J, were collected at the time during which the corpus callosum (CC) crosses midline. Fetuses from each strain were matched initially with respect to chronological age, then morphological age and finally brain weight, and in each case the CC was assessed for presence at midline. The results indicated that CC development was retarded in the BALB animals relative to C57 animals of the same developmental status as measured by either morphological age or brain weight.",
