     "AB": "Preoptic regulatory factor-1 (Porf-1) and Preoptic regulatory factor-2 (Porf-2) are two novel peptide genes which are expressed in the central nervous system. Expression is modified by age and by hormones of the reproductive system. In this study nuclease protection assays were employed to investigate Porf-1 and Porf-2 mRNA expression in the cerebral cortex (CC), hippocampus (HIPP), preoptic area (POA) and medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) of male and female rats, aged 15, 30 and 60 days. Porf-1 and Porf-2 mRNA expression tended to decrease from 15 to 60 days, with two exceptions. Porf-2 in the hippocampus of female rats, and Porf-1 in the MBH of the male rats, were found instead to increase with age. There were distinctive sex differences inporf-1 andporf-2 gene expression. Consistently higher mRNA levels were measured for both genes in the POA of female rats at all ages examined, and this difference reached statistical significance for Porf-1 at the age of 60 days. In contrast, levels of Porf-2 mRNA were higher in MBH of male than female rat MBH at 15 days, and Porf-1 mRNA was substantially more abundant in male than in female rat MBH at 30 and 60 days of age. These results indicate that there is sexual dimorphism and regional specificity in the developmental expression of these genes.",
