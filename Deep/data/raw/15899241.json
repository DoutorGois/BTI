     "AB": "This study investigated the effect of apolipoporotein E (apoE) deficiency on hippocampal reactive sprouting responses of the septohippocampal cholinergic (SHC) and commissural/associational fibers (C/A) following an electrolytic lesion of the entorhinal cortex (ECL), using apoE knockout (apoEKO) and age-matched control wild-type mice. Based on recent evidence suggesting that apoE plays a role in the modulation of glial inflammation, we also tested the hypothesis that the pattern of the astroglial response to ECL might be related to the defective reinnervation previously reported in apoEKO mice. Consistent with our hypothesis, we report a differential pattern of astroglial response that concurred with impairments in the sprouting of the SHC and corresponding synaptic replacement in apoEKO mice at 14 and 30 days post-lesion (DPL), a time range covering the onset of axonal/terminal sprouting to synaptogenesis. We also report a limited sprouting of the C/A fiber system in apoEKO relative to control mice at 30 DPL, a period of active dendritic remodeling. The results of the present study confirm and extend previous findings that apoEKO mice display impaired regenerative capacity in response to ECL and argue that in addition to the effect of apoE on lipid trafficking, apoE may also influence the astroglial response to damage, and that both of these effects account for the defective reinnervation observed in apoEKO mice.",
