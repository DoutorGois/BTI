     "AB": "The granule cells (GCs) and their axons, the mossy fibers (MFs), make synapses with interneurons in the hilus and CA3 area of the hippocampus and with pyramidal cells of CA3, each with distinct anatomical and functional characteristics. Many features of synaptic communication observed at the MF synapses are not usually observed in most cortical synapses, and thus have drawn the attention of many groups studying different aspects of the transmission of information. One particular aspect of the GCs, that makes their study unique, is that they express a dual glutamatergic-GABAergic phenotype and several groups have contributed to the understanding of how two neurotransmitters of opposing actions can act on a single target when simultaneously released. Indeed, the GCs somata and their mossy fibers express in a regulated manner glutamate and GABA, GAD, VGlut and VGAT, all markers of both phenotypes. Finally, their activation provokes both glutamate-R-mediated and GABA-R-mediated synaptic responses in the postsynaptic cell targets and even in the MFs themselves. The developmental and activity-dependent expression of these phenotypes seems to follow a \"logical\" way to maintain an excitation-inhibition balance of the dentate gyrus-to-CA3 communication.",
