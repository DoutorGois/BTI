     "AB": "1. We examined the binding of [3H]-8-hydroxy-2-(DI-n-propilamino)tetralin ([3H]-8OH-DPAT) to 5-hydroxytriptamine-1A (5-HT1A) receptors in rat hippocampal membranes. 2. Computer analysis of [3H]-8OH-DPAT displacement curves in the absence and in the presence of 100 microM guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) were best fitted with a three-site model with apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of 0.45, 2.8 and 30 nM; the corresponding binding capacity (Bmax) existing in the three affinity states were 4, 2 and 12 pmol/g of tissue (wet weight), respectively. 3. These results suggest that [3H]-8OH-DPAT binding can be resolved as complex isotherms and we provided evidence that [3H]-8OH-DPAT labels 2 high-affinity GTP gamma S-sensitive and one low-affinity GTP gamma S-sensitive state of 5-HT1A receptors.",
