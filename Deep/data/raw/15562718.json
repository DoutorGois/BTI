     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: A method was established for the determination of hypoxanthine and xanthine in Hippocampus by HPLC. METHODS: The HPLC system consisted of a Kromasil C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) with methanol-water (2:98, V/V) as the mobile phase. The wavelength of detection was 254 nm. RESULTS: The linear range of hypoxanthine and xanthine were 29.0-464.0 ng (r = 0.99996) and 24.5-392.0 ng (r = 0.9995) respectively. The average recovery of hypoxanthine was 100.73%, RSD = 1.31% (n = 6). The average recovery of xanthine was 100.54%, RSD = 1.14% (n = 6). CONCLUSION: This method is convenient and the result is accurate. It can be used for quality control of Hippocampus.",
