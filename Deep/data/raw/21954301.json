     "AB": "This study examined the positive modulatory properties of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-(3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-propyl)-phenol (CGP7930) and (R,S)-5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-hydroxy-3-trifluoromethyl-3H-benzofuran-2-one (rac-BHFF) at gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABA(B)) receptors in different brain regions. Using quantitative autoradiography, we measured GABA(B) receptor-stimulated binding of guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(3)(5)S]thiotriphosphate) ([(3)(5)S]GTPgammaS) to G proteins in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), hippocampus, and cerebellum. CGP7930 and rac-BHFF enhanced baclofen-stimulated [(3)(5)S]GTPgammaS binding similarly in mPFC and hippocampus, but were more effective in cerebellum. CGP7930 (100 muM) increased [(3)(5)S]GTPgammaS binding stimulated by baclofen (30 muM) from 29 to 241% above basal in mPFC and from 13 to 1530% above basal in cerebellum. Likewise, rac-BHFF (10 muM) increased baclofen-stimulated [(3)(5)S]GTPgammaS binding more in cerebellum (from 13 to 1778% above basal) than in mPFC (from 29 to 514% above basal). rac-BHFF (10 muM) in combination with gamma-hydroxybutyrate (20 mM) increased [(3)(5)S]GTPgammaS binding in cerebellum but not in mPFC. rac-BHFF also enhanced the effects of 3-aminopropyl(diethoxymethyl)phosphinic acid (CGP35348). Consistent with its partial agonist properties, CGP35348 stimulated [(3)(5)S]GTPgammaS binding in mPFC when given alone (to 18% above basal), but less extensively than baclofen (140% above basal), and antagonized baclofen when given together. CGP35348 (1 mM) in combination with rac-BHFF (100 muM) produced an increase in [(3)(5)S]GTPgammaS binding that was larger in cerebellum (from 61 to 1260% above basal) than in mPFC (from 18 to 118% above basal). Taken together, the results show that GABA(B) receptor-positive modulators enhance [(3)(5)S]GTPgammaS binding stimulated by GABA(B) receptor agonists in a brain region-dependent manner. This regionally selective enhancement is further evidence of pharmacologically distinct GABA(B) receptor populations, possibly allowing for more selective therapeutic targeting of the GABA(B) system.",
