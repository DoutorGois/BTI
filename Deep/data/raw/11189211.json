     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To study the action mechanism of a new cognition enhancer clausenamide and the effect of clausenamide on regional acetylcholine (ACh) levels, and to examine anisodine-induced ACh decrease in mice of memory deficits, and to compare the effect of (-)clausenamide on ACh with that of (+)clausenamide. METHODS: Animal amnesia model was induced by i.p. anisodine and brain ACh content was measured by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. RESULTS: Single administration of (-)clausenamide or (+)clausenamide (10, 20, 50 mg/kg, i.g.) had no effect on the ACh level in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. However, pretreatment with (-)clausenamide (10, 20, 50 mg/kg, i.g.) significantly ameliorated the reduction of ACh induced by anisodine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in a dose-dependent manner. Physostigmine (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.), as a cholinesterase inhibitor significantly increased the ACh levels and reversed the anisodine-induced ACh decrease. In contrast, (+)clausenamide had no effect on ACh decrease in all examined brain regions. (-)Clausenamide ameliorated anisodine-induced memory deficits in step-through test in mice. CONCLUSION: There is significant difference in the action of (-)clausenamide and (+)clausenamide. The protective action of (-)clausenamide against anisodine-induced amnesia is due to its ability to reverse the ACh reduction.",
