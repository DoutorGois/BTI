     "AB": "The disabled 1 (Dab1) p80 protein is essential for reelin signaling during brain development. p80 has an N-terminal domain for association with reelin receptors, followed by reelin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation sites and about 310 C-terminal residues of unknown function. We have generated mutant mice that express only a natural splice form of Dab1, p45, that lacks the C-terminal region of p80. The normal development of these mice implies that the receptor-binding region and tyrosine phosphorylation sites of p80 are sufficient for reelin signaling. However, a single copy of the truncated gene does not support normal development of the neocortex and hippocampus. The CA1 region of the hippocampus is split into two well-organized layers, while the marginal zone of the neocortex is invaded by late-born cortical plate neurons. The haploinsufficiency of the p45 allele of Dab1 implies that the C terminus of p80 affects the strength of reelin-Dab1 signaling, yet there is no apparent change in reelin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p45 relative to p80. Therefore, we suggest that the C-terminal region of Dab1 p80 is involved in signaling to downstream effector molecules. Furthermore, the presence of late-born cortical plate neurons in the marginal zone reveals a requirement for reelin-Dab1 signaling in late-born cortical plate neurons, and helps distinguish models for the cortical inversion in the reeler mutant mouse.",
