     "AB": "Studies on glycoprotein fucosylation were carried out using hippocampal slices from rat brain. These slices were incubated in the presence of the protein kinase C (PKC) activating phorbol ester, 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), or an inactive isoform, 4 alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (PDD), respectively, for 7 min followed by a 60 min pulse of [3H]fucose. PDBu caused an increase in [3H]fucose incorporation into glycoproteins by 29% as well as an activation of the fucokinase enzyme reaction by 21%. The PDBu-induced stimulation of [3H]fucose insertion into hippocampal glycoproteins was abolished by the PKC inhibitors, staurosporine and H7. The importance of a PKC-regulated glycoprotein fucosylation in mechanisms underlying changes in neuronal plasticity is discussed.",
