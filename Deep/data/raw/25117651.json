     "AB": "This work presents a pathway-dependent anatomic and functional connectivity analysis in 19 patients with relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and 16 age-, education-, and gender-matched controls. An MS population is used in this study as a model for anatomic connectivity, permitting us to observe relationships between anatomic and functional connectivity more easily. A combined resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and whole-brain, high angular resolution diffusion imaging analysis is performed in three independent, monosynaptic pathways. The pathways chosen were transcallosal pathway connecting the bilateral primary sensorimotor regions, right and left posterior portion of the Papez circuit, connecting the posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus. The Papez circuit is known to be involved in memory function, one of the most frequently impacted cognitive domains in patients with MS. We show that anatomic connectivity, as measured with diffusion-weighted imaging, and functional connectivity, as measured with resting-state fMRI, are significantly reduced in patients as compared with controls for at least some of the pathways considered. In addition when all pathway measures are combined, anatomic and functional connectivity are significantly correlated in patients with MS as well as healthy controls. We suggest that anatomic and functional connectivity are related for monosynaptic pathways and that radial diffusivity, as a diffusion-tensor-based measure of white matter integrity, is a robust measure of anatomic connectivity in the general population.",
