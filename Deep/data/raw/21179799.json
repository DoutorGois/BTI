     "AB": "AIM: To study the effects of vitamin E on stress-induced impairments in hippocampus of rats. METHODS: Twenty four male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four groups: control, stress, control+ VE, stress+ VE. The rat stress model was built by restraining for 6 h/d,21 d. The long-term potentiation was induced in rat hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) by high-frequency test stimulation. RESULTS: Compared with control group, the rats suffered from restraint stress showed that the number of crossing in open-field test and the content of glucocorticoids in plasma was significantly increased, the changes of amplitude of population spike (PS) were significantly lower. After VE supplementation in stress rats, the indices mentioned above were significantly improved. CONCLUSION: Opportune supplementation of vitamin E may improve the brain function under stress.",
