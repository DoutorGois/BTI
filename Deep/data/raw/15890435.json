     "AB": "In normal brain aging, CNS resident macrophages exhibit increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II expression. However, the transcriptional basis for this observation has not been clarified nor have age-related alterations in pivotal pro-inflammatory genes been characterized. Age-related mRNA alterations in MHC II, MHC II accessory molecules and several pro-inflammatory mediators were measured in older (24 months) and younger (3 months) male F344xBN F1 rats. Real time RT-PCR was utilized to measure steady state mRNA levels in hippocampus. Older as compared to younger animals exhibited increased mRNA levels of MHC II, CD86, CIITA and IFN-gamma. Furthermore, IL-10 and CD200 mRNA, molecules that down-regulate macrophage activation, was decreased in older animals. The present results indicate that normal brain aging is characterized by a shift towards a pro-inflammatory microenvironment in the CNS.",
