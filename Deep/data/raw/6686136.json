     "AB": "To investigate the effects of whole body vibration on the central nervous system, rats were exposed to various whole body vibrations and examined for changes in the levels of norepinephrine (NE) in whole brain or regions of the brain. Whole brain NE had decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) after an acceleration of 5.0G with a frequency of 20 Hz; and the decrease was also observed in the hypothalamus (P less than 0.01) and the hippocampus (P less than 0.10). Exposure to noise [100 dB (A)] caused a significant decrease in NE. This decrease related particularly to a significant decrease in midbrain NE (P less than 0.05) and a non-significant decrease of NE in the hypothalamus.",
