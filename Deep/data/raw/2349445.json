After transplantation of a suspension of embryonic hippocampal cells agglomerations of cells at the site of injection were observed. Some of them were in the layer of the destroyed neuronal population. These neurons formed dendritic branches and dendritic spines. As compared with control areas with a normal neuronal population, the neurons at the site of transplantation had less regular branching of dendrites and some of the branches were quite chaotic.",
