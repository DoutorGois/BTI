     "AB": "We analyzed the dynamic concentration change of serotonin (5-HT) and its main metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) within the epileptic hippocampus in rats. Seizure was induced by systemic injection of pilocarpine (320mg/kg, i.p.). Using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, we found that primary seizure discharge was induced 30min after pilocarpine administration and that recurrent discharge peaked 14d after the onset of status epilepticus (SE). The extracellular fluid in the hippocampus was sampled by microdialysis from conscious animals at various time points before and after SE. The concentrations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the samples were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Interestingly, 5-HT levels in the hippocampus were dramatically increased within the 30min following SE. This reversed to basal level by 4d after SE and continued to drop to 48% at 7d and 28% of basal level 14d after SE. Accordingly, a marked increase of 5-HIAA in the hippocampus appeared at 2d after SE, then gradually declined to levels below baseline. To identify serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei (a major source of 5-HT release in the brain), brain sections were immunostained for tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). The number of TPH positive neurons and the intensity of TPH staining significantly decreased at 28d after SE. These data suggest that pilocarpine induces depletion of 5-HT in the hippocampus and significantly compromise serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei. The loss of serotonergic function may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy.",
