     "AB": "Orphan transporter v7-3 is a member of a new subfamily of Na+, Cl- dependent neurotransmitter transporters with two large extracellular loops. Distribution of v7-3 mRNA was investigated in the rat brain. In situ hybridization study revealed that v7-3 mRNA was widely distributed in the rat central nervous system, including the olfactory bulb, the hypothalamus, the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum. In addition, intense v7-3 mRNA expression was found in the motor nuclei including the oculomotor nucleus, abducens nucleus, trigeminal motor nucleus, facial nucleus, hypoglossal nucleus and ventral horn of spinal cord. Intense hybridization signals were also observed in the nuclei containing monoaminergic neurons, such as locus coeruleus, the substantia nigra pars compacta, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal raphe nucleus and the median raphe nucleus. This multifocal and broad nature of the v7-3 distribution suggests widespread roles for this gene product in neurons mediating several important brain function.",
