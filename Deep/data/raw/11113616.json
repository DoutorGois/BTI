     "AB": "To identify genetic factors involved in brain aging, we have initiated studies assessing behavioral and structural changes with aging among inbred mouse strains. Cognitive performance of C57BL/6J mice is largely maintained with aging, and stereological analysis revealed no significant age-related change in neuron number, synaptic bouton number or glial number in the hippocampus. Moreover, no change in cortical neuron number and cholinergic basal forebrain neuron number has been found in this strain. 129Sv/J mice have more pronounced age-related cognitive deficits, although hippocampal and basal cholinergic forebrain neuron number also appear unchanged with aging. Differences in neurogenesis and neuron vulnerability in the adult CNS of C57BL/6, 129/Sv and other inbred strains have been reported, which in turn may have important consequences for brain aging. Age-related lesions, such as thalamic eosinophilic inclusions and hippocampal clusters of polyglucosan bodies also vary greatly among inbred strains although the functional significance of these lesions is not clear. The continued assessment of such age-related structural and behavioral changes among inbred mouse strains offers the potential to identify genes that control age-related changes in brain structure and function.",
