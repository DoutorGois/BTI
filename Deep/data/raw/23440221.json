     "AB": "Sharp wave-associated approximately 200-Hz ripple oscillations in the hippocampus have been implicated in the consolidation of memories. However, knowledge on mechanisms underlying ripples is still scarce, in particular with respect to synaptic involvement of specific cell types. Here, we used cell-attached and whole-cell recordings in vitro to study activity of pyramidal cells and oriens-lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) interneurons during ripples. O-LM cells received ripple-associated synaptic input that arrived delayed (3.3 +/- 0.3 ms) with respect to the maximum amplitude of field ripples and was locked to the ascending phase of field oscillations (mean phase: 209 +/- 6 degrees ). In line, O-LM cells episodically discharged late during ripples ( approximately 6.5 ms after the ripple maximum), and firing was phase-locked to field oscillations (mean phase: 219 +/- 9 degrees ). Our data unveil recruitment of O-LM neurons during ripples, suggesting a previously uncharacterized role of this cell type during sharp wave-associated activity.",
