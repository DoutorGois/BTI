     "AB": "Surgical innovation relies on patient safety and quality of life, which require a drastic iatrogenic impact reduction. A parallel development toward less invasive approaches has occurred in the field of surgery, interventional radiology, and endoscopy. Minimally invasive techniques provide unquestionable benefits to patients in terms of postoperative outcome. However, those techniques are not intuitive, and extensive training is required to overcome the inherent challenges and to be proficient and consequently to achieve a steep learning curve. Technologies have been developed by computer science and robotics departments, which might improve minimally invasive techniques. A new concept of cyber therapies is emerging through the development of computer and robotic sciences aiming at human-machine integration. Additionally, the convergence of surgery, endoscopy, and interventional radiology toward a hybrid therapeutic modality, namely image-guided minimally invasive procedures, holds promises insofar as they could well maximize benefits in terms of efficacy and iatrogenic impact. In the present manuscript, the mainstays of these new paradigm developments are briefly outlined in light of our experience and vision of the future.",
