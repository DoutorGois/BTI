     "AB": "Based on physiological evidence, we propose a theoretical model of the hippocampal-cortical memory system. The model consists of the following components: the sensory system, the hippocampus (short-term memory), and the association cortex (long-term memory). A series of key codes (local information) is supplied from the sensory system, while context (global information) is inputted from the hippocampus. The two inputs interact dynamically in the association cortex. The interactive neurons work as a detector of coincidence. The cortical network learns the memory information through the coincidence window and, finally, stores it in the form of attractors. This local-global information works as an addressor to designate the stored location of the memory in the association cortex and accelerates the process of storing and retrieving memory information.",
