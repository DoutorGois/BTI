     "AB": "Inadequate oxygen availability at high altitude causes oxidative stress and generation of reactive oxygen species, which may lead to memory impairment. Hippocampus, which plays a key role in the learning and memory processes, is especially vulnerable to hypoxic damage. The present study was aimed at investigating the effect of acetyl-L-carnitine on spatial working and reference memory deficits along with oxidative and apoptotic damage, caused by hypobaric hypoxia in male Sprague Dawley rats. Rats were trained in Morris Water Maze for eight days after which they were submitted to chronic hypobaric hypoxia exposure at a simulated altitude of 6100 m for three days. Rats received daily acetyl-L-carnitine at a dosage of 75 mg/kg body weight orally during exposure. Subsequent to exposure, performance of the animals was tested in Morris Water Maze, which revealed working memory impairment that was significantly improved by acetyl-L-carnitine. However, there was no change in the reference memory after hypobaric hypoxia exposure. Following behavioral study animals were sacrificed and biomarkers of oxidative damage like free radical production, lactate dehydrogenase activity, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant status and expression of apoptotic [viz. caspase-3, Apoptosis activating factor (Apaf-1), bax, cytochrome c] and anti-apoptotic protein-Bcl-2 were studied in the hippocampus. There was a significant increase in oxidative stress along with increased expression of apoptotic proteins and NR1 subunit of glutamate receptor indicating occurrence of excitotoxicity in hypoxia exposed rats. These results suggested that supplementation with acetyl-L-carnitine improves spatial working memory deficits reduces oxidative stress and inhibits apoptotic cascade induced by hypoxia.",
