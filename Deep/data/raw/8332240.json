The analysis shows that the parameters of average frequency, the presence of theta modulation of activity, the behavior of the neurons in situations evoking theta rhythm in the EEG of the hippocampus (inhibition or activation during the effect of sensory stimuli), and the character of the influences of stimulation of the medial septal region of the internal connections of the hippocampus do not permit the reliable identification of different types of neurons of the hippocampus in the awake rabbit. The available data on the functional classification of neurons of the hippocampus are discussed in connection with notions regarding their state in situations associated with the generation of theta rhythm.",
