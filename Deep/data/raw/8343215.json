     "AB": "The coexistence of amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) and basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF) in single cells of the parietal cortex, hippocampus and basal magnocellular nucleus was investigated immunohistochemically in adult rats. A monoclonal antibody directed against human recombinant APP and a polyclonal antibody against a synthetic fragment of basic FGF (the N-terminal 12 residues) were used. APP and basic FGF were frequently colocalized in the pyramidal cells of layers III and V of the parietal cortex, in the pyramidal and extrapyramidal cells of the hippocampus, and in large cells of the medial septal nucleus and the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca. Such a frequent colocalization suggests a close functional relationship between APP and basic FGF in the neuronal cells.",
