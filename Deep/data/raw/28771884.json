     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Although quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult hippocampus proliferate in response to neurogenic stimuli and subsequently give rise to new neurons continuously throughout life, misregulation of NSCs in pathological conditions, including aging, leads to the impairment of learning and memory. High mobility group B family 1 (HMGB1) and HMGB2, HMG family proteins that function as transcriptional activators through the modulation of chromatin structure, have been assumed to play some role in the regulation of adult NSCs; however, their precise functions and even expression patterns in the adult hippocampus remain elusive. RESULTS: Here we show that expression of HMGB2 but not HMGB1 is restricted to the subset of NSCs and their progenitors. Furthermore, running, a well-known positive neurogenic stimulus, increased the proliferation of HMGB2-expressing cells, whereas aging was accompanied by a marked decrease in these cells. Intriguingly, HMGB2-expressing quiescent NSCs, which were shifted toward the proliferative state, were decreased as aging progressed. CONCLUSIONS: HMGB2 expression is strongly associated with transition from the quiescent to the proliferative state of NSCs, supporting the possibility that HMGB2 is involved in the regulation of adult neurogenesis and can be used as a novel marker to identify NSCs primed for activation in the adult hippocampus.
