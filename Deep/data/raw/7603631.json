     "AB": "Excitatory amino acid (EAA)-like and excitotoxic properties of the secondary metabolite of cyanide, 2-iminothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, (2-ICA) were evaluated because of its possible role in cyanide-induced neurotoxicity. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of 2-ICA in mice produced wild-running seizures that were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to seizures observed with glutamate. 2-ICA, kainate and proline seizures were prevented by both the NMDA and non-NMDA antagonists, MK-801 and CNQX, respectively. In contrast, NMDA-induced seizures were prevented by MK-801, but not CNQX. When infused i.c.v. in rats over a seven day period, 2-ICA produced extensive and selective loss of CA-1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. In hippocampal slices preloaded with D-[3H]aspartate, 2-ICA superfusion did not evoke release nor significantly augment potassium stimulated release of the radiolabeled transmitter. These findings indicate 2-ICA has excitotoxic properties and its role in cyanide neurotoxicity deserves further study.",
