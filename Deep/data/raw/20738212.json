     "AB": "AIM: Growing evidence indicates that the glutamatergic system, especially the abnormalities of glutamate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors contribute to the pathophysiology and possibly the pathogenesis of major depressive disorders. This study is to evaluate the effect of gan mai da zao (GMDZ) decoction on glutamate and NMDA receptor in unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sucrose preference test and open field test were used to estimate the depressive-like behaviors of UCMS rats. Glutamate levels and NMDA receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A and NR2B) in the frontal cortex and hippocampus were determined by HPLC-FLD and by western-blot respectively. RESULTS: 32 days UCMS induced depressive-like behaviors, increased glutamate concentration and decreased NMDA receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats. However, NR1 expression remained constant in stressed rats compared with normal. The GMDZ decoction alleviated the depressive-like behavior, decreased glutamate level, and increased expression of NMDA receptor subunit NR2A and NR2B in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of stressed rats. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that GMDZ treatment reversed chronic unpredictable stress-induced depressive-like behaviors in UCMS rats, possibly via reducing glutamate levels and increasing the NMDA receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B in frontal cortex and hippocampus.",
