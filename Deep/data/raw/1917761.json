     "AB": "A method for intracellular recording from rat hippocampal brain slices under helium pressure is described. The preparation is mounted on a horizontal mobile platform that is rolled into the pressure chamber and can be viewed at pressure. Remote manipulation of the glass microelectrodes is achieved by a high-resolution electrically driven commercially available system. The slice is superfused continuously from a closed system within the chamber. Temperature is maintained at 37 degrees C and PO2 at 0.5 atm within the pressure chamber. A pressure of 200 ATA can be obtained, although thus far recordings have been made up to only 130 ATA. The experiments demand that a number of sample recordings be made from the same slice at both ambient and high pressure, and tests have proved that, although difficult, this can be achieved. The resting membrane potential, the current-voltage relationship, and the action potential responses to short (8 ms), medium (80 ms), and long (800 ms) depolarizing current pulses have all been measured in CA1 pyramidal neurons.",
