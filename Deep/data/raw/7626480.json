     "AB": "Pregnenolone (PREG), synthesized de novo in rodent brain, is the precursor of PREG sulfate (S) and progesterone (PROG). PROG is further converted to 5 alpha-pregnane 3, 20-dione (DH PROG) and to 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (TH PROG). PROG, DH PROG and TH PROG have been measured in the brain of male and female rats. Neither PROG nor DH PROG disappeared from brain, contrary to plasma, after combined adrenalectomy (ADX) and gonadectomy (CX). Trilostane decreased PROG and increased PREG in the brain of CX+ADX rats and mice, in accordance with a precursor to product relationship. As previously described in CX male mice, the neurosteroid DHEA and its analog 3 beta-methyl-androst-5-en-17-one (CH3-DHEA) inhibited the aggressive behavior of female mice towards lactating female intruders. The decrease of biting attacks by DHEA was definitely more prominent in females neonatally imprinted with testosterone. The degree of inhibition of aggressive behavior was related to the decrease of PREG S concentrations in brain. The memory-enhancing effects of DHEA S and PREG S in male mice have been previously documented. Infusion of PREG S (12 fmol) into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) of the rat after the acquisition trial enhanced memory performance in a two-trial recognition task (TTRT). Conversely, TH PROG (6 fmol), which potentiates GABAergic neurotransmission, disrupted performance when injected before the acquisition trial. Accordingly, we have found a positive correlation between the performances of 2-year-old rats in the TTRT and the concentrations of PREG S in the hippocampus, namely animals which performed best had the highest steroid levels.",
