     "AB": "These experiments provide a direct test of the hypothesis that median raphe lesion- or PCPA-induced hyperactivity in the rat is mediated specifically by the hippocampus. Previous studies had shown that a marked depletion of hippocampal serotonin accompanied median lesion-induced hyperactivity. In the present studies, aspiration of the anterodorsal hippocampus of adult male rats prior to median raphe lesions or PCPA administration abolished the ability of both of these treatments to produce locomotor hyperactivity in animals chronically housed in tilt cages. Control lesions of the overlying dorsal cortex and corpus callosum were ineffective in blocking the hyperactivity produced by these two treatments. The possibility that serotonin depletion-induced hyperactivity was dependent on the pituitary was excluded by the fact that PCPA effectively elevated the activity of hypophysectomized rats. These data indicate that serotonin depletion-induced hyperactivity in the rat is mediated by the hippocampus.",
