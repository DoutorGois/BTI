     "AB": "The effects of median raphe lesions on the hippocampal EEG were examined in freely moving rats. First, median raphe lesions, including those restricted to the median raphe nucleus, unequivocally produced hippocampal low-frequency theta activity (5.8 Hz, SD = 0.47 Hz) during relaxed immobility which was not observed under normal conditions. This lesion-induced theta activity during immobiliy continued for at least 20 days, and was markedly suppressed by atropine sulfate (10 mg/kg, i.p.). On the other hand, reticular formation lesions had little effect on either hippocampal EEG patterns during immobility, movement or PS. Second, the mean frequency of theta activity was significantly reduced during movement and PS on the day following the median raphe lesion. These findings suggest a raphe-hippocampal pathway in which the median raphe mucleus plays a major role in hippocampal desynchronization (irregular pattern) by exerting an inhibitory influence on the hippocompal theta generating or facilitating mechanism. Thus the theta activity will be induced by the disinhibition following median raphe lesions.",
