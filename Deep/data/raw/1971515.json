     "AB": "The modulation of Ca2+ currents by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and its analogs was investigated in hippocampal neurons in culture. In the presence of glutamate receptor-gated ion channel antagonists, all of the analogs tested caused either a small reversible depression or had no effect on the Ca2+ current. However, in neurons dialyzed with GTP gamma S, quisqualate and glutamate but not NMDA, kainate, AMPA, or L-APB caused marked and irreversible depressions of the Ca2+ current. This inhibition was only observed if Ca2+ was present in either the internal or external medium. Intracellular H-7, staurosporine, IP3, cAMP, cGMP, or calmodulin inhibitors failed to prevent the quisqualate-induced Ca2+ current inhibition. These observations are consistent with an interaction between a G protein-coupled glutamate receptor and Ca2+ channels.",
