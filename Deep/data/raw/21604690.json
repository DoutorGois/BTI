     "AB": "The present study was undertaken to identify proteins interacting with PrP(C) that could provide new insights into its physiological functions and pathological role. Human PrP(C) was expressed in prion protein-deficient murine hippocampus (HpL3-4) neuronal cells. The PrP(C) along with its interacting proteins were affinity purified using STrEP-Tactin-chromatography, in-gel digested, and identified by Q-TOF MS/MS analysis. Forty-three proteins appeared to interact with PrP(C) in this neuronal cell line. Of these, 15 were already known for their interaction with PrP(C) or PrP(Sc), while 28 new proteins were identified. Interaction of a novel interacting partner of GTPase family-Rab7a, having a suggested role in vesicle trafficking, was further investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy and reverse coimmunoprecipitation. Both reverse coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence results confirmed potential interaction of Rab7a with the PrP(C). siRNA against the Rab7a gene decreased expression of Rab7a protein, in PrP(C) expressing HpL3-4 and SH-SY5Y cells. This depleted Rab7a expression led to the enhanced accumulation of PrP(C) in Rab9 positive endosomal compartments and consequently an increased colocalization between PrP(C)/Rab9. However, the Rab9 accumulated PrP(C) remained sensitive to proteinase-K digestion. The work described demonstrated for the first time that Rab7a interacts with PrP(C) and highlighted the involvement of endosomal compartments in the trafficking and regulation of PrP(C).",
