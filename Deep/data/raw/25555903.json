     "AB": "To explore microstructural integrity of hippocampus in vascular dementia (VD) using DTI. Twenty-five individuals with VD, without magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of gray matter pathology, and 25 matched healthy control (HC) individuals underwent a 3T MRI protocol including T2, FLAIR, and PD in the axial plane, 3D whole-brain T1-weighted with an isotropic resolution of 1 mm, and DTI acquired using 64 diffusion sensitizing directions, b value of 1,500 s/mm(2), 65 axial slices, isotropic resolution of 1.8 mm. Images were processed to obtain indices of microstructural variations of bilateral hippocampi. Mean diffusivity (MD) in the hippocampus of patients with VD was significantly increased (p < 0.05) bilaterally with respect to that of the group of HC examinees. In VD group left hippocampal MD (10(-6 )x mm(2)/s) was 833.4 +/- 92.8; in HC group left MD was 699.8 +/- 56. In VD group, right hippocampal MD was 859.1 +/- 69.8; in HC group right MD was 730.4 +/- 40.2. No group differences were found in hippocampal FA. DTI shows microstructural hippocampal damage in VD in patients with normal appearing gray matter structures on conventional MRI, indicating the need for further research on the link between VD and AD.",
