     "AB": "Developmental and regional expression of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PES) transcript was examined in the rat brain and in primary mixed cultures of neurons and glial cells from neonatal brain. Although the PES mRNA level in the brain was much lower than that in peripheral rat tissues such as lung, liver, spleen and kidney, a significant 3.0 kb band was detected in brain samples by Northern blot analysis. During development, PES mRNA was first detectable at postnatal day 7, and increased thereafter toward adulthood. The highest level of 3.0 kb PES mRNA was observed in the olfactory bulb, midbrain, and hypothalamus; and the lowest level in the hippocampus. In primary cultures of neonatal brain cells, the level of 3:0 kb transcript of PES transiently and dramatically increased about 30-fold on the third day after plating. Simultaneously, two cross-hybridizing signals were detected at 4.0 and 7.0 kb. This increase in PES mRNAs was completely inhibited by addition of cytosine-1-beta-D-arabinofuranoside. The induction of PES mRNA was in parallel with the increase in PES protein, as assessed by Western blot analysis. Immunostaining of cultured cells with anti-PES monoclonal antibody revealed that PES protein was induced mainly in neurons but not in glial cells. These results suggest that PES is expressed in the central nervous system at a low concentration under normal conditions, and that the neuronal cells possess an ability to express high levels of PES mRNA and protein.",
