     "AB": "Changes in the membrane potential of neurons in the hippocampal CA2 and CA1 regions were recorded by optical recording techniques. After stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals at the hippocampal CA2 region, excitatory optical signals first occurred adjacent stimulus electrode and then flamed-up signals spread toward the hippocampal CA1 region. The optical signal was blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX) (1 microM). Propagation of the optical signal was blocked in an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 0 mM Ca2+ and 6 mM Mg2+. 6,7-Dinitroquinoxaline-2,3 (1H,4H)-dione (DNQX) (20 microM) also blocked the optical signals that spread to the hippocampal CA1 region. The time course of the optical signal recorded at a unit area (49 pixels) on the propagation pathway was characterized by fast and slow components. TTX (1 microM) blocked both fast and slow components of the optical signal. The slow component of the optical signal was preferentially depressed by either removal of external Ca2+ or by bath-application of DNQX (20 microM). When bicuculline (15 microM) was applied to the bath-solution, the intensity and propagation area of the optical signal were increased. The results indicate that stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals in the hippocampal CA2 region produces the propagation of the optical signal to the hippocampal CA1 region, and that the optical signal involves the action potential and excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials.",
