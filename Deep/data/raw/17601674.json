     "AB": "The preconditioning (PC) by using mild intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (PC) increases a resistance of the brain to severe hypoxia/ischemia and various stresses. Recently, potent antidepressant-like effects of PC have been described in animal models of depression. In the present study, the impact of PC on the activity and feedback regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) impaired in depression has been studied in the model of shock-induced depression in rats. PC completely prevented depressive-like behavior (54% reduction in ambulance, 59% reduction in rearing in the open field, 654% increase of the anxiety level in the elevated plus maze), the HPA hyperactivity and the impairment of HPA feedback regulation that appeared in response to the inescapable footshock. Not affecting basal HPA activity, PC remarkably enhanced the HPA reactivity to stresses and substantially up-regulated the expression of glucocorticoid receptors in the ventral hippocampus following footshock that apparently contributes to the mechanisms responsible for the antidepressant-like action of PC.",
