     "AB": "A thorough survey of the literature has revealed that indole derivatives have shown various central nervous system activities. This study aims to evaluate the antidepressant activity of the newly synthesized dialkyl- [2-(1-oxa-3,4,9-triaza-fluoren-2-yl-methoxy)ethyl] amines and their effect on biogenic amines. In this study, the synthesized compounds were assessed by in-vivo antidepressant models, by forced swim test and tail suspension test in mice and effect of synthesized compounds on biogenic amines in brain in a chronic unpredictable stress model. The test compounds have demonstrated significant (P < 0.05) reduced immobility duration in mice when compared with the control group animals. The reduced immobility displayed by mice indicates potential antidepressant activity. In this study, chronic unpredictable stress led to decreased monoamine levels in the cortex and hippocampus regions of the brain. With chronic administration of the investigated compounds there is an increased in monoamines in the brain, in the chronic unpredictable stress model. Decreased levels of monoamines induced by the chronic unpredictable stress induced model of depression, were normalized by treatment with the test compounds, which indicates potential antidepressant activity.",
