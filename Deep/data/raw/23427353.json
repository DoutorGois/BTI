     "AB": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY; 36 amino acids) is one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the mammalian central nervous system, and it is produced in the arcuate and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei (1). NPY exhibits a diverse range of important physiological activities, including effects on psychomotor activity, food intake, regulation of central endocrine secretion, and energy homeostasis, as well as potent vasoactive effects on the cardiovascular system. High levels of NPY are found in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus (2). Five subtypes of NPY (Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5, and Y6) have been defined by pharmacological criteria (3). The Y2 and Y4 receptor subtypes are thought to inhibit appetite, whereas the Y1 and Y5 receptor subtypes are responsible for stimulation of appetite. NPY receptors, such as NPY1R, have been identified in a variety of tissues, including the brain, spleen, small intestine, kidney, testis, placenta, and aortic smooth muscle (4). Kameda et al. (5) reported a series of 2,4-diaminopyridine small molecule NPY1R-selective antagonists with properties that are attractive for brain imaging. One of these antagonists, Y1-973, is reported to have IC50 values of 0.13 nM for human NPY1R and >10,000 nM for human NPY2R, NPY4R, and NPY5R. Y1-973 is not a substrate for the human P-glycoprotein transporter. Y1-973 was radiolabeled with (18)F as [(18)F]Y1-973 for use with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of NPY1R expression, and [(18)F]Y1-973 has been evaluated in rhesus monkey brain (6). [(18)F]Y1-973 showed good brain accumulation, with regional heterogeneity and specific binding to NPY1R in vivo in monkeys.",
