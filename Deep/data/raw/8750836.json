In this study we describe the tissue distribution and cellular localisation of mRNA encoding sst1, sst3 and sst4 receptors in the human cerebellum, frontal cortex (Brodmann's area 11) and hippocampus. RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation studies indicated a distinct, but partially overlapping pattern of expression of the receptor mRNAs. In situ hybridisation studies using co-expression techniques with probes for sst1, sst3 and sst4 receptor mRNA on paraffin sections revealed the presence of neurones expressing more than one somatostatin receptor mRNA type in both the hippocampus and pyramidal cells of layer V of the frontal cortex.",
