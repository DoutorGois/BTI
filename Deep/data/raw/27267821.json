     "AB": "Exposure to particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 mum (PM2.5) is associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, but potential neurotoxic mechanisms remain to be determined. In this study, adult male Sprague- Dawley (SD) rats were divided into four groups as follows: control (CON), PM2.5 exposure (PM alone), ischemic stroke (IS), and ischemic stroke and PM2.5 (IS-PM). Ischemic stroke groups were prepared by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and neurobehavior was assessed daily for 7 consecutive days. The control group was administered intranasally 20 mul PBS, while PM2.5 alone was given as 20 mul of PM2.5 (10 mg/ml) intranasal daily for 7 consecutive days. The spontaneous locomotion and exploratory behavior of rats were assessed by the open field test. Cells positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were determined for astrocyte activation and inflammatory reactions. Neuronal edema and pyknosis in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and midbrain were observed in IS groups with or without PM2.5 treatment. Astrocyte activity was enhanced, whereas spontaneous locomotion and exploratory movements decreased in the IS-PM group. Data demonstrated that astrocytes activation and inflammatory reactions may play a role in IS and that exposure to PM2.5 may aggravate the neurobehavioral alterations observed in rats suffering from IS.",
