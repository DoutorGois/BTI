     "AB": "In the present study, an attempt has been made to investigate the distribution of aluminum in different regions of brain and body organs of male albino rats, following subacute and acute aluminum exposure. Aluminum was observed to accumulate in all regions of the brain with maximum accumulation in the hippocampus. Subcellular distribution of aluminum indicated that there was maximum localization in the nucleus followed by cytosolic, microsomal, and mitochondrial deposition. Elution profile of cytosolic proteins on G-75 Sephadex column revealed a substantial amount of aluminum bound to high-mol-wt protein fraction. Aluminum was also seen to compartmentalize in almost all the tissues of the body to varying extents, and the highest accumulation was in the spleen.",
