     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence for a dysfunctional metabolic network in human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). To further describe this, we evaluated the bioenergetic status in unilateral MTLE inter-regionally and in relation to neuropathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used whole brain high field (4 T) 31P MR spectroscopic imaging to determine in vivo PCr and ATP, studying n=22 patients (all candidates for hippocampal resection) and n=14 control volunteers. The degree of bioenergetic impairment was assessed by calculating the ratio of PCr to ATP. RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients demonstrated significant decreases in PCr/ATP from the ipsilateral amygdala and pes (0.84 +/- 0.14, 0.87 +/- 0.10, respectively, patients vs 0.97 +/- 0.15, 0.98 +/- 0.16, controls). In patients, the ipsilateral thalamic energetics positively correlated with contralateral hippocampal energetics. In addition, the ipsilateral thalamic and striatal energetics negatively correlated with hippocampal total glial counts. CONCLUSIONS: These data are consistent with a view that in MTLE, the bilateral hippocampi, ipsilateral thalamus and striatum are linked in their energetic depression, possibly reflecting the propagation of seizures throughout the brain.",
