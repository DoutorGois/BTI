     "AB": "This study examined the utility of structural and functional MRI at 1.5 and 3T in the presurgical evaluation and prediction of postsurgical cognitive outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Forty-nine patients undergoing presurgical evaluation for temporal lobe (TL) resection and 25 control subjects were studied. Patients completed standard presurgical evaluations, including the intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) and neuropsychological testing. During functional imaging, subjects performed a complex visual scene-encoding task. High-resolution structural MRI scans were used to quantify hippocampal volumes. Both structural and functional imaging successfully lateralized the seizure focus and correlated with IAT memory lateralization, with improvement for functional imaging at 3T as compared with 1.5 T. Ipsilateral structural and functional MRI data were related to cognitive outcome, and greater functional asymmetry was related to earlier age at onset. These findings support continued investigation of the utility of MRI and fMRI in the presurgical evaluation of TLE.",
