     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: The relation between growth hormone (GH) secretion and general cognitive function has been established. General cognitive functioning depends on core functions including selective attention, which have not been addressed specifically in relation to GH. The present review addresses current insights about specific effects of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) on varieties of selective attention, as well as effects of GH suppletion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies investigating relationships between GH status and valid measures of selective or divided attention were reviewed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There are no indications that GHD is characterized by impaired attribute selection, interference control, or attentional switching. In contrast, a few studies point to a deficit in integrated processing of multiple dimensions, as well as speed of information processing. There is also weak evidence for beneficial effects of GH replacement in the opposite direction in these domains. CONCLUSIONS: The function of integrated processing of multiple stimulus dimensions may be based on neural mechanisms in the anterior cingulate cortex and its extensive connections to the hippocampus, the latter being known to be rich in GH receptors.",
