     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic responses is a widely researched model of synaptic plasticity that occurs during learning and memory. The cannabinoid system is an endogenous system that modulate this kind of synaptic plasticity. In addition, voltage dependent calcium channels is essential for induction of LTP at some synapses in the hippocampus. However, there is currently debate over the interaction between L-type calcium channels and cannabinoid system on the synaptic plasticity. In this study, we examined the effects of an acute administration of the cannabinoid antagonist AM251 following a chronic administration of the Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil on LTP induction in the hippocampal dentate gyrus(DG) of rats. Male Wistar rats were administered verapamil(10,25,50mg/kg) or saline intraperitoneally(IP) daily for 13days(n=10/group). After this treatment period, animals were anesthetized with an IP injection of urethane; the recording and stimulating electrodes were positioned in the DG and the perforant pathway. After obtaining a steady state baseline response, a single IP injection of saline or AM251(1 or 5mg/kg) was administered. LTP was induced by high-frequency stimulation(HFS). The population spike(PS) amplitude and the slope of excitatory postsynaptic potentials(EPSP) were compared between the experimental groups. The acute administration of the CB1 antagonist AM251 increased LTP induction. The EPSP slopes and PS amplitude in the verapamil and AM251 groups differed after HFS, such that AM251 increased LTP, whereas verapamil decreased LTP induction. These findings suggest that there are functional interactions between the L-type calcium channels and cannabinoid system in this model of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.",
