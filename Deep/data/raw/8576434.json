     "AB": "Collateral sprouting of dentate granule cell axons, the mossy fibers, occurs in response to denervation, kindling, or excitotoxic damage to the hippocampus. Organotypic slice culture of rodent hippocampal tissue is a model system for the controlled study of collateral sprouting in vitro. Organotypic roller-tube cultures were prepared from hippocampal slices derived from postnatal day 7 mice. The Timm heavy metal stain and densitometry were used to assay the degree of mossy fiber collateral sprouting in the molecular layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Factors influencing mossy fiber collateral sprouting were time in culture, positional origin of the slice culture along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus, and presence of attached subicular-entorhinal cortical tissues. Collateral sprouting in the molecular layer was first detected after 6 days in culture and increased steadily thereafter. By 2 weeks considerable sprouting was apparent, and at 3 weeks intense sprouting was observed within the molecular layer. An intrinsic septal-to-temporal gradient of collateral sprouting was apparent at 14 days in culture. To determine whether differential damage to the mossy fibers was the basis for the differences in collateral sprouting along the septotemporal axis, we made complete transections of the mossy fiber projection as it exited the dentate hilus at various levels along the septotemporal axis; no differences were found on subsequent collateral sprouting in the dentate molecular layer. Timm-stained hippocampal cultures with an attached entorhinal cortex, a major source of afferent innervation to the dentate granule cells, displayed significantly less collateral sprouting at 10 days in culture compared to that in cultures from adjacent sections without attached subicular-entorhinal tissues present. Thus, time in culture, position along the septotemporal axis, and presence of afferent cortical tissues influence aberrant neurite collateral sprouting in organotypic slice cultures of neonatal mouse hippocampus.",
