     "AB": "Recently, limbic encephalitis (LE) associated with Voltage-gated potassium channel antibody (VGKC-Ab) has been postulated as a new autoimmune disorder. Most previously reported cases of VGKC-Ab-associated LE were non-paraneoplastic, and reports of a paraneoplastic type are rare. Here we describe a 59-year-old woman with paraneoplastic VGKC-Ab-associated LE preceding the recurrence of invasive thymoma. There was a close temporal relationship between the clinical course and the changes of the VGKC-Ab titer. Unlike many of the non-paraneoplastic VGKC-Ab-associated LE cases, our cases showed the more extensive high intensity lesions on MRI and the absence of seizure and hyponatremia.",
