     "AB": "We studied the functional properties of isolated brain mitochondria (BM) prepared from total rat brain (BM(total)) or from cerebral subregions under basal and Ca(2+) overload conditions in order to evaluate the effects of cyclosporine A (CsA) in a regiospecific manner. CsA-induced effects were compared with those of two derivatives-the none-immunosuppressive [O-(NH(2)(CH2)(5)NHC(O)CH(2))-D-Ser](8)-CsA (Cs9) and its congener, the immunosuppressive [D-Ser](8)-CsA. The glutamate/malate-dependent state 3 respiration of mitochondria (state 3(glu/mal)) differed in region-specific manner (cortex > striatum = cerebellum > substantia nigra > hippocampus), but was significantly increased by 1muM CsA (+21+/-5%) in all regions. Ca(2+) overload induced by addition of 20muM Ca(2+) caused a significant decrease of state 3(glu/mal) (-45 to -55%) which was almost completely prevented in the presence of 1muM CsA, 1muM Cs9 or 1muM [D-Ser](8)-CsA. Mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation thresholds linked to permeability transition (PT) as well as the rate and completeness of mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation differed between different brain regions. For the first time, we provide a detailed, regiospecific analysis of Ca(2+)-dependent properties of brain mitochondria. Regardless of their immunosuppressive impact, CsA and its analogues improved mitochondrial functional properties under control conditions. They also preserved brain mitochondria against Ca(2+) overload-mediated PT and functional impairments. Since Cs9 does not mediate immunosuppression, it might be used as a more specific PT inhibitor than CsA.",
