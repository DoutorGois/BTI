     "AB": "The mechanisms involved in mossy fiber LTP in the hippocampus are not well established. In the present study, we show that the kainate receptor antagonist LY382884 (10 microM) is selective for presynaptic kainate receptors in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. At a concentration at which it blocks mossy fiber LTP, LY382884 selectively blocks the synaptic activation of a presynaptic kainate receptor that facilitates AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. Following the induction of mossy fiber LTP, there is a complete loss of the presynaptic kainate receptor-mediated facilitation of synaptic transmission. These results identify a central role for the presynaptic kainate receptor in the induction of mossy fiber LTP. In addition, these results suggest that the pathway by which kainate receptors facilitate glutamate release is utilized for the expression of mossy fiber LTP.",
