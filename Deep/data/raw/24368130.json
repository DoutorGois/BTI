     "AB": "Changes in EEG synchronization, i.e., spatio-temporal correlation, with amygdala-hippocampal stimulation were studied in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Synchronization was evaluated for high frequency, 130 Hz, pseudo-monophasic or biphasic charge-balanced pulses. Desynchronization was most frequently induced by stimulation. There was no correlation between the changes in synchronization and the changes in interictal epileptiform discharge rates. Changes in synchronization do not appear yet to be a marker of stimulation efficiency in reducing seizures.",
