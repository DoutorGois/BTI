     "AB": "The elevated level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP) is associated with cognitive dysfunction, for which changes in the hippocampus plausibly play a pivotal role. We tested the hypothesis that an elevated level of HSCRP correlates with hippocampus volume and insulin resistance in nondementia patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Subjects included 45 nondementia patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who were divided into 2 groups: high-HSCRP group (age, 65 +/- 6 years [mean +/- SD]; n = 17) and normal-HSCRP group (65 +/- 7 years, n = 28). Hippocampus volume has been quantitated with computer-assisted analysis using a magnetic resonance imaging voxel-based specific regional analysis system developed for the study of Alzheimer disease (VSRAD), which yields a z score as the end point for assessment of hippocampal volume. The z score was higher in the high-HSCRP group than in the normal-HSCRP group (P < .0001). The fasting plasma glucose (P < .05) and insulin concentrations (P < .0001) and the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index (P < .0001) were higher in the high-HSCRP group than in the normal-HSCRP group. Multiple regression analysis showed that HSCRP levels were independently predicted by z score and HOMA index. Our results indicate that the elevated level of HSCRP in Japanese nondementia patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by increased hippocampus volume and insulin resistance, and that the z score and HOMA index are independent predictors of HSCRP.",
