     "AB": "We compared the effects of the D1/D5 receptor antagonist SCH-23390 with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol on the persistence of long-term potentiation in the CA1 and dentate gyrus subregions of the hippocampus. In slices, SCH-23390 but not propranolol reduced the persistence of long-term potentiation in area CA1 without affecting its induction. The drugs exerted reverse effects in the dentate gyrus, although in this case the induction of long-term potentiation was also affected by propranolol. The lack of effect of SCH-23390 on the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus was confirmed in awake animals. The drug also had little or no effect on the expression of inducible transcription factors. In area CA1 of awake animals, SCH-23390 blocked persistence of long-term potentiation beyond 3 h, confirming the results in slices. To rule out a differential release of catecholamines induced by our stimulation protocols between brain areas, we compared the effects of the D1/D5 agonist SKF-38393 with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol on the persistence of a weakly induced, decremental long-term potentiation in CA1 slices. SKF-38393 but not isoproterenol promoted greater persistence of long-term potentiation over a 2-h period. In contrast, isoproterenol but not SKF-38392 facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation. These data demonstrate that there is a double dissociation of the catecholamine modulation of long-term potentiation between CA1 and the dentate gyrus, suggesting that long-term potentiation in these brain areas may be differentially consolidated according to the animal's behavioural state.",
