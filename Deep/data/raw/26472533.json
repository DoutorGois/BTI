     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by increased accumulation of Abeta and degeneration of cholinergic signaling between basal forebrain and hippocampus. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are important mediators of cholinergic signaling in modulation of learning and memory function. Accumulating lines of evidence indicate that a nAChR subtype, alpha7 receptor (alpha7-nAChR), plays an important role in modulations of excitatory neurotransmitter release, improvement of learning and memory ability, and enhancement of cognitive function. Importantly, the expression and function of alpha7-nAChRs is altered in the brain of AD animal models and AD patients, suggesting that this nAChR subtype participates in AD pathogenesis and may serve as a novel therapeutic target for AD treatment. However, the mechanisms underlying the role of alpha7-nAChRs in AD pathogenesis are very complex, and either neuroprotective effects or neurotoxic effects may occur through the alpha7-nAChRs. These effects depend on the levels of alpha7-nAChR expression and function, disease stages, or the use of alpha7-nAChR agonists, antagonists, or allosteric modulators. In this chapter, we summarize recent progresses in the roles of alpha7-nAChRs played in AD pathogenesis and therapy.",
