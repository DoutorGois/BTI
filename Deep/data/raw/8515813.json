     "AB": "Plasticity is a property of the nervous system that allows it to modify its response to an altered input. This capacity for change suggests that there are molecular mechanisms in neurons that can couple stimuli to long-term alterations in phenotype. Neuronal excitation elicits rapid transcriptional activation of several immediate-early genes, for example c-fos, c-jun and zif268. Many immediate-early genes encode transcription factors that control expression of downstream genes whose products are believed to bring about long-term plastic changes. Here we use a highly sensitive differential complementary DNA cloning procedure to identify genes that may participate in long-term plasticity. We cloned 52 cDNAs of genes induced by the glutamate analogue kainate in the hippocampus dentate gyrus. The number of these candidate plasticity-related genes (CPGs) is estimated to be 500-1,000. One of the cloned CPGs (16C8), encoding a protease inhibitor, is induced by a stimulus producing long-term potentiation and during dentate gyrus development; a second, cpg1, is dependent on activation of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor for induction and encodes a new small, dentate-gyrus-specific protein. Seventeen of the cloned CPGs encode known proteins, including six suggesting that strong neuronal activation leads to de novo synthesis of vesicular and other synaptic components.",
