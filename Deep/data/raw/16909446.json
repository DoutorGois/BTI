     "AB": "Ginkgo biloba from the traditional Chinese system of medicine has been found to possess neurocognitive enhancing effects. The mechanism of action of Ginkgo seems to be related to its antioxidant properties. In the present study, Ginkgo biloba phytosomes were administered to Wistar rats at 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg for 7 and 14 days. Chemical hypoxia was induced by administration of sodium nitrite (75 mg/kg) 1 h after the last administration of treatment. Thirty minutes after sodium nitrite administration, the animals were killed and the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus and striatum were isolated and homogenized. The supernatants were used for the estimation of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. Ginkgo biloba phytosome treatment was found to increase superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities in all the brain regions compared with those treated only with sodium nitrite. The prevention of depletion of the antioxidant enzymes by sodium nitrite in the presence of Ginkgo biloba phytosomes may be correlated to its antioxidant activity.",
