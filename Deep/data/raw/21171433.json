     "AB": "AIM: To study the expression of Goalpha mRNA in hippocampus and dentate gyrus of 7-day rats with hypothyroidism. METHODS: We use wistar rat model of hypothyroidism and non-radioactive in situ hybridization technique to observe the changs of Goalpha mRNA levels in hippocampus and dentate gyrus of 7-day rats with or without hypothyroidism. RESULTS: Perinatal hypothyroidism can increase Goalpha mRNA levels in all areas of hippocampus and dentate gyrus of 7-day rats. CONCLUSION: Thyroid hormone can down-regulate Goalpha gene transcription in hippocampus and dentate gyrus during the early development of rat brain.",
