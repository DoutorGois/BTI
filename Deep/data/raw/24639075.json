     "AB": "The 53 kDa insulin receptor substrate protein (IRSp53) is highly enriched in the brain. Despite evidence that links mutations of IRSp53 with autism and other neuropsychiatric problems, the functional significance of this protein remains unclear. We used light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that IRSp53 is expressed throughout the adult rat brain. Labeling concentrated selectively in dendritic spines, where it was associated with the postsynaptic density (PSD). Surprisingly, its organization within the PSD of spiny excitatory neurons of neocortex and hippocampus differed from that within spiny inhibitory neurons of neostriatum and cerebellar cortex. The present data support previous suggestions that IRSp53 is involved in postsynaptic signaling, while hinting that its signaling role may differ in different types of neurons.",
