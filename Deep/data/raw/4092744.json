     "AB": "The effects of lesions of the limbic-hypothalamic structures on the pyruvate metabolic responses to daily repeated heat exposures in the liver of rabbits have been investigated. The experimental results were as follows: 1. The pyruvate metabolic responses to the 1st heat exposure (heat exposure on the 1st day) were altered by lesions of periventricular arcuate nucleus (ARC), ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), stria terminalis (ST) and dorsal fornix (FX). 2. The pyruvate metabolic responses to heat exposure were completely abolished by the ten times repetition of daily heat exposures in rabbits with lesions of ARC, VMH and ST, as same as in each sham-operated group. 3. In rabbits with FX lesions, the pyruvate metabolic responses to heat exposure remained even after the ten times repetition of daily heat exposures. 4. From these results, it might be suggested that ARC, VMH, amygdala (AMYG)-ST system and dorsal hippocampus (HPC)-FX system played a certain role in the mechanisms of pyruvate metabolic responses to the 1st heat exposure, but only the HPC-FX system participated in the process of pyruvate metabolic adaptation to daily repeated heat exposures.",
