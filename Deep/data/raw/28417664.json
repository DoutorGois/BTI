     "AB": "Cholinergic neurotransmission plays a key role in learning and memory. Prior research with rats indicated that a low dose of pre-training scopolamine (0.1 mg/kg), a cholinergic receptor antagonist, did not affect cued fear conditioning, but did block renewal when injected before extinguishing a conditioned tone, opening up opportunities to pharmacologically improve exposure therapy for anxiety patients. Before translating these findings to the clinic, it is important to carefully examine how scopolamine affects contextual fear memories. Here, we investigated the effects of scopolamine on encoding of contextual anxiety and its generalization in male Wistar rats. We found a profound disruption of context conditioning, suggesting that, even at a low dose, systemic scopolamine may influence contextual encoding in the hippocampus, particularly when the context is the best predictor for the presence of shocks.",
