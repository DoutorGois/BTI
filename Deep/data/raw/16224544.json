     "AB": "In Wistar and August rats characterized by different resistance to acute emotional stress we compared the resistance to neurodegenerative brain damage (model of Alzheimers disease) produced by administration of a neurotoxic peptide fragment (25-35) beta-amyloid into the brain. August rats were more resistant to acute stress and development of neurodegenerative disorders compared to Wistar rats. This conclusion was derived from studying animal behavior in conditioned passive avoidance task and open-field test that characterize cognitive function of the brain. Administration of beta-amyloid modulated the behavior of Wistar rats, which reflected the impairment of memory and orientation and exploratory activity in these animals. These disturbances in Wistar rats were accompanied by activation of lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus.",
