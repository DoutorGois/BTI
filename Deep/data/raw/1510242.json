     "AB": "The hippocampal formation of eight perfusion-fixed human brains was examined using new methods according to stereotactic and morphometric principles (macrovibratome and computer-aided 3D reconstruction). The reconstructions form part of a neuroanatomical reference system (NeuRef). This reference system allows for 3D visualisation of the brain and its components on a computer graphic workstation, as well as for the presentation of the union set based on a neuroanatomical structure taken from this sample of brains. This retrievable knowledge of neurofunctional systems is important for the preoperative planning of neurosurgeons and the adjustment of radiotherapy.",
