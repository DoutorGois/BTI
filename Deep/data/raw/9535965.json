     "AB": "Assessing the development of local circuitry in the hippocampus has relied primarily on anatomic studies. Here we take a physiological approach, to directly evaluate the means by which the mature state of connectivity between CA3 and CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells is established. Using a technique of comparing miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) to EPSCs in response to spontaneously occurring action potentials in CA3 cells, we found that from neonatal to adult ages, functional synapses are created and serve to increase the degree of connectivity between CA3-CA1 cell pairs. Neither the probability of release nor mean quantal size was found to change significantly with age. However, the variability of quantal events decreases substantially as synapses mature. Thus in the hippocampus the developmental strategy for enhancing excitatory synaptic transmission does not appear to involve an increase in the efficacy at individual synapses, but rather an increase in the connectivity between cell pairs.",
