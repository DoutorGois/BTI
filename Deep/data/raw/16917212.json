     "AB": "Recent epidemiological and dietary intervention studies in animals and humans have suggested that diet-derived flavonoids, in particular quercetin, may play a beneficial role by preventing or inhibiting tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether quercetin may act differently on cancer and normal neuronal tissue. In order to investigate this, the U138MG human glioma cell line and hippocampal organotypic cultures were used. The study showed that quercetin induced in glioma cell cultures results in (a) a decrease in cell proliferation and viability, (b) necrotic and apoptotic cell death, (c) arrest in the G2 checkpoint of the cell cycle, and (d) a decrease of the mitotic index. Furthermore, we demonstrated that while quercetin promotes cancer regression it was able to protect the hippocampal organotypic cultures from ischemic damage. To sum up, our results suggest that quercetin induced growth inhibition and cell death in the U138MG human glioma cell line, while exerting a cytoprotective effect in normal cell cultures.",
