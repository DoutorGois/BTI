     "AB": "Changes in local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) of the postischemic rat brain were investigated using the rat four-vessel occlusion model. Following 20 or 30 min of ischemia, LCGUs of the cerebral cortices, striatum and hippocampus were decreased at 1 and 3 days postischemia, but were recovered at 7 days postischemia. Effects of repeated administration of RS-8359, (+-)-4-(4-cyanoanilino)-7-hydroxycyclopenta(3,2-e)pyrimidin e, (30 mg/kg x 2/day, p.o., 4 days) were examined at 3 days postischemia following 20 min of ischemia. Compared with the sham-operated group, the LCGUs of 22 out of 34 structures examined in the ischemic-control group were significantly reduced. In the RS-8359-treated group, however, significant reduction was observed in only 9 structures. Compared with the ischemic-control group, RS-8359 significantly ameliorated the reduction of LCGU in 12 structures. These results suggest that RS-8359 has beneficial effects on reduced glucose metabolism in the postischemic brain.",
