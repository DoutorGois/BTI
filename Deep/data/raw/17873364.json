     "AB": "Changes in ionotropic glutamate (Glu) N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA), and 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA) receptors in rat forebrain regions were autoradiographically quantified after continuous infusion of JL 13 [(5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-8-chloro-pyrido[2,3-b][1,5]benzoxazepine fumarate] for 28 days using osmotic minipumps, and compared to the effects of representative typical (haloperidol) and atypical (clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone) antipsychotic drugs from previous studies. Similar to other atypical and not typical antipsychotics, JL 13 decreased labeling of NMDA receptors in medial and lateral caudate-putamen (CPu; by 40%). These findings indicate that down-regulation of NMDA receptors by JL 13 and other atypical antipsychotic agents in CPu may contribute to their low risk of extrapyramidal side effects. In addition, and similar to olanzapine and risperidone, JL 13 increased AMPA receptor binding in CPu (by 42%). Changes in AMPA receptors may contribute to psychopharmacological properties of JL 13 and other atypical agents. Similar to clozapine, JL 13 did not alter levels of NMDA and AMPA receptors in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Long-term effects of JL 13 on ionotropic Glu receptors, as well as on other dopamine and serotonin receptors, support the atypical antipsychotic profile of this novel agent.",
