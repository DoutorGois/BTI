     "AB": "Errorless learning (EL) procedures have been shown to be effective in teaching new information and new procedures to individuals with severe memory impairment. The published studies have been based on comparatively short-term interventions delivered to individuals with relatively circumscribed impairments. In this single case study, we explore the usefulness of errorless learning procedures used for seven years with an adult with profound and complicated memory and executive function impairments associated with three distinct aetiologies. In primary functional areas targeted by the intervention, outcome was documented by behavioural descriptions and a frequency rating scale. Caregiver burden was documented with qualitative descriptors. A financial cost-benefit analysis is also provided. In the absence of change in underlying neuropsychological impairments, DI's everyday functioning in critical areas improved substantially, with corresponding reduction in supports and improved quality of life. Caregiver burden was reduced to acceptable levels and cost-benefit analysis demonstrates substantial ongoing cost savings.",
