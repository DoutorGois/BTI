     "AB": "The effects of two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) in the hippocampus were studied in wildtype and in 5-HT(1B) receptor knockout mice using in vivo microdialysis. Basal 5-HT levels in the hippocampus were not different between the two genotypes. The functional absence of 5-HT(1B) receptors was examined in the knockout mice by local infusion of the 5-HT(1B) receptor agonist, 1,4-Dihydro-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyridin-5-one (CP93129) into the hippocampus. CP93129 (1 microM) decreased 5-HT levels in wildtype mice, but not in 5-HT(1B) knockout mice. Systemic administration of the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor paroxetine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) increased extracellular 5-HT levels. The increase of 5-HT in 5-HT(1B) knockout mice was almost twofold higher than in wildtype mice. Systemic administration of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors stimulates both terminal 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors and somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors. Therefore, the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, fluvoxamine, was applied locally into the hippocampus to investigate the role of the terminal 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors. Local administration of 0.3 microM fluvoxamine resulted in comparable increases in extracellular 5-HT in both genotypes, whereas 1.0 microM fluvoxamine produced a twofold greater increase in 5-HT levels in 5-HT(1B) knockout as compared to wildtype mice. In conclusion, the differences in hippocampal 5-HT output between wildtype and 5-HT(1B) knockout mice after local or systemic administration of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors show that 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors play a significant role in the inhibition of 5-HT release at serotonergic nerve terminals. In addition, the different dose-response to fluvoxamine suggests that 5-HT(1B) knockout mice have possible adaptations of 5-HT transporters in order to compensate for the loss of the terminal 5-HT(1B) autoreceptor.",
