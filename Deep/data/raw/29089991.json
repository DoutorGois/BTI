     "AB": "Calbindin D-28K (CB), a Ca(2+)-binding protein, maintains Ca(2+) homeostasis and protects neurons against various insults. Hyperthermia can exacerbate brain damage produced by ischemic insults. However, little is reported about the role of CB in the brain under hyperthermic condition during ischemic insults. We investigated the effects of transient global cerebral ischemia on CB immunoreactivity as well as neuronal damage in the hippocampal formation under hyperthermic condition using immunohistochemistry for neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and CB, and Fluoro-Jade B histofluorescence staining in gerbils. Hyperthermia (39.5 +/- 0.2 degrees C) was induced for 30 minutes before and during transient ischemia. Hyperthermic ischemia resulted in neuronal damage/death in the pyramidal layer of CA1-3 area and in the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus at 1, 2, 5 days after ischemia. In addition, hyperthermic ischemia significantly decreaced CB immunoreactivity in damaged or dying neurons at 1, 2, 5 days after ischemia. In brief, hyperthermic condition produced more extensive and severer neuronal damage/death, and reduced CB immunoreactivity in the hippocampus following transient global cerebral ischemia. Present findings indicate that the degree of reduced CB immunoreactivity might be related with various neuronal damage/death overtime and corresponding areas after ischemic insults.",
