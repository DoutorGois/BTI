     "PG": "4083-7",
     "AB": "Combined intracellular and microfluorometric recording techniques were used to evaluate whether the inhibition by cholinergic or adrenergic transmitters of the Ca2(+)-activated potassium current (IAHP) in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells was mediated by an alteration of depolarization-induced change in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [(Ca2+]i). Low concentrations of isoproterenol (1-10 microM) and muscarine (0.25-1 microM) reversibly abolished IAHP without affecting concomitant Ca2+ transients or the steady-state [Ca2+]i. Only after application of higher concentrations of muscarine, [Ca2+]i increased; in the presence of potassium channel blockers, muscarine depressed Ca2+ currents and concomitant Ca2+ transients. These observations provide direct evidence that the inhibition of IAHP by isoproterenol and muscarine are not mediated by an alteration of Ca2+ dynamics.",
