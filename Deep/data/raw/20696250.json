     "AB": "EHD1 is an EH (Eps15 homology) domain-containing protein involved in endosomal recycling. Our yeast two hybrid screening experiments showed that EHD1 interacts with a synaptic protein, snapin, and the present study was carried out to further elucidate the functional significance of this interaction. Immunoreactivity to EHD1 is observed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum, in the rat brain. The protein is colocalized with the axon terminal marker synaptophysin in cultured neurons. EHD1 binds to the C terminus of snapin via its C terminus EH domain. It negatively affects the binding of a SNARE complex protein, SNAP-25, to snapin, probably due to the competition for overlapping binding sites on the C terminus of snapin. EHD1 affects the coupling of synaptotagmin-1 to the SNARE complex, and could be a negative regulator of exocytosis. This is supported by electrophysiological findings that PC-12 cells which overexpress EHD1 show reduced depolarization-induced exocytosis compared to controls, but the reduced exocytosis is not observed in cells which overexpress the N terminus of EHD1 that is unable to bind snapin. Together, the above results indicate that EHD1 is a synaptic protein that negatively affects exocytosis through binding to snapin.",
