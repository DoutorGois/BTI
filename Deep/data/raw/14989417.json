     "AB": "The underlying neurobiology of emerging psychotic disorders is not well understood. Recent neuroimaging findings have suggested that some brain areas are affected prior to the onset of psychosis, while changes occur in other brain regions during the transition to illness. Further, previous research using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has generally demonstrated that there are changes to the brain chemistry of patients with schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whether these changes are present prior to or at the onset of the disorder, and to what extent they are specific to schizophrenia. In this study, we assessed the left medial temporal and left dorsolateral prefrontal regions of 56 patients in their first episode of a psychotic disorder, 30 young people at ultra high-risk (UHR) of developing psychosis, and 21 healthy controls, using proton MRS. Six of the UHR group developed a first episode psychosis over the study period. No differences were identified between the first episode and control groups for any metabolite ratio in either region of interest. This may reflect intact neuronal circuits in the early phase of psychotic disorders. There were also no differences between the UHR and control groups for the medial temporal region. However, there was a significant elevation of the NAA/Creatine and the Choline/Creatine ratios in the dorsolateral prefrontal region of the UHR group, which was interpreted as a decline in creatine indicative of hypometabolism. This finding did not discriminate between those UHR individuals who later became psychotic and those who did not.",
