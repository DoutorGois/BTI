     "AB": "Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease affecting millions of individuals. Kainate receptors, especially kainate-type of ionotropic glutamate receptor 2 (GluK2), play an important role in epileptogenesis. Recent data showed that GluK2 could undergo post-translational modifications in terms of S-nitrosylation (SNO), and affect the signaling pathway of cell death in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. However, it is unclear whether S-nitrosylation of GluK2 (SNO-GluK2) contributes to cell death induced by epilepsy. Here, we report that kainic acid-induced SNO-GluK2 is mediated by GluK2 itself, regulated by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and the level of cytoplasmic calcium in vivo and in vitro hippocampus neurons. The whole-cell patch clamp recordings showed the influence of SNO-GluK2 on ion channel characterization of GluK2-Kainate receptors. Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining results showed that inhibition of SNO-GluK2 by blocking nNOS or GluK2 or by reducing the level of cytoplasmic calcium-protected hippocampal neurons from kainic acid-induced injury. Finally, immunoprecipitation and western blotting data revealed the involvement of assembly of a GluK2-PSD95-nNOS signaling complex in epilepsy. Taken together, our results showed that the SNO-GluK2 plays an important role in neuronal injury of epileptic rats by forming GluK2-PSD95-nNOS signaling module in a cytoplasmic calcium-dependent way, suggesting a potential therapeutic target site for epilepsy.",
