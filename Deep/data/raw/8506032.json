     "AB": "Modifications of responses of hippocampal neurons to sensory stimuli at the background of increased endogenous acetylcholine level (injection of physostigmine) and during blocking by scopolamine were analysed in the chronic alert rabbit. A significant decrease of reactivity (about 40%) of hippocampal neurons to sensory stimuli occurred after physostigmine injection, inducing stable theta modulation. Suppression and decrease of inhibitory responses (including initial reset phase) and of some excitatory reactions (including on-effects) were observed. However, a limited group of excitatory responses was augmented and prolonged under physostigmine action. Scopolamine, which blocked electroencephalogram theta-rhythm, did not change the responsiveness of hippocampal neurons. Some of the inhibitory and excitatory effects of sensory stimuli, especially on-responses, were strongly facilitated. Tonic responses were shorter, but they were stably reproduced without typical gradual habituation. All these effects were also present in the hippocampus after basal undercutting of the septum, which eliminates ascending brainstem input. It is suggested that under normal conditions a new or significant sensory stimulus evokes, in the hippocampus, an initial inhibitory reset of neuronal activity with subsequent coordinated triggering of rhythmic theta modulation by the septal input and arrival of the cortical input signal phase-locked to it. During the period of theta triggered by the stimulus, its processing and fixation in memory occurs, while the other, interfering stimuli, which are not phase-locked to the ongoing theta activity, are actively filtered out. Thus, septohippocampal interactions may participate in the organization of selective attention as a necessary condition for memory trace formation.",
