The content of egr-1, junB, and c-jun mRNA gradually increased and doubled 120 min after tetanization. The increase in c-jun mRNA level lagged behind the increment of egr-1 and junB. The level of c-fos mRNA increased 30 min after tetanization, returned to the initial level by min 60, and again increased 120 min after induction of long-term posttetanic potentiation.",
