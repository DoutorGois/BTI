     "AB": "This study demonstrates that combined dopaminergic and cholinergic denervation of the hippocampus results in the appearance of morphologically altered, Tau reactive, apical dendrites of granule cells in the rat dentate gyrus. The denervated granule cells and their apical dendrites also display immunoreactivity to a mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERK-1, and also evidence of abnormal phosphorylation of these dendrites as revealed by SMI-31 immunoreactivity. Dopaminergic denervation alone also causes mitogen activated protein kinase reactivity without the Tau-reactive apical dendrities. These results suggest an analogy to synaptophysin loss and the appearance of dendritic threads described in Alzheimer's disease (AD), as an early stage in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). This is the first animal model in which abnormal phosphorylation of Tau has been shown to be produced experimentally in vivo.",
