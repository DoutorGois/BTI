     "AB": "It has been reported that more than 50% of lupus patients show various forms of neurological deficits including impaired cognitive functions and psychiatric disorders. Using an animal model of lupus we investigated the production of neuropeptides in the brain of NZB/W F1 female hybrid mice and its parental strain NZB and NZW. Our results indicate that the alteration in learning and memory described in lupus mice are paralleled by a decrease in calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P and neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels in the hippocampus and a significant decrease of NPY in the cortex. These findings are interesting in the light of previously reported results suggesting that these neuropeptides can play an important role in cognitive functions. We also observed a decrease of NPY and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide levels in the hypothalamus of lupus prone mice and these changes may be related to the disregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis observed in lupus prone mice.",
