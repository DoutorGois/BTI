     "AB": "The serotoninergic system has been analysed in the brainstem and the forebrain of adult C57BL and BALBc mice. Endogenous 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels have also been measured in the different raphe nuclei and in the caudate nucleus and the hippocampus of these strains, using the micropunch technique and the radioenzymatic method (for 5-HT) and a new radioimmunoassay (for 5-HIAA). This investigation was performed at three times of the day: 9:00 hr; 14:00 hr; 20:00 hr to underline the differences between the strains. Most of the time, higher 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels are found in the brainstem and the raphe nuclei of the BALBc strain compared to C57BL. In the forebrain the differences are reversed, except in the caudate nucleus and the hippocampus where the levels of 5-HT are identical in the two strains. Moreover the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio shows a higher turn-over of the amine in the C57BL strain.",
