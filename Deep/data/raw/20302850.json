     "AB": "Proechimys, a rodent living in the Amazon region, has shown resistance to developing chronic epilepsy when submitted to different experimental models. Recently, many studies have attributed a potent anticonvulsant action to cannabinoid receptor CB1. This study investigated the distribution and expression of the CB1 receptor in the hippocampal formation of Proechimys using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting techniques. Results were compared with values obtained from adult Wistar rats. The immunoreactivity for CB1 was evident throughout the Ammon's horn and in the hilar region of both animal species. However, the distribution of these receptors was higher in the stratum lucidum of CA3 and in the hilar region of Proechimys. In addition, higher expression of CB1 receptors was observed in the Proechimys hippocampus. These data could explain, at least partially, the natural resistance of this animal species to developing spontaneous seizures following epileptogenic precipitating events.",
