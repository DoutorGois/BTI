     "AB": "In the series of experiments reported here we provide evidence that a focal adhesion-like process underlies the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the Schaffer Collateral-CA1 projection in the hippocampus. Here we show that an integrin binding peptide (RGD) impairs induction of Schaffer Collateral-CA1 LTP in hippocampal slice preparations in vitro. The heparin-binding peptide that binds heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and blocks the formation of focal adhesions also impairs induction of LTP. Either the integrin-binding peptide or heparin-binding peptide reduces LTP partially. However, when the two peptides were administered simultaneously, there was no LTP 1 hour after induction. This indicates that these two molecules might function together and that a focal adhesion-like process might be involved in the induction of LTP. Additionally,we report that the RGD effect on LTP is time dependent and occurs only in the first few minutes following LTP induction, that the binding of the RGD peptide in CA1 stratum radiatum increases after LTP induction and that this increased binding depends on Ca(2+). Using electron microscopy we show that integrins are present in synapses.",
