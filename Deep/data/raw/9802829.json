     "AB": "The 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-induced increase in the extracellular concentration of dopamine and the long-term depletion of 5-HT were studied in the hippocampus of the rat brain. MDMA produced a dose-dependent increase in the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the hippocampus, as well as in the striatum. The MDMA-induced increase in the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the hippocampus, but not in the striatum, was suppressed in rats treated with the norepinephrine uptake inhibitor, desipramine, and in rats in which noradrenergic neurons in the hippocampus were lesioned with DSP4 (N-(2- chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromo benzylamine). However, the long-term depletion of 5-HT in the hippocampus produced by MDMA was unaltered in desipramine-treated rats. These results are supportive of the view that the MDMA-induced increase in the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the hippocampus is the result of an enhanced release of dopamine from noradrenergic neurons. In addition, the MDMA-induced depletion of 5-HT in the hippocampus appears not to involve dopamine-initiated processes, because suppression of MDMA-induced dopamine release did not attenuate the long-term depletion of 5-HT in the hippocampus.",
