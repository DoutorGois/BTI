     "AB": "Brain morphological abnormalities have been reported in several independent investigations of chronic schizophrenic patients. The present study is a prospective 4-year follow-up of first-episode schizophrenic patients to determine whether some of these abnormalities may be a consequence of regional brain structural change over time after the onset of a first psychotic episode. Whole hemisphere, temporal lobes, superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, caudate, corpus callosum, and lateral ventricles were measured in a series of MRI scans taken over a 4-year period in 20 patients and five controls. Total volume reduction was noted in both hemispheres to a greater degree in patients than controls. When adjusted for total brain size, left ventricular enlargement occurred in patients, but not controls, over time. These preliminary data suggest that subtle cortical atrophy may be occurring over time after the onset of illness.",
