     "AB": "Myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) is a major substrate for protein kinase C, and is involved in synaptic plasticity. Using both Northern blot and in situ hybridization techniques, we investigated whether MARCKS expression varied according to the cerebral region, including the hippocampal formation, or according to the type of neuron. Northern blot analysis showed that the MARCKS mRNA level was higher in the association areas than in the primary sensory and motor areas of the cerebral neocortex. MARCKS mRNA levels in the hippocampus and the amygdala were as high as those in the association areas. The in situ hybridization experiments confirmed the Northern blot results and showed the distribution and characteristics of MARCKS mRNA-positive neurons. In the association areas of the neocortex, prominent signals were observed in neurons in layers II-VI. In the primary areas, prominent signals were restricted to neurons in layers IV-VI. In the hippocampus, the most intense hybridization signals were observed in neurons in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. The observed region-specific expression might reflect functional specialization for plasticity in individual regions of the monkey cerebral cortex.",
