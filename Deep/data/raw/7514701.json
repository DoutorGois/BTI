     "AB": "The simultaneous use of different neuroanatomical anterograde tracers provides a potentially powerful method to study the convergence of afferent systems in a particular brain area. However, a simple routine procedure to apply multiple anterograde tracers in conjunction with their simultaneous visualization is still missing. We report an easy and straightforward application of three sensitive anterograde tracers: Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), rhodamine-conjugated dextran amine (RDA) and biotin-conjugated dextran amine (BDA). These tracers can be visualized simultaneously and permanently through a triple-staining procedure with nickel-enhanced diaminobenzidine (DAB-Ni), DAB and 1-naphthol/Azur B as chromogens. Our test model comprised the projections from the nucleus reuniens thalami and entorhinal cortex. Both projection systems show a high degree of overlap in their terminal fields in the hippocampus. Two tracers were injected in the left and right entorhinal cortex, respectively; a third tracer was injected in the nucleus reuniens. This combination of injections provided a good opportunity to compare the three tracers in one and the same animal. PHA-L, RDA and BDA, injected in either of the injection sites, turned out to be equally sensitive and revealed the morphology of the involved projection systems in great detail. The triple-staining protocol yielded an excellent, simultaneous detectability of the three tracers with a remarkably low background level. Thus, the combination of the anterograde tracers PHA-L, RDA and BDA, in conjunction with the triple-staining procedure, offers a very attractive approach for neuroanatomical research.",
