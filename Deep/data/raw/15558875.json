     "AB": "Dipole sources of interictal epileptiform activities recorded by conventional electroencephalogram (EEG) were estimated using the dipole tracing method. Four cases of temporal lobe epilepsy with medial temporal lesions were studied. Two patients with hippocampal sclerosis, one patient with granulation in the hippocampus and one patient with cavernous angioma were involved in the study. Interictal epileptiform activities were classified into two patterns according to the topography of spikes. They were widespread spikes over the parasagittal electrodes (parasagittal spikes) and restricted spikes at the temporal electrodes (temporal spikes). Dipole sources of parasagittal spikes were localized in the medio-basal temporal lobe with vertically orientated vector moment. Dipole sources of temporal spikes were localized in the medio-basal temporal lobe with horizontally orientated vector moment. Locations of dipoles and directions of vector moments were consistent with topography and polarity of spikes. The difference in the two patterns of interictal epileptiform activities was derived from the difference in the direction of the vector moment of dipole sources. There was no difference in the location of dipole sources. Both the dipole sources and the lesions were localized in the same medio-basal temporal lobe. Dipole tracing was very useful in localizing the dipole sources of interictal epileptiform activities and in understanding the neurophysiological background.",
