     "AB": "We examined cytosolic cytochrome c in gerbil hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions after induction of 5-min ischemia by immunoblotting. In the CA1 region, cytochrome c was detected in the cytosolic fraction from 1 to 6 h after ischemia by Western blotting, while it was not detected in the CA3 region. Following intraventricular administration of cyclosporin A (CsA), detectable cytosolic cytochrome c was dramatically decreased, and about 80% of CA1 neurons survived after ischemia. The present studies demonstrate that cytochrome c is translocated from mitochondria to the cytosol in the early stage of delayed neuronal cell death, and suggest the involvement of the mitochondrial permeability transition.",
