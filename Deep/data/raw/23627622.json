     "AB": "In this study, we present a novel low-frequency electrical stimulation paradigm for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). The paradigm utilizes the hippocampal commissure as a unique stimulation target to simultaneously influence large portions of the bilateral hippocampal network. When applied to an acute rat model of MTLE, animals that received stimulation exhibited an 88% reduction in the signal power of the bilateral epileptiform activity relative to the control group. In addition, the stimulation entrained the hippocampal network's spontaneous epileptiform activity and disrupted its bilateral synchrony.",
