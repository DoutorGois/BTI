     "AB": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark neuropathological lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using a triple transgenic model (3xTg-AD) that develops both lesions in AD-relevant brain regions, we determined the consequence of Abeta clearance on the development of tau pathology. Here we show that Abeta immunotherapy reduces not only extracellular Abeta plaques but also intracellular Abeta accumulation and most notably leads to the clearance of early tau pathology. We find that Abeta deposits are cleared first and subsequently reemerge prior to the tau pathology, indicative of a hierarchical and direct relationship between Abeta and tau. The clearance of the tau pathology is mediated by the proteasome and is dependent on the phosphorylation state of tau, as hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates are unaffected by the Abeta antibody treatment. These findings indicate that Abeta immunization may be useful for clearing both hallmark lesions of AD, provided that intervention occurs early in the disease course.",
