     "AB": "In this study we compared the results of visual analysis of MR imaging with T2 relaxation time mapping of the mesial structures in a group of 97 patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy. All patients underwent a clinical neurological examination, neuropsychological investigation, prolonged video-EEG monitoring, SPECT imaging, MR imaging, and T2 relaxation time mapping. T2 relaxation times were estimated with a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence with 48 echoes (15 to 720 ms). The mean T2 relaxation time value was 118.5 +/- 2 ms in the hippocampi and 120.3 +/- 1.9 ms in the amygdala of 21 healthy subjects used as controls. T2 relaxation mapping revealed mesial temporal sclerosis in 91.8% of the patients (often involving both the hippocampus and the amygdala) and evidenced bilateral involvement in 44.6% of the patients against 72.2 and 6.2%, respectively, for MR imaging. The ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampal T2 relaxation time values did significantly correlate with seizure frequency and the contralateral hippocampal T2 relaxation time value with the duration of epilepsy. In conclusion, this quantitative method is highly sensitive for the detection of mesial temporal sclerosis and permits a better evaluation of the apparently normal contralateral mesial structures.",
