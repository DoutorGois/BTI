     "AB": "Nogo-A interaction with its different receptors (Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1), S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2), paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB)) restricts plasticity and growth-dependent processes leading, via the activation of different signaling pathway to the stabilization of the neuronal networks (either developmentally or during processes of memory consolation in the mature nervous system). Taking away these molecular brakes might allow for the induction of extensive structural and functional rearrangements and might promote compensatory growth processes after an injury of the CNS, in cortical structures as well as in the spinal cord. However, it is important to keep in mind that this could as well be a dangerous endeavor, since it might facilitate unwanted and unnecessary (and probably even maladaptive) neuronal connections.",
