     "AB": "GH and GH secretagogues (GHSs) are involved in many cellular activities such as stimulation of mitosis, proliferation and differentiation. As astrocytes are involved in developmental and protective functions, our aim was to analyse the effects of GH and GH-releasing hexapeptide on astrocyte proliferation and differentiation in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. Treatment of adult male Wistar rats with GH (i.v., 100 mug/day) for 1 week increased the levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and decreased the levels of vimentin in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. These changes were not accompanied by increased proliferation. By contrast, GH-releasing hexapeptide (i.v., 150 mug/day) did not affect GFAP levels but increased proliferation in the areas studied. To further study the intracellular mechanisms involved in these effects, we treated C6 astrocytoma cells with GH or GH-releasing hexapeptide and the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, and observed that the presence of this inhibitor reverted the increase in GFAP levels induced by GH and the proliferation induced by GH-releasing hexapeptide. We conclude that although GH-releasing hexapeptide is a GHS, it may exert GH-independent effects centrally on astrocytes when administered i.v., although the effects of both substances appear to be mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway.",
