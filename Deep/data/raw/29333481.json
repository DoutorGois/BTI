     "AB": "It has been proposed that path integration in mammals is performed by the convergence of internally generated speed and directional inputs onto grid cells. Although this hypothesis has been supported by the discovery that head direction, speed, and grid cells are intermixed within entorhinal cortex and by the recent finding that head-direction inputs are necessary for grid firing, many details on how grid cells are generated have remained elusive. For example, analysis of recording data suggests that substituting head direction for movement direction accrues errors that preclude the formation of grid patterns. To address this discrepancy, we propose that the organization of grid networks makes it plausible that movement-direction signals are an output from grid cells and that temporally precise grid cell sequences provide a robust directional signal to other spatial and directional cell types.",
