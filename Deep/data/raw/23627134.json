     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effect and mechanism of (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the degeneretive changes of the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice induced with chemical drugs. METHODS: AD model mice were established by subcutaneously injecting with 3% D-gal at the dose of 150 mg/kg body weight once daily for 6 weeks. From the third week, the mice of D-gal + V(E) 280 U/kg group, D-gal + EGCG 2 mg/(kg x d) group and D-gal + EGCG 6 mg/(kg x d) group were intragastricly given with 5.6% V(E) at the dose of 280 IU/kg and EGCG at the dose of 2 mg/kg x d or 6 mg/kg x d respectively after injection of D-gal. The mice of control group, D-gal + dd H2O group and D-gal + oil group were administered with same volume vehicle distilled water and soybean oil respectively. The pathological changes of the brain in AD model mice were observed by HE staining analysis, the immunohistochemical analysis of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and evaluating the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the hippocampus of mice by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: EGCG 2 mg/(kg x d) or 6 mg/(kg x d) 4 weeks, ig evidently released neuronal injury in the hippocampus of the AD mice induced by D-gal, and significantly reduced the express of Abeta and APP in the hippocampus of AD model mice induced by D-gal (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: EGCG has a protective effect on AD model mice induced by D-gal by decreasing the expression of APP and beta-Amyloid in the hippocampus of mice.",
