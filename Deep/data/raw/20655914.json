     "AB": "The study was undertaken to evaluate changes in the activity of adenosine deaminase (ADA) in brains of rats infected by Trypanosoma evansi. Each rat was intraperitoneally infected with 10(6) trypomastigotes either suspended in fresh (group A; n = 13) and cryopreserved blood (group B; n = 13). Thirteen animals were used as control (group C). ADA activity was estimated in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus. No differences (P > 0.05) in ADA activity were observed in the cerebellum between infected and non-infected animals. Significant (P < 0.05) reductions in ADA activity occurred in cerebral cortex in acutely (day 4 post-infection; PI) and chronically (day 20 PI) infected rats. ADA activity was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in the hippocampus in acutely infected rats, but significantly (P < 0.05) increased in the chronically infected rats. Significant (P < 0.05) reductions in ADA activity occurred in the striatum of chronically infected rats. Parasites could be found in peripheral blood and brain tissue through microscopic examination and PCR assay, respectively, in acutely and chronically infected rats. The reduction of ADA activity in the brain was associated with high levels of parasitemia and anemia in acute infections. Alterations in ADA activity of the brain in T. evansi-infected rats may have implications for pathogenesis of the disease.",
