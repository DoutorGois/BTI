     "AB": "Synaptopodin (SP), an actin binding protein associated with the spine apparatus, has been proposed to affect the ability of neurons to undergo synaptic plasticity. In the present study, we compared the density of SP puncta in stratum radiatum of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) with that of the ventral hippocampus (VH), a region that expresses only small and short lived LTP. Surprisingly, the VH contains significantly higher density of SP puncta than the DH. Following exposure to an acute stress, LTP was enhanced in the VH and suppressed in the DH. While SP density did change following stress, no similar trends were seen in the two sectors of the hippocampus. Thus, our results indicate a lack of clear interrelation between the density of SP and the ability to express LTP in the hippocampus.",
