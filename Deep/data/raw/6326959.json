     "AB": "The firing repertoires of theta cells in the CA1 and dentate layers of the hippocampal formation of the freely moving rabbit were analyzed during 3 behavioral conditions: (1) voluntary motor patterns, termed type 1 theta behaviors; (2) automatic motor patterns, termed type 2LIA behaviors; (3) alert immobility with presentation of sensory stimuli, termed type 2 theta behavior. Cholinergic manipulations were shown to effect the firing repertoires of theta cells during the type 2 theta behavior condition (sensory processing) and not the other two behavioral conditions. A hypothesis of a sensorimotor processing function of the hippocampal formation is presented and discussed.",
