     "AB": "In this work we have determined the role of the 26S proteasome in the regulation of the content of progesterone receptors (PR-A and PR-B), estrogen receptors (ER-alpha and ER-beta), the coactivator SRC-1 and the corepressor SMRT in the rat brain during the estrous cycle. The 26S proteasome inhibitor MG132 was injected once into the lateral ventricle on proestrous day; and 24h later, on estrous day we evaluated the content of PR and ER isoforms, SRC-1 and SMRT in the hypothalamus, the preoptic area and the hippocampus by Western blot. A significant increase in the content of both PR isoforms, ER-beta and SRC-1 was observed after the administration of MG132 in the three studied cerebral regions. SMRT content was increased in the hypothalamus and the preoptic area and a significant increase in ER-alpha content was only observed in the preoptic area. These results suggest that essential proteins that participate in progesterone and estrogen actions in the brain should be regulated by the 26S proteasome in a tissue-specific manner in physiological conditions.",
