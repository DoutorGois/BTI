They seem to comply adequately with the following requirements: similarity of inducing conditions; similarity of behavioral states; similarity of underlying neurobiological mechanisms; and reversibility by usual pharmacological treatment. The model seems adequate to reproduce several symptoms of the disorder, offering a good experimental tool for the analysis of its inducing conditions, affected neurobiological mechanisms, and clinical treatment.",
