     "AB": "Polychlorinated biphenyls are one of the environmental toxicants and neurotoxic compounds which induce the production of free radicals. Creatine kinase plays a key role in energy metabolism of nervous tissue and might be one of the targets for reactive oxygen species. Melatonin, an indoleamine, plays an important role in neurodegenerative diseases as an antioxidant and neuroprotector. The objective of the present study was to investigate the protective role of melatonin on polychlorinated biphenyl (Aroclor 1254)-induced oxidative stress and the changes in creatine kinase activity in brain regions of adult rats. Group I: rats were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered with corn oil (vehicle) for 30 days. Group II: rats injected i.p. with Aroclor 1254 at 2 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day for 30 days. Groups III and IV: rats i.p. received melatonin (5 or 10 mg/kg bw/day) simultaneously with Aroclor 1254 for 30 days. After 30 days, rats were killed and the brain regions were dissected to cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. Lipid peroxidation, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels were determined. The activity of creatine kinase was assayed in serum and brain regions, and its isoenzymes in serum were separated electrophoretically. Activity of creatine kinase was decreased while an increase in H2O2, hydroxyl radical and lipid peroxidation was observed in brain regions of polychlorinated biphenyl-treated rats. Also polychlorinated biphenyl exposure showed a significant increase in serum creatine kinase level and its isoforms such as BB-creatine kinase, MB-creatine kinase, and MM-creatine kinase. Administration of melatonin prevented these alterations induced by polychlorinated biphenyl by its free radical scavenging mechanism. Thus, polychlorinated biphenyl alters creatine kinase activity by inducing oxidative stress in brain regions, which can be protected by melatonin.",
