     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of deltamethrin (DM) on the permeability of mitochondrial membrane and the expression of cytochrome C in brain tissue of rats. METHODS: Wistar rats were randomizedly divided into five groups (including four treated groups and one control group). In the treated groups, DM of 12.5 mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally once in rats and the rats were sacrificed 5, 24, 48 and 72 hours later while in the control group, the salad oil of 5 mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally once. The mitochondria in brain tissue of rats were extracted to measure the membrane permeability and the activity of cytochrome C oxidase as well as the expression of cytochrome C in cortex and hippocampus. RESULTS: After the treatment the permeability of mitochondrial membrane was significantly increased in the treated groups compared with the control group. The expression of cytochrome C was increased in cortex and hippocampus CA1 and CA2 5 h, 24 h and 48 h groups and CA4 24 h group (0.57 +/- 0.04, 0.67 +/- 0.09, 0.58 +/- 0.04) and (0.81 +/- 0.18) (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) while there was no significant difference in the expression of cytochrome C in cortex and hippocampus CA2 72 h group and CA3 and CA4 5 h, 48 h and 72 h groups between the treated groups and the control group (P > 0.05). The activity of cytochrome C oxidase was inhibited (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Deltamethrin can significantly increase the permeability of mitochondrial membrane and the expression of cytochrome C in brain tissue of rats.",
