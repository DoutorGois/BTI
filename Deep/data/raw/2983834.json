     "AB": "The chronic rat preparation was utilized to study the effects of noradrenaline (NA) depletion on field potentials recorded from the hilus of the fascia dentata. Both single pulses and high-frequency trains were applied to the perforant path (PP). The effects of NA depletion on baseline responses as well as on long-term potentiation (LTP) were examined. Reduced NA levels resulted in an increase in the population spike amplitude and a depression of the population excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). Depleted animals showed significantly higher levels of LTP of the population EPSP, but reduced levels of population spike LTP (measured 13-15 min after tetanization). There were, however, no differences in LTP levels 1 week after the potentiation tests. These results demonstrate that NA levels do not affect that component of LTP which can persist for several weeks.",
