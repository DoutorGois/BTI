     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline, presence of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles. Kinins act through B1 and B2 G-protein coupled receptors (B1R and B2R). Chronic infusion of Abeta peptide leads to memory impairment and increases in densities of both kinin receptors in memory processing areas. Similar memory impairment was observed in C57BL/6 mice (WTAbeta) but occurred earlier in mice lacking B2R (KOB2Abeta) and was absent in mice lacking B1R (KOB1Abeta). Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the participation of B1R and B2R in Abeta peptide induced cognitive deficits through the evaluation of densitiesof kinin receptors, synapses, cell bodies and number of Abeta deposits in brain ofWTAbeta, KOB1Abeta and KOB2Abeta mice. An increase in B2R density was observed in both WTAbeta and KOB1Abeta in memory processing related areas. KOB1Abeta showed a decrease in neuronal density and an increase in synaptic density and, in addition, an increase in Abeta deposits in KOB2Abeta was observed. In conclusion, memory preservation in KOB1Abeta, could be due to the increase in densities of B2R, suggesting a neuroprotective role for B2R, reinforced by the increased number of Abeta plaques in KOB2Abeta. Our data point to B2R as a potential therapeutic target in AD.",
