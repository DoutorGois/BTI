     "AB": "The deposition of tau inclusions is one of the neuropathological hallmarks in neurodegenerative disorders with dementia. We have reported that the N-terminal fragment of a human granin-like neuroendocrine peptide precursor (N-proSAAS) is accumulated in Pick bodies. However, it is unknown whether N-proSAAS is widely accumulated in tau inclusions in other tauopathies. Here, we performed an immunohistochemical examination using antibodies against both the N- and C-terminal sequence of proSAAS in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and parkinsonism-dementia complex on Guam. The antibody against N-proSAAS immunostained neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques in both diseases, whereas the antibody against the C-terminal sequence of proSAAS did not. The results of the present study suggest that N-proSAAS or proSAAS-like molecules were trapped within the tau fibrils and accumulated in tau inclusions.",
