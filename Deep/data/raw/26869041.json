     "AB": "3,3'-Iminodipropionitrile (IDPN), one of the nitrile derivatives, can induce persistent neurotoxicity, and therefore cause dyskinesia and cognitive impairments. Gastrodin, a main bioactive ingredient of Gastrodia elata Blume, is shown to greatly improve cognitive function. The aim of this study was to further determine whether administration of gastrodin can ameliorate IDPN-induced cognitive deficits in the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR) task, and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Results showed that exposure to IDPN (100 mg/kg/day, for 8 days) significantly impaired spatial and object recognition memory and that repeated treatment with gastrodin (150 mg/kg/day, for 6 weeks) could effectively alleviate the IDPN-induced cognitive impairments as indicated by increased spatial memory and discrimination ratio in the MWM and NOR tests. Gastrodin treatment also reverted IDPN-induced decreases of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels and increases of a2 GABAA receptor protein expression in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of IDPN-treated rats. These results suggest that gastrodin treatment may provide a novel pharmacological strategy for IDPN-induced cognitive deficits, which was mediated, at least in part, by normalizing the GABAergic system.",
