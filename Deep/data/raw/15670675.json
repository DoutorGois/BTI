     "AB": "Amplitudes of the P3 recorded invasively from the medial temporal lobe (MTL-P3) have been reported to be reduced on the side of a mediotemporal epileptogenic focus. This reduction has been attributed to the massive cell loss within the hippocampus associated with hippocampal sclerosis. It has remained unclear how functional connectivity between the hippocampus and rhinal cortex, as well as within the hippocampus, is altered in hippocampal sclerosis. To investigate this issue, we analyzed to what extent stimulus-related phase-locking and power changes within the low-frequency range (2-30 Hz) and within the gamma band (32-48 Hz), as well as rhinal-hippocampal phase synchronization contribute to the averaged MTL-P3 potentials. Event-related responses were recorded via bilateral depth electrodes in epilepsy patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis, who performed a visual oddball experiment. On the contralateral (nonsclerotic) side, successful target detection was associated with an increase of power and phase locking of hippocampal activity in both the low-frequency range and in the gamma range. Besides, there were rhinal-hippocampal synchronization enhancements in the theta and gamma range. On the ipsilateral (sclerotic) side, the event-related power increase in the low-frequency range had almost disappeared, a finding likely to be explained by the loss of principle neurons. However, low-frequency phase-locking, rhinal-hippocampal synchronization, as well as event-related power changes in the gamma range persisted ipsilaterally, although there were differences in temporal and spectral characteristics. These findings support the hypothesis that functional connectivity between hippocampus and rhinal cortex, as well as intrahippocampal connectivity, are partially preserved in hippocampal sclerosis.",
