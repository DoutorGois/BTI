     "AB": "It has been suggested that sleep has a restorative function; however, experimental support is limited. Hence, we investigated whether changes in the level of antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein and proapoptotic BAX protein occur during sleep deprivation (SD) and sleep rebound, and evaluated the spontaneous changes in these proteins, along the light-dark cycle, in the adult male Wistar rat. Estimations were made in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and pons. We observed that BCL-2 exhibited diurnal variations in the prefrontal cortex and striatum, whereas BAX varied in the striatum and showed only small variations in the pons as measured by immunoblotting. The BCL-2/BAX ratio exhibited diurnal variations in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. BCL-2 and BAX levels were affected by 24 hr of total SD and 24 hr of sleep rebound. SD decreased the BCL-2/BAX ratio in the prefrontal cortex and pons. Sleep rebound increased the BCL-2/BAX ratio in the hippocampus. In conclusion, the BCL-2/BAX ratio is high during the dark phase as compared with the light phase in the prefrontal cortex and during the light phase as compared with the dark phase in the striatum. SD decreased the BCL-2/BAX ratio in the prefrontal cortex and pons, whereas sleep rebound increased it in the hippocampus. These changes point out structures in the brain that express these proteins as a response to the light-dark cycle. Similarly, SD and sleep rebound seem to change these proteins expression in some other brain structures, suggesting that cellular vulnerability might be altered by these changes.",
