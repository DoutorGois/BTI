     "AB": "The insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose-6-phosphate (IGF-II/M6P) receptor is single transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the trafficking of lysosomal enzymes and the internalization of circulating IGF-II. At present, there is little information regarding the cellular distribution of the IGF-II/M6P receptor within the adult rat brain. With the use of immunoblotting and immunocytochemical methods, we found that the IGF-II/M6P receptor is widely but selectively expressed in all major brain areas, including the olfactory bulb, striatum, cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Intense IGF-II/M6P receptor immunoreactivity was apparent on neuronal cell bodies within the striatum, deeper layers (layers IV and V) of the cortex, pyramidal and granule cell layers of the hippocampal formation, selected thalamic nuclei, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, pontine nucleus and motoneurons of the brainstem as well as in the spinal cord. Moderate neuronal labeling was evident in the olfactory bulb, basal forebrain areas, hypothalamus, superior colliculus, midbrain areas, granule cells of the cerebellum and in the intermediate regions of the spinal gray matter. We also observed dense neuropil labeling in many regions, suggesting that this receptor is localized in dendrites and/or axon terminals. Double-labeling studies further indicated that a subset of IGF-II/M6P receptor colocalizes with cholinergic cell bodies and fibers in the septum, striatum, diagonal band complex, nucleus basalis, cortex, hippocampus, and motoneurons of the brainstem and spinal cord. The observed widespread distribution and colocalization of IGF-II/M6P receptor in the adult rat brain provide an anatomic basis to suggest a multifunctional role for the receptor in a wide-spectrum of central nervous system neurons, including those expressing a cholinergic phenotype.",
