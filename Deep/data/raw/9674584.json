     "AB": "The effect of long-term adrenalectomy on NMDA receptors in the rat hippocampus was studied. Hippocampal sections of control and adrenalectomized rats were incubated with [3H]MK-801, a radiolabeled non-competitive inhibitor of the NMDA receptor. Analysis by in vitro autoradiography showed a significant decrease in [3H]MK-801 binding in the dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA4 areas, as well as the temporal cortex. Results of this study suggest that glucocorticoids are vital for the regulation of the NMDA receptors.",
