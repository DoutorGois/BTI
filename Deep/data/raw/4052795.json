     "AB": "Ovariectomized Long-Evans rats received bilateral rostral hypothalamic infusions of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT). Neurochemical determination of catecholamines (CA) and indoleamines in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and mesencephalon revealed that 5,7-DHT infusions had no effect on CA content in these areas nor in mesencephalic serotonin or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). However, the neurotoxin produced significant decreases in hippocampal serotonin and 5-HIAA. Serotonin-depleted animals exhibited an increase in both spontaneous and estradiol-induced wheel running. In addition it was found that serotonin-depleted animals exhibit an enhanced activity response to starvation. Because estrogen is thought to decrease serotonergic transmission, the enhanced activity response to estrogen may be secondary to an estrogen-related exaggeration of the 5,7-DHT-induced serotonin depletion. The increased activity effect of starvation may indicate that serotonin-depleted animals do not effectively mobilize energy stored as lipid.",
