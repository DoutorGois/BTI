     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Recently, the Chinese Verbal Learning Test (ChVLT) was developed to assess episodic memory in Chinese speakers. The goal of this analysis was to determine whether memory consolidation as measured by the ChVLT was specifically associated with hippocampal volume in patients with cognitive impairment. METHODS: We administered the ChVLT to 22 Chinese-speaking patients with mild cognitive impairment and 9 patients with dementia and obtained hippocampal and cortical volumes from T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Linear regression revealed that hippocampal volume explained 9.9% of the variance in delayed memory (P = .018) after controlling for the effects of age, education, immediate recall after the last learning trial, overall level of cognitive impairment, and volumes of other cortical regions. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the ChVLT is specifically correlated with hippocampal volume, supporting its utility for detecting hippocampal disease and monitoring hippocampal state over time.",
