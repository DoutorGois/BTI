     "AB": "1. Intracerebral microdialysis was used to determine whether 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) release in the ventral hippocampus of rats anaesthetized with chloral hydrate was modulated by 5-HT3 receptors. 2. It was confirmed that 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H-indole (RU 24969), a selective 5-HT1B receptor agonist, decreased 5-HT release in a dose- and concentration-related manner when administered i.p. (1 and 5 mg kg-1) or via the dialysis probe (0.1 and 1 microM) respectively. The effect of RU 24969 infusion (1 microM) was attenuated by concurrent infusion of metitepine (10 microM) into the hippocampus. 3. When infused into the hippocampus for 15 min, the selective 5-HT3 receptor agonist, 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (2-methyl-5-HT; 0.1- 10 microM) increased dialysate 5-HT levels in a concentration-related manner; an effect which was abolished by concurrent infusion of 3-tropanyl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate (1 microM, MDL 72222), a selective 5-HT3 antagonist. 4. MDL 72222 had no effects on hippocampal 5-HT release when administered via the dialysis probe (1 or 10 microM). 5. The data show that 5-HT3 and 5-HT1B receptors have opposing roles in the control of 5-HT release in the hippocampus, with 5-HT3 receptors facilitating and 5-HT1B receptors inhibiting 5-HT efflux, respectively. They also indicate that the facilitatory 5-HT3 receptors are not tonically activated.",
