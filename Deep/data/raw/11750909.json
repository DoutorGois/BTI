The spatiotemporal patterns of immunoreactivity of both APG-2 and glial fibrillary acidic protein were very similar, indicating that reactive astrocytes express APG-2, which was confirmed by double immunofluorescence histochemistry. Colocalization of APG-2 and a neuronal marker NeuN in the neurons of the CA2 and CA3 subfields was also confirmed.",
