     "AB": "Processing of information for long-term storage requires specific patterns of activity that lead to modification of synapse structure and eventual change in neural connectivity pattern. Morphological change associated with memory consolidation is reliant on neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) function and that of its polysialylated variant (NCAM PSA). Across species and paradigms, a transient frequency increase of polysialylated neurons in the hippocampal dentate has been found necessary for memory consolidation, however, recent studies suggest that NCAM PSA may serve to suppress memory formation in certain paradigms. As intraventricular infusions of NCAM blocking antibodies have been used successfully to demonstrate its time-dependent role at the 6 h post-training period of memory consolidation, we employed the same procedure to demonstrate a functional requirement for NCAM PSA in the consolidation of two commonly used behavioral paradigms: avoidance conditioning and spatial learning in Wistar rats. Anti-PSA was found to significantly induce amnesia of the passive avoidance response when infused at the 10 h post-training time, a period coincident with the learning-associated increase in dentate polysialylated cell frequency. Moreover, the amnesia became apparent at the 48 h recall time and was not apparent at the 24 h post-training time, suggesting a possible role in memory reconsolidation. A similar anti-PSA action was observed following water maze training in aged animals but was not apparent in young animals, an effect suggested to be due to inadequate antibody saturation of the polysialylated cell population. These studies confirm the requirement for NCAM PSA in memory consolidation and separate it from that of NCAM.",
