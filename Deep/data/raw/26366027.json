     "AB": "Studies investigating the development of memory processes and their neural substrates have flourished over the last two decades. The review by Jabes and Nelson (2015) adds an important piece to our understanding of the maturation of different elements and circuits within the hippocampal system and their association with the progressive development of hippocampal-dependent memory processes in humans. In this accompanying commentary, we explore some additional connections between the nonhuman primate work and the human data, and take the opportunity to highlight some common and additional interpretations of the results. This commentary makes three points: (1) the recognition processes present in the first few days of life may be linked to the early maturation of the medial temporal cortical areas instead of, or in addition to, the early maturation of the subiculum; (2) recent findings on the differential protracted maturation of spatial relational memory processes in monkeys further support the notion proposed by Jabes and Nelson that this protracted development may reflect progressive maturation of the CA1 field of the hippocampus followed by further maturation of CA3/dentate gyrus; (3) finally, further considerations of the differential maturation of the longitudinal hippocampal axis and of the diencephalon are proposed as additional contributors to the refinement of episodic memory functions during development.",
