     "AB": "Focused ultrasound (FUS) in combination with microbubbles (MBs) has been successfully used in the delivery of various-size therapeutic agents across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study revealed that FUS-induced BBB opening size, defined by the size of the largest molecule that can permeate through the BBB, can be controlled by the acoustic pressure as dictated by cavitational mechanisms. Focused ultrasound was applied onto the mouse hippocampus in the presence of systemically administered MBs for trans-BBB delivery of fluorescently labeled dextrans with molecular weights 3 to 2,000 kDa (hydrodynamic diameter: 2.3 to 54.4 nm). The dextran delivery outcomes were evaluated using ex vivo fluorescence imaging. Cavitation detection was employed to monitor the MB cavitation activity associated with the delivery of these agents. It was found that the BBB opening size was smaller than 3 kDa (2.3 nm) at 0.31 MPa, up to 70 kDa (10.2 nm) at 0.51 MPa, and up to 2,000 kDa (54.4 nm) at 0.84 MPa. Relatively smaller opening size (up to 70 kDa) was achieved with stable cavitation only; however, inertial cavitation was associated with relatively larger BBB opening size (above 500 kDa). These findings indicate that the BBB opening size can be controlled by the acoustic pressure and predicted using cavitation detection.",
