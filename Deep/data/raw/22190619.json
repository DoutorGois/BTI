     "AB": "The prevailing view of epileptic seizures is that they are caused by increased hypersynchronous activity in the cortical network. However, this view is based mostly on electroencephalography (EEG) recordings that do not directly monitor neuronal synchronization of action potential firing. In this study, we used multielectrode single-unit recordings from the hippocampus to investigate firing of individual CA1 neurons and directly monitor synchronization of action potential firing between neurons during the different ictal phases of chemoconvulsant-induced epileptic seizures in vivo. During the early phase of seizures manifesting as low-amplitude rhythmic beta-electrocorticography (ECoG) activity, the firing frequency of most neurons markedly increased. To our surprise, the average overall neuronal synchronization as measured by the cross-correlation function was reduced compared with control conditions with ~60% of neuronal pairs showing no significant correlated firing. However, correlated firing was not uniform and a minority of neuronal pairs showed a high degree of correlated firing. Moreover, during the early phase of seizures, correlated firing between 9.8 +/- 5.1% of all stably recorded pairs increased compared with control conditions. As seizures progressed and high-frequency ECoG polyspikes developed, the firing frequency of neurons further increased and enhanced correlated firing was observed between virtually all neuronal pairs. These findings indicated that epileptic seizures represented a hyperactive state with widespread increase in action potential firing. Hypersynchrony also characterized seizures. However, it initially developed in a small subset of neurons and gradually spread to involve the entire cortical network only in the later more intense ictal phases.",
