     "AB": "Membranes from rat cerebellum or hippocampus were photolabeled by [3H]flunitrazepam and incubated with various endoglycosidases. The largest reduction in apparent molecular weight of photolabeled proteins P51 (mol. wt. 51,000) and P55 (mol. wt. 55,000) was obtained using endoglycosidase F or glycopeptidase F. However, even after extensive treatment with these enzymes the deglycosylated products of proteins P51 (apparent mol. wt. 44,000) and P55 (two peptides with apparent mol. wt. 48,000 and 51,000) still differed in their apparent molecular weight. This might indicate that structural features other than N-linked carbohydrates are responsible for the difference in apparent molecular weight of these proteins.",
