     "AB": "A quantitative dot immunobinding procedure was used to quantify glial [the S-100 protein and the glial fibrillary acidic (GFA) protein] and neuronal (the 68- and 200-kDa neurofilament polypeptides, neuron-specific enolase, and neuronal cell adhesion molecule) markers. A single intraperitoneal administration of 10 mg/kg of MK 801 blocked the increase of glial parameters and the decrease in content of neuronal marker proteins that occurred as the response to an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) lesion in the rat hippocampus. The degradation products of GFA protein and the 68-kDa neurofilament polypeptide that were induced by the NMDA lesion did not appear after MK 801 treatment. This study shows that brain-specific proteins are a set of precise tools for the evaluation of neuroprotective effects of antagonists to excitatory amino acids.",
