     "AB": "In 20 unselected autopsy cases tissue blocks from the hippocampus with adjacent entorhinal cortex and neocortex were stained for acetylcholinesterase (AChE). From five brains shown to have large numbers of senile plaques tissue, adjacent to that taken for AChE tissue blocks, was embedded in paraffin and sections were immunostained for the A4 protein. The morphological aspects were compared. Equivalent types of plaques and plaque-like structures were observed in the A4- and ACHE-stained sections. On selected tissue blocks from patients with many senile plaques two immediately adjacent cryostat sections were stained, one for AChE and one for A4 protein. The same individual plaques could be identified on the two sections. These findings suggest that high AChE activity is intimately associated with the process of A4 protein formation and accumulation in plaques and that this association already occurs at a very early stage of plaque formation.",
