     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Naofucong Granule (NFCG), a self-manufactured Chinese herbal preparation, on memory and cerebral cholinergic system in cerebral ischemic mice. METHODS: Mice model of learning/memory impairment was established by bilateral ligation of internal carotid arteries. The memory ability of mice was assessed by measuring latent period in the Morris Water Maze. RESULTS: Seven days after modeling, the latent period and swimming course of mice (82.3 +/- 32.0 seconds and 986.7 +/- 414.5 cm) were longer than those of control (sham-operated mice, 35.3 +/- 37.9 seconds and 410.4 +/- 507.0 cm, P < 0.01). Administration of NFCG could ameliorate these changes to 30.6 +/- 31.3 seconds and 378.1 +/- 386.3 cm (P < 0.01) and normalized. In the model animals, the choline acetylase activity in brain cortex and hippocampus was 35.64 +/- 4.96 and 45.08 +/- 4.96 respectively, which was significantly lower than that in the control (40.52 +/- 4.74 and 53.96 +/- 8.53); so was the activity of cholinergic receptor M in cerebral cortex (44.41 +/- 10.67 vs 57.56 +/- 6.98) and the activity of cholinergic receptor N in cerebral cortex and hippocampus (232.41 +/- 21.99 and 303.72 +/- 72 +/- 28.78 vs 276.66 +/- 32.46 and 385.56 +/- 46.88), P < 0.05 or P < 0.01. Administration of NFCG also could reverse them and elevate to normal level. CONCLUSION: NFCG has protective function on intellectual deficits in cerebral ischemic mice, which may be related to its action in enhancing function of cholinergic system.",
