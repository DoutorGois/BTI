     "AB": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that, in addition to its essential role in the function of the immune system, is present in the central nervous system (CNS). In particular, pathologically increased CNS IL-6 has been linked to impairments in memory performance. Thus, the aim of our present study was to investigate hippocampus-dependent and -independent memory, in combination with exploratory and anxiety related behaviour in IL-6 knock-out (IL-6KO) mice. The experiments were performed with 9 male IL-6KO and 9 age matched male wild-type (CTRL) mice. Hippocampus-dependent learning was assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM), hippocampus-independent learning with the novel object recognition memory test (NORM). The test-battery for additional behavioural assessments included open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM) and forced swim test (FST). IL-6KO mice showed impaired memory processes in the NORM as well in the MWM test. This could not be explained by reduced general activity or increased baseline anxiety. But, there was evidence for a higher susceptibility for stress and reduced exploratory behaviour in IL-6KO mice. In conclusion, absent CNS IL-6 does not lead to an improvement in memory function, but instead to an impairment. As \"too little and too much spoils everything\", our findings do not contradict the hypothesis of an involvement of IL-6 in memory processes. However, it remains unclear if impairments of memory are a specific result of disturbed IL-6 signalling, or rather an epiphenomenon associated with reduced exploratory behaviour and stress resistance.",
