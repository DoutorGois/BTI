     "AB": "Effects of intraperitoneal and intrahippocampal 2-chloroadenosine and caffeine were examined in fully kindled amygdaloid rats. Intraperitoneal administration of 2-chloroadenosine (5 and 10 mg/kg) decreased afterdischarge duration, stage 5 seizure duration and prolonged time taken to reach stage 4 seizure. Only the 10 mg/kg dose induced a significant reduction in seizure stage. Intraperitoneal administration of caffeine (50 mg/kg) increased both afterdischarge duration and stage 5 seizure duration but did not significantly alter other parameters. Intrahippocampal microinfusion of 2-chloroadenosine (1 mM) or caffeine (2 mM) did not alter any of the measured seizure parameters. Intraperitoneal but not intrahippocampal pretreatment of animals with caffeine (50 mg/kg and 2 mM, respectively) blocked the anticonvulsant effects induced by intraperitoneal administration of 2-chloroadenosine. It may therefore be concluded that the adenosine A1 receptors of the CA1 region of the hippocampus do not play a role in mediating the anticonvulsant effects of intraperitoneally administered 2-chloroadenosine in amygdaloid kindled rats.",
