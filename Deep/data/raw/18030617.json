     "AB": "Adrenalectomy (ADX) has been useful for a good in vivo model for apoptosis in the hippocampus by the absence of corticosteroids following ADX. In some neurodegenerative diseases, GABAergic neurons are more resistant to neuronal damage as compared with glutamatergic neurons. In the present study, we observed chronological changes in three GABA degradation enzymes, e.g., GABA transaminase (GABA-T), succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) and succinic semialdehyde reductase (SSAR) immunoreactivity and protein levels in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region after ADX. Changes in their immunoreactivities were distinct in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region. GABA-T immunoreactivity and protein level were significantly increased in the CA1 region 3 h after ADX, in contrast, SSAR and SSADH immunoreactivity and protein level were increased 12 h and 3-12 h, respectively, after ADX. These results suggest that the increases of GABA-T, SSADH and SSAR immunoreactivity and protein levels in the hippocampal CA1 region in ADX gerbils may be associated with the control of GABA levels in this region.",
