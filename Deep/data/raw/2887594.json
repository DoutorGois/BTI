     "AB": "This study describes the cholinergic innervation of chemically defined nonpyramidal neurons in the hilar region of the rat hippocampus. Cholinergic terminals were identified by immunocytochemistry employing a monoclonal antibody against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme, and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase (ABC) technique. Nonpyramidal neurons in the hilar region were characterized by immunostaining with antibodies against glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-synthesizing enzyme, and somatostatin (SS). The immunoreactivity to these antibodies was detected by using biotinylated secondary antibodies and avidinated ferritin as an electron-dense marker. This electron microscopic double immunostaining procedure enabled us to demonstrate that immunoperoxidase-labeled ChAT-immunoreactive terminals established symmetric synaptic contacts on the ferritin-labeled GAD- and SS-immunoreactive hilar cells. In additional experiments at least some of the GAD- and SS-immunoreactive hilar neurons were further characterized as commissural neurons by retrograde filling with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) following an injection of the tracer into the contralateral hilus. From these triple labeling experiments, we concluded that at least some GABAergic and somatostatin-containing neurons in the hilar region, which are postsynaptic to cholinergic terminals, project to the contralateral hippocampus. Together with previous studies on the cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus and fascia dentata, our present results thus demonstrate that different types of hippocampal cells, including GABAergic and peptidergic commissural neurons in the hilar region, receive a cholinergic input.",
