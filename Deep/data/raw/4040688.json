After electrolytic lesions of the hippocampus and the amigdalar complex at early stages of alcoholization the inhibition of development of this pathologic attraction occurred however with subsequent dynamical reorganization of the structural and functional mechanisms of alcoholic motivation and with duplication of the triggering links. Important role of the limbico-neocortical relations was revealed in a development of behavioural and emotional-vegetative disturbances accompanying experimental alcoholism.",
