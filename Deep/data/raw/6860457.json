     "AB": "Rats can learn to persist in making a response that is punished. Brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) systems are known to mediate acute responding to punishment. This work investigates 5-HT involvement in learned resistance to punishment. Forebrain 5-HT was depleted by intracerebral injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. Lesioned rats were fully able to learn resistance to punishment, although acute responding to punishment was impaired. Forebrain 5-HT does not mediate learned resistance to punishment.",
