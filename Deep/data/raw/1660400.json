     "AB": "The effect of magnesium-free medium on electrical and CaM kinase II activity in the rat hippocampal slice was examined. Experimental slices were incubated in 2 mM Mg, then exposed to magnesium-free medium for 1 h. Control slices were concurrently run in 2 mM Mg. Slices were then frozen and CaM kinase II activity was measured in homogenates. Exposure of hippocampal slices to magnesium-free medium resulted in spontaneous epileptiform activity and a concurrent 38 +/- 5.47% decrease in CaM kinase II activity (range 38.8-75.4% of control; n = 7, P less than 0.001, paired Student's t test). The decrease in CaM kinase II activity was not reversible by treatment with protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (58.8 +/- 4.77% of control activity; range 28.6-69.7, P less than 0.01, paired Student's t-test), indicating that the decrease in CaM kinase II activity cannot be accounted for exclusively by autophosphorylation. The results demonstrate that magnesium-free medium treatment can induce spontaneous epileptiform activity and simultaneous changes in CaM kinase II activity.",
