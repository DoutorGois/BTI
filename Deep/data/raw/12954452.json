     "AB": "The purpose of the present study was to study the effect of an acute dose of the serotonin (5-HT) - noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine on extracellular concentrations of 5-HT, NA and dopamine (DA) in the hippocampus and on the peripheral hormone concentrations in freely moving rats. Blood obtained from a catheter placed in the vena femoralis was analyzed for adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), beta-endorphins, prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH) and cortisol. Collections are referred to pre and post injection of 20 mg/kg of venlafaxine. Extracellular hippocampal NA and 5-HT as determined with in vivo microdialysis increased significantly after drug injection. PRL and ACTH were significantly affected by the drug. At the selected dose venlafaxine is able to increase the release of 5-HT but also of NA in rat hippocampus. Due to the dual reuptake properties of the drug and the functional interconnection of the NA and the 5-HT systems, the observed effects on peripheral hormones are possibly mediated by a combined action of these 2 systems.",
