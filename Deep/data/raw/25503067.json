     "AB": "Inhibitors of DNA-binding/differentiation (ID) proteins bind to basic helixloophelix (bHLH) transcription factors, including those that regulate differentiation and cellcycle progression during development, and regulate gene transcription. However, little is known about the role of ID proteins in the brain under transient cerebral ischemic conditions. In the present study, we examined the effects of ischemiareperfusion (I-R) injury on the immunoreactivity and protein levels of IDs 14 in the gerbil hippocampus proper Cornu Ammonis regions CA13 following 5 min of transient cerebral ischemia. Strong ID1 immunoreactivity was detected in the nuclei of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA13 regions; immunoreactivity was significantly changed following I-R in the CA1 region, but not in the CA2/3 region. Five days following I-R, ID1 immunoreactivity was not detected in the CA1 pyramidal neurons. ID1 immunoreactivity was detected only in GABAergic interneurons in the ischemic CA1 region. Weak ID4 immunoreactivity was detected in nonpyramidal cells, and immunoreactivity was again only changed in the ischemic CA1 region. Five days following I-R, strong ID4 immunoreactivity was detected in nonpyramidal cells, which were identified as microglia, and not astrocytes, in the ischemic CA1 region. Furthermore, changes in the protein levels of ID1 and ID4 in the ischemic CA1 region studied by western blot were consistent with patterns of immunoreactivity. In summary, these results indicate that immunoreactivity and protein levels of ID1 and ID4 are distinctively altered following transient cerebral ischemia only in the CA1 region, and that the changes in ID1 and ID4 expression may relate to the ischemiainduced delayed neuronal death.",
