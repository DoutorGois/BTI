     "AB": "Glutamate afferents reaching the ventral tegmental area (VTA) affect dopamine (DA) cells in this structure probably mainly via NMDA receptors. VTA appears to be one of the structures involved in regulation of hippocampal theta rhythm, and this work aimed at assessing the role of glutamatergic activation of the VTA in the theta regulation. Male Wistar rats (n=17) were divided into groups, each receiving intra-VTA microinjection (0.5 mul) of either solvent (water), glutamatergic NMDA agonist (0.2 mug) or antagonist (MK-801, 3.0 mug). Changes in local field potential were assessed on the basis of peak power (Pmax) and corresponding peak frequency (Fmax) for the delta (0.5-3 Hz) and theta (3-6 Hz) bands. NMDA microinjection evoked long-lasting hippocampal theta. The rhythm appeared with a latency of ca. 12 min post-injection and lasted for over 30 min; Pmax in this band was significantly increased for 50 min, while simultaneously Pmax in the delta band remained lower than in control conditions. Theta Fmax and delta Fmax were increased in almost entire post-injection period (by 0.3-0.5 Hz and 0.3-0.7 Hz, respectively). MK-801 depressed the sensory-evoked theta: tail pinch could not induce theta for 30 min after the injection; Pmax significantly decreased in the theta band and at the same time it increased in the delta band. Theta Fmax decreased 10 and 20 min post injection (by 0.4-0.5 Hz) and delta Fmax decreased in almost entire post injection period (by 0.3-0.7 Hz). NMDA injection generates theta rhythm probably through stimulation of dopaminergic activity within the VTA.",
