     "AB": "The hippocampal formation has been extensively described as a key component for object recognition in conjunction with place and context. The present study aimed at describing neural mechanisms in the hippocampal formation that support olfactory-tactile (OT) object discrimination in a task where space and context were not taken into account. The task consisted in discriminating one baited cup among three, each of them presenting overlapping olfactory or tactile elements. The experiment tested the involvement of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the dorsal hippocampus (DH) in the acquisition of this cross-modal task, either with new items or with familiar but recombined items. The main results showed that DH inactivation or cholinergic muscarinic blockade in the DH selectively and drastically disrupted performance in the recombination task. EC inactivation impaired OT acquisition of any OT combinations while cholinergic blockade only delayed it. Control experiments showed that neither DH nor EC inactivation impaired unimodal olfactory or tactile tasks. As a whole, these data suggest that DH-EC interactions are of importance for flexibility of cross-modal representations with overlapping elements.",
