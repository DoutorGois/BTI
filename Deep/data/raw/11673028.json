     "AB": "In this study the role of adenosine A(1) receptors of CA1 region of the hippocampus on amygdala-kindled seizures was investigated in rats. Results obtained showed that in kindled animals, bilateral injection of N(6)-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), an adenosine A(1) receptor agonist, at doses of 0.1, 1 and 10 microM into the CA1 region of the hippocampus significantly decreased the afterdischarge duration and stage 5 seizure duration and increased the latency to stage 4 seizure, but there were no changes in seizure stage. Also, bilateral injection of 1,3-dimethyl-8-cyclopenthylxanthine (CPT), an adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist, at doses of 0.5 and 1 microM into the CA1 region of the hippocampus could not produce any changes in the seizure parameters. Intrahippocampal pretreatment of CPT (1 microM) before CHA (0.1 and 1 microM), reduced the effects of CHA on seizure parameters significantly. Thus, it may be suggested that CA1 region of the hippocampus plays an important role in spreading seizure spikes from the amygdala to other brain regions and activation of adenosine A(1) receptors in this region, participates in anticonvulsant effects of adenosine agonists.",
