     "AB": "The competitive antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonoeptanoic acid (APV) was injected intracerebroventricularly to determine the involvement of NMDA receptors in different stages of memory consolidation. Subsequent experiments used local injections to determine possible sites of drug action. Rats were trained in a rapidly learned olfactory task to find palatable food in a hole in a sponge impregnated with the target odor in the presence of two other sponges with nonrewarded odors. APV injections were made intracerebroventricularly 5 min or 2 hr after the end of the training, and a retention test was given 48 hr later. The results showed that blockade of NMDA receptors immediately after training induces a profound and enduring amnesia with no effect when the treatment is delayed at 2 hr after training. To address the question of the effective sites of action of the intracerebroventricular treatment, APV injections into the hippocampus and into the prelimblic region of the frontal cortex (PLC) were made. Blockade of NMDA receptors into the PLC but not into the hippocampus impaired memory formation of the odor-reward association. The amnesia is not transient, because the retention tests were made 48 hr after training. These results underlie the role of NMDA receptors in the early stage of consolidation of a simple odor-reward associative memory and confirm the role of the PLC in the consolidation of long-term memory.",
