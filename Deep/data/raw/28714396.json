     "AB": "Nicotine exposure affects the hippocampus through activation of hippocampal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are present throughout excitatory and inhibitory hippocampal circuitry. The role of cholinergic functioning in the hippocampus varies across developmental stages so that nicotine exposure differentially affects this region depending upon timing of exposure, producing developmentally distinct changes in structure, function, and behavior. The hippocampus continues to mature well into adolescence, and this development is modulated by cholinergic activity. Further, the hippocampus is a critical participant in learning and memory processes that are modulated by nAChR activity throughout the lifetime. Chronic nicotine exposure during early development and adolescence produces lifelong changes in hippocampal morphology and functioning, and exposure in adulthood and aging disrupts synaptic plasticity mechanisms involved in learning and memory. Thus, the hippocampus is sensitive to the effects of nicotine in an age-dependent manner. We discuss current understanding of the unique effects of nicotine exposure on the hippocampus throughout the lifespan with a focus on hippocampal morphology, cholinergic functioning, and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.",
