     "AB": "5,7-Dichlorokynurenic acid (5,7-DCKA), one of the most potent excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists yet described, binds to a strychnine-insensitive glycine binding site located on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex (Ki = 79 nM versus [3H]glycine). 5,7-DCKA (10 microM) antagonized the ability of NMDA to stimulate the binding of the radiolabeled ion channel blocker N-[3H][1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]-piperidine ([3]TCP). Glycine was able to overcome this effect and in the presence of 5,7-DCKA enhanced [3H]TCP binding to antagonist-free levels. 5,7-DCKA completely and noncompetitively antagonized several NMDA receptor-mediated biochemical and electrophysiological responses. Thus, micromolar concentrations of 5,7-DCKA inhibited NMDA-stimulated elevation of cytosolic calcium in cultured hippocampal neurons, cGMP accumulation in cerebellar slices, and norepinephrine release from hippocampal slices. The glycine antagonist could also block the action of synaptically released agonist, as shown by its ability to inhibit the increase in the magnitude of the population spike that follows tetanic stimulation of the hippocampus in vitro (long term potentiation). Inclusion of glycine or D-serine prevented all these effects of the antagonist. 5,7-DCKA was a potent anticonvulsant when administered intracerebroventricularly to mice. As in the in vitro experiments, the dose-response curve for the antagonist was shifted rightward in a parallel fashion when D-serine was coinjected. This spectrum of activity displayed by a compound acting at the glycine binding site suggests that the therapeutic utility of glycine antagonists will be similar to those proposed for other types of glutamate receptor antagonists.",
