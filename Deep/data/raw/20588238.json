     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Damage to the developing brain may be caused by maternal environment, nutritional deficiencies, failure of protective mechanisms, etc. Further, the developing brain may be damaged by intrauterine ischemia or by ischemia in newborns complicated by perinatal asphyxia. There is an effort to find agents with neuroprotective effect on the developing brain. The aim was to study the effect of the new pyridoindole antioxidant SMe1EC2 on the resistance of offspring hippocampus exposed to ischemia in vitro after treatment of mothers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The electrically evoked responses were determined by extracellular recording from offspring hippocampal slices. The effect of oral treatment of rats with SMe1EC2 over 18 consecutive days, from day 15 of gestation to day 10 post partum (PP) was analyzed in the model of ischemia in vitro measured on the hippocampus of 21-day-old pups, with focus on neuronal function recovery in reoxygenation. RESULTS: Increased recovery of neuronal response was found at the end of 20-min reoxygenation in offspring hippocampal slices exposed to 10-min hypoxia/hypoglycemia from rats whose mothers were treated with the dose of 50 and 250 mg/kg of SMe1EC2, compared to control offspring slices (mothers received vehicle over the same time). CONCLUSIONS: The increased offspring hippocampus resistance to hypoxia/hypoglycemia due to 18-day maternal treatment with SMe1EC2 might have been obtained via the transplacental way as well as in the neonatal period via breast milk, skin and saliva. The manifested neuroprotective effect of SMe1EC2 on the developing brain might find exploitation during risk pregnancy and delivery.",
