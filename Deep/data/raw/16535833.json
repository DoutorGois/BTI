     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe and explore the effect of aluminum on mitochondria in nerve cells of rats. METHODS: Nerve cells of new born rats (1-3 days) were cultured. Ultrastructure of mitochondria, cell death rate (CDR), reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and MTF were performed to investigate the alteration of mitochondrial structure and functions in cultured nerve cells. RESULTS: Aluminum can impair the ultrastructure of cultured nerve cells of rats. Increased CDR, enhanced ROS, decreased MMP, and decreased activity of enzyme in mitochondria were investigated in the group of Al3+ 100 micromol/L and Al3+ 500 micromol/L. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that the alteration of mitochondrial structure and functions have played important roles in neurotoxic mechanism induced by aluminum.",
