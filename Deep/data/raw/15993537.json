     "AB": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to study age-related differences in the neural circuitry involved in perception of negative facial affect. During scanning, 24 younger and 22 older adults viewed blocks of angry and neutral faces. The fMRI data analysis of the angry versus neutral faces contrast demonstrated greater activation in younger versus older individuals in the right amygdala/hippocampus region, whereas older adults demonstrated greater activation in the right anterior-ventral insula cortex. Hence, normal aging seems to affect specific nodes in the neural network involved in processing negative emotional face information. This age-related change from more subcortical to more cortical involvement could reflect functional compensation within the neural system involved in perception of facial affect, or the fact that older adults process emotional information in a different manner than do young adults.",
