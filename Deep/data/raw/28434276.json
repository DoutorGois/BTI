     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The present study has investigated the effects of mobile phone (900-1800 MHz)-induced electromagnetic radiation on redox status in the heart, liver, kidney, cerebellum, and hippocampus of dams and the offspring mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pregnant Balb/C were divided into two groups including the control and the experimental group. The experimental group was exposed to mobile phone (900-1800 MHz), during pregnancy (2 h/d for 20 d). The dams and the offspring of both groups were sacrificed and tissues of interest were harvested immediately after delivery. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, total thiol groups (TTG) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities were determined in the tissues. RESULTS: In the experimental groups, MDA levels were significantly increased, while TTG, SOD, and CAT were significantly decreased in the total tissues of dams and their offspring. CONCLUSION: Exposure to mobile phone (900-1800 MHz) during pregnancy induced oxidative stress in tissues of dams and their offspring.",
