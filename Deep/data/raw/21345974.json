     "AB": "Histone acetylation plays a critical role during long-term memory formation. Several studies have demonstrated that the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) CBP is required during long-term memory formation, but the involvement of other HAT proteins has not been extensively investigated. The HATs CBP and p300 have at least 400 described interacting proteins including transcription factors known to play a role in long-term memory formation. Thus, CBP and p300 constitute likely candidates for transcriptional coactivators in memory formation. In this study, we took a loss-of-function approach to evaluate the role of p300 in long-term memory formation. We used conditional knock-out mice in which the deletion of p300 is restricted to the postnatal phase and to subregions of the forebrain. We found that p300 is required for the formation of long-term recognition memory and long-term contextual fear memory in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and cortical areas.",
