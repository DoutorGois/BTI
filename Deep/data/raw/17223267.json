     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent increase in the strength of synaptic transmission triggered by neuronal activity. Here, we submitted hippocampal slices to a perfusion of forskolin and IBMX, which induces a long-lasting LTP (>4 h) (L-LTP). We separated the proteins of the CA1 region by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). We then immunoblotted them using an anti-p-Tyr antibody. We found a protein whose tyrosine phosphorylation was unchanged 10 min after LTP induction but was dramatically increased after 1h, dropping back to its baseline after 4 h. This protein was identified as rabphilin using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). We also demonstrated that genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphorylation, prevented the development of the late phase of electrically-induced L-LTP. Our results suggest that rabphilin, a protein present in presynaptic terminals, could play a role in the late phase of L-LTP.",
