     "AB": "Using a specific polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbit against amino acids 1-23 of the mouse mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) we investigated the developmental profile of MR expression in the murine CNS by immunocytochemistry. MR protein appeared first at embryonic day E16.5 in the limbic system, i.e. in the hippocampus and induseum griseum. During development and in adulthood, high levels of MR expression were observed in the limbic system, whereas expression levels detectable in layers II, III, V of the neocortex and in motoneurons of cranial nerves and spinal cord were lower. No MR staining was found in the hypothalamus. Developmental MR expression was restricted to neuronal populations that also express MR protein in the adult CNS, indicating that the MR may fulfill the same functions in neurons during development and in adulthood.",
