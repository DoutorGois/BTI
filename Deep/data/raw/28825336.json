     "AB": "The role of glycocalyx in blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and brain damage is poorly understood. Our study aimed to investigate the impacts of endothelial glycocalyx on BBB function in a rat model of cardiac arrest (CA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to 8-min asphyxia CA/CPR. Compared to controls, glycocalyx was mildly injured by CA, severely disrupted by hyaluronidase (HAase) with CA, and mitigated by hydrocortisone (HC) with CA. More importantly, the disruption of glycocalyx caused by HAase treatment was associated with higher BBB permeability and aggravated brain edema at 24 h after return of spontaneous circulation, as well as lower survival rate and poorer neurologic outcome at seventh day. Reversely, less degradation of glycocalyx by HC treatment was accompanied by higher seven-day survival rate and better neurologic outcome. Mechanistically, HAase treatment further increased CA/CPR-induced activation of glia cells and expression of inflammatory factors, whereas HC decreased them in the brain cortex and hippocampus. Glycocalyx degradation results in BBB leakage, brain edema, and deteriorates neurologic outcome after asphyxia CA/CPR in rats. Preservation of glycocalyx by HC could improve neurologic outcome and reduce BBB permeability, apparently through reduced gene transcription-protein synthesis and inflammation.",
