     "AB": "Orthodromic evoked potentials of CA1 pyramidal cells were studied in superfused slices of marmoset hippocampus. N-methylaspartate, quinolinic acid and quisqualic acid depressed the responses, but only the former two compounds appeared to be antagonized by 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate. Kynurenic acid also reduced the orthodromic evoked responses but had no effect on antidromic potentials, the blocking action therefore probably resulting from an interference with synaptic transmission. The study reveals receptors for N-methylaspartate, quisqualate, quinolinate and kynurenic acid in the primate hippocampus broadly comparable with those previously studied in non-primate vertebrates.",
