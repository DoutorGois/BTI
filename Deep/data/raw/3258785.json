     "AB": "Effects of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, (the active metabolite of the neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), on reduction/oxidation activity of mitochondrial cytochromes were studied in rat striatal slices using scanning spectrophotometry. The objective was to test the hypothesis that the neurotoxin alters electron transport in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Incubation of rat striatal slices with MPP+ (1 microM) produced a time-dependent oxidation of Cytochrome-b in a manner consistent with the concept of a block in electron transport in the intramitochondrial respiratory chain between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and Cytochrome-b. This effect of MPP+ was decreased by co-incubation with a potent dopamine uptake inhibitor (mazindol), or when studied in a tissue with low dopaminergic innervation (hippocampus). The amplitude of Cytochrome-b oxidation was greater than that expected from a selective effect of MPP+ on dopaminergic neurons suggesting that neighboring cells are influenced secondary to the MPP+ effect on dopaminergic terminals.",
