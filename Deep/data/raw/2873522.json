     "AB": "The effect of baclofen and clonidine, both individually and in combination, on noradrenaline turnover was examined in several brain regions as well as in the spinal cord using the alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine depletion method. Baclofen (30-50 mg/kg) consistently increased the turnover of noradrenaline in the cortex, hippocampus and spinal cord and this effect was stereoselective for the L-isomer. Clonidine (0.1 mg/kg) decreased noradrenaline turnover in these regions and reversed the effect of baclofen. In the striatum, baclofen (50 mg/kg) decreased the turnover of dopamine in a stereoselective manner. Clonidine (0.1 mg/kg) did not alter dopamine turnover but potentiated the effect of baclofen. These results support behavioural data which suggests that baclofen interacts with central noradrenergic pathways. The nature of such interactions appears to be complex.",
