In this article, I reviewed radiological findings associated with seizures (reduced diffusion and swelling of hippocampus and cortex, and a reversible splenial lesion), and lesions causing epilepsy and seizures, such as congenital abnormality of the brain (holoprosencephaly, hemimegalencephaly, lissencephaly, heterotopia, polymicrogyria, schizencephaly, and focal cortical dysplasia), neurocutaneous syndromes (tuberous sclerosis and Sturge-Weber syndrome), vascular disorders (moyamoya disease/syndrome and cavernous angioma), and encephalitis/encephalopathy (herpes encephalitis, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, acute necrotizing encephalopathy of childhood, and acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion).",
