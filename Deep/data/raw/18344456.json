     "AB": "PYST1/MKP3 is a negative feedback modulator of fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) signaling in the mammalian isthmic organizer of the brain, which affects the development of the midbrain and the hindbrain. The Dusp6 (Mkp3) gene is also highly expressed in the mouse embryonic forebrain. However, its role in forebrain development and function remains largely unknown. In this study, association analyses were preformed in silico between the variation I62M (rs13480726) of the Dusp6 (Mkp3) gene and the mouse forebrain weight/structure in 385 mice of 20 strains. It was found that I62M (allele A) was associated with reduced mouse forebrain structure in both sexes and lower brain weight in males.",
