     "AB": "The laminar and rostro-caudal distribution of 125I-neurotensin binding sites is described in human entorhinal cortex using quantitative autoradiography. Specific binding was most prominent over the cell clusters of layer II of the entorhinal cortex throughout its rostro-caudal extent. Dense binding was also observed in the adjacent presubiculum and cortical amygdaloid transition area, whereas minimal binding was detected in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. 125I-Neurotensin may serve as a selective probe for neurotensin receptor alterations and layer II-specific cytoarchitectural disturbances in the entorhinal cortex in neuropsychiatric diseases associated with abnormalities of the mesial temporal lobe.",
