     "AB": "The development of the host/graft interface of cerebellar and cerebral transplants was studied 1-60 days after operation. Grafts from fetal Wistar rats were transplanted to a cavity over the superior colliculus of adult rats by removing parts of the overlying cortex and hippocampus according to the Bjorklund/Stenevi technique. In sham-operated control rats, in which a cavity was made in the brain but no graft was implanted, the parenchyma bordering the entire cavity developed a complete glial-meningeal scar within 2 weeks after operation consisting of multilayered glial processes, a basal lamina, and fibroblasts (meningeal cells). A similar interface also developed between graft and host in the most superficial parts of the transplantation cavity. In the basal parts of the transplantation cavity, the host/graft interface consisted either of an incomplete sheet of astrocyte processes aligned in parallel to each other but without a covering basal lamina or of completely fused neuropil without any morphological signs of separation between host and transplant. It is concluded that these three zones of host/graft interface are established by differential interaction between the growing transplant and the host cicatrix. At the basal host/graft parenchymatous interface the fetal transplant interferes with the normal adult cicatrization process of the host, possibly by either releasing inhibitory factors or by preventing contact between the astroglia of the host and fibroblasts (meningeal cells). In white matter regions of the transplantation cavity, voluminous cysts developed, both in sham-operated controls and in graft recipients, which were invaded by transplanted neurons.",
