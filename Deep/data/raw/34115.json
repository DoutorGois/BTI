     "AB": "A modification of the tyrosine hydroxylase assay is described in which ascorbate, rather than 2-mercaptoethanol or dihydropteridine reductase with NADPH, is used as the reductant. Enzyme activity is 3-4 times higher with ascorbate than with the other reducing agents. Low blanks are obtained with the ascorbate system provided that catalase is also included. The tissue distribution and kinetic activation of the enzyme have been studied with the ascorbate assay. The results obtained are consistent with the biological and regulatory properties of the enzyme which have been determined with the other reducing systems.",
