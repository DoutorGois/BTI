     "AB": "In vivo models of cerebral ischemia do not fully control for the interacting effects of many variables (e.g., anesthesia, temperature, cerebrovascular changes) and often do not clearly define the region affected. Numerous in vivo studies have indicated that hyperglycemia augments ischemic brain damage; this effect is often attributed to lactic acidosis. To separate the effects on neuronal tissue of ischemia from those due to actions on the cerebrovascular system, we used an in vitro blood-free system as an ischemic model. In our study we evaluated the effects of various combinations of oxygen and glucose levels on evoked synaptic activity in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slice preparation. A 50% inhibitory dose for both oxygen and glucose on neuronal synaptic function was determined. It is our intention to use this model for preliminary screening of antihypoxic/anti-ischemic drugs.",
