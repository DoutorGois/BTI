     "AB": "We have previously shown that the density of dendritic spines on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells is dependent on circulating estradiol and progesterone and fluctuates naturally during the 5 day estrous cycle in the adult rat. To date, however, no detailed characterization of the roles that these hormones play in regulation of spine density has been made. In order to determine the time courses and extent of the effects of estradiol and progesterone on dendritic spine density, we have analyzed the density of dendritic spines on the lateral branches of the apical dendritic tree of Golgi-impregnated CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells in several experiments. In summary, our findings included the following: (1) Following ovariectomy, circulating estradiol is undetectable within 24 hours; however, spine density decreases gradually over a 6 day period. (2) Spine density does not decrease any further up to 40 days following ovariectomy. (3) Treatment with estradiol alone can reverse the ovariectomy-induced decrease in spine density. (4) Spine density begins to increase within 24 hours following estradiol benzoate injection in an ovariectomized animal, peaks at 2 and 3 days, then gradually decreases over the next 7 day period. (5) Although free estradiol is metabolized more rapidly than estradiol benzoate, there is no difference in the rate of decrease in spine density following injection of either form. (6) Progesterone has a biphasic effect on spine density in that progesterone treatment following estradiol initially increases spine density for a period of 2 to 6 hours but then results in a much sharper decrease than is observed following estradiol alone. By 18 hours following progesterone treatment, spine density is decreased nearly to 6 day ovariectomy values. (7) Treatment of intact rats with the progesterone receptor antagonist, RU 486, during the proestrus phase of the estrous cycle inhibits the proestrus to estrus drop in spine density. These findings account for both the gradual increase and rapid decrease in spine density which we have previously observed during the estrous cycle and indicate that progesterone in particular may be an important factor in the regulation of rapid morphologic changes which occur naturally in the adult brain.",
