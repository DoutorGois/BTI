     "AB": "Inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are often followed by cognitive deficits associated with the neuronal injury, synaptic loss and altered neurogenesis within the hippocampus. Changes depend on the genetic and epigenetic factors that ensure the cellular and environmental homeostasis and regulate the interactions of immunocompetent, glial and neural cells. Owing to high impact of stress proteins on these processes, in this study we compared the protein content of interleukin-6, transforming growth factor-beta1, metallothioneins I/II (MTs) and glycoprotein 96 (gp96) in the hippocampus of DA and AO rats that differ in the susceptibility to the induction of EAE, and tested the relationship of MTs and gp96 to granule neurons, glial cells and neural progenitors in different subfields of dentate gyrus. Rats were immunized with bovine brain homogenate emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant or only with CFA. The data showed that acute attack of EAE in DA rats was followed by accumulation of IL-6, TGF-beta1 and MTs proteins, by increased expression of MTs in molecular and granular cell layer, by reduced expression of gp96/granular cell, by apoptosis and by microgliosis with appearance of Iba-1+ cells, co-expressing MT I/II and gp96. Furthermore, in subgranular zone (SGZ) of DA rats an augmented number of GFAP+ precursors, but decreased number of doublecortin (DCX)+ neuroblasts and immature NeuN+ neurons were found, implying that in DA rats the neurogenesis was delayed or reduced. Besides, in SGZ of both strains several DCX+ and NeuN+ cells co-expressing gp96 and MT I/II were found.",
