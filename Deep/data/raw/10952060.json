     "AB": "Increased numbers of corpora amylacea have been observed in the resected mesial temporal lobe of many patients with complex partial seizures (CPS) and Ammon's horn sclerosis (AHS). Several heat shock proteins (HSPs) are induced by seizures and have been suggested as an etiologic factor in the formation corpora amylacea. We quantified corpora amylacea and HSP27-immunoreactive astrocytes in temporal lobe specimens from patients with CPS (28 AHS; 10 non-AHS) and in 5 autopsy controls. Corpora amylacea were increased in each sector of Ammon's horn in the AHS group, significantly so in CA1 and CA3 (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0097, respectively), compared with the non-AHS group, although there was considerable variability among the specimens. We found HSP27 to be significantly but nonspecifically increased in the resected temporal lobe specimens from all patients with CPS, regardless of the underlying pathology. HSP27 was not, however, expressed within the corpora amylacea, and did not correlate with the number of corpora amylacea in any of the 9 mesial and lateral temporal lobe areas examined.",
