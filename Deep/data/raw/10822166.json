     "AB": "It is well-established that levels of corticosterone sufficient to occupy Type II glucocorticoid receptors produce a decrement in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in rats. In the present series of experiments we investigate the interaction of corticosterone and the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) on LTP in the rat dentate gyrus. In confirmation of previous studies, we found that corticosterone (2 mg/kg) had decremental effects on LTP. However, simultaneous injection of corticosterone and DHEAS (30 mg/kg) elicited excitatory post-synaptic potentials and population spikes that were not significantly different from those observed in control animals. The results are discussed in terms of the interaction of the two hormones, the agonist effects of DHEAS on sigma receptors, and their relation with the antidepressant effects of DHEA.",
