     "AB": "In addition to the trisynaptic perforant pathway from entorhinal cortex to CA1, there are multiple direct parallel pathways between several cortical regions and CA1. These may be supposed to function cooperatively, in conjunction with the perforant pathway; but neither the functional nor anatomical organization of the extended network is well understood. In this report, we further investigate the connections between anterior inferotemporal cortex (area TE) and CA1. Injections of tracer substances demonstrate that part of the dorsal subdivision of TE sends projections to CA1, but does not receive reciprocating projections back. This contrasts with the bi-directional connections between the more ventral subdivision, TEav, and CA1, as reported by previous studies (and corroborated by tracer injections in this report). The corticohippocampal projections from dorsal TE are likely to be unimodal visual. They partially converge in the posterior portion of CA1 with connections from posterior TE and from the inferior parietal lobule, perhaps constituting a network related to visual or visuospatial processes.",
