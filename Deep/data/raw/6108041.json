     "AB": "The hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic distribution of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) was investigated in fed adult sand rats (Psammomys obesus) of both sexes using the immunofluorescence technique. Blood glucose and insulin concentrations were determined in these animals prior to decapitation. In a blind study, the amount of immunofluorescence of certain CNS areas and the glucose: Insulin ratio were compared and found to be connected: High amounts of SLI were detected in the dorsal hippocampus, in some hypothalamic nuclei and the median eminence of rats displaying low glucose levels. Sand rats with high blood glucose values did not show SLI in the hippocampal formation and the immunofluorescence of the circumventricular (hypothalamic) regions and the Eminentia mediana was drastically reduced. A possible correlation of SLI with insulin concentrations in the blood could not be revealed. The data obtained are discussed as a possible expression of a CNS influence on glucoregulation in this species.",
