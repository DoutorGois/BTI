     "AB": "The role of endogenous glucocorticoids in facilitating the postnatal innervation of septohippocampal cholinergic projections was examined. Septohippocampal cholinergic innervation was determined using two methods. One method involved measuring the optical density of acetylcholinesterase, a marker of cholinergic fibres in the hippocampus. In the other method, acetylcholinesterase-positive fibre counts were made in the hippocampus. Both methods revealed that 14-day-old rats adrenalectomized at 10 days of age have significantly lower densities of acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampal dentate gyrus molecular layer and in the regio inferior when compared to sham-operated control rats. This reduction in hippocampal acetylcholinesterase did not occur when 10-day-old adrenalectomized rats were either injected daily with exogenous corticosterone (0.3 mg/100 g body weight) or when adrenalectomy was conducted at later postnatal ages. In addition, unlike the developing hippocampus, the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, which is also highly innervated by cholinergic fibres, showed no significant changes in acetylcholinesterase density after adrenalectomy. These observations suggest that glucocorticoids play an important role in supporting the development of cholinergic projections to the hippocampus. Cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus appears especially sensitive to the action of glucocorticoids occurring before the conclusion of the second postnatal week. Furthermore, this glucocorticoid influence is directed rather specifically to the hippocampus in comparison to the basolateral amygdala.",
