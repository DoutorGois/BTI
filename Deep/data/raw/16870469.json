     "AB": "High mobility group protein A1a (HMGA1a) is expressed at high levels in embryonic cells and has been implicated in their transcriptional regulation. However, it has been reported that high levels of HMGA1a expression are normally detected in the photoreceptor of adult (terminally differentiated cells) murine retina. We showed that biochemical purification of the recombinant HMGA1a binding activity in nuclear fractions from murine retina, but not from hippocampus, resulted in STAT3 interacting protein 1 (StIP1) that formed a novel complex with HMGA1a, STAT3 and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2). While StIP1 expressions in brain, liver, lung, heart, skeletal muscle, spleen and thymus have previously been demonstrated, this is the first report that StIP1 was expressed in nuclear fractions from murine retina, and that in murine retina there are several novel complexes of transcriptional regulators consisting of HMGA1a, StIP1, STAT3 and HIPK2.",
