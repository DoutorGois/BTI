Senile dementia rats' cognitive capabilities and memory could be improved by reduction of beta-amyloid protein, attenuation of excessive phosphorylation of tau protein, regulation of center neurotransmitter dysmetabolism, oxidation of anti-free radicals, reduction of neuron apoptosis in the cortex and the hippocampus, inhibition of glial cells' differentiation, adjustment of G protein signaling transduction, and improvement of the mitochondrial dysfunction, thus providing experimental evidence for treating AD by acupuncture.",
