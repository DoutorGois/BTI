     "AB": "A model is a simplified preparation that reproduces only the most critical features of a disease. To be considered as a validated animal model, such an experimental preparation must fulfill three criteria: isomorphism or similarities of the symptoms; predictivity or identical pharmacological reactivity; homology or etiological similarity. In epilepsy, the use of animal models helps our understanding of physiological and pathological networks involved in the genesis, maintenance, and propagation of seizures. The animal models of epilepsy are also useful in designing and testing new surgical therapeutical strategies, in particular using deconnection or neuromodulation in drug-resistant focal epilepsies. Here we describe three animal models of focal epilepsy, adapted to addressing experimental surgery issues. Kindling consists in the regular liminar stimulation of a given brain structure in the rodent to develop a focal discharge that is secondarily generalized. The local application of epileptogenic agents such as cobalt, iron, or penicillin leads to focal discharges that do not generalize in the rodent or the primate. It is a model of focal neocortical epilepsy without secondary generalization. The focal application of kainate, an excitotoxic glutamate agonist, in the dorsal hippocampus of the adult mouse results, after a latent period, in spontaneous and recurrent focal discharges, behavioral interictal troubles, drug resistance, and histological anomalies reminiscent of hippocampal sclerosis. This constitutes a model of mesial-temporal epilepsy. Better knowledge, in these models, of the neural networks generating, propagating, and/or controlling the seizures should make it possible to design innovative surgical approaches for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsies.",
