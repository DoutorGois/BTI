     "AB": "Cognitive and functional decline with age is correlated with deregulation of intracellular calcium, which can lead to neuronal death in the brain. Previous studies have found protective effects of various calcium channel blockers in pathological conditions. However, little has been done to explore possible protective effects of blockers for T-type calcium channels, which forms a family of FDA approved anti-epileptic drugs. In this study, we found that neurons showed an increase in viability after treatment with either L-type or T-type calcium channel antagonists. The family of low-voltage activated, or T-type calcium channels, comprise of three members (Cav3.1, Cav3.2, and Cav3.3) based on their respective main pore-forming alpha subunits: alpha1G, alpha1H, and alpha1I. Among these three subunits, alpha1H is highly expressed in hippocampus and certain cortical regions. However, T-type calcium channel blockers can protect neurons derived from alpha1H-/- mice, suggesting that neuroprotection demonstrated by these drugs is not through the alpha1H subunit. In addition, blockers for T-type calcium channels were not able to confer any protection to neurons in long-term cultures, while blockers of L-type calcium channels could protect neurons. These data indicate a new function of blockers for T-type calcium channels, and also suggest different mechanisms to regulate neuronal survival by calcium signaling pathways. Thus, our findings have important implications in the development of new treatment for age-related neurodegenerative disorders.",
