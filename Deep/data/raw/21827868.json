     "AB": "The synaptic vesicle-associated synapsin proteins may participate in synaptic transmission, but their exact functional role(s) here remain(s) uncertain. We here briefly describe the important characteristics of the synapsin proteins, and review recent studies on transgenic mice devoid of the gene products encoded by the synapsin I and II genes, where both neurochemical, cell biological and electrophysiological methods have been employed. We present evidence for synapsin effects on both neurotransmitter synthesis and homeostasis, as well as on synaptic vesicle development and functions. Moreover, we describe physiological analyses of excitatory glutamatergic hippocampal synapses where a novel synapsin-dependent delayed response enhancement (DRE) phase occurs, and demonstrate the postnatal developmental patterns of both frequency facilitations and DRE responses. Finally, we report synapsin I and II effects in distinct excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus, and indicate that synapsin-dependent modulations of synaptic function may use distinct presynaptic response patterns in order to induce different classes of presynaptic plasticity.",
