     "AB": "Doublecortin (DCX) is a microtubule-associated protein necessary for neuronal migration. In spite of its ubiquitous distribution in dendrites, its possible role in dendrite development has not yet been documented. The present study examined the effects of different expression levels of DCX on the arborization of dendrites in cultured hippocampal neurons. Reduced expression of DCX following RNAi transfection resulted in reduced branch points, total length and complexity of the dendrites. Overexpression of DCX resulted in an increase in branch points and complexity of the dendrites. In contrast to control green fluorescent protein cells, DCX-overexpressing cells maintained highly branched and complex dendritic trees when subjected to reduced neuronal activity by blockade of immature GABA(A) receptors. These results suggest that DCX supports developing dendrites, in addition to its role in neuronal migration.",
