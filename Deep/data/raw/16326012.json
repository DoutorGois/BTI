     "AB": "The mechanisms responsible for the stabilization and persistence of synaptic plasticity remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the time course of the dependence of late-phase long term potentiation of field excitatory post-synaptic potential on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and its downstream effectors mTOR and AKT. In agreement with our previous results obtained on an early-phase long-term potentiation paradigm we observed that application of a nanomolar concentration of wortmannin (100 nM) 1 h after late-phase long term potentiation induction reversed potentiation completely. However, application of wortmannin 4 h after late-phase long term potentiation induction resulted in a more limited reduction of field excitatory post-synaptic potential suggesting that the dependence of late-phase long term potentiation expression on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase decreases over time. Application of a nanomolar concentration of rapamycin (200 nM) during the tetanization paradigm prevented the induction of late-phase long term potentiation consistent with our earlier results. Application of rapamycin 1 h after late-phase long term potentiation induction resulted in a less pronounced though significant decline of field excitatory post-synaptic potential. Immunohistological analysis demonstrated that the concentration of rapamycin used was effective in inhibiting the phosphorylation of p70S6K at Thr389, the main determinant of its pro-translational activity, and that Thr389 phosphorylation recovered after washout. Lastly, a transient application of Akt inhibitor I (10 microM) one hour after late-phase long term potentiation induction also induced a partial although significant reduction of potentiated field excitatory post-synaptic potential that stabilized at a level of approximately 114% of baseline three hours after application, suggesting that AKT also contributes to the stabilization of late-phase long term potentiation expression. These results confirm and extend previous observations that the expression of long term potentiation in the CA1 of rat hippocampus involves several elements of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway.",
