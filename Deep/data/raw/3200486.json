     "AB": "Threshold of stimulation frequency in the perforant path to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in dentate gyrus was determined in hippocampal slices obtained from two different lines of rats inbred for 30 generations according to their performance in an avoidance escape test in a shuttle box. High-performance (HP) rats were defined as those giving at least 70% conditioned responses (CRs) and low-performance (LP) rats as those giving less than 15% CRs. LTP was defined as a 30% or more increase in the amplitude of the evoked population spike (PS), lasting at least 20 min. Stimulation frequency threshold was determined by stimulating with a train of pulses of 0.5 ms duration during 1 s. The same slice was stimulated with trains of increasing frequency from 5 to 400 Hz, each train separated by an interval of at least 20 min. HP rats showed a lower threshold (13 +/- 4 Hz) than LP rats (92 +/- 42 Hz) for the induction of LTP; there were no differences in the magnitude of LTP. The greater learning ability of HP rats may be related to the plasticity of hippocampal synaptic transmission.",
