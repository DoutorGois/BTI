     "AB": "Genes and proteins of the Fos family are used as markers of neuronal activity and can be modulated by stress. This study investigated whether social defeat (SD) or exposure to an olfactory cue associated with the SD experience activated Fos and FosB/DeltaFosB (DeltaFosB) expression in brain regions implicated in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder. Mice exposed to acute SD showed more Fos positive cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), CA1 of the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) 1h after SD, and had greater expression of the more persistent FosB/DeltaFosB protein in the BLA 24 h after SD compared to controls. Mice exposed to an olfactory cue 24 h or 7 days after SD had higher levels of Fos expression in all three regions 1h after exposure to the cue, and displayed increased avoidance behavior compared to controls. While the avoidance response dissipated with time (less at 7 day vs 24 h after social defeat), Fos expression in the mPFC and CA1 in response to an olfactory cue was greater at 7 days relative to 24 h after social defeat. The results suggest additional processing of the cue-stress association and may provide further support for a role of the mPFC in fear inhibition. These findings may have implications for brain regions and circuitry involved in the avoidance of cues associated with a stressful event that may lead to context-dependent adaptive or maladaptive behavior.",
