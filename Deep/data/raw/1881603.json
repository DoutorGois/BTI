     "AB": "The expression of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) mRNA in various regions of the adult rat central nervous system (CNS), as well as in selected peripheral tissues was examined using Northern blot analysis. The highest expression was also found in the cerebral spinal cord, with the levels of TGF alpha mRNA being 5- to 6-fold higher in this tissue than in any other examined. Significant expression was also found in the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, corpus striatum, hippocampus, ventral mesencephalon and caudal brainstem. Of the peripheral tissues examined, only adrenal gland expressed TGF alpha mRNA at similar levels. Lower, but detectable, expression was found in prefrontal cortex, cerebral cortex and cerebellum. The latter levels were similar to those observed in lung, liver, kidney and, variable, salivary gland. These data demonstrate a widespread but differential distribution of TGF alpha mRNA throughout the rat CNS, and indicate relatively high levels of expression of this growth factor in central versus peripheral tissues.",
