     "AB": "At least two main cognitive strategies can be used to solve a complex navigation task: the allocentric or map-based strategy and the sequential egocentric or route-based strategy. The sequential egocentric strategy differs from a succession of independent simple egocentric responses as it requires a sequential ordering of events, possibly sharing functional similarity with episodic memory in this regard. To question the possible simultaneous encoding of sequential egocentric and allocentric strategies, we developed a paradigm in which these two strategies are spontaneously used or imposed. Our results evidenced that sequential egocentric strategy can be spontaneously acquired at the onset of the training as well as allocentric strategy. Allocentric and sequential egocentric strategies could be used together within a trial, and bidirectional shifts (between trials) were spontaneously performed during the training period by 30% of the participants. Regardless of the strategy used spontaneously during the training, all participants could execute immediate shifts to the opposite non previously used strategy when this strategy was imposed. Altogether, our findings suggest that subjects acquire different types of spatial knowledge in parallel, namely knowledge permitting allocentric navigation as well as knowledge permitting sequential egocentric navigation.",
