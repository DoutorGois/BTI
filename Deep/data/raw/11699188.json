     "AB": "Ozone is one of the main atmospheric pollutants. Its inhalation causes an increase in free radicals, when these free radicals are not compensated by antioxidants, it leads to an oxidative stress state. This oxidative stress state has been implicated in neurodegenerative processes. To determine the effects of oxidative stress caused by exposure to ozone on memory and motor activity, we used 120 male Wistar rats exposed to one of the following ozone doses, (0.0, 0.1, 0.4, 0.7, 1.1 and 1.5 ppm), for four hours. After ozone exposure, short and long term memory of a one trial passive avoidance test were measured, and motor activity was registered for five minutes, in 10 rats of each group. In 16 rats exposed to 0.0, 0.4, 0.7 or 1.1 ppm lipid peroxidation levels from frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum, were measured. Results show that ozone, causes memory impairment from doses of 0.7 ppm, decrease in motor activity from doses of 1.1 ppm, and increase in lipid peroxidation levels from doses of 0.4 ppm. that increase with the dose.",
