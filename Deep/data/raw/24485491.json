     "AB": "Chronic stress as well as chronic treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) primes the neuroinflammatory response to a subsequent pro-inflammatory challenge. However, it remains unclear whether chronic GCs sensitize the response of key CNS immune substrates (i.e. microglia) to pro-inflammatory stimuli. In the present set of studies, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent sham surgery or were adrenalectomized and then treated with varying concentrations of corticosterone (CORT; 0, 25, 50, and 75 mug/ml) administered in their drinking water. After 10 days of CORT exposure, whole hippocampus was collected and expression of glial activation markers measured or hippocampal microglia were isolated and challenged with LPS to probe for CORT-induced sensitization of pro-inflammatory responses. Chronic CORT exposure increased the gene expression of NLRP3, Iba-1, MHCII, and NF-kappaBIalpha in a concentration dependent manner. Chronic CORT (75 mug/ml) exposure potentiated the microglial proinflammatory response (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and NLRP3) to LPS compared to the microglial response of sham surgery animals treated with vehicle. The present set of results demonstrate that chronic exposure to GCs primes microglia to pro-inflammatory stimuli and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that a permissive function of GCs is that of an endogenous danger signal or alarmin.",
