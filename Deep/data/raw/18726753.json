     "AB": "An ever-increasing number of reports show the involvement of free radicals in the functional and structural changes occurring in the brain as a part of the normal aging process. This study aimed to assess the potential efficacy of glutathione monoester (GME) when administered intraperitoneally (12 mg/kg body weight) for 20 days on memory and the antioxidant defense system and lipid peroxidation in discrete brain regions such as cortex, striatum, and hippocampus of young and aged rats. Age-associated decline in memory and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione, vitamin E, and vitamin C, and elevated levels of lipid peroxidation and oxidized glutathione, were observed in all the brain regions studied (p < .001). GME administration was effective in restoring the antioxidant status and in decreasing lipid peroxidation level in aged rat brain regions.",
