     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To research on the protective effect of 3'-methoxy-puerarin (3'-mo-pue) on rat brain suffering from ischemia and to offer the experimental basis for widening the applied areas of Radix Puerariae. METHOD: All rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, control group, Pue group and 3'-mo-pue group. The influence of different dosage on relevant indexes were measured through cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model rat covered by Fecl3, and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model rat after 2VO. RESULT: The result showed that 3'-mo-Pue could reduce the scores of neurological deficit, cerebral infarcted zone to varying degrees and the water content of brain tissue in MCAO model. It could obviously increase the activity of CAT and GPx in the hippocampus and also increase the activity of CAT and GPx in the cortex in the ischemia field. Moreover, 3'-mo-Pue could decrease the content of LPO, LD in the brain tissue of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model rat. CONCLUSION: 3'-mo-Pue has favorable protective effect on brain suffering from ischemia. The mechanism is possibly related to its effect of anti-oxidation.",
