     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To examine whether ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) inhibits the high-voltage-activated calcium currents (ICa,HVA) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in hippocampal neurons in rat brain slices exposed to beta-amyloid peptide 25-35 (Abeta25-35). METHODS: An experimental Alzheimer disease (AD) model was prepared by exposure of rat brain slices to Abeta25-35 (10 micromol/L). After treatment with Rg1 (20 micromol/L), the ICa,HVA elicited in hippocampal neurons in these rat brain slices upon depolarization from-40 to 40 mV for 200 ms was recorded by a whole-cell patch clamp to analyze the changes in the peak current density, I-V curve, activation-V curve, and inactivation-V curve. RESULTS: Exposure of rat brain slices to Abeta led to a significant increase in ICa,HVA, enhancement of the voltage sensitivity of channel activation, and reduction of the voltage sensitivity of channel inactivation in neurons in the hippocampus of rat brain slices. Rg1 treatment significantly inhibited these changes. These effects of Rg1 could be effectively inhibited by the MAPK inhibitor PD98059. CONCLUSION: Rg1 can inhibit Ica,HVA via MAPK in hippocampal neurons in Abeta-exposed rat brain slices.",
