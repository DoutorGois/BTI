     "AB": "The effects of intrastriatal and intrahippocampal injections of the excitotoxic amino acid, quinolinic acid (QUIN), were examined in the rat using immunohistochemical and neurochemical techniques. Serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid measurements at 90 min, 6 h, 4 and 11 days following QUIN administration revealed highly elevated levels of the metabolite in the injected nuclei, with peak increases occurring after 4 days. Serotonin levels remained largely unchanged over the same time period. Direct visualization of hippocampal serotonergic fibers by immunohistochemistry demonstrated morphological changes (varicosities, swellings) in otherwise undamaged serotonin-positive afferents 4 days following a local QUIN injection. Hippocampal serotonin turnover was assessed at 4 days after an intrahippocampal QUIN-application: following inhibition of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, the accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan was twice as rapid in QUIN-lesioned hippocampi as in controls. Dose-response relationships, examination of brain regions distant from the two injection sites and the temporal sequence of the changes described here suggest a close association between QUIN-induced neuronal degeneration and alterations in the serotonergic system.",
