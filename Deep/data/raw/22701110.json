     "AB": "Sex steroids play essential roles in the modulation of synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection in the hippocampus. Accumulating evidence shows that hippocampal neurons synthesize both estrogen and androgen. Recently, we also revealed the hippocampal synthesis of corticosteroids. The accurate concentrations of these hippocampus-synthesized steroids are determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass-spectrometry in combination with novel derivatization. The hippocampal levels of 17beta-estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and corticosterone (CORT), are 5-15 nM, and these levels are sufficient to modulate synaptic plasticity. Hippocampal E2 modulates memory-related synaptic plasticity not only slowly/genomically but also rapidly/non-genomically. Slow actions of E2 occur via classical nuclear receptors (ERalpha or ERbeta), while rapid E2 actions occur via synapse-localized or extranuclear ERalpha or ERbeta. Nanomolar concentrations of E2 change rapidly the density and morphology of spines in hippocampal neurons. ERalpha, but not ERbeta, drives this enhancement/suppression of spinogenesis in adult animals. Nanomolar concentrations of androgens (T and DHT) and CORT also increase the spine density. Kinase networks are involved downstream of ERalpha and androgen receptor. Newly developed Spiso-3D mathematical analysis is useful to distinguish these complex effects by sex steroids and kinases. Significant advance has been achieved in investigations of rapid modulation by E2 of the long-term depression or the long-term potentiation.",
