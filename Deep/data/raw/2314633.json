     "AB": "Physiologically viable slices of rat hippocampus were incubated in radiolabeled valine, then cut into 20 microns serial sections to evaluate the profile of protein synthesis through the depth of the slice. Maximum radiolabel incorporation was observed near the center of the slice, while at the upper (gas interface) and lower (liquid interface) surfaces radiolabel incorporation per section was reduced by about 30% and 90%, respectively. The results suggest that in properly slices damage due to slicing may be less important to cell viability than are limits on oxygen diffusion into the tissue.",
