     "AB": "Using H2 15O PET, we examined the neuroanatomy associated with a simple form of episodic memory in patients with right or left medial temporal lobe epilepsy and normal healthy controls. When line drawings of common objects were memorized and tested after a 30 min delay, no behavioral difference was found between the patient groups and the controls. However, the patients with epilepsy showed greater cortical activations than the control group on the side ipsilateral to the epileptic focus. rCBF in the anterior thalamic region was enhanced in patients relative to the control group. The results showed that long-term dysfunction of the medial temporal lobe might reinforce alternative memory pathways and recruit a distributed cortical network ipsilateral to their epilepsy focus.",
