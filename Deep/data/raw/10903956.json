     "AB": "1. The systemic administration of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (2.5 - 7.5 mg kg(-1)) reduced hippocampal extracellular acetylcholine concentration and impaired working memory in rats. 2. Both effects were antagonized not only by the CB(1) cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR141716A (0.5 mg kg(-1), i.p.) but also unexpectedly by the D(2) dopamine receptor antagonist S(-)-sulpiride (5, 10 and 25 mg kg(-1), i.p.). Conversely, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol-induced memory impairment and inhibition of hippocampal extracellular acetylcholine concentration were potentiated by the subcutaneous administration of the D(2) dopamine receptor agonist (-)-quinpirole (25 and 500 microg kg(-1)). The inhibition of hippocampal extracellular acetylcholine concentration and working memory produced by the combination of (-)-quinpirole and Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol was suppressed by either SR141716A or S(-)-sulpiride. 3. Our findings suggest that impairment of working memory and inhibition of hippocampal extracellular acetylcholine concentration are mediated by the concomitant activation of D(2) dopamine and CB(1) cannabinoid receptors, and that D(2) dopamine receptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of the cognitive deficits induced by marijuana.",
