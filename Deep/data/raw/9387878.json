     "AB": "Kainate-induced seizure activity causes persistent changes in the hippocampus that include synaptic reorganization and functional changes in the mossy fibers. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry, the expression of PKC alpha, PKC beta, PKC gamma, PKC delta and PKC epsilon mRNAs was investigated in the hippocampus of adult rats following seizures induced by a s.c. injection of kainic acid. In CA1 and CA3, we found a significant decrease in PKC gamma mRNA 1 day after kainic acid which persisted for a 2nd day in CA1. None of the other PKC isoform mRNAs were altered in CA1 or CA3. In granule cells, a significant up-regulation specific to PKC epsilon mRNA was observed. One week after kainic acid administration, a marked increase in PKC epsilon immunoreactivity was found that persisted 2 months after kainic acid administration. PKC epsilon immunoreactivity was found associated with mossy fibers projecting to the hilus of the dentate gyrus and to the stratum lucidum of the CA3 field and presumably with the newly sprouted mossy fibers projecting to the supragranular layer. These data provide the first evidence for a long-lasting increase of the PKC epsilon in the axons of granule cells caused by kainate-induced seizures and suggest that PKC epsilon may be involved in the functional and/or structural modifications of granule cells that occur after limbic seizures.",
