     "AB": "Extracellular ATP evoked two excitatory responses in hippocampal neuroblastoma cells (HN2). The first, an opening of a receptor-operated non-selective cation channel and the second was a leftward shift in Na+ channel activation. Both ATP (5-1000 microM) and 2',3'-(4-benzoyl)-benzoyl-ATP (Bb-ATP, 50 microM) activated a non-selective cation current reversing near 0 mV and shifted the Na+ activation and inactivation curves to the left. Based on a comparison of a series of agonists and antagonists, the inward current appeared to be partially mediated by activation of a P2X7 receptor, although hybrid channels cannot be ruled out. The shift in Na+ channel gating could be separated from the opening of the cation channel, as application of the P2Y antagonist Reactive Blue-2 and GTP shifted the Na+ current activation to the left but failed to elicit the inward cation current. Both responses to ATP and Bb-ATP were insensitive to block by the P2X antagonist suramin (300 microM) but were prevented by incubation in oxidized ATP (200 microM); a putative P2X7 receptor antagonist. Prior screening of the surface negative charge of the membrane with a high concentration of divalent cations prevented both responses. We suggest that ATP4- activates a P2X receptor and becomes trapped on a site, on or near the Na+ channel. Activation of the P2X receptor leads to the opening of a non-specific cation channel, while the binding of ATP4- leads to a modified charge sensed by the Na+ channel, similar to what occurs in the presence of charged amphiphiles as well as a number of beta-scorpion toxins.",
