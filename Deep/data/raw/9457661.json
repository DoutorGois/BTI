     "AB": "A study of the effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) has shown enhancing effects on training in adult and aged Swiss mice. An analysis of inbred mice has confirmed this sensitivity to EGb 761, but depending on the strains, with different effects at different ages. The most interesting results are related to improvements in performances observed with aged mice of the DBA/2J strain. The results obtained with inbred strains in the study of the mossy fibers of the hippocampus make it possible to suggest a link between the improvements in training and the histological structure of the hippocampus. This possibility, which can be confirmed by further studies, is presented here.",
