     "AB": "1. Behavioral responses to unilateral and bilateral microinjections of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, NAN190 [1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido) butyl]piperazine hydrobromide] (1 microgram), into the hippocampal CA1 area of male Wistar rats were studied. 2. NAN190 decreased locomotor activity (the number of horizontal and vertical movements). The effect was most pronounced with microinjections of NAN190 into the right hippocampus. 3. Microinjections of NAN190 facilitated learning and memory in shuttle-box testing. 4. Microinjections of NAN190 had an anxiogenic effect in elevated plus-maze experiments and Vogel's conflict test. 5. The different behavioral responses to left and right microinjections of NAN190 in some of the behavioral tests suggest functional asymmetry of 5-HT1A receptors in the CA1 hippocampal area.",
