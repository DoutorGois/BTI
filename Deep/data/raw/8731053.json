     "AB": "The literature on the role of the hippocampus in object-recognition contains a paradox: Transient forebrain ischemia (ISC) produces hippocampal damage and severe deficits on the delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS) task, yet hippocampal ablation (ABL) produces milder deficits. Experiment 1 confirmed that pretrained rats display severe DNMS deficits following ISC, but not ABL. Ischemia produced loss of CA1 neurons, but no obvious extrahippocampal damage. In Experiments 2 and 3, ISC rats from Experiment 1 received ABL, and ABL rats received ISC; neither treatment affected DNMS performance. In Experiment 4, rats that received ISC followed 1 hr later by ABL displayed only mild deficits. It is hypothesized that ISC-induced DNMS deficits are due to extrahippocampal damage produced by pathogenic processes that involve the hippocampus.",
