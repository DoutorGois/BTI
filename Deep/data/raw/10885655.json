     "AB": "Neuroinflammation in the course of multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis results in demyelination and, recently demonstrated, axonal loss. Invading neuroantigen specific T cells are the crucial cellular elements in these processes. Here we demonstrate that invasion of activated T cells induces a massive microglial attack on myelinated axons in entorhinal-hippocampal slice cultures. Flow cytometry analysis of activation markers revealed that the activation state of invading MBP-specific T cells was significantly lower in comparison to PMA-activated T cells. Moreover, MBP-specific T cells showed a significantly lower secretion of IFN-gamma. Conversely, MBP-specific T cells displayed a significantly higher potential to trigger activation of microglial cells, i.e. upregulation of MHC class II and ICAM-1 expression, and, most importantly, microglial phagocytosis of pre-traced axons. Our data suggest that this was mediated via specific cellular interactions of T cells and microglial cells since IFN-gamma alone was not sufficient to induce axonal damage while such damage was apparent in response to TNF-alpha which is released by activated microglial cells. TNF-alpha secretion by both T cell populations was negligible. Thus, MBP-specific T cells which invade nervous tissue in the course of neuroinflammation are more effective in axon-damaging recruiting microglial cells than activated T cells of other specificities.",
