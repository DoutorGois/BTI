     "AB": "We have studied the effect of chronic treatment with imipramine, citalopram, and electroconvulsive shock (ECS) on serum and brain copper levels in rats. Chronic treatment with citalopram and imipramine (but not ECS) significantly (approx 14%) decreased the serum copper level. Chronic treatment with both drugs did not alter the brain copper level. However, chronic ECS induced a significant increase (by 36%) in the copper level in the hippocampus and also in the cerebellum (by 16%). In contrast to the zinc, where both pharmacologic and ECS treatment increased its hippocampal concentration, these two antidepressant therapy (drugs versus ECS) differ in their effect on brain copper level. These findings suggest that the mechanism by which copper is involved in ECS differs from that of any involvement in the action of the drugs studied.",
