     "AB": "AIM: To examine the effects of a single convulsion and multiple convulsions on cholecystokinin (CCK) mRNA expression in hippocampus of audiogenic seizure-prone rats (P77PMC). METHODS: Ringing (electric bell, 100 dB, 60 s) was used to induce convulsions, hippocampal CCK mRNA expression was exhibited by in situ hybridization. RESULTS: 1) The number of CCK mRNA-positive neurons in principal hippocampus of normal rats was 34 +/- 5, which elevated markedly after a single (155 +/- 7, P < 0.01) or multiple convulsions (95 +/- 8, P < 0.01). 2) CCK mRNA levels in multiple consecutive convulsion rats were lower than that in a single convulsion rats (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The increased number of CCK mRNA-positive neurons in hippocampus may have important functional consequences in convulsion-associated processes.",
