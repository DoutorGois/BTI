     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The relationship between reduced glucose metabolism in positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 ([(18)F]FDG-PET) and hippocampal damage (HD) in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the presence and severity of HD verified by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (QMRI) and histopathological analysis affect the degree of hypometabolism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy underwent [(18)F]FDG-PET and QMRI (hippocampal volumetry and T2 relaxometry) before surgery. Histopathological analysis of the hippocampus included measurements of neuronal loss, proliferation of glial cells, and mossy fiber sprouting. The asymmetry in glucose metabolism described the degree of hypometabolism. RESULTS: Temporal hypometabolism was not related to severity of HD as measured by QMRI or histopathological analysis. The degree of hypometabolism did not differ in patients with mild, moderate, or severe HD. In addition, [(18)F]FDG-PET revealed significant temporal hypometabolism even though hippocampal QMRI findings were normal or showed only mild HD. Thus, glucose consumption was reduced over and above the histopathological changes. CONCLUSIONS: [(18)F]FDG-PET is sensitive for localizing the epileptogenic region in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. However, it is insensitive to reflect the severity of HD.",
