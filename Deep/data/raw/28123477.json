     "AB": "Cerebral ischemia results from cerebrovascular occlusion, which leads to neuronal cell death and eventually causes neurological impairments. Dexmedetomidine is a potent and highly selective alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist with actions such as sedation, anxiolysis, analgesia and anesthetic-sparing effects. We investigated the effect of dexmedetomidine on apoptosis in the hippocampus after transient global ischemia in gerbils. Transient global ischemia was induced by ligation of both common carotid arteries. Dexmedetomidine was administrated intraperitoneally at three respective doses (0.1, 1 and 10 microg/kg) once per day for 14 consecutive days beginning a day after surgery. Short-term memory was assessed by use of a step-down avoidance task. Apoptosis was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling assay, immunohistochemistry for caspase-3, and western blot analysis of Bcl-2-associated X protein, B-cell lymphoma 2, Bid, cytochrome c, apoptotic protease activating factor-1 and caspase-9 in the hippocampus. Induction of global ischemia deteriorated short-term memory by enhancing the expression of apoptosis-related molecules in the hippocampus. Treatment with dexmedetomidine suppressed the expression of apoptosis-related molecules under ischemic conditions, resulting in short-term memory improvement. Under normal conditions, dexmedetomidine exerted no significant effect on apoptosis in the hippocampus. The present results suggest that the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine may be a useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of ischemic brain diseases.",
