Pathological disturbance of this interaction produces the basic varieties of neuroses: hysteria, neurasthenia, psychasthenia and obsessive states. The significance is discussed of individual features of sets and hierarchy of basal human needs: material-biological, social, ideal (with their variants: retention and development, \"for oneself\" and \"for others\") needs of overcoming (will) and of \"fitness\" - for the formation of individuality.",
