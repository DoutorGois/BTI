     "AB": "Parathelypteriside (PG), a stilbenoid compound, was extracted from Parathelypteris glanduligera (kze.) ching that exhibits antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of PG against the d-galactose (d-gal)-induced neurotoxicity in mice. It was found that long-term intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of PG (5 or 10 mg/(kg day)) for two weeks significantly improved the behavioral performance of d-gal-treated mice in both Morris water maze test and step-down avoidance test. Biochemical examination revealed that PG reduced the increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), and attenuated the decreased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase in the hippocampus of d-gal-treated mice. Furthermore, the electrophysiological assay showed that PG significantly rescued the long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment in mice hippocampus, and western blotting analysis indicated that the effects of PG on LTP might be attributed to the activation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Together, these results suggested that the natural product PG represented a potential source of medicine for the treatment of the neurodegenerative diseases.",
