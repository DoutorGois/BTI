     "AB": "Novel transgenic approaches provide an exciting opportunity to assess the impact of the loss of specific genes in the biochemistry and electrophysiology of neurons involved in a learned behavior. Recent studies describing mice harboring mutations in five kinase genes expressed in the hippocampus found that two of these kinases, the alpha-Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent kinase II and the Fyn tyrosine kinase are necessary for the establishment of long-term potentiation. In addition to providing a new tool for the dissection of the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, these mutants will be important in determining how changes in synaptic strength affect not only learning and memory, but also a host of other processes thought to be associated with plasticity.",
