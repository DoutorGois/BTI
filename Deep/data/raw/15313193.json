     "AB": "Based on the data from a cDNA microarray experiment which was carried out to screen the differential expressed genes in the rat hippocampus 10 days after removal of the entorhinal afferents, we confirmed the increase of expression of eight transcripts encoding protein osteonectin, thymosin-beta4, gelsolin, MHC I, MHC II, beta2-microglobulin, and interferon-gamma receptor using Northern blot. In situ hybridization revealed that the up-regulation of all these 8 transcripts localized specifically in the denervated target areas, the hippocampal stratum lacunosum-moleculare, and the dentate outer molecular layer. The results suggest that these molecules may have roles in the plasticity events in the hippocampus after entorhinal deafferentation.",
