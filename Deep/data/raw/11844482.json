     "AB": "Moderately head injured patients often suffer long term neurological sequelae. There is no therapy for brain trauma and current treatments aim only to minimize secondary damage. These secondary effects are often triggered by the inability to re-establish ionic homeostasis after injury, due to large energy demands. Recent reports have demonstrated that neurons are capable of utilizing lactate as an energy source, thus this report examines the usefulness of lactate administration in the attenuation of behavioural deficits following a moderate brain injury. Lactate infusion (i.v.) was started 30 min after lateral fluid percussion injury and continued for 3 h. Cognitive deficits were determined using the Morris water maze. Lactate infused injured animals demonstrated significantly less cognitive deficits than saline infused injured animals. Thus, lactate infusion attenuated the cognitive deficits normally observed in this model, and therefore may provide moderately head injured patients with a treatment to help ameliorate the sequelae.",
