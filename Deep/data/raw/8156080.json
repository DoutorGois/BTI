     "AB": "The density of diffuse, primitive and classic beta/A4 protein deposits was estimated in sulci and gyri in the frontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) in 8 cases of Alzheimer's disease. Total beta/A4 deposit density was similar in the frontal cortex and PHG but the ratio of primitive and classic deposits to the total was greater in the PHG compared with the frontal cortex. Total beta/A4 deposit density was greater in the depths of the sulci, but the proportions of the various beta/A4 subtypes were similar in sulci and gyri. Hence, increased density of primitive and classic deposits in the PHG could reflect enhanced conversion of diffuse to mature deposits whereas increased density of mature beta/A4 subtypes in sulci versus gyri may reflect increased beta/A4 deposition in the sulci.",
