     "AB": "Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in many physiological and pathophysiological processes in the brain. In this study, we examined the mechanistic effects of an NO donor, diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide adduct (DETA/NO) on the voltage-gated calcium currents in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. DETA/NO stimulated the calcium currents and slightly increased the channel sensitivity to depolarizing voltages. The effect of DETA/NO on the calcium current was blocked by either depleting the NO in DETA/NO or by pretreating the neurons with NEM, a thiol-specific alkylating agent, suggesting an involvement of S-nitrosylation in the current response to NO. In addition, activation of the cGMP pathway by 8-Br-cGMP inhibited the calcium current in the neurons. Also, inhibition of guanylyl cyclase by 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo [4,3-a] quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) increased the current response to DETA/NO. Taken together, our results demonstrate that both S-nitrosylation and cGMP pathway are involved in the NO modulation of the hippocampal calcium current.",
