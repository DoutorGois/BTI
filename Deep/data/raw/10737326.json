     "AB": "N-glycans of neuropsin (serine protease in the murine hippocampus) expressed in Trichoplusia ni cells were released from the glycopeptides by digestion with glycoamidase A (from sweet almond), and the reducing ends of the oligosaccharides were reductively aminated with 2-aminopyridine. The derivatized N-glycans were separated and structurally identified by a two dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) mapping technique on two kinds of HPLC columns. Fourteen different major N-glycan structures were identified, of which 6 were high-mannose type (9.1%), and the remaining 8 were paucimannosidic type. The presence of insect specific N-glycan structures containing both alpha1,3- and alpha1,6- di-fucosylated innermost N-acetylglucosamine residue (23.3%), as below, was also confirmed by 600 MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy.",
