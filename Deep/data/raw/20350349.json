     "AB": "Cell transplantation is a promising treatment strategy for many neurological disorders, including stroke, which can target multiple therapeutic mechanisms in a sustained fashion. We investigated the ability of human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived SB623 cells to rescue neural cells via trophic support following an in vitro stroke model. Following oxygen glucose deprivation, cortical neurons or hippocampal slices were cocultured with either MSCs or SB623 cells separated by a semiporous membrane (prohibits cell-cell contact) or with MSC- or SB623 cell-conditioned medium. MSCs, SB623 cells, MSC-conditioned media, and SB623 cell-conditioned media all significantly reduced neural cell damage/death compared to untreated conditions, and the rescue effect of the conditioned media was dose dependent. We identified 11 neurotrophic factors secreted by MSCs and/or SB623 cells. This study emphasizes the importance of trophic support provided by marrow-derived cells, which likely contributes to the efficacy of cell therapy for brain injury.",
