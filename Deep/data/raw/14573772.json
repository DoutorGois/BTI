     "AB": "Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) modulate a variety of cellular responses, including Ca2+ signals and neurotransmitter release, which can influence neuronal processes such as synaptic efficacy and neuroprotection. In addition to receptor activation through the agonist binding site, an allosteric modulation of nAChR has also been described for a novel class of allosteric ligands. Of these, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and Alzheimer drug galantamine represents the prototypical allosteric ligand, based on its potentiation of nAChR-evoked single-channel and whole-cell currents. The aim of this study was to establish whether the allosteric potentiation of nAChR currents is transduced in downstream cellular responses to nAChR activation, namely increases in intracellular Ca2+ and [3H]noradrenaline release. In SH-SY5Y cells, galantamine potentiated nicotine-evoked increases in intracellular Ca2+ and [3H]noradrenaline release with a bell-shaped concentration-response profile; maximum enhancement of nicotine-evoked responses occurred at 1 muM galantamine. This potentiation was blocked by mecamylamine, whereas galantamine had no effect on these measures in the absence of nicotine. Galantamine did not compete for radioligand binding to the agonist binding sites of several nAChR subtypes, consistent with an allosteric mode of action. Unlike galantamine, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors rivastigmine and donepezil did not potentiate nAChR-mediated responses, whereas donepezil was a reasonably potent inhibitor of nicotine- and KCl-evoked increases in Ca2+. nAChR-mediated [3H]noradrenaline release from hippocampal slices was also potentiated by galantamine, with an additional component attributable to acetylcholinesterase inhibition and subsequent increase in acetylcholine. These results indicate that the allosteric regulation of nAChR results in the potentiation of receptor-dependent cellular processes relevant to many of the physiological consequences of nAChR activation.",
