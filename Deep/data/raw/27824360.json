     "AB": "Current understanding and treatment of depression is limited to the monoaminergic theory with little knowledge of the involvement of other cellular processes. Genome-wide association studies, however, implicate several novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms with weak but replicable effects and unclarified mechanisms. We investigated the effect of rs1106634 of the ATPV1B2 gene encoding the vacuolar H+ATPase on lifetime and current depression and the possible mediating role of neuroticism by logistic and linear regression in a white European general sample of 2226 subjects. Association of rs1106634 with performance on frontal (Stockings of Cambridge (SOC)) and hippocampal-dependent (paired associates learning (PAL)) cognitive tasks was investigated in multivariate general linear models in a smaller subsample. The ATP6V1B2 rs1106634 A allele had a significant effect on lifetime but not on current depression. The effect of the A allele on lifetime depression was not mediated by neuroticism. The A allele influenced performance on the PAL but not on the SOC test. We conclude that the effects of variation in the vacuolar ATPase may point to a new molecular mechanism that influences the long-term development of depression. This mechanism may involve dysfunction specifically in hippocampal circuitry and cognitive impairment that characterizes recurrent and chronic depression.",
