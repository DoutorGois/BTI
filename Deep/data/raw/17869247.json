     "AB": "Presynaptic nerve terminals contain scaffolding proteins that orchestrate neurotransmitter release at active zones. Here we describe mover, a yet unknown non-transmembrane protein that is targeted to presynaptic terminals when overexpressed in cultured neurons. Confocal immunomicroscopy revealed that mover colocalizes with presynaptic markers in the calyx of Held. In the hippocampus, mover localizes to mossy fibre terminals, but is absent from inhibitory nerve terminals. By contrast, mover localizes to inhibitory terminals throughout the cerebellar cortex. Our results suggest that mover may act in concert with generally expressed scaffolding proteins in distinct sets of presynaptic terminals.",
