     "AB": "The expression of caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 in hippocampus of rats with diabetes and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were investigated. Diabetes mellitus model was established by intraperitoneal injection of STZ. On the basis of diabetes mellitus model, SAH animal model was established by injecting fresh autologous femoral artery blood into cerebellomedullary cisten. Rats were divided into blank control group, diabetes control group and diabetes + SAH group. TUNEL method was used to detect cell apoptosis of hippocampus. Expression levels of caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 were detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and western blot analysis at mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Apoptotic cells were not detected in blank control group and diabetes group, and number of apoptotic cells was the highest in the diabetic SAH group. Expression levels of caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA and protein were significantly higher in diabetes + SAH group than in blank control group and diabetes group. In conclusion, Hippocampal neuron apoptosis was induced by diabetes + SAH and expression levels of caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 were also increased. Our study provided experimental basis for further studies of the relationship between SAH and cell apoptosis.",
