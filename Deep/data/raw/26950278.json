     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a considerable public health issue. The mechanisms underlying AD onset and progression remain largely unclear. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) is a strong functional AD candidate gene because it encodes part of the statin-binding domain of the enzyme, which serves as the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis in all mammalian cells. Here, we evaluated the potential role of HMGCR (rs3846662) in AD-related pathology by assessing neuroimaging biomarkers. We enrolled in 812 subjects from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. In general, it is possible that HMGCR (rs3846662) could be involved in preventing the atrophy of right entorhinal (P=0.03385) and left hippocampus (P=0.01839) in the follow-up research of two years. What's more, it lowered the drop rate of glucose metabolism in right temporal. We then further validated them in the AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), normal control (NC) sub-groups. All the results in the MCI groups confirmed the association. The results of our study indicated that HMGCR (rs3846662) plays a vital role in AD pathology mainly by influencing brain structure and glucose metabolism during AD progression.",
