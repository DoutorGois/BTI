     "AB": "The tetradecapeptide somatostatin (SRIF) is a hormone release-inhibiting substance that mediates diverse effects in brain and peripheral organs via specific receptors. A cDNA encoding a rat SRIF receptor was identified by use of degenerate oligonucleotide primers and polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA prepared from transcripts expressed in rat brain. The complete cDNA encodes a protein of 391 amino acids with seven potential transmembrane domains. Expression of the cDNA product in transfected COS-7 cell lines provides the same high affinity of binding to [125I-Tyr11]SRIF-14 as that of rat cerebral cortex tissues. However, the binding of [125I-Tyr11]SRIF-14 to cloned rat SRIF receptor is not displaced by MK678, a SRIF analog that partially displaces [125I-Tyr11]SRIF-14 binding sites in membranes of rat cerebral cortex. Northern analysis and in situ hybridization indicate that mRNA (4.0 kilobases) for cloned rat SRIF receptor is preferentially expressed in rat brain regions such as cerebral cortex and hippocampus with no detectable expression in most peripheral organs. This pattern contrasts with the exclusive peripheral expression of a recently cloned human SRIF receptor. The cDNA probe of rat receptor detects mRNA from mouse brain but not from human cerebral cortex and cerebellum.",
