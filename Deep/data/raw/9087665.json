     "AB": "The effect of oral administration of a tryptophan-free amino acid mixture or the same mixture containing tryptophan (Trp) on hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) extracellular levels was studied using in vivo brain microdialysis of freely moving rats. During chloral hydrate anesthesia rats were implanted with dialysis probes in the dorsal hippocampus, and experiments were performed 24 h later. In vehicle-treated rats, the extracellular levels of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and 5-HT did not change during 240 min after ingestion. Oral administration of the Trp-free amino acid mixture significantly decreased basal 5-HT and 5-HIAA output 100 min after ingestion (65 and 81% of basal value, respectively) and remained at this level for another 140 min. The amino acid mixture containing Trp failed to significantly change basal extracellular levels of 5-HT, but enhanced that of 5-HIAA by approximately 134%. Moreover, in rats receiving the Trp-free amino acid mixture, the increase of hippocampal 5-HT release induced by d-fenfluramine (206%) was smaller than that released by the same drug in rats receiving the nutritionally balanced amino acid mixture (271%). Thus these results show that removal of Trp from the balanced amino acid mixture decreases spontaneous and d-fenfluramine-induced release of 5-HT in the hippocampus. In conclusion, our study supports the hypothesis that the mood-lowering effect observed in man after ingestion of a Trp-free amino acid mixture is associated with diminished 5-HT release in the brain.",
