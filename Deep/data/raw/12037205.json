     "AB": "The molecular mechanisms that underlie the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) remain unclear. We have examined the influence of postsynaptic cAMP-dependent processes on LTP maintenance in CA1 hippocampal cells. After LTP induction, drugs affecting cAMP-dependent processes were perfused into the cell through a patch pipette. A cAMP analogue, Rp-cAMPS (4 mM), dramatically decreased the amplitude of potentiated synaptic responses. The amplitude of responses in the control pathway was also decreased but to a lesser extent, indicating a specific effect on the potentiation process. This specific effect was not due to the larger amplitude of potentiated responses, was not use-dependent and, unlike other factors that affect LTP maintenance, did not depend on the delay (2, 10, or 25 min) of drug application after LTP induction. Lower concentrations of Rp-cAMPS (1.0 and 0.4 mM) also produced an inhibitory effect but reduced the LTP and control pathways comparably. One possible action of Rp-cAMPS is competitive inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA). Surprisingly, a potent and noncompetitive PKA inhibitor, regulatory type II subunit of PKA, produced only a weak depression of potentiated and control responses indicating there must be other targets for Rp-cAMPS. Moreover, Sp-8-OH-cAMPS, which is an activator of PKA, and Rp-8-OH-cAMPS, which is a weak inhibitor of PKA, both produced effects similar to those of Rp-cAMPS. We conclude that there are postsynaptic cyclic nucleotide-dependent processes that can specifically alter the mechanisms that maintain LTP and that are not primarily dependent on PKA.",
