     "AB": "Isotonic media containing sodium salts from weak organic acids induce cell swelling in several experimental preparations (Grinstein et al., 1984; Jakubovicz et al., 1987). In vivo perfusion of rat dentate gyrus, using a microdialysis probe, with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solutions in which 50 mM NaCl was isotonically substituted by the sodium salts from organic acids with a pKa value of greater than 2 (acetate, propionate, or pyruvate), induced a reversible increase in the extracellular taurine concentration. By contrast, similar NaCl substitutions with sodium salts from the stronger organic acids isethionate and methane-sulfonate did not change extracellular taurine levels. Extracellular taurine increases evoked by acetate, propionate, or pyruvate were almost completely abolished when the perfusion liquid was made hypertonic by adding sucrose (50 mM). A 30% reduction of the acetate-induced extracellular taurine increase was observed both when amiloride was present or when the [Na+]0 was lowered. Both conditions are known to inhibit Na+/H+ exchange. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that acid load-induced taurine release is stimulated by an osmotic sensitive mechanism, part of which is dependent on activation of the Na+/H+ exchange.",
