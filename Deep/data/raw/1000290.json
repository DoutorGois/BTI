     "AB": "Spontaneous and hypothalamically induced hippocampal rhythmical slow activity (RSA or theta) was studied acutely in rats anaesthetized with urethane or immobilized with D-tubocurarine. Systematic tracking of microelectrodes showed two foci of hippocampal RSA, one located in the basal part (stratum oriens) of CAl (mean amplitude 1 mV) and the other located in stratum moleculare of the dorsal blade of the fascia dentata (mean amplitude 2 mV). The hippocampal RSA recorded from the lower blade of the fascia dentata was always smaller than that found in the upper blade (mean amplitude 1 mV). The whole dorsal hippocampal extent within each generator zone was shown to be in synchrony, and the respective generator zones of both hippocampi were synchronous with one another. A null zone in stratum radiation was found interposed between the two generators and a zone of large amplitude fast activity (30-50 Hz) was localized to the hilus of the fascia dentata. Wave form analysis showed that the RSA recorded from the two generators was approximately 180 degrees out of phase. Amplitude and analysis of phase changes of RSA recorded in brain areas outside of the two generator zones suggested that such activity was due to physical spread from the two generators, with the possible exception of a restricted portion of CA3. The existence of the two generators, 180 degrees out of phase, was demonstrated in freely moving rats. Behavioural observations showed that the two generators were related systematically to concurrent motor behaviour. Preliminary observations suggest that, of the two generators, the one located in CAl may be the more variable.",
