     "AB": "Axotomy of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band and degeneration of their terminals in the hippocampus resulting from fornix-fimbria lesions induce elevation of NGF content in these two brain regions. Postlesion levels of cholinergic neuron-specific ChAT activity in the septum suggest that endogenously produced NGF may, at least partly, promote survival of axotomized cholinergic neurons or induce ChAT activity in undamaged cells or both. These findings thus support the proposed trophic role for NGF in central cholinergic neurons.",
