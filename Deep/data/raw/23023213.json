     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Gap junctions composed of connexins (Cx) are functional in cell defense by propagation of toxic/death molecules to neighboring cells. Hippocampus, one of the brain regions with particular vulnerability to damage, has a wide network of gap junctions. Functional response of astrocytic Cx30 and neuronal Cx32 to hippocampal damage is unknown. METHODS: We infused lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intracerebroventricularly (2.5 mug/rat) once daily for two weeks to create neuroinflammation. The mRNA and protein levels of the Cx were measured in the hippocampus after 1st, 7th and 14th injection by real-time PCR and Western-blot techniques. RESULTS: A significant increase in Cx32 and Cx30 gene expression was observed after 7th and 14th injection of LPS with no significant change in their protein abundance. CONCLUSION: Transcriptional overexpression of hippocampal Cx30 and Cx32 could be an adaptive response to production of intracellular toxic molecules but it is not accompanied with post- transcriptional overexpression and might have no functional impact.",
