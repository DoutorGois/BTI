     "AB": "In utero exposure to ionizing radiation is of importance because of its potential health risks. The developing nervous system is particularly vulnerable and the consequences of exposure to low levels of radiation (< or = 1 Gy) are not well established. The developmental effects of maternal exposure to 50 cGy gamma-radiation on gestational days (GD) 9.5, 15, and 18 were investigated in Sprague Dawley rats. Rats exposed on GD-9.5 along with appropriate controls were killed at 4 h, 48 h, and 10 days post-irradiation while those irradiated on GD-15 and GD-18 were killed postnatally (PN) on days 7 and 26. All were examined for developmental anomalies and representative samples of brains were processed for microscopic study. No significant developmental differences were observed between irradiated and control embryos killed 48 h after irradiation on GD 9.5. However, in irradiated fetuses a larger number of developmental anomalies were observed at term. Defects of the eye and of spinal curvature were the most common malformations encountered. Mitoses were reduced within the neuroepithelium of embryos irradiated on GD-9.5 and evidence of pyknosis and necrosis was seen 4 h after irradiation. The capacity of surviving primitive neural cells for repair, however, was such that by 48 h after exposure the irradiated nervous system no longer differed from controls. Rats irradiated on GD-15 and GD-18 and examined on PN-26 exhibited clusters of small, dark, pyknotic neurons within the hippocampal and dentate gyri, often bilaterally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
