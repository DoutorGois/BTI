     "AB": "The present work deals with morphological aspects which are likely related to a genetically determined learning behavior in the shuttle box paradigm. Subregions of the hippocampal mossy fiber system in two closely related inbred mice strains, DBA1 as a bad active avoider and DBA2 as a good one, are compared. Additionally, data derived from C3H (bad active avoider) studies are analyzed. Beside of certain structural similarities in DBA1 and DBA2 such as the elongation of infrapyramidal mossy fibers along the CA3 neurons this study pays attention to the topography of hilus and basal CA3 mossy fiber innervation.",
