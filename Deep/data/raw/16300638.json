Another important phenomenon involved in these disorders is the alteration of iron homeostasis, with an increase in iron levels. The present study investigated whether 6-hydroxymelatonin (6-OHM) can reduce Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation and necrotic cell damage in the rat hippocampus in vivo. It was found that 6-OHM administration proved successful in reducing Fe2+-induced neurotoxicity in rat hippocampus. This study provides some evidence of the neuroprotective effects of 6-OHM.",
