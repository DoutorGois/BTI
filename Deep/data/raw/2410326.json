The rat brain was divided into: I--cerebral cortex, II--hippocampus, III--midbrain, IV--thalamus with hypothalamus, V--cerebellum and VI--medulla oblongata. The obtained results proved that the analogues of SP fragments inhibit selectively the activity of the enzyme in the homogenates of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain and cerebellum. In the crude mitochondrial fractions the applied analogues of SP fragments caused a slight increase of the enzyme activity. The most significant changes in the activity of MAO were observed in hippocampus homogenate fraction.",
