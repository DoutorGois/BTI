     "AB": "Extracts of Valeriana officinalis have been used in folkloric medicine for its sedative, hypnotic, tranquilizer and anticonvulsant effects, and may interact with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and/or benzodiazepine sites. At low concentrations, valerian extracts enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding (EC50 4.13 x 10(-10) mg/ml). However, this increased [3H]flunitrazepam binding is replaced by an inhibition at higher concentrations (IC50 of 4.82 x 10(-1) mg/ml). These results are consistent with the presence of at least two different biological activities interacting with [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites. Valerian extracts also potentiate K+ or veratridine-stimulated release of radioactivity from hippocampal slices preloaded with [3H]GABA. Finally, inhibition of synaptosomal [3H]GABA uptake by valerian extracts also displays a biphasic interaction with guvacine. The results confirm that valerian extracts have effects on GABA(A) receptors, but can also interact at other presynaptic components of GABAergic neurons.",
