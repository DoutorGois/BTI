     "AB": "Previous in vitro studies have shown that Al(3+) binds to calmodulin, inducing alterations in its capability to interact with target proteins, accompanied by loss of immunological recognition by its conformational specific monoclonal antibody CAM1. In spite of the wealth of data of calmodulin action in vitro, little information is available on the possible involvement of this protein in the pathology typical of Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we investigated calmodulin immunoreactivity in post-mortem human brains affected by Alzheimer's disease, compared with age-matched control brains. Conformational monoclonal antibodies raised against Ca(2+)-calmodulin, namely CAM1 and CAM4, were used in this study for the characterization of calmodulin. Calmodulin immunorecognition by monoclonal antibody CAM1 was found to be lost in cortical tissue sample from brains affected by Alzheimer's disease. This finding leads to the hypothesis of a new, possibly inactive, conformation of the molecule during the disease. On the other hand, CAM4 immunoreactivity was decreased in neurons of brains affected by Alzheimer's disease. Anti-Al(3+) monoclonal antibodies revealed instead more marked aluminium immunoreactivity in the affected brains compared to normal ones. The loss of CAM1 immunoreactivity and the occurrence of large amounts of aluminium suggest an alteration of the active conformation of calmodulin in disease-affected brains. These alterations could be involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology.",
