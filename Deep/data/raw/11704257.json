     "AB": "The present study investigated the effects of high levels of estradiol in female rats on four different radial arm maze tasks: the hippocampus-dependent spatial working-reference memory task; the prefrontal cortex-hippocampus dependent delayed win-shift task; the striatum-dependent cued win-stay task; and the amygdala-dependent conditioned place preference task. Ovariectomized female rats were injected daily with either 10 microg of estradiol benzoate or sesame oil vehicle approximately 4 h prior to testing. In Experiment 1, treatment with estradiol disrupted learning on the spatial working-reference memory task by increasing the number of reference memory errors to reach criterion. In Experiment 2, treatment with estradiol had no significant effect on the delayed win-shift task. In Experiment 3, treatment with estradiol resulted in impaired performance on a striatum-dependent cued win-stay task. In Experiment 4, treatment with estradiol impaired the acquisition of a conditioned place-preference task. Taken together these findings suggest that high levels of estradiol inhibit reference memory, stimulus response learning, and amygdala-dependent appetitive conditioning while having little effect on working memory.",
