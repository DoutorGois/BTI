Adult female rats were fed a control or 40% ethanol (percent of total caloric intake) liquid diet. Additional controls were pair fed to the 40% experimental group. Results of the effects of these diets on the offspring included both qualitative and quantitative changes observed in Golgi study of hippocampal pyramidal neurons.",
