     "AB": "The cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) gene transcription factor has been implicated in the synaptic plasticity and memory. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of CREB and/or cyclic AMP-responsive element modulatory protein (CREM) binding to CRE sites in brain tissues. CRE-DNA binding was determined in nuclear extracts obtained from the several brain structures of wild-type and CREB delta/alpha mutant mice. It was found that antibodies to CREB, phosphorylated CREB, and CREM supershifted the CRE-DNA binding complex in cortical nuclear extracts from wild-type mice, which suggests that the CRE-DNA binding complex contains both CREB and CREM proteins. In contrast, CRE-DNA binding is abolished in the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and amygdala of CREB delta/alpha mutant mice. Because the CREB delta and alpha isoforms have been deleted in CREB mutant mice, consequently, other forms of CREB, such as CREB-beta and CREM, are up-regulated. These results suggest that the binding of CREM to CRE sites requires the presence of CREB delta/alpha, and that CREB-beta may be inefficient in binding to CRE-sites. Thus, these results indicate that CREB delta/alpha mutant mice are a useful animal model for studying the functional role of CREB-dependent gene expression.",
