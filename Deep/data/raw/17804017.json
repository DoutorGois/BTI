     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the presence of viral DNAs of HSV-1, HSV-2, HHV-6, HHV-8, and CMV in hippocampus of the patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) syndrome. METHODS: Pathological specimens were obtained from 33 patients with MTLE undergone temporal lobectomy with amygdalo-hippocampectomy due to intractable seizures. Autopsy materials from the hippocampus of 7 patients without neurological disease were used as controls. The data was also correlated with the clinical history of patients including febrile convulsions, age, and history of CNS infections. Real-time polymerase chain reaction method was performed for detection of DNAs of these viruses. RESULTS: HHV-6, HSV-1 and HHV-8 were detected in the hippocampus of 3, 2 and 1 patients with MTLE respectively. None of the hippocampus of patients with MTLE was positive for DNA of HSV-2 and/or CMV. Three patients with positive HHV-6 DNAs had febrile convulsions and family history for epilepsy. None of our control specimens showed PCR positivity to any of the 5 tested viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to report the presence of HHV-8 viral genome in the brain tissue of patient with MTLE. Viral DNAs were detected in a total of 18% of the patients in this study; we can conclude that activity of the latent virus in patients with hippocampal sclerosis should be more extensively studied to establish its role in active infection.",
