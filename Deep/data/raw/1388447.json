This severely compromised system, which includes the nucleus basalis of Meynert, is largely responsible for the massive loss of cortical and subcortical cholinergic innervation in the diseased state. Our study juxtaposes the basal forebrain immunohistopathology to the hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex in AD. Key findings include a progressive degeneration of these cholinergic neurons characterized by the formation of immunoreactively atypical NFT, the loss of intraneuronal lipofuscin, a lack of senile plaque and beta-amyloid deposition within the basal forebrain, and end-stage gliosis without residual extracellular NFT. These structural and compositional differences suggest a unique pathogenesis of the basal forebrain separate from other cortical regions in AD.",
