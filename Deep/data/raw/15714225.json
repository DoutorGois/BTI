     "AB": "Immobilization stress upregulates c-Fos expression in several CNS areas. Repeated stress or the use of drugs can modulate stress-induced c-Fos expression. Here, we investigated in 40 different areas of the rat brain the effects of dexamethasone (SDX, a synthetic glucocorticoid), diazepam (SBDZ, a benzodiazepine), and imipramine (IMI, an antidepressant) on the c-Fos expression induced by restraint stress. Wistar rats were divided into four groups and submitted to 20 days of daily injection of saline (three first groups) or imipramine, 15 mg/kg, i.p. On day 21, animals were submitted to injections of saline (somatosensory, SS), SDX (1 mg/kg, i.p.), SBDZ (5 mg/kg, i.p.), or IMI (15 mg/kg, i.p.) before being submitted to restraint. Immediately after stress, the animals were perfused and their brains processed with immunohistochemistry for c-Fos (Ab-5 Oncogene Science). Dexamethasone reduced stress-induced c-Fos expression in SS cortex, hippocampus, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), and locus coeruleus (LC), whereas diazepam reduced c-Fos staining in the SS cortex, hippocampus, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, septal area, and hypothalamus (preoptic area and supramammillary nucleus). Chronic administration of imipramine decreased staining in the hippocampus, PVH, and LC, while increasing it in the nucleus raphe pallidus. We conclude that dexamethasone, diazepam and imipramine differentially modulate stress-induced Fos expression. The present study provides an important comparative background that may help in the further understanding of the effects of these compounds and on the brain activation as well as on the behavioral, neuroendocrine, and autonomic responses to stress.",
