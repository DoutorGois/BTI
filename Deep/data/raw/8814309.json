     "AB": "Noradrenaline- and ionomycin-stimulated as well as basal phospholipase D activity from rat hippocampus produced, in the presence of ethanol, two different classes of [32P]phosphatidylethanol (designated I and II), which were separated by thin layer chromatography. Endogenous labeling experiments using 3H-fatty acids showed that two different classes of phosphatidylcholine, separated by two-dimensional TLC, one enriched with high incorporation of [3H]arachidonic acid (B) and the other with [3H]myristic acid (A), were the most likely sources for the two classes of phosphatidylethanol. Experiments where individual 32P-phospholipids extracted from [32P]Pi-labeled hippocampal slices were incubated with cabbage phospholipase D, in the presence of ethanol, showed that each class of [32P]phosphatidylcholine, i.e. A and B, produced a different band of [32P]phosphatidylethanol, with the same mobility in TLC as phosphatidylethanol II and I, respectively.",
