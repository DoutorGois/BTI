     "AB": "Fetal hippocampal neurons were stereotaxically transplanted to five-day-old ischemic CA1 lesions in adult rat hippocampi. The recipient brains were examined 14 or 100 days later. The grafts survived well, and transplanted cells usually formed clusters in the host CA1 subfield. In vitro receptor autoradiography was employed to map the following receptors, the ligands indicated in parentheses being used for labeling: muscarinic cholinergic ([3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate), adenosine A1 ([3H]cyclohexyladenosine), kainate ([3H]kainic acid), spirodecanone ([3H]spiperone), opioid ([3H]naloxone), and GABAA ([3H]muscimol). The receptor autoradiographic technique showed significant binding of the six ligands in all hippocampal grafts two weeks after transplantation. One hundred days following transplantation, almost all receptors, especially muscarinic cholinergic, adenosine A1 and opioid receptor bindings in grafts, had significantly increased compared to bindings two weeks after transplantation. At this time, kainate and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in grafts had increased up to the near normal level of the CA1 in the hippocampus. Interestingly, adenosine A1 receptors in the grafted side had significantly increased not only in the CA1 but also in the stratum oriens of the CA3 compared with that in the non-grafted side. The increase of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding corresponded well with the innervation of acetylcholinesterase-positive fibers at 100 days after grafting. These results demonstrate that the transplanted neurons, which showed both pre- and post-synaptic autoradiographic markers in the ischemic CA1 lesions, are able to develop their properties and express the nature of normal hippocampal neurons.",
