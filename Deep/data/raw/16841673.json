     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Dahuang Zhechong Pill (DZP) on the content of amino acids in hippocampal tissue of model rats of ischemic cerebral hemorrhage (ICH). METHODS: Collagenase and heparin were injected into caudate nucleus to establish ICH rat model. The content of glutamic acid (Glu), aspartic acid (Asp) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in hippocampal tissue was detected by anti-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic fluorimetry to observe the effect of DZP on the content of amino acids in brain tissue. RESULTS: Three days after modeling, the content of Glu, Asp and GABA was significantly higher in the model group than those in the sham-operation and the normal control group (P < 0.05), for Glu 15.2926 +/- 4.2429 micromol/g vs 8.0057 +/- 1.1227 micromol/g and 8.5040 +/- 1.7794 micromol/g, for Asp 3.6384 +/- 3.1021 micromol/g vs 1.4986 +/- 0.4174 micromol/g and 1.2669 +/- 0.4695 micromol/g, and for GABA 0.3859 +/- 0.1846 micromol/g vs 0.1829 +/- 0.04665 micromol/g and 0.1770 +/- 0.0472 micromol/g. The content of Glu (9.0550 +/- 1.7195 micromol/g), Asp (1.8085 +/- 0.6862 micromol/g) and GABA (0.1993 +/- 0.0424 micromol/g) in hippocampal tissue in the DZP group was reduced significantly, as compared with that in the model group (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: DZP could reduce the release of excitatory amino acids (EAA-Glu, ASP) to balance EAA/inhibitory amino acid (IAA), so as to relieve ICH-induced brain injury.",
