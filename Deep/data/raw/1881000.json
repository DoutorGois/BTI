     "AB": "An acutely acquired dependence was investigated in rat hippocampal slices after brief exposure to morphine. Morphine augmented the population spike amplitude. Naloxone not only reversed the augmentation but decreased the amplitude to a level below that of the control. The inhibitory effect of naloxone correlated with the period of preincubation with morphine. These results suggested that the decreased response may indicate the withdrawal state acquired in vitro.",
