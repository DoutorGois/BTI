     "AB": "The actions of the GABA analog 3-aminopropanephosphinic acid (3-APA) were studied in the guinea-pig isolated ileal preparation and at synapses between cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Like the GABAB receptor agonist, baclofen, 3-APA inhibited the electrically evoked ileal twitch. The EC50 for 3-APA was 0.8 microM; the EC50 for baclofen was 9 microM. In addition, the depressant responses to 3-APA and baclofen were blocked by the GABAB receptor antagonists phaclofen, saclofen, 2-hydroxy-saclofen and delta-aminovaleric acid. 3-APA also mimicked the presynaptic action of baclofen at GABAergic synapses between embryonic rat hippocampal neurons in culture. 3-APA reduced the amplitude of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and currents (IPSCs) by greater than 50% at a concentration of 1 microM, while baclofen reduced synaptic transmission to a similar degree at 10 microM. 3-APA did not alter membrane conductance, nor did the drug alter postsynaptic responses to GABA. These data show that 3-APA is a potent agonist at presynaptic GABAB receptors in the periphery and on GABAergic neurons from the central nervous system. The activity of 3-APA at central postsynaptic GABAB receptors remains to be studied.",
