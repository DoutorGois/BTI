     "AB": "Spindle-like waves of 40-85 Hz (minispindle-II) and 85-155 Hz (minispindle-I) were recorded from the cat hippocampus. Minispindle-II, as well as minispindle-I, occurred during drowsy and slow-wave sleep episodes. The minispindle-I type was dominant in the CA1 sector; and, conversely, the minispindle-II type was predominant in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. In addition to the different distribution of minispindle-I and -II, disparity was observed in the concurrency of the minispindles.",
