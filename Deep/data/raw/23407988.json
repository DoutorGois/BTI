     "AB": "Regional progression of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) around the hippocampus was traced on thick sections double immunofluorolabeled with RD3 and RD4 antibodies, specific for three- and four-repeat tau, respectively. As reported, the cubic density of all tau-positive neurons was predominant in the entorhinal cortex and cornu ammonis (CA)1, and decreased progressively to the CA2-4 subregions. Among the three isoform profiles (RD3+/4-, RD3+/4+, and RD3-/4+), this regional gradient was replicated with RD3+/4- and RD3+/4+ neurons, while RD3-/4+ neurons exhibited the reverse gradient. Comparison of the subregion pairs confirmed a consistent profile shift along this gradient in every case regardless of the abundance of NFTs. To clarify the underlying mechanism of this regional profile shift, intraneuronal intensity of RD3 and RD4 immunoreactivity (IR) was quantified. Although their intensities were both lower in dendrites than in the soma, this gradient was steeper with RD4, leaving RD3 IR in dendrites. Dendritic arborization was abundant in RD3-/4+ pretangles, attenuated in RD3+/4+ neurons, and further attenuated in RD3+/4- ghost tangles. These findings suggest that dendritic RD4 IR retracts first, leaving RD3 IR in the dendrites. Taken together, this dendrite-oriented retraction initiates the gradual shift from RD3-/4+ pretangle neurons to RD3+/4- ghost tangles by way of RD3+/4+ NFTs. This intraneuronal profile shift may be a basis for the regional gradation featured by the similar profile shift during progression of NFT pathology.",
