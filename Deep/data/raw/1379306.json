     "AB": "Effects of human recombinant acidic fibroblast growth factor (haFGF) on long-term potentiation (LTP) and the increase of the spike amplitude induced by weak tetanic stimulation were investigated and compared with those of CS23 (modified human basic FGF) in the dentate gyrus of fasted and nonfasted rats. haFGF didn't influence the LTP induced by the tetanus of 100 pulses at 100 Hz in both 24 hr fasted and non-fasted rats. On the other hand, the tetanus of 20 pulses at 60 Hz significantly enhanced the amplitude of population spike and facilitated the generation of LTP by the i.c.v. injection of 10 microliters of 20-40 micrograms/ml haFGF in 24 hr fasted rats but not in non-fasted rats. However, 40 micrograms/ml CS23 induced LTP when the tetanus of 20 pulses at 60 Hz was applied in both fasted and non-fasted states. These results suggest that haFGF might be one of the regulating factors of feeding and memory.",
