Many herbal drugs and extracts have been used for the treatment of cerebral ischemia induced insults. This study was designed to investigate the protective effect of Semelil (ANGIPARS), a new herbal drug, on focal cerebral ischemia in male rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MALE RATS WERE DIVIDED INTO FIVE GROUPS: sham-operated, ischemic animals treated with distilled water as vehicle, ischemic animals treated with 1, 10 and 100 mg/kg of Semilil respectively. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used in NMRI rats and neuronal injury analyzed in hippocampal CA1 sector after 48 hrs of Middle Cerebral Artery (MCAO). RESULTS: Results of this study showed that treatment with semelil attenuated ischemic damages and has positive effects on focal cerebral ischemia.",
