     "AB": "We present a model for the study of injury-induced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) in murine organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHCs). A brief exposure of 8-day-old hippocampal slice cultures to the glutamate receptor agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA; 20-50microM for 30 min) caused a selective excitotoxic injury in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus that matured over a period of 24h. The insult resulted in a prominent up-regulation of proliferating nuclei within the OHC dentate gyrus (DG), and a corresponding increase in Ki67/doublecortin double-positive cells in the SGZ of the dentate gyrus. 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labelling of the OHCs for three days subsequent to the NMDA exposure revealed significantly increased BrdU incorporation within the DG (SGZ and GCL) of the hippocampus. Doublecortin immunofluorescence indicated a concurrent up-regulation of neuronal precursor cells specifically in the SGZ and GCL. Significantly increased BrdU incorporation could be detected up to 6-9 days after termination of the NMDA exposure. The model presented here enables easy manipulation and follow-up of injury-induced neuroblast proliferation in the DG that is amenable to the study of transgenic mice.",
