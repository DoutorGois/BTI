     "AB": "Synapses enable the transmission of information within neural circuits and allow the brain to change in response to experience. During the last decade numerous proteins that can induce synapse formation have been identified. Many of these synaptic inducers rely on trans-synaptic cell-cell interactions to generate functional contacts. Moreover, evidence now suggests that the same proteins that function early in development to regulate synapse formation may help to maintain and/or regulate the function and plasticity of mature synapses. One set of receptors and ligands that appear to impact both the development and the mature function of synapses are Eph receptors (erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line) and their surface associated ligands, ephrins (Eph family receptor interacting proteins). Ephs can initiate new synaptic contacts, recruit and stabilize glutamate receptors at nascent synapses and regulate dendritic spine morphology. Recent evidence demonstrates that ephrin ligands also play major roles at synapses. Activation of ephrins by Eph receptors can induce synapse formation and spine morphogenesis, whereas in the mature nervous system ephrin signaling modulates synaptic function and long-term changes in synaptic strength. In this review we will summarize the recent progress in understanding the role of ephrins in presynaptic and postsynaptic differentiation, and synapse development, function and plasticity.",
