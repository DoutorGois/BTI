     "AB": "Unilateral sensorimotor cortical contusion significantly decreased ipsilateral hippocampal cerebral metabolic rates of glucose utilization (CMRglu) compared to sham controls at 2 and 16 days post injury. In contrast, hippocampal CMRglu was transiently increased at 6 days post injury. Both the increased and decreased CMRglu were predominantly localized to the hippocampal CA3 subfield ipsilateral to injury and were significantly different from sham controls in the dorsal but not ventral hippocampal formation.",
