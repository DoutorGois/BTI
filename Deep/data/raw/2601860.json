     "AB": "The effect of nerve growth factor on the intact versus injured septohippocampal cholinergic system of adult rats was studied. Nerve growth factor was continuously infused into the lateral ventricle of adult uninjured rats or rats that had received unilateral partial transection of the fimbria. Controls (operated and unoperated) received intraventricular infusion of cytochrome c. After 2 weeks of nerve growth factor or cytochrome c treatments, choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase activities were measured in the septal area and in the hippocampus (divided into dorsal, medial and ventral parts). The continuous infusion of nerve growth factor resulted in a marked dose-dependent increase of choline acetyltransferase activity in both septum and hippocampus of adult unlesioned rats. In lesioned rats the nerve growth factor treatment was capable of inducing choline acetyltransferase activity in the hippocampus of not only the lesioned but also the unlesioned side, as well as in the septal area. In addition, nerve growth factor affected choline acetyltransferase activity differently in the hippocampus of the operated side with respect to the contralateral side or in unoperated animals. The chronic infusion of nerve growth factor did not affect acetylcholinesterase activity in the septum or in the hippocampus of either lesioned or unlesioned rats. The present findings indicate that nerve growth factor is capable of modulating the function of not only damaged but also normal adult forebrain cholinergic neurons. This suggests that nerve growth factor may modulate the function of these neurons in adulthood.",
