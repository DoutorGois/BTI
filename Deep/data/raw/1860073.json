     "AB": "In this study, we attempted to find out whether a social stress-induced increase in the vulnerability to acquire amphetamine self-administration was associated with a change in number of hippocampal corticosteroid receptors. This was examined in two types of sex-mixed colonies of rats. Animals were maintained for 4 weeks in: (1) 'stable social condition', membership did not change after constitution of the colony; (2) 'unstable social condition', the males were changed daily in a random design. The animals living in the 'stable social' conditions had: (1) a lower number of hippocampal type I corticosteroid receptors; (2) a longer duration of the increase in plasma corticosterone after exposure to novelty; (3) a higher vulnerability to acquire amphetamine self-administration. These findings suggest that a decrease in hippocampal type I corticosteroid receptors may be one of the biological mechanisms responsible for the impaired corticosterone feedback control observed in vulnerable animals. These findings throw more light on the role of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in the modulation of adaptive behavior. The availability of drugs which are specific for corticosteroid receptors could represent a new approach to the therapy of certain behavioral disturbances.",
