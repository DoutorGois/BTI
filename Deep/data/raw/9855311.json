     "AB": "The aim of this study was to study the possible intracellular mechanisms underlying the anoxia-induced long-term potentiation (anoxic LTP) in the CA1 neurons of rat hippocampal slices using extra- and intracellular recording techniques. Superfusion of the hippocampal slices with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors NPC-15437 (20 microM) or H-7 (20 microM) specifically prevented the induction of anoxic LTP. Moreover, the anoxic LTP was completely abolished in neurons intracellularly recorded with the selective PKC inhibitor PKCI 19-36 (50 microM). The specific cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor Rp-cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (Rp-cAMPS, 25 microM) had no effect on the anoxic LTP. It is concluded that induction of anoxic LTP requires the activation of postsynaptic PKC.",
