     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxious disorder associated with low levels of corticosterone and enhanced negative feedback of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Previous studies showed that the amygdala not only has an excitatory effect on the HPA axis but also plays a key role in fear-related behaviors. Coticosterone exert actions through binding to the mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which are abundant in the amygdala. In our previous study, down-regulation of MR and GR in the hippocampus of PTSD rats was found. But the roles of MR and GR in the amygdala of PTSD rats is incompletely understood. RESULTS: wistar rats were divided into 1 d, 7 d, 14 d groups after single prolonged stress (SPS) and control group. SPS is a reliable animal model of PTSD. Open field test (OF) and elevated plus maze tests (EPM) were performed to examine fear-related behaviors. Morphological changes of the ultrastructure of the amygdala neurons were assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Dual-immunofluorescence histochemistry was used to determined subcellular distribution and colocalization of MR- and GR-ir. Protein and mRNA of MR and GR was examined by western blotting and RT-PCR. OF and EPM showed enhanced fear in SPS rats. Abnormal neuronal morphology was discovered in the amygdala of SPS rats. The expression of MR- and GR-ir intensity, mRNA and protein within the amygdala decreased after SPS at 1 day, and then gradually recovered by 14 days, although the degree of decrease and recovery were different amongst techniques. We found no change in the MR/GR ratio at 3 levels of the amygdala. But more cytoplasmic distribution and decreased colocalization of MR- and GR-ir were observed in the amygdala after 7 days of SPS. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that change of MR and GR in the amygdala are involved in the mechanisms of fear in PTSD.",
