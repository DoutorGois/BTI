     "AB": "Phospholipase C-beta isozymes that are activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and heterotrimeric G proteins carry a PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain binding motif at their C terminus. Through interactions with PDZ domains, this motif may endow the PLC-beta isozyme with specific roles in GPCR signaling events that occur in compartmentalized regions of the plasma membrane. In this study, we identified the interaction of PLC-beta3 with Shank2, a PDZ domain-containing multimodular scaffold in the postsynaptic density (PSD). The C terminus of PLC-beta3, but not other PLC-beta isotypes, specifically interacts with the PDZ domain of Shank2. Homer 1b, a Shank-interacting protein that is linked to group I metabotropic glutamate receptors and IP3 receptors, forms a multiple complex with Shank2 and PLC-beta3. Importantly, microinjection of a synthetic peptide specifically mimicking the C terminus of PLC-beta3 markedly reduces the mGluR-mediated intracellular calcium response. These results demonstrate that Shank2 brings PLC-beta3 closer to Homer 1b and constitutes an efficient mGluR-coupled signaling pathway in the PSD region of neuronal synapses.",
