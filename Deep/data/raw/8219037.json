     "AB": "The present paper reports data concerning aluminum accumulation and compartmentation in the central nervous system from rats exposed by inhalation to aluminum acetylacetonate [Al(acac)3] for two weeks. The complex Al(aca)3 was chosen for being neutral, hydrolytically stable and lipophilic. After animals treatment, Al(III) was identified fluorimetrically by using morin (3,5,7',2',4'-pentahydroxyflavone) that gives a specific green-yellow fluorescence when complexed to the metal. Al(III) was observed to be accumulated in the brain cortex, hippocampus, enthorinal area, olfactory bulb as well as in the Purkinje cells of cerebellum, and in the white matter.",
