     "AB": "Mental-sweating response (MSR) was observed in the palm when the subject was asked to perform a mentally stressful task such as memory recall or mental calculation. About 4 s before the development of MSR, small MSR-related wavelets (MSR wavelets) and large waves were randomly generated on electroencephalograph. After differentiating the two types of waves, we calculated locations of the current dipole of MSR wavelets using the two-dipole model of the SSB/dipole tracing method. The result showed that one current dipole of MSR wavelets was consistently located in the hippocampus while the other dipole was widely dispersed in the cortex during memory recall and mental calculation.",
