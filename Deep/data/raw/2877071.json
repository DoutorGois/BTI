These areas were selected for their different dopaminergic activities. After L-dopa loading, DA, DOPAC and HVA were increased in all the structures, but the largest increases were in those tissues with the less dopaminergic activity, while 3-MT increased in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum but was lowered in striatum. 3-O-Medopa, which is the direct product of the O-methylation of L-dopa, did not show any specific distribution. The data provide evidence that the striatum, by feed-back mechanisms and specific enzymatic activity, is able to ensure a better regulation of dopaminergic activity than the other structures, thereby overcoming excess L-dopa.",
