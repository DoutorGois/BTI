     "AB": "This study was originally aimed at investigating the effects of intragyral cell suspension grafts which had been enriched in basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) before being implanted into the rat hippocampus denervated by aspiration of the septohippocampal pathways. Whether treated with vehicle alone, vehicle + bFGF, cell suspension with or without bFGF, and irrespective of the surgical treatment (sham-operation, lesions or lesions + grafts), we unexpectedly found approximately 80% of the rats to show morphological alterations in the dentate gyrus (20 weeks post-grafting). These alterations consisted of loss of a part of the granule cells; this loss was most often located in the dorsal leaf of the dentate gyrus. Also, in the close vicinity of the degeneration area, we found severe shrinkage of the molecular layer and disappearance of the typical laminae pattern of acetylcholinesterase distribution. These observations confirm previous findings which showed that fluid injections into the dentate gyrus, a widely used technique for intracerebral administration of drugs, trophic factors or neural grafts, may induce undesirable granule cell necrosis.",
