     "AB": "Despite the availability of multiple antiepileptic drugs (AED), failure to adequately control seizures is a challenge for approximately one third of epilepsy patients, and new therapies with a differentiated mechanism of action are needed. The neuroactive steroid, SGE-516, is a positive allosteric modulator of both gamma- and delta-containing GABAA receptors. This broad GABAA receptor activity differentiates neuroactive steroids like SGE-516 from benzodiazepines, a class of anticonvulsants which have been shown in vitro to selectively target gamma-subunit containing GABAA receptors. As a neuroactive steroid, SGE-516 has pharmacokinetic properties that are intended to allow for chronic oral dosing. We investigated the anticonvulsant activity of SGE-516 across numerous in vitro and in vivo models of seizure activity. SGE-516 dose-dependently reduced neuronal firing rates and epileptiform activity in vitro. In mice, SGE-516 protected against acute seizures in the PTZ-induced chemo-convulsant seizure model and the 6Hz psychomotor seizure model. In addition, SGE-516 demonstrated anticonvulsant activity in the mouse corneal kindling model. These data suggest that SGE-516 may have potential for development as a novel oral AED for the treatment of refractory seizures.",
