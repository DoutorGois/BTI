     "AB": "The selective, brain penetrant, 5-HT(1D) receptor agonist SKF 99101H (10-30 mg/kg i.p.) caused a dose-related fall in rectal temperature in guinea pigs which lasted longer than 2 h. Sumatriptan (1.0-100 mg/kg i.p.), a selective 5-HT(1D) agonist which does not penetrate the brain, did not produce hypothermia, suggesting that peripheral mechanisms are not critically involved in the response. The hypothermia induced by SKF 99101H (30 mg/kg i.p.) was dose-dependently blocked by the 5-HT(1D) receptor antagonists GR 127935 (0.01-1 mg/kg i.p.) and GR 125743 (0.01-3 mg/kg i.p.), confirming the role of 5-HT(1D) receptors. Mianserin (0.3-10.0 mg/kg i.p.) and granisetron (0.1-3.0 mg/kg i.p.) were inactive, suggesting that 5-HT(2A/2B/2C) or 5-HT( 3) receptors play no significant role in the generation of the hypothermic response. Nor was the hypothermia reversed by prazosin (0.03-1.0 mg/kg i.p.), idazoxan (0.03-1.0 mg/kg i.p.) or scopolamine (0.01-0.3 mg/kg i.p.), thereby excluding mediation by alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors and muscarinic receptors. WAY 100635 (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) significantly potentiated the effect of SKF 99101H. The antagonists, when given alone, had no effect on body temperature, with the exception of prazosin (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg). Three days of treatment with parachloroamphetamine (30 mg/kg i.p.) depleted forebrain 5-HT by approximately 75% in frontal cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus and striatum, but failed to alter the hypothermic response to SKF 99101H. The hypothermia is, therefore, unlikely to be mediated by 5-HT(1D) receptors located on 5-HT neurons. SKF 99101H-induced hypothermia in the guinea pig may serve as a useful model for investigation of centrally acting 5-HT( 1D) receptor antagonists.",
