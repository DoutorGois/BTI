     "AB": "Intensities of the immunoreactivities against two GAD isoforms, GAD65 and GAD67, were examined quantitatively in somata of GABAergic neurons in the mouse hippocampus proper. All labeled somata contained both isoforms but showed diverse immunoreactivities against them. The somata showing weak immunoreactivity for GAD65 but moderate to intense immunoreactivity for GAD67 were frequently located in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 and CA3 regions and were mainly composed of parvalbumin-containing neurons, a particular subpopulation of hippocampal GABAergic neurons. These data revealed additional distinctive properties of parvalbumin-containing neurons and suggest their specialized roles in the hippocampal GABAergic system.",
