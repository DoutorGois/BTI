     "AB": "Previous reports have demonstrated that some focal brain injuries increase amyloid precursor protein (APP) immunoreactivity in the region surrounding the injury where it was localized, in damaged axons and in pre-alpha 2 cells of the entorhinal cortex. However, to date, APP expression in the hippocampus remote from the impact site has not been comprehensively studied. Therefore, we have evaluated APP expression not only in the locally injured cerebral cortex but also in the hippocampus remote from the impact site. In the present paper, diffuse axonal injury was induced in rats in midline fluid percussion injury. APP expression was examined post injury using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the expression of 100-kd APP was increased in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus 24 h after injury. It then decreased in the hippocampus, but did not change in the cerebral cortex, 7 days after injury. Immunohistochemical studies showed increased immunoreactivity of APP in the neuronal perikarya and reactive astrocytes near the region of injury in the cerebral cortex 24 h to 7 days after injury. In the hippocampus, APP accumulated in the CA3 neurons 24 h and 3 days after injury, although no hemorrhagic lesions were seen at that site. The APP positive neurons in CA3 showed shrunken cell bodies and pyknotic nuclei 3 days after injury, and some of the neurons in CA3 had disappeared by 7 days postinjury. The results of present study suggest that traumatic brain injury induces overexpression and accumulation of APP in neuronal perikarya and that these events are followed by degeneration of CA3 neurons. Further, the decline in APP expression in the hippocampus is thought to be due to neuronal loss in CA3 subsector.",
