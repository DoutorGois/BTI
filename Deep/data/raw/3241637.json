     "AB": "The regional localization of mRNA coding for the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) has been studied in the rat brain by in situ hybridization using a 32P-labelled synthetic 32 mer oligonucleotide. Autoradiograms were quantified using computer-assisted microdensitometry. High levels of hybridization were observed in the neocortex, claustrum, endopiriform nucleus, cingular cortex, amygdala, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, geniculate nucleus, several thalamic nuclei and substantia nigra compacta. Very weak signal was detected in the striatum, the cerebellum and the brainstem. The topographic distribution of CCK neurons observed overlaps in part with that previously described by immunohistochemical techniques. However, some discrepancies were also found, particularly in the thalamus. These results show that in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes together with a semiquantitative method described can be used to map the expression of the CCK mRNA in rat brain sections as well as its modification after pharmacological or physiological manipulations.",
