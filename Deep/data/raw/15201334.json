     "AB": "In neurons, excitotoxic stimulation induces mitochondrial calcium overload and the release of pro-apoptotic proteins, which triggers delayed cell death. The precise mechanisms of apoptogen release, however, remain controversial. To characterize the linkage between mitochondrial calcium load and cell vulnerability, and to test the hypothesis that only a subpopulation of mitochondria damaged by calcium overload releases apoptogens, we have measured directly the concentrations of total Ca (free plus bound) in individual mitochondria and monitored in parallel structural changes and the subcellular localization of pro-apoptotic cytochrome c after NMDA overstimulation in cultured hippocampal neurons. Beyond transient elevation of cytosolic calcium and perturbation of Na+/K+ homeostasis, NMDA stimulation induced dramatic, but mainly reversible, changes in mitochondria, including strong calcium elevation, membrane potential depolarization, and variable swelling. Elevation of matrix Ca in the approximately one-third of mitochondria that were strongly swollen, as well as the absence of swelling when Ca2+ entry was abolished, indicate an essential role for Ca overload. Shortly after NMDA exposure, cytochrome c, normally localized to mitochondria, became diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, coincident with the appearance of severely swollen mitochondria with ruptured outer membranes; under these conditions, cytochrome c was retained in intact mitochondria, implying that it was released mainly from damaged mitochondria. Consistent with the role of mitochondrial Ca overload, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone decreased Ca accumulation, prevented cytochrome c release, and was neuroprotective. These results support a mechanism in which delayed excitotoxic death involves apoptogen release from a subpopulation of calcium-overloaded mitochondria, whereas other, undamaged mitochondria maintain normal function.",
