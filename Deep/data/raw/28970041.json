     "AB": "Crassifoside (CH) is a novel chlorine-containing compound isolated from rhizomes of Curculigo glabrescens. This study aimed to explore the antidepressant-like effect of CH and involved mechanisms. A rat depression model was established using chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm. Behavioral tests including sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT) and forced swimming test (FST) were used to evaluate the antidepressant-like effect of CH. The levels of plasma corticosterone (CORT) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) in hypothalamus were measured to determine the activity of hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Protein expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as well as the total and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in hippocampus were also analyzed by Western blotting. The CH administration effectively ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors of CUMS rats, as indicated by the increased sucrose intake in SPT, reduced immobility time in FST, and the increased rearing and grooming numbers, spent more time in inner zone and less time in outer zone in OFT. CH improved CUMS-induced HPA axis hyperactivity by reduced plasma CORT and CRH expression in hypothalamus. Moreover, CH reversed CUMS-induced decrease of 5-HT1A receptor expression, and up-regulated BDNF and phosphorylated-ERK1/2 levels in hippocampus. These findings suggest that CH improved depressive behaviors of CUMS rats by modulating of HPA axis dysfunction, increasing 5-HT1A receptor expression, and activating BDNF-ERK signaling pathway.",
