     "AB": "In the present study, the effects of repeated intra-ventral hippocampal (intra-VH) microinjections of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist or antagonist on morphine-induced anxiolytic-like behavior were investigated in morphine-sensitized mice using elevated plus-maze. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of different doses of morphine (5, 7.5 and 10mg/kg) increased the percentage of open arm time (%OAT), open arm entries (%OAE), but not locomotor activity, indicating an anxiolytic-like response to morphine. The maximum response was obtained by 7.5mg/kg of the opioid. The anxiety-like behavior which was induced by a lower dose of morphine (5mg/kg) was significantly increased in mice that had previously received once daily injections of morphine (10 and 20mg/kg, i.p.) for 3 days. It should be considered that this treatment also increased locomotor activity in morphine-sensitized mice. Furthermore, the response to an ineffective dose of morphine (5mg/kg, i.p.) in the EPM was significantly increased in the animals that had previously received nicotine for 3 days (0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 mug/mouse; intra-VH), 5 min prior to the injections of morphine (5mg/kg/day x 3 days; i.p.). On the other hand, the increase of morphine-induced anxiolytic-like effect in animals that had previously received the 3-day morphine (20mg/kg) was dose dependently suppressed by once daily injections of mecamylamine (0.5, 1 and 2 mug/mouse/day x 3 days; intra-VH). It is important to note that repeated intra-VH administrations of the same doses of nicotine or mecamylamine alone caused no significant change in morphine (5mg/kg)-induced anxiety-like parameters in the EPM. In conclusion, it seems that morphine sensitization affects the anxiety-like behavior in the EPM and the cholinergic system in the ventral hippocampus, via nicotinic receptors, may play an important role in this effect.",
