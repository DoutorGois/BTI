     "AB": "Neurotoxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is usually ascribed to the ortho-substituted congeners. We have examined the effects of acute perfusion of 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 77), a coplanar, dioxin-like congener, on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 and the mossy fiber-CA3 pathways in mouse hippocampus. LTP in both pathways was blocked by PCB 77, with a threshold effect at a concentration of 1 microM. LTP is a useful model of learning and memory function in which a patterned stimulation of an afferent pathway produces a persistent increase in the efficacy of synaptic transmission. LTP is reduced by PCB mixtures and ortho-substituted congeners at concentrations comparable to those studied here. These observations provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like PCB congeners are equally potent in causing the cognitive decrements seen in children exposed prenatally to PCBs.",
