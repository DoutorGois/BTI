     "AB": "Bone, one of the favored sites for tumor metastasis, is a dynamic organ undergoing formation and resorption. We found bone metastasis with osteolytic lesion in the bone marrow of the femur by injecting BW5147 T-lymphoma cells into the tail vein of AKR mice. To understand this bone destruction, we constructed a cDNA library from BW5147 with a cloning vector that allowed in vitro synthesis of mRNAs, and then identified a particular cDNA clone by adding the conditioned medium from Xenopus oocytes following injection of the mRNA synthesized in vitro to primary bone marrow heterogeneous cell populations on hydroxyapatite thin films. By means of this method, we isolated a factor with 16% leucine residues, termed neurochondrin, that induces hydroxyapatite resorptive activity in bone marrow cells resistant to bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of macrophage- and osteoclast-mediated resorption. Expression of the gene was localized to chondrocyte, osteoblast, and osteocyte in the bone and to the hippocampus and Purkinje cell layer of cerebellum in the brain. This may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying bone resorption with potential implications for the activation of cells other than macrophages and osteoclasts in bone marrow cells.",
