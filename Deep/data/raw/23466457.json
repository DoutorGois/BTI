     "AB": "Although respiratory complications with blood gas abnormalities contribute significantly to neurodevelopment in the immature brain, little is known about the mechanisms via which blood gas abnormalities, such as hypoxic hypercapnia, impair neurocognitive outcomes. To investigate the possible long-term consequences of neonatal exposure to hypoxic hypercapnia regarding learning ability, we investigated the effect of neonatal hypoxic hypercapnia on later functions in the hippocampus, which is a structure that has been implicated in many learning and memory processes. Neonatal rat pups (postnatal day 7; P7) were exposed to a high concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2; 13%) for 2 or 4h. Exposure to CO2 in P7 rat pups caused blood gas abnormalities, including hypercapnia, hypoxia, and acidosis, and disrupted later learning acquisition, as assessed in 10-week-old adult rats subjected to a Morris water maze test. Induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the synapses of the hippocampal CA1 area was also impaired, whereas the paired-pulse responses of population spikes exhibited a significant increase, in CO2-exposed rats, suggesting decreased recurrent inhibition in the hippocampus. Such long-lasting modifications in hippocampal synaptic plasticity may contribute to the learning impairments associated with perinatal hypoxic hypercapnia and acidosis.",
