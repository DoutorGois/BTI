     "AB": "Two experiments studied the effects of shifts in the amount of water reinforcement on the instrumental performance of toads (Bufo arenarum) using one trial per day. In the first experiment, a shift from a large to a small reward magnitude led to a gradual change in performance without evidence of negative contrast. A shift from large or small reward magnitude to extinction led to similar extinction rates and provided no indication of the magnitude of reinforcement extinction effect. In the second experiment, the gradual change in performance (with no contrast) after a shift from a large to a small reward magnitude was completely eliminated by ablation of the medial pallium. These results provide support for the hypothesis that the medial pallium in amphibians is homologous to the hippocampal formation in mammals and also indicate that species differences in these learning phenomena may be related to the differential development and differentiation of the hippocampal formation.",
