     "AB": "An iron induced model of posttraumatic chronic focal epilepsy in rats was studied with respect to extracellular amino acids, electrophysiology, and morphology, approx. 6 months after intracortical injection of ferrous chloride. Twenty-six of the twenty-eight (93%) rats developed spontaneous epileptiform EEG-activity and electrical cortical stimulation done in eight animals evoked seizure activity in five animals (62.5%). Epileptic brain tissue displayed significantly higher extracellular interictal levels of aspartate (ASP), compared to normal brain, measured with intracerebral microdialysis. The interictal levels of serine (SER) were significantly higher at the lesion side compared to the contralateral cortex in epileptic animals. Spontaneous elevations of ASP and glutamate (GLU) levels up to 8 times the basal level were found in 4/5 (80%). There was no consistent amino acid pattern following the electrically induced seizures, but in association with more intense seizure activity ASP and GLU were elevated. Histopathologically, the necrotic lesions in the cortex contained small vessels and iron pigment loaded astrocytes. Scattered eosinophilic neurons were found in the hippocampus, bilaterally in 37% of the animals. The results show that a focal epileptiform activity developed in a high percentage of animals that received an intracortical iron injection. The observed amino acid changes in epileptic animals may be involved in the development of seizures in this model of posttraumatic epilepsy.",
