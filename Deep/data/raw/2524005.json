     "AB": "The release of cerebral acetylcholine from terminals in the cerebral cortex has been shown to be regulated by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) but it is not known which subtype of the 5-HT receptor is involved. 5-HT receptor agonists increase acetylcholine levels in vivo, indicating a reduced turnover, and reduce release of acetylcholine from striatal slices in vitro. Depleting 5-HT by inhibiting synthesis or by destroying the neurons containing 5-HT potentiates acetylcholine release, and increases acetylcholine turnover in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Selective antagonists for the 5-HT3 receptor subtypes which seem to have effects on mood and activity may exert their effect through the regulation of acetylcholine release in the cortex and limbic system. Radioligand binding studies show a high density of 5-HT3 receptors in the cholinergic-rich entorhinal cortex and we provide evidence that a reduction in cortical cholinergic function can be effected in vitro by 5-HT3 receptors.",
