     "AB": "Previous studies indicated that the excitatory effects of nicotine may be mediated via interference with GABAergic transmission. Here, several variants of the paired-pulse paradigm were employed to ascertain whether nicotine interferes with endogenous inhibitory circuits in the hippocampus. Nicotine attenuated the inhibition evoked by antidromic (alvear) stimulation in the CA1 region in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 60-75 microM). This same phenomenon was also observed for the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (0.1 microM). Orthodromic-orthodromic paired-pulse paradigms were found to be unsuitable for investigating the effects of epileptogenic agents such as nicotine and bicuculline on endogenous inhibition.",
