     "AB": "Previous studies concerning the volumes of the amygdala and the hippocampus in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show inconsistent results. We acquired magnetic resonance images of 30 individuals with ASD and individually matched controls. All participants had an IQ>100 to increase the likelihood of including non-syndromal forms of ASD. Manually defined amygdala volumes showed no significant group difference, while hippocampi were significantly enlarged in ASD. This finding is discussed with regard to the 'intense world hypothesis'.",
