     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of repeated +Gz exposures on the expression and distribution of c-fos protein immunoreactivity in rabbit brain. METHOD: Twenty rabbits were divided randomly into 4 groups (n=5 in each group). Animals were anesthetized and then exposed to +4 Gz until 30 s after the arterial pressure at eye level dropped to 0 kPa. The exposure was repeated for 3 times with 30 min intervals. The expression of c-fos protein in rabbit brain was examined at 0 h, 1 h and 6 h after +Gz exposure by immunohistochemistry method. RESULT: c-fos protein was obviously expressed in cortex, the third ventricle, hippocampus and dentate gyrus immediately after repeated +Gz exposures, and strongly expressed 1 h after the exposure, and then had a tendency to decrease 6 h after the exposure. CONCLUSION: Three +Gz exposures may cause time-dependent c-fos expression in rabbit brain, which may be involved in +Gz-induced brain damage.",
