     "AB": "A phosphorylated, approximately 110 kDa laminin-binding protein (110 kDa LBP) from mouse brain has been previously identified. This protein recognizes a neurite-outgrowth promoting 19-amino acid synthetic peptide (PA 22-2) derived from the laminin A chain. In the present study, an antibody against the 110 kDa LBP was used to localize immunoreactivity in the normal adult rat brain and also following a stab wound and ischemic lesion. Immunoreactive cells were found in layers II/III and V of the cerebral cortex and within apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Specific immunoreactivity was also found in the stratum lucidum in the CA3 region of the hippocampus which exhibited densely stained mossy fibers and terminals. Mechanical and ischemic lesions induced intense immunolabeling of reactive glial cells around the lesion site. The distinct and anatomically restricted localization of the immunostain in adult and lesioned rat brain suggests that 110 kDa LBP-like molecules might have an important function in forebrain structures and may be involved in the response to CNS injury.",
