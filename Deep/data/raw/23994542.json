     "AB": "Systems consolidation involves the reorganization of brain circuits that support long-term memory. It is a prolonged process that can take days, weeks, or longer. An animal model of systems consolidation was established in the early 1990s and provided compelling support for the initial observations in humans, that hippocampal damage disproportionally impairs recent memory compared to remote memory. Context fear conditioning was the most frequently and successfully used task to study systems consolidation and demonstrate temporally graded retrograde amnesia. However, recent studies have failed to support these early findings of temporal gradients and instead reported that both recent and remote memories are equally impaired. Thus, the status of context fear conditioning as method to study the process of systems consolidation is at present uncertain. Accordingly, we evaluated classically conditioned fear memory in large groups of rats with hippocampal damage by manipulating several procedural variables including the training protocol, the training-surgery interval, the extent of hippocampal damage, and the method of damaging the hippocampus. The results indicate that hippocampal damage profoundly impairs context fear conditioning. These findings are unambiguous and independent of any particular procedural manipulation we evaluated. We suggest that the preponderance of currently available evidence indicates that context fear memory remains hippocampus-dependent indefinitely.",
