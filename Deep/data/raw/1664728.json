     "AB": "The effects of physical activity on spatial memory performance and associated cholinergic function were examined in F344 rats. Cholinergic analysis included resting and depolarization-induced activation of high-affinity choline uptake and muscarinic receptor binding in the hippocampus, parietal cortex and frontal cortex. Rats that were physically trained, using chronic treadmill running, demonstrated significantly enhanced performance on the spatial learning task, both in second trial latency and first and second trial proximity ratio scores (P less than 0.002). Concomitant with enhanced behavioral performance were neurochemical changes of a reduction in hippocampal high-affinity choline uptake, an upregulation of muscarinic receptor density, and an increase in high-affinity choline uptake 24 h after spatial memory testing (P less than 0.05). Spatial memory tested rats demonstrated enhanced depolarization-induced activation of high-affinity choline uptake (P less than 0.001). Rats that were yoked for swim time to spatial memory tested rats did not show any spatial learning-induced alterations in high affinity choline uptake. These spatial learning- and physical activity-induced cholinergic alterations were observed only in the hippocampus, not in the parietal or frontal cortex. These data indicate that the chronic running-induced alterations in hippocampal high-affinity choline uptake and upregulation of muscarinic receptor density, in combination with enhancement of high-affinity choline uptake related to spatial learning, may contribute to the enhanced spatial learning performance of chronic-run rats.",
