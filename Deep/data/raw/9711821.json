     "AB": "Bioelectric activity of a nervous tissue and its synchronization with formatting epileptiform bursts are simulated by a coupled map lattice. The functional units of the map located in the lattice sites represent neural masses which consist of current sources and sinks. The sources lead to depolarization of neurons, and sinks provide hyperpolarization. The map describes a single variable--the bioelectric potential. This potential is created by the interplay of all current sources and sinks in the neural masses. The neural masses are diffusively coupled with each other both by electronic influence and synaptic coupling. Both mechanisms mentioned are suggested to be essential for the formation of synchronous bursts. The transition from chaotic activity to bursts was studied.",
