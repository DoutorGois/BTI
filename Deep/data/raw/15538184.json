     "AB": "We measured the concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) in the brains of mature and developing macaque monkeys. In the adult macaque brain, the highest level of BDNF was found in the hippocampus. Comparisons between cortical regions showed higher levels of BDNF in the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal association cortices than elsewhere. In contrast, NT-4 levels were 3-30 times lower than those of BDNF. During development, the contents of BDNF and NT-4 protein in cerebral cortices were highest at the postnatal second month and at embryonic day 140, respectively. These results suggest that the two TrkB ligands, BDNF and NT-4, may be differently regulated and might play separate roles in monkey cortical development.",
