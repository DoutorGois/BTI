     "AB": "Arthropods as well as mammals are able to return straight home after a random search excursion under conditions that are designed to exclude all external cues. After a brief clarification of the terminology, two principal systems of information processing that can achieve this performance are introduced and analysed: Polar versus Cartesian path integration. The different demands and achievements of the two systems are confronted with neurophysiological findings on the functioning of the hippocampus, and with a recent comprehensive model of how the hippocampal place cells perform path integration. To connect the neurophysiological findings with the behavior of the animal, a new model is developed. It achieves three functionally diverse performances: maintenance and control of a compass direction, navigation by path integration, and formation of goals by connecting non-spatial features with their location. This is done by three interconnected feedback loops, set by a common reference variable. Their information-processing structure enables the animal not only to home but also to go straight from any stored goal to any other, without explicit representation of the distance between them, and without a topological arrangement of the store. The model explains behaviors not yet understood and predicts still undiscovered performances. Because it allows the isolation of orienting from storing functions yet also shows how they can be connected, the model may help to reconcile conflicting views on the function of the hippocampus.",
