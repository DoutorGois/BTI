     "AB": "The projection from the contralateral entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus is shown to exert a monosynaptic excitatory action. Stimulation of the contralateral entorhinal cortex evokes unitary granule cell discharges in the dentate gyrus. This evoked activity is followed by a period of inhibition lasting about 50 msec. Laminar analyses of field potentials generated by contralateral medial entorhinal stimulation localize the synaptic activity to the middle portion of the granule cell dendrites. This localization is consistent with the termination site of the contralateral entorhinal projection as previously shown anatomically. Earlier studies have indicated that the entorhinal cortex excites only the ipsilateral dentate gyrus. These findings now demonstrate that the cortical input to the dentate gyrus is bilateral in normal rats. However, the contralateral projection appears to be much less efficacious than the ipsilateral input.",
