     "AB": "CONTEXT: Psidium cattleianum Sabine (Myrtacea) is rich in vitamin C and phenolic compounds, including epicatechin and gallic acid as the main components. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antifungal and antioxidant capacity in vitro of the essential oil of araca (EOA). The acute toxicity of the EOA also was evaluated in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The leaves of the P. cattleianum were extracted by steam distillation. The antioxidant capacity was evaluated by in vitro tests [1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS), ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), linoleic acid oxidation, thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS)], and ex vivo analysis [TBARS, delta-aminulevunilate dehydratase (delta-Ala-D) and catalase activity, non-protein thiols (NPSH), and ascorbic acid levels]. The toxicity was studied in mice by a single oral administration of EOA; and the antifungal activity was performed with five strains of fungi. RESULTS: The EOA exhibited antioxidant activity in the FRAP assay and reduced lipid peroxidation in the cortex (Imax = 32.90 +/- 2.62%), hippocampus (IC50 = 48.00 +/- 3.00 microg/ml and Imax = 32.90 +/- 2.62%), and cerebellum (Imax = 45.40 +/- 14.04%) of mice. Acute administration of the EOA by the oral route did not cause toxicological effects in mice (LD50 > 500 microg/ml). The EOA also showed antifungal activity through of the determination minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 41.67 +/- 18.04 to 166.70 +/- 72.17 microg/ml for tested strains. CONCLUSION: The results of present study indicate that EOA possess antioxidant properties, antifungal and not cause toxicity at tested doses.",
