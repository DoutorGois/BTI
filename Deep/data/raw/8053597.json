     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Dextromethorphan (DM), a widely used antitussive agent, has been shown to possess both anticonvulsant and neuroprotective properties functionally related to its inhibitory effects on glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. The current study was designed to determine whether DM administration prevents delayed neuronal degeneration in central nervous system areas after global forebrain ischemia and whether this correlates with inhibition of induction of the immediate early gene c-fos. METHODS: Mongolian gerbils, anesthetized with 2% halothane in air at 37 degrees C, received either 0.9% sodium chloride (vehicle, n = 9) or 50 mg/kg DM in vehicle (n = 9) by intraperitoneal injection before bilateral carotid artery occlusion. After 1 h of reperfusion under anesthesia, the animals were killed and the brains removed. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect neurons expressing Fos protein. Computer-assisted image analysis quantified changes in the number of labeled neurons as a function of drug treatment. To determine the extent of delayed neuronal degeneration within the hippocampus, other animals were treated with either DM (n = 7) or vehicle (n = 6) before carotid artery occlusion and allowed to survive for 1 week. RESULTS: Global forebrain ischemia produced consistent patterns of Fos-like immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and neocortex of vehicle-treated animals. DM inhibited the induction of c-fos from 65% to 91%. DM also protected against delayed neuronal degeneration in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The induction of nuclear-associated Fos protein represents a sensitive marker of cellular responses to ischemia and a method to assay the effectiveness of pharmacologic interventions. DM markedly inhibited ischemia-induced Fos expression and prevented cell death in CA1. DM given before conditions of ischemia or decreased central nervous system perfusion may be highly beneficial.",
