     "AB": "Reactive oxygen species may participate in development of neurological toxicity resulting from hyperbaric oxygen exposure. To explore the possibility that increased reactive O2 metabolite generation may result in oxidative modification of lipids and proteins, rats were exposed to five atmospheres (gauge pressure) of O2 until development of an electroencephalographic seizure. Lipid peroxidation (as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) and protein oxidation (as 2,4-dinitrophenyl-hydrazones) were measured in five brain regions. Oxidized and reduced glutathione were also determined because of their role in regulating lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation was confined to the frontal cortex and hippocampus, while protein oxidation (in both cytoplasmic and membranous fractions) and increased oxidized glutathione was evident throughout the brain. These results support a role for formation of reactive O2 metabolites from hyperbaric O2 exposure and suggest that protein oxidation, especially in soluble proteins, may be one of the most sensitive measures.",
