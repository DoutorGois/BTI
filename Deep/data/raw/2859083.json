     "AB": "Perforant path stimulation for 24 h evoked hippocampal granule cell spikes and epileptiform discharges throughout the stimulation period. After stimulation, hippocampal neurons that receive granule cell output were irreversibly damaged and the stimulated hippocampus of each rat revealed a selective loss of Timm stain in the mossy fiber pathway. These results provide evidence in vivo for a role for synaptic zinc in neurotransmission and/or seizure mechanisms.",
