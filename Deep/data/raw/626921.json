     "AB": "Total whole brain concentrations of S-100 protein and of its water-soluble fraction were determined in 11 inbred mouse straine: DBA/2J, AKR/J, CBA/Lac, C57BL/6J, C57BL/6J-Ay, C3H/He, C3H/f, DD, A/He, BALB/cLac, CC57BR/Mv, and in cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus in DBA/2J, AKR/J and CBA/Lac strains. Highly significant differences in the concentrations of the water-soluble S-100 protein were found between some strains. Slight differences were found in total S-100 protein content in whole brains between the strains (0.01 less that P less than 0.05). The DBA/2J mice had the highest brain S-100 protein content, and were characterized by a higher learning rate in shuttle-box as compared to CBA/Lac and AKR/J mice, who had a low content of this neurospecific protein.",
