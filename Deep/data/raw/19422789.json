     "AB": "Recent clinical studies have identified an association between APOE 4 and cognitive deficits in patients with multiple sclerosis. We induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in APOE knockout (KO) and human APOE 4 knockin (E4) mice to study the interaction of APOE and neuroinflammation on cognition. After EAE induction, KO and E4 showed significant deficits in spatial learning and recall. Regional decreases in choline acetyltransferase localized to the hippocampus. Induction of EAE in a transgenic APOE animal provides a template from which we can decipher the role APOE has on cognition in the context of neuroinflammation.",
