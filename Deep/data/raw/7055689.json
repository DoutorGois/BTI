CAT levels were reduced in the cortex and hippocampus of Parkinsonians. The apparent affinity of [3H]QNB for the muscarinic receptor was higher in both the caudate nucleus and the frontal cortex. Receptor density increased only in the frontal cortex. These changes are discussed in relation to dementia and mental disturbances following anticholinergic treatment frequently observed in Parkinson's disease.",
