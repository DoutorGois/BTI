     "AB": "Recent studies have shown marked increases in brain content of neuropeptide Y (NPY) after seizures induced by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid and after pentylenetetrazole kindling in the rat. We have now investigated possible changes in the rate of biosynthesis of NPY after kainic acid treatment, by using pulse-labeling of the peptide and by determining prepro-NPY mRNA concentrations. For pulse labeling experiments, [3H]tyrosine was injected into the frontal cortex, and the incorporation of the amino acid into NPY was determined after purifying the peptide by gel filtration chromatography, antibody affinity chromatography, and reversed-phase HPLC. At 2 and 30 days after kainic acid treatment, the rate of tyrosine incorporation was enhanced by approximately 380% in the cortex. In addition, concentrations of pre-pro-NPY mRNA were determined in four different brain areas by hybridization of Northern blots with a complementary 32P-labeled RNA probe 2, 10, 30, and 60 days after kainic acid treatment. Marked increases were observed in the frontal cortex (by up to 350% of controls), in the dorsal hippocampus (by 750%), and in the amygdala/pyriform cortex (by 280%) at all intervals investigated. In the striatum only a small, transient increase was observed. The data demonstrate increased expression of prepro-NPY mRNA and an enhanced rate of in vivo synthesis of NPY as a result of seizures induced by the neurotoxin kainic acid.",
