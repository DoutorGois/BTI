The preconditioning motor activity significantly enhances the resistance of pyramidal neurons to ischemia at a temperature of 30 degrees C. The period of protection lasts for up to 40 min after the end of motor activity. In case the ischemia was started within 5-10 min after the preconditioning, complete restoration of the field potentials to preischemic control level could be achieved. These data are the first indication of the neuroprotective effect of preconditioning motor activity in CA1 damage after prolonged global ischemia.",
