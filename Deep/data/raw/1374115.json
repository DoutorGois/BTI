     "AB": "Two abnormal entities of 69 and 130 kDa, immunologically related to the microtubule-associated tau proteins, are present in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex of the Alzheimer brain, which contain a large number of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), but are absent in the cerebellum, which does not contain these structures. Epitope mapping with antibodies spanning domains present in the N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal tau sequence demonstrated that the 69- and 130-kDa entities belong to the tau family. Both the 69- and the 130-kDa proteins were found in an insoluble form and were the major tau species present in purified NFTs. A procedure was devised that allowed us to prepare from Alzheimer hippocampi two NFT fractions differing in size (20 and 3 microns), both of which contained the tau entities of 130 and 69 kDa.",
