     "AB": "Synaptosomes isolated from the adult rat hippocampus contain the alpha- and beta-subspecies of protein kinase C (PKC), but not the gamma-subspecies which is abundantly expressed in the pyramidal cells in this brain region. Although the gamma-subspecies is known to respond significantly to free arachidonic acid, it is found that both the alpha- and beta-subspecies are also activated dramatically by arachidonic acid in synergistic action with diacylglycerol. Oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids are all active. It is possible that unsaturated fatty acids may take part in the activation of alpha- and beta-subspecies of PKC which are present in the presynaptic nerve endings terminating at the hippocampal pyramidal cells.",
