     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study if monoclonal antibody against human NMDA receptor key subunit (NR1) may protect neurons from excitotoxicity. METHODS: We cultured primary hippocampal neurons from 10 newborn rats and made the glutamate excitotoxicity model, examined the ratio of surviving neuron (Trypan blue dye staining) and LDH assay to study the protective effects of mAbN1, There were 2 plates in parallel per group, the experiments were repeated 4 times. RESULTS: 0.3 micro mol/L mAbN1 could protect cultured hippocampal neurons from neuroexcitotoxicity induced by 500 micro mol/L glutamate with increased survival rate 35%. Epitope peptide could block the protection of mAbN1, which suggests that the protection of mAbN1 is specific. CONCLUSION: mAbN1 is a novel NMDAR blocker with in vitro neuroprotective activity which may provide a basis for antibody therapy of neuroexcitotoxicity.",
