     "AB": "Low-dimensional chaotic dynamics have been suggested in the rat hippocampal slice during iron-induced epileptiform activity. The dimensionality of this chaotic activity has been found to be similar in slices bathed in the same ionic extracellular medium. Some slices also displayed a drop in dimensionality prior to the onset of seizure-like activity. We suggest that techniques of nonlinear dynamical analysis are a useful reverse-engineering tool for studying the in vitro brain slice. We further conclude that neuronal circuits capable of displaying chaotic activity could exist at the level of the in vitro brain slice.",
