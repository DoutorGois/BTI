     "PG": "604-27",
     "AB": "In the particular case of boron and lithium we examine the possibilities of using stable isotopes for experiments of isotopic labelling and microlocalization, as no radioisotopes exist. The detection is made with the help of a specific nuclear reaction, using homogeneous detectors. The first experimental applications are given: transepithelial fluxes of lithium (frog skin) have shown Liefflux values larger than the influx ones. Detailed microlocalization of lithium have been made on histological preparations of mice having received lithium treatment: particularly important contents are found in the hypophysis, the salivary glands, the bladder, the kidney (especially the pelvis), the intestinal system and certain parts of the brain (particularly the hippocampus); the liver, however remains very poor in lithium. Physiological implications are examined.",
