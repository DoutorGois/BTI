     "AB": "beta-Receptors were identified in rat brain by a light microscopic autoradiographic technique. The procedure involved binding 3H-labeled dihydroalprenolol to beta-receptors in intact slide-mounted tissue sections and generating autoradiograms by the apposition of emulsion-coated cover slips, Biochemical analysis of the binding indicated that these conditions provided a high degree of selective labeling of beta-receptors. High densities of receptors were found in superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, throughout the caudate-putamen, in the periventricular nucleus of the thalamus, in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, and in other areas. These results are in agreement with other electrophysiological and histochemical data. This radiohistochemical approach should be an important addition to other methods for mapping functional catecholamine neuronal pathways and sites of hormonal action.",
