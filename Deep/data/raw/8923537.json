     "AB": "Cytoplasmic seleno-glutathione peroxidase, by reducing hydrogen peroxide and fatty acid hydroperoxides, may be a major protective enzyme against oxidative damage in the brain. Oxidative damage is strongly suspected to contribute to normal aging and neurodegenerative process of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. We report here an immunocytochemical analysis of the localization of glutathione peroxidase in the adult mouse brain, carried out with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody. Most of the brain areas analysed showed weak to strong glutathione peroxidase immunoreactivity, expressed in both neurons and glial cells. The strongest immunoreactivity was found in the reticular thalamic and red nuclei. Highly immunoreactive neurons were observed in the cerebral cortex (layer II), the CA1, dentate gyrus and pontine nucleus. Other regions, such as the caudate-putamen, septum nuclei, diagonal band of Broca, hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus, showed moderate staining. This study provides original information about the wide distribution of glutathione peroxidase in the mouse brain. Double-staining experiments indicated that specific subsets of cholinergic neurons in septal and diagonal band nuclei were negative for this antigen. Similarly, many dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta expressed low levels of glutathione peroxidase antigen, in contrast to the ventral tegmental area, wherein most catecholaminergic cells were strongly positive. A lack of glutathione peroxidase in subsets of dopaminergic or cholinergic neurons may thus confer a relative sensitivity of these cells to oxidative injury of various origins, including catecholamine oxidation, neurotoxins and excitotoxicity.",
