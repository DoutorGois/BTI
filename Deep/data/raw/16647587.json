     "AB": "Cholinergic and gabaergic systems play an important role generating electroencephalographic activity and regulating vigilance states. Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist commonly used to induce seizures and an epilepticus-like state in rodents. A relationship between status epilepticus and reactive oxygen species has been also suggested which could result in seizure-induced neurodegeneration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the existence of oxidative damage as well as the antioxidant enzyme response in cortex and hippocampus after the administration of an intraperitoneal (350 mg/kg) and an intracerebroventricular (360 microg, 1 microl) pilocarpine injection in rats. The GABA agonist muscimol (1 mg/kg, i.p.), with described neuroprotective properties, was used as a negative control. Only systemic pilocarpine induced oxidative damage. Malondialdehyde levels, as a marker of lipid peroxidation (LP), increased in both regions (55-56%). Catalase (52-80%) and superoxide dismutase (53-60%) activities also rose in both regions but glutathione peroxidase activity only increased in cortex (45%). Glutathione reductase and caspase-3 activity did not change. In conclusion, systemic pilocarpine produced oxidative brain damage, whereas local pilocarpine brain injection had no effects. Moreover, the enzymatic determinations performed in this study are a good tool to study brain injury in pharmacological manipulations such as the ones used in short recording EEG studies.",
