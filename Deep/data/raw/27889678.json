     "AB": "Alterations of brain network activity are observable in Alzheimer's disease (AD) together with the occurrence of mild cognitive impairment, before overt pathology. However, in humans as well in AD mouse models, identification of early biomarkers of network dysfunction is still at its beginning. We performed in vivo recordings of local field potential activity in the dentate gyrus of PS2APP mice expressing the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) Swedish mutation and the presenilin-2 (PS2) N141I. From a frequency-domain analysis, we uncovered network hyper-synchronicity as early as 3 months, when intracellular accumulation of amyloid beta was also observable. In addition, at 6 months of age, we identified network hyperactivity in the beta/gamma frequency bands, along with increased theta-beta and theta-gamma phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling, in coincidence with the histopathological traits of the disease. Although hyperactivity and hypersynchronicity were respectively detected in mice expressing the PS2-N141I or the APP Swedish mutant alone, the increase in cross-frequency coupling specifically characterized the 6-month-old PS2APP mice, just before the surge of the cognitive decline.",
