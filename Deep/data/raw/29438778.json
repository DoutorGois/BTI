     "AB": "Gamma oscillations that occur within the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal circuitry play important roles in the formation and retrieval of memory in healthy brains. Recent studies report that gamma oscillations are impaired in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and AD animal models. Here we review the latest advancements in studies of entorhinal-hippocampal gamma oscillations in healthy memory and dementia. This review is especially salient for readers in Alzheimer's research field not familiar with in vivo electrophysiology. Recent studies have begun to show a causal link between gamma oscillations and AD pathology, suggesting that gamma oscillations may even offer a plausible future therapeutic target.",
