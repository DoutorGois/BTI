     "AB": "The effect of IV morphine, 2, 6 and 15 mg/kg, on hilar-evoked CA3 field potentials was studied to determine if this area would be more sensitive to mu-type opiate agonists than the CA1 or dentate regions. In addition, the effect of IV naloxone, 2 and 25 mg/kg, on the same responses was studied to determine if endogenous opiates reported to be present in the mossy fibers are released by electrical stimulation of this pathway. Neither morphine nor naloxone had an effect on CA3 field potentials at any dose used. The CA1 region of the hippocampus is the area most sensitive to morphine, and this effect of morphine correlates best, anatomically, with the localization of mu-receptors identified by the binding of dihydromorphine. Physiological release of endogenous opiates from the hippocampus remains to be shown.",
