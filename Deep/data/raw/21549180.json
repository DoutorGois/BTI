     "AB": "Previous studies have shown that acoustic trauma can disrupt the firing of place cells in the hippocampus and also inhibit hippocampal neurogenesis, suggesting that such trauma might impair spatial memory. In this study, we investigated performance in the alternating T maze and Morris water maze of rats exposed to acoustic trauma (16 kHz, 110 dB SPL pure tone for 1 h), who had elevated auditory brainstem response thresholds and the psychophysical attributes of tinnitus (using a conditioned lick suppression task). To our surprise, we found that rats with tinnitus did not perform significantly differently from sham control animals in either the alternating T maze task or any aspect of the reference or working memory versions of the Morris water maze task except for a faster acquisition in T maze alternation. These results suggest that acoustic trauma and tinnitus may not impair spatial memory in rats.",
