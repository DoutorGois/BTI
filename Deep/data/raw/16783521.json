     "AB": "The spike activity of hippocampal field CA3 neurons was studied in rats avoiding (group A) and not avoiding (group E) the cries of a victim partner in the emotional resonance test. The frequencies of neuron discharges were compared in animals in the state of hunger, after satiation, and on exposure to emotionally positive and negative intracerebral electrical stimulation. The results showed that intracortical electrical stimulation produced increases in the discharge activity of neurons and that this activation was more marked for emotionally positive stimulation. Rats of group E showed asymmetry in their neuron responses to emotional stimulation on the right and left sides of the hippocampus. Left-sided cell activation was significantly greater than right-sided and was independent of the emotional sign of the stimulus. This asymmetry was not seen in rats of group A.",
