     "AB": "A technique has been developed to record from 16 different brain sites of the freely moving rat using subminiature MOSFET preamplifiers. The high input impedance, small size, durability and light weight of the amplifiers and connecting cable allows high quality multisite recording of field potentials and unit activity. In addition, a movable headstage for positioning multiple microelectrodes is described. The compact recording system permits one to construct neocortical EEG maps, instant depth profiles of evoked and spontaneous field data, and to study neuronal synchrony of distant cell populations.",
