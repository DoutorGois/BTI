     "AB": "Isoforms of ankyrin (ankyrinR) are expressed in both the erythrocyte and the brain. Four cDNAs representing regulatory domains of ankyrinR expressed in the rat spleen and brain were cloned and sequenced. These different cDNAs were found to result from tissue-specific alternative mRNA processing of the ankyrinR regulatory domain. One of the isolated cDNAs was used to develop an antibody to brain isoforms of ankyrinR, and this antibody was used to study the localization of ankyrinR in the rat brain. The protein was found to be widely expressed in neurons of the metencephalon but limited to a discrete subset of neurons in the rat forebrain. In the thalamus and areas of the basal ganglia, these neurons were grouped in defined nuclei, whereas in the cortex, hippocampus, and caudate putamen they appeared as isolated cells distributed randomly throughout these structures. A similar study using an antibody raised against erythrocyte spectrin (beta R) showed a comparable localization to that of ankyrinR. Both proteins were expressed late in the developing rat brain, as part of the maturation stage of neural development. These data suggest a specific role for these erythrocyte structural proteins in the postmitotic development of a subset of neurons in the rat brain.",
