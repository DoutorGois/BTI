     "AB": "OBJECT: Recently, two different cyclooxygenase (COX) genes, COX-1 and -2, were identified. In this study, topographic and chronological profiles of COX-2 messenger (m)RNA and c-fos mRNA expression were investigated using in situ hybridization after focal cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Rats undergoing permanent ischemia were decapitated at 30 and 90 minutes and at 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, and rats undergoing transient ischemia were decapitated at 4, 8, and 24 hours after MCA occlusion that lasted for either 30 or 90 minutes. After brief transient MCA occlusion, c-fos mRNA was induced in the whole MCA territory, adjacent cortex (cingulate cortex), and distant brain regions such as the hippocampus and substantia nigra. In contrast, COX-2 mRNA was not induced in the ischemic core (lateral striatum) but only in the penumbral area (MCA cortex). Long transient and permanent MCA occlusion did not induce c-fos and COX-2 mRNAs in the ischemic core but strongly induced both mRNAs in the penumbral area (medial striatum and periphery of MCA cortex) and adjacent cortex (cingulate cortex). In brain regions distant from the ischemic territory, although c-fos mRNA was induced in the thalamus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus after extended transient and permanent occlusion, COX-2 mRNA was only induced in the bilateral hippocampi. The induction of COX-2 mRNA persisted in all locations even at 24 hours after MCA occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of COX-2 mRNA induction was apparently different from that of c-fos mRNA after MCA occlusion. These results pertaining to COX-2 mRNA agree well with the previous observations of changes in prostaglandin metabolism induced by focal cerebral ischemia. However, whether this induction of the COX-2 gene contributes to the histopathological outcome of cerebral ischemia remains to be elucidated.",
