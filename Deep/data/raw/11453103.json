     "AB": "The aim of the study was to determine the effect of chronic vasospasm after SAH on angiogenesis and the effect of endothelin-1, the main causative factor in vasospasm, on this process. Male Wistar rats, 220-250 g, were examined. Seven days after cannulation of the cisterna magna (CM), a 100 microl dose of non-heparinized blood was administered to induce SAH. Sham SAH (aSAH) was induced by intracisternal injection of 100 microl of artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Endothelin receptor antagonist BQ-123 in a dose of 40 nmol in 50 microl of cerebrospinal fluid was given three times: 20 min. before SAH and aSAH, 60 min and 24 hours after SAH and aSAH. The same pattern of BQ-123 administration was used in the nonSAH group. The brains were removed 48 hours later for histological evaluation. Vascular surface density was measured in cerebral hemisphere sections (at the level of the dorsal part of the hippocampus) and brain stem sections (1/2 of the pons). An increase in angiogenesis was observed after SAH, compared to control values. The administration of BQ-123, a specific endothelin receptor blocker inhibits angiogenesis in cerebral hemispheres after SAH.",
