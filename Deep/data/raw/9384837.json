     "AB": "Postmortem, magnetic resonance, and event-related potential studies suggest the presence of temporal lobe abnormalities in schizophrenia. Analyses using convergent measurements of brain structure and function, however, have rarely been done in the same patients. We recently developed a protocol using high-spatial-resolution magnetic resonance scans, auditory P300 event-related potentials, and thought disorder scales to examine temporal lobe structure and function in the same patients. We report a case of schizophrenia that showed left-lateralized volume reduction in the superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus (also on right), with associated P300 amplitude reduction and thought disorder marked by word-finding difficulties and perseverations.",
