     "AB": "The binding of [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate ( [3H] QNB) to muscarinic cholinergic receptors in dentate gyrus of rat hippocampal formation was analyzed by membrane binding assay and in vitro autoradiography. The destruction of dentate granule cells, either by neonatal irradiation or colchicine injection, resulted in nearly complete elimination of [3H] QNB binding sites in the molecular and granule cell layers. By contrast, neither perforant path transection nor destruction of the septal-hippocampal cholinergic afferents caused a decline of [3H] QNB binding sites. Amygdala kindled seizures resulted in a 30% reduction of [3H] QNB binding sites which was distributed uniformly across the entire molecular and granule cell layers. Thus, most, if not all, of the muscarinic cholinergic receptors present in dentate gyrus appear to reside on the somata and dendritic trees of the dentate granule cells. We propose that this kindled seizure-induced decline of muscarinic receptors represents an endogenous compensatory mechanism designed to stabilize granule cell excitability.",
