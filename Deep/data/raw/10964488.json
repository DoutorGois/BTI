     "AB": "Our group has reported on the cloning of a novel rat neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor involved in NPY-induced food intake, the Y5 receptor. The distribution in rat brain of the mRNA encoding this receptor has been determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry, using radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes. Control experiments were carried out in cell lines transfected with either rat Y1 or rat Y5 cDNAs. With the exception of the cerebellum, only the antisense probes yielded hybridization signal in rat brain tissue sections. A number of brain regions contained hybridization signals indicative of Y5 mRNA localization. Chief among these were various hypothalamic nuclei, including the medial preoptic nucleus, the supraoptic nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus, and the lateral hypothalamus. Other regions with substantial hybridization signals included the midline thalamus, parts of the amygdala and hippocampus, and some midbrain and brain-stem nuclei. In general a low density of Y5 mRNA was observed in most cortical structures, with the exception of the cingulate and retrosplenial cortices, each of which contained a moderate abundance of Y5 hybridization signal. The distribution of this receptor mRNA is consistent with a role for the Y5 receptor in food intake and also suggests involvement in other processes mediated by NPY.",
