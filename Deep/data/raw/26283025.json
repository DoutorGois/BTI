     "AB": "Bisabolol is a plant-derived monocyclic sesquiterpene alcohol with antinociceptive and antiinflammatory actions. However, molecular targets mediating these effects of bisabolol are poorly understood. In this study, using a two-electrode voltage-clamp and patch-clamp techniques and live cellular calcium imaging, we have investigated the effect of bisabolol on the function of human alpha7 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in Xenopus oocytes, interneurons of rat hippocampal slices. We have found that bisabolol reversibly and concentration dependently (IC50 = 3.1 muM) inhibits acetylcholine (ACh)-induced alpha7 receptor-mediated currents. The effect of bisabolol was not dependent on the membrane potential. Bisabolol inhibition was not changed by intracellular injection of the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA and perfusion with Ca(2+)-free solution containing Ba(2+), suggesting that endogenous Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) channels are not involved in bisabolol actions. Increasing the concentrations of ACh did not reverse bisabolol inhibition. Furthermore, the specific binding of [(125)I] alpha-bungarotoxin was not attenuated by bisabolol. Choline-induced currents in CA1 interneurons of rat hippocampal slices were also inhibited with IC50 of 4.6 muM. Collectively, our results suggest that bisabolol directly inhibits alpha7-nAChRs via a binding site on the receptor channel.",
