     "AB": "Intraperitoneal injection of alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (alpha-FMH; 200 mg/kg), a specific inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase produced a severe depletion of neocortical and hippocampal histamine 3 h later as determined by a radioenzymatic assay. This treatment had no obvious effect on either low voltage fast activity (LVFA) in the neocortex or on rhythmical slow activity (RSA) in the hippocampus during an 8 h recording period during the rats' light cycle. Scopolamine-sensitive LVFA, scopolamine-resistant LVFA and scopolamine-resistant hippocampal RSA all appeared unaffected. This suggests that any contribution histamine makes to electrocortical activation is probably indirect, acting via other transmitter systems.",
