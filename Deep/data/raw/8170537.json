     "AB": "Transforming growth factor-beta 1 was studied as a possible regulator of messenger RNAs in astrocytes and neurons that increase after hippocampal deafferentation by perforant path transection: tubulin alpha 1, clusterin and glial fibrillary acidic protein messenger RNA. Because transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger RNA is increased after this lesion, we examined which messenger RNA lesion responses could be induced by transforming growth factor-beta 1 alone. Porcine transforming growth factor-beta 1 infused into the lateral ventricle elevated the messenger RNAs for tubulin alpha 1, clusterin and glial fibrillary acidic protein 24 h after infusion in the ipsilateral hippocampus. As assayed by nuclear run-on, the transcription of glial fibrillary acidic protein RNA was increased in the ipsilateral hippocampus after perforant path transection and in primary rat astrocyte cultures by transforming growth factor-beta 1. In contrast, transforming growth factor-beta 1 did not change apolipoprotein-E messenger RNA or transcription, or growth associated protein-43 messenger RNA levels. We conclude that transforming growth factor-beta 1 increases subsets of neuronal and astrocyte messenger RNAs coding for cytoskeletal proteins that are also elevated in response to experimental lesions and Alzheimer's disease. This suggests that transforming growth factor-beta 1 might be a local organizing factor of neuronal and astrocyte responses to brain injury.",
