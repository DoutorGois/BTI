     "AB": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are structurally related survival and differentiation factors for distinct sets of peripheral and central neurons. The regulation of NGF gene expression has been extensively studied in L929 mouse fibroblasts. L929 cells also express the BDNF gene. Northern blot hybridization analysis revealed 4 discrete BDNF mRNA species in L929 cells and rat hippocampus after induction of seizures with kainic acid. Serum as well as 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulated NGF and all 4 BDNF mRNAs in L929 cells. Treatment with both agents induced NGF mRNA to a much larger extent than the BDNF mRNAs. The induction of the BDNF mRNAs was rapid, with nearly maximal levels by 1 hr. In contrast, NGF mRNA induction occurred later and peaked at 4-6 hr. Both NGF and BDNF mRNA induction were inhibited by actinomycin D. Cycloheximide, on the other hand, inhibited only NGF but not BDNF mRNA induction. Corticosterone rapidly decreased NGF mRNA but not the BDNF mRNAs, and had no effect on seizure-induced NGF or BDNF mRNAs. Forskolin did not stimulate NGF or BDNF mRNAs. In contrast to NGF mRNA, forskolin did not interfere with the serum induction of BDNF mRNAs. These results demonstrate that 2 genes which encode closely related neurotrophic factors are differentially regulated in L929 cells. The molecular mechanisms which bring about this differential regulation remain to be elucidated.",
