     "AB": "We analysed AMPA ionotropic receptor subunits at the mRNA level (GluR-1 to -4) and at the protein level (GluR-1 and GluR-2/3/4c) in \"primary astroglial cultures\" (non-neuronal cell cultures highly enriched in glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] positive cells) prepared from newborn rat cerebral hemispheres, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum and in \"brain non-neuronal cell cultures\" (low percentage of GFAP positive cells) prepared from cerebellum, brainstem, mesencephalon, and hypothalamus. For comparison, we also determined AMPA subunit mRNA and protein levels in different brain regions. By Northern blot analysis mRNAs for the AMPA receptor subunits (GluR-1,-2,-3,-4) were detected in primary rat cerebral hemispheres astroglial cultures. Immunoblotting analysis with anti-GluR-1 and anti-GluR-2/3/4c polyclonal antibodies confirmed the presence of low level of immunoreactive proteins of the same size of those identified in vivo as GluR subunits. Expression of GluR genes varied depending on the brain area used as starting material for the preparation of the cultures: GluR-1, -2, and -3 were mainly expressed in cortical cultures, while GluR-4 expression predominated in brainstem derived cultures. Interestingly this pattern of expression correlates with that observed in the intact brain, where high levels of GluR-4 mRNA and low levels of the other GluR subunits were found in the brainstem. In conclusion our results confirm the existence of glutamate ionotropic receptors of the AMPA type in primary astroglial cultures and suggest that GluR-4 is the main AMPA receptor subunit expressed in non-neuronal cells of the central nervous system.",
