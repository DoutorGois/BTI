     "AB": "Thyroid hormones (THs) exert a broad spectrum of effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Hypothyroidism, especially during CNS development, can lead to structural and functional changes (mostly resulting in mental retardation). The hippocampus is considered as one of the most important CNS structures, while the investigation and understanding of its direct and indirect interactions with the THs could provide crucial information on the neurobiological basis of the (frequently-faced in clinical practice) hypothyroidism-induced mental retardation and neurobehavioral dysfunction. THs-deficiency during the fetal and/or the neonatal period produces deleterious effects for neural growth and development (such as reduced synaptic connectivity, delayed myelination, disturbed neuronal migration, deranged axonal projections, decreased synaptogenesis and alterations in neurotransmitters' levels). On the other hand, the adult-onset thyroid dysfunction is usually associated with neurological and behavioural abnormalities. In both cases, genomic and proteomic changes seem to occur. The aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date synopsis of the available knowledge regarding the aforementioned alterations that take place in the hippocampus due to fetal-, neonatal- or adult-onset hypothyroidism.",
