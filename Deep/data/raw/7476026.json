     "AB": "The distribution of AMPA-selective subunits, GluR1-4, was determined in the human hippocampus and cerebellum by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. In the hippocampus, in situ hybridization revealed that GluR1 and GluR2 mRNAs were similarly distributed and highly expressed in the dentate gyrus, with lower levels in the CA regions. GluR3 and GluR4 mRNAs were expressed at very low levels. Immunocytochemical studies showed that GluR1- and GluR2/3-immunoreactivity were highest in the dentate molecular and granular layers. In the CA regions, GluR1 and GluR2/3 staining was observed in pyramidal cell bodies and surrounding neuropil and was more intense in CA4/3/2 compared with CA1. GluR4-immunoreactivity was low throughout the hippocampus. In the cerebellum, GluR1 and GluR4 transcripts were expressed in the granular and Purkinje cell/Bergmann glia layers. GluR2 mRNA was highly expressed in the granular layer and individual Purkinje cells, while GluR3 mRNA was not detectable in the cerebellum. GluR1- and GluR4-immunoreactivity were localized to Purkinje cells and putative Bergmann glia, as well as their processes extending into the molecular layer. GluR2/3 staining was intense in Purkinje cells, with moderate staining in the granular layer. Thus, GluR1-4 subunits are differentially distributed in the hippocampus and cerebellum. In addition, the distribution of subunit mRNA and protein correlate well with each other and with the glutamatergic neuroanatomy of the hippocampus and cerebellum.",
