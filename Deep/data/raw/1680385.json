     "AB": "It seems self-evident that changes in the cellular synaptic function of the brain must underlie the formation and storage of cognitive memories. Because it has been identified as a brain area important in the formation of memory, the hippocampus has been a focus in the study of such synaptic changes. An activity-induced increase in hippocampal synaptic efficacy, known as long-term potentiation (LTP), has been widely studied as a potential substrate for memory. This paper briefly reviews some of the significant progress that has been made in understanding the cellular mechanisms that underlie LTP, including recent experiments dealing with its synaptic locus, or the question of whether the mechanism regulating LTP is pre- or postsynaptic.",
