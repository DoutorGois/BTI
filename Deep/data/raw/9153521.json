     "AB": "Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dementia and spinocerebellar degeneration. Recently, part of the gene responsible for this disorder was cloned containing a CAG repeat, and predominant neuronal expression of the gene was proved only through Northern blot analysis in rats. In this study, we investigated the regional and cellular expression of the dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy gene in the central nervous system of normal and affected humans, as well as in rat brains. In normal control human subjects, the gene messenger RNA was present in all brain regions examined, with the highest levels seen in the cerebellum, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and pontine nuclei. Its expression in the striatum, globus pallidus, and cerebral cortex was intermediate. The gene was expressed predominantly in neurons; a low but significant level of expression was also seen in glial cells. Neurons susceptible to degeneration in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy did not selectively express high or low levels of its gene messenger RNA. In brains affected by the disorder, the distribution and levels of gene messenger RNA were comparable to those of the normal controls in all the areas. In the rat brains, gene messenger RNA expression was very similar to that in human brain. It was also expressed predominantly in neurons, while low-level expression was observed in glial cells. It is apparent from these results that the presence of expanded trinucleotide repeats in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy does not result in the absence of its gene messenger RNA expression or in altered patterns or levels of expression.",
