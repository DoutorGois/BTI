     "AB": "The determination of the physiological role of glutamatergic metabotropic actions has been hampered by the lack of potent and specific antagonists. It has recently been reported that 4C3HPG (RS-4-carboxy-3-hydroxyphenylglycine) can antagonize metabotropic responses in the central nervous system. The effects of 4C3HPG on metabotropic responses evoked by trans-ACPD were investigated in CA3 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slice cultures. Our results show that in hippocampus 4C3HPG fails to antagonize responses mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors.",
