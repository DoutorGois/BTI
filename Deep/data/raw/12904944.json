     "AB": "A method to measure catechol- O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity using high performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection with norepinephrine (NE) as a natural substrate was optimized for both soluble (S-) and membrane-bound (MB-) COMT activities in rat brain areas, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, brain stem, hypophysis, and hypothalamus. The highest S-COMT activity in Sprague-Dawley rat brain was found in hippocampus. MB-COMT activities in all brain areas were about 3-8 times lower than S-COMT activities. However, considering Vmax/ Km values, specificity constants for NE to S- and MB-COMT contributes mainly to the metabolism of NE in cerebral cortex and cerebellum.",
