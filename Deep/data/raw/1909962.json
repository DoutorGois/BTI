     "AB": "Previous work has demonstrated that arginine vasopressin (AVP), acting in the CNS, can maintain functional tolerance to ethanol. We now show that the AVP metabolite peptide, [pGlu4,Cyt6]arginine vasopressin-(4-9), also maintains ethanol tolerance, with a potency similar to that of arginine vasopressin, while nerve growth factor has only a marginal effect. The effects of these peptides on ethanol tolerance correlate with their previously described ability to induce expression of the proto-oncogene, c-fos, in the septum, a putative mechanism underlying peptide effects on neuroadaptive processes.",
