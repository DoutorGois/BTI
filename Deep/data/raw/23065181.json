     "AB": "The protective effect of the mild hypoxia to the epilepsy has been widely tested. Although it is found that the hypoxia protects the brain by up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, few focused on systematic comparisons between different mild hypoxia manipulations and their effects. The male Sprague-Dawley rats were observed following exposure to hypoxia before and after epilepsy for 3 days with 90 min per day. The effects of different mild hypoxia manipulations on kainic acid-induced epilepsy were compared from the perspective of morphology, molecular biology and behavioral test. Results showed that different mild hypoxia manipulations could inhibit the cell apoptosis of kainic acid-induced rat hippocampus and improve their physiological functions. The effect of preconditioning group was better than that of postconditioning group and that of preconditioning and postconditioning with mild hypoxia group was the best among all the groups. The result showed that the preconditioning and postconditioning of mild hypoxia was recommended pre- and post-epilepsy and exposure to mild hypoxia should be prolonged. These findings might provide new ideas and methods for the clinical treatment of epilepsy.",
