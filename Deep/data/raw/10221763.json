     "AB": "The phosphorylation of substrate proteins by protein kinases plays a key role in signal transduction and function of neurons. Protein kinases have been associated with several physiological and pathological states including depression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of imipramine and electroconvulsive treatment (ECS), both clinically effective treatments of depression, on the activity of calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaM-KII) in the hippocampus. Our results indicate that repeated (but not acute) imipramine and ECS administration significantly decreased CaM-KII activity by 65 and 70%, respectively, in the soluble fractions from hippocampus. This decreased enzyme activity was accompanied by a proportional decrease (60-70%) of the amount of a-CaM-KII in the same fraction. A single and repeated administration of imipramine produced a significant increase in the activity of CaM-KII (50 and 337%, respectively) in the particulate fraction from hippocampus. Similarly, a single and repeated ECS produced an increase in the enzyme activity by 22 and 240%, respectively. The amount of a-CaM-KII in the particulate fraction was not significantly affected by repeated antidepressant administration. It is postulated that changes in CaM-KII activity following chronic antidepressant treatment might represent and important step in expression of its antidepressive action.",
