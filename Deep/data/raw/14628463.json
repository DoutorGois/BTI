     "AB": "The central feature of drug addiction is compulsive drug use--loss of control over apparently voluntary acts of drug seeking and drug taking. Drug addiction, as a chronic brain disease, may result from abnormal engagement of long-term associative memory. Addiction and memory are likely to share much in common in the aspects of neural adaptations, synaptic plasticity, and related molecular mechanisms. This paper reviews the possible roles of learning mechanisms in the development of relapse, sensitization, and drug addiction, abnormal associative learning and compulsive behavior, addiction memory and addiction, multiple memory systems and the development of addiction, and emphasize the importance of synaptic plasticity and addiction memory in drug addiction. Addiction is characterized by the involvement of specific learning patterns of information. Addiction is closely related to the disorder of associate learning that depends on dopamine. Hippocampus may play a key role in addiction. At last, we put forward the future directions for research.",
