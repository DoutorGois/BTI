     "AB": "Doses of sufentanil (i.e., 0.01, 0.04, 0.16, 0.63, 2.5, 10, and 40 micrograms/rat) were injected either into the lumbar epidural space or intravenously in rats weighing +/- 250 g, and in vivo pharmacologic activities (i.e., prolongation of latency to tail withdrawal in response to noxious heat, blockade of cornea and pinna reflexes, increase of skeletal muscle tone), ex vivo mu-opiate receptor binding (i.e., displacement of specific 3H-sufentanil binding in thalamus, striatum, hippocampus, cortex, mamillary body-medulla oblongata segment, medulla oblongata, and in cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord), and drug concentrations in plasma, brain, cortex, and cerebellum, were determined. An ED50 dose of intravenous sufentanil of 0.075 micrograms/rat produced analgesia. CNS-mediated in vivo side effects (i.e., blockade of pinna and cornea reflexes, muscle rigidity) were apparent at 6-28 times higher doses. Epidural sufentanil also produced analgesia at an ED50 dose of 0.08 micrograms/rat, but CNS-mediated side effects occurred only at 35 to 76 times higher doses. This greater in vivo selectivity of epidural sufentanil in producing analgesia was consistent with ex vivo binding data that showed that in most areas of brain, but not in spinal cord, more mu-opiate binding occurs with intravenous than with epidural sufentanil. The two routes nonetheless differed by no more than a factor of approximately two in producing detectable levels of sufentanil both in plasma and in brain tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
