     "AB": "We studied expression of the 5-HT(1A) receptor in cortical and limbic areas of the brain of the tree shrew. In situ hybridization with a receptor-specific probe and immunocytochemistry with various antibodies was used to identify distinct neurons expressing the receptor. In vitro receptor autoradiography with (3)H-8-OH-DPAT ((3)H-8-hydroxy-2-[di-n-propylamino]tetralin) was performed to visualize receptor-binding sites. In the prefrontal, insular, and occipital cortex, 5-HT(1A) receptor mRNA was expressed in pyramidal neurons of layer 2, whereas (3)H-8-OH-DPAT labeled layers 1 and 2 generating a columnar-like pattern in the prefrontal and occipital cortex. In the striate and ventral occipital cortex, receptor mRNA was present within layers 5 and 6 in pyramidal neurons and Meynert cells. Pyramid-like neurons in the claustrum and anterior olfactory nucleus also expressed the receptor. Principal neurons in hippocampal region CA1 expressed 5-HT(1A) receptor mRNA, and (3)H-8-OH-DPAT labeled both the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum. CA3 pyramidal neurons displayed low 5-HT(1A) receptor expression, whereas granule neurons in the dentate gyrus revealed moderate expression of this receptor. In the amygdala, large pyramid-like neurons in the basal magnocellular nucleus strongly expressed the receptor. Immunocytochemistry with antibodies against parvalbumin, calbindin, and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) provided no evidence for 5-HT(1A) receptor expression in GABAergic neurons in cortical and limbic brain areas. Our data agree with previous findings showing that the 5-HT(1A) receptor mediates the modulation of glutamatergic neurons. Expression in the limbic and cortical areas suggested an involvement of 5-HT(1A) receptors in emotional and cognitive processes.",
