     "AB": "Accumulating evidence suggests that the cannabinoids exert their action to reduce the turnover rate of acetylcholine in the hippocampus by an action in the septum via inhibitory gamma-butyric acid (GABA) containing interneurons. In the studies presented here administration of the potent dimethylheptyl derivative of (-)-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol, which has previously been shown to reduce the turnover rate of acetylcholine in the hippocampus, reduces the turnover rate of GABA in the septum. A simple model in which cannabinoids transsynaptically activate inhibitory GABAergic septal neurons impinging on cholinergic septal neurons does not explain the data. A more complex model suggesting that inhibitory GABAergic septal interneurons innervate other inhibitory GABAergic septal interneurons has been hypothesized.",
