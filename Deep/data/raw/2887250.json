     "AB": "The present study provides evidence for the presence of an endogenous ligand for the phencyclidine (PCP) receptor of mammalian brain. Partially purified bovine hippocampal extracts potently and dose dependently inhibit binding to PCP receptors of [3H]N-(1-[2-thienyl]-cyclohexyl)piperidine (TCP), a highly potent and specific ligand of PCP receptors. In addition to demonstrating PCP-like binding properties, the partially purified extract mimics biological actions of PCP upon neurotransmitter release. HPLC fractions active in the [3]TCP binding assay, by contrast to fractions inactive in the binding assay, potently elicited stimulation of spontaneous acetylcholine and dopamine efflux and inhibited NMDA-stimulated release of acetylcholine and dopamine. The transmitter release assay provides validation of a PCP-like physiological activity exerted by bovine hippocampal extracts partially purified by HPLC.",
