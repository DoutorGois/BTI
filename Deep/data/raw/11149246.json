     "AB": "The phenomenon of delayed neuronal death in CA1 neurons following brief duration of global ischemia has eluded definitive explanation. Using a differential display technique, we examined changes in expression of mRNAs in the hippocampus following 5-min cerebral ischemia in Mongolian gerbils. Under pentobarbital anesthesia, gerbils were sacrificed by decapitation at 6 h (n = 20) and 2 days (n = 20) after ischemia, and sham-operated gerbils (n = 20) were sacrificed at 6 h after surgery. Total RNA was isolated from the hippocampal samples in each group for the differential display analysis. The mRNAs were classified into three patterns; gradual disappearance, decrease and recovery, and new appearance. Representative mRNAs in three patterns were subcloned and sequenced partly. An mRNA in the gradual disappearance pattern showed homologous with neuronal pentraxin. In situ hybridization and Northern blot analyses of neuronal pentraxin revealed the gradual disappearance pattern. An mRNA in the decrease and recovery pattern showed homologous with 14-3-3 protein gamma-subtype, and an mRNA in the new appearance pattern showed no homology in the data base. The differential display analysis is a useful technique with which to investigate changes in expression of mRNAs following transient cerebral ischemia. The novel mRNA may be involved in the treatment of cerebral ischemia. Further studies are necessary for this point.",
