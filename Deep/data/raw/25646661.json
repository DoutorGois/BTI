     "AB": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critically important in both normal neuronal development and neurological diseases. Although cerebral ischemia has been shown to alter the miRNA profiles of rats, the role of miRNA in the cornu ammonis 1 region of the gerbil hippocampus under ischemic tolerance has not been studied. In the present study, Mongolian gerbils were subjected to one or three times the nonlethal dose of 2-min transient common carotid artery occlusion (tCCAO). miRNA microarray technology detected 251 miRNAs and the expression of seven of these in terms of ischemic tolerance. They were compared at different time points: 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months. mmu-miR-15a-5p, related to neurogenesis, showed increased expression after one dose of 2-min tCCAO and was much higher after three doses. An increase in sha-miR-24 and oan-let-7b-3p, related to transactivation response DNA-binding protein (TDP43), was observed after one dose of 2-min tCCAO, but the peak was accelerated to an earlier period of reperfusion after three doses. In contrast, mmu-miR-125b-5p and mmu-miR-132-5p, related to fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS), showed similar increases at both doses. mmu-miR-181c-5p and mmu-miR-378a-5p, related to heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), also showed accelerated expression after three doses. This data set provides new insight about miRNA expression during neurogenesis, and related to TDP43, FUS/TLS, and HSP70, which may be useful when pursuing further studies on the possible use of miRNAs as biomarkers in cerebral ischemic tolerance and neuroregeneration.",
