     "AB": "Hippocampal slices were incubated in the presence of [32P]P1, and protein phosphorylation was examined by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Incubation for at least 30 min with 300 muCi of [32P)P1/brain slice gave rise to the phosphorylation of 8-10 protein bands. Most of these bands showed enhanced phosphorylation in response to noradrenaline. The basal phosphorylation of kainic acid-pretreated hippocampal slices was enhanced two- to threefold compared with controls. There was also an additional increase in kainic acid-pretreatment slices in the response to noradrenaline. 8-Br-Cyclic AMP and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as papaverine or isobutylmethylxanthine, had no effect on the phosphorylation patterns.",
