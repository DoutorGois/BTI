     "AB": "Glutathione serves the function of providing reducing equivalents for the maintenance of oxidant homeostasis, and besides it plays roles in intra- and intercellular signaling in the brain. Our purpose was to test the effects of depleting tissue glutathione by diethylmaleate (5.3 mmol/kg, intraperitoneal) on brain antioxidant metabolism, nerve growth factor levels, and cognitive performance in rats. Six hours after the treatment, glutathione level in the hippocampus dropped down to 30% of the mean value of vehicle-treated animals and glutathione peroxidase activity also declined. Twenty-four hours after the injection the values had been partially restored. Moreover, the hippocampal and cortical levels of nerve growth factor protein did not change in response to diethylmaleate treatment. Glutathione depletion did not influence the performance of animals in the step-through passive avoidance test, but impairs acquisition in the Morris water maze when given before training. However, when diethylmaleate was administered after acquisition in the same paradigm, it did not affect the retention tested at the following day. Our results suggest that glutathione status is important during acquisition, but not for retention, of spatial memory in maze tasks and they support the hypothesis of the oxidant/antioxidant equilibrium as a key piece acting in the regulation of brain function.",
