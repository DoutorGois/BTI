     "AB": "1. The effects of 2, 8 and 21 day oral treatment with the specific gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) inhibitors gamma-vinyl GABA (GVG) and ethanolamine O-sulphate (EOS) on brain GABA levels, GABA-T activity, and basal and stimulated GABA release from rat cross-chopped brain hippocampal slices was investigated. 2. Treatment with GABA-T inhibitors lead to a reduction in brain GABA-T activity by 65-80% compared with control values, with a concomitant increase in brain GABA content of 40-100%. 3. Basal hippocampal GABA release was increased to 250-450% of control levels following inhibition of GABA-T activity. No Ca2+ dependence was observed in either control or treated tissues. 4. GVG and EOS administration led to a significant elevation in the potassium stimulated release of GABA from cross-chopped hippocampal slices compared with that of controls. Although stimulated GABA release from control tissues was decreased in the presence of a low Ca2+ medium, GVG and EOS treatment abolished this Ca2+ dependency. 5. GABA compartmentalization, Na+ and Cl- coupled GABA uptake carriers and glial release may provide explanations for the loss of the Ca2+ dependency of stimulated GABA release observed following GVG and EOS treatment. 6. Administration of GABA-T inhibitors led to increases in both basal and stimulated hippocampal GABA release. However, it is not clear which is the most important factor in the anticonvulsant activity of these drugs, the increased GABA content 'leaking' out of neurones and glia leading to widespread inhibition, or the increase in stimulated GABA release which may occur following depolarization caused by an epileptic discharge.",
