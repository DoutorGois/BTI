     "AB": "The distribution of creatine kinase BB-isoenzyme in the human central nervous system (CNS) was investigated immunohistochemically and the findings were compared with the distributions of tubulin and astroprotein. Creatine kinase BB-isoenzyme existed both in neurons and astrocytes, and was universally distributed within the CNS. Tubulin was visualized only in the neuronal elements, namely perikarya, dendrites and axons, while astroprotein was exclusively visualized in astrocytes. A combination of immunohistochemistry for structural and soluble proteins may be a useful tool for the investigation of pathophysiological conditions within the CNS.",
