     "AB": "The effect of alloxan-induced diabetes was studied on the activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO), the oxidative deaminating enzyme of monoamine neurotransmitters. MAO was assayed from discrete brain regions like medial preoptic area and median eminence--arcuate region of hypothalamus, septum, amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus, pons and medulla. In all these areas studied, the induction of diabetes resulted in significant increase in MAO activity at 3, 8, 15 and 28 day intervals, whereas, the treatment of diabetic rats with insulin led to recovery in the enzyme activity. Blood glucose levels increased significantly after induction of diabetes and the recovery was seen after insulin treatment. These data suggest the involvement of MAO in diabetes associated alterations in physiological and endocrinological disorders.",
