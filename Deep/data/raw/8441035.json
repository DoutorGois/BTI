     "AB": "Protein kinase C plays a crucial role in signal transduction for a variety of biologically active substances which activates cellular functions and their proliferation. The actions are closely related to both normal and abnormal functions in the nervous system. Tumor-promoting phorbol esters can substitute for diacylglycerols which are important ligands that bind to protein kinase C. Three typical phorbol esters, phorbol 13-[1-11C]butyrate, phorbol 12,13-[1-11C]dibutyrate and 12-deoxyphorbol 13-isobutyrate-20-[1-11C]butyrate, were synthesized by using [11C]ethylketene with a high specific activity (186GBq/mumol). Their in vivo autoradiograms demonstrated a heterogenous distribution in rat brain. 12-deoxyphorbol 13-isobutyrate-20-[1-11C]butyrate was particularly suited for in vivo use due to its nontumor-promoting activity and its ready permeability to the blood-brain barrier. High optical density was observed in the cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. The in vivo binding properties of this compound to protein kinase C were confirmed by in vivo displacement studies with unlabeled 12-deoxyphorbol 13-isobutyrate-20-butyrate and unlabeled phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. This suggests that 12-deoxyphorbol 13-isobutyrate-20-[1-11C] butyrate has a specific binding affinity for protein kinase C.",
