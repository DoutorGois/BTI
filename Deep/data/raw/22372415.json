     "AB": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate the effect of hypobaric hypoxia (HH) on the function and expression of P2X receptors in rat hippocampus CA1 pyramidal cells. RESEARCH DESIGN: The functional changes of P2X receptors were investigated through the cell HH model and the expressional alterations of P2X receptors were observed through the animal HH model. METHODS AND PROCEDURE: P2X receptors mediated currents were recorded from the freshly dissociated CA1 pyramidal cells of 7-day-old SD rats by whole cell patch clamp recording. The expression and distribution of P2X receptors were observed through immunohistochemistry and western blot at HH 3-day and 7-day. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: In acute HH conditions, the amplitudes of ATP evoked peak currents were decreased compared to control. The immunohistochemistry and western blot results reflected there was no change in P2X receptors expression after 3 days HH injury, while P2X receptors expression was up-regulated in response to 7 days HH injury. CONCLUSIONS: These findings supported the possibility that the function of P2X receptors was sensitive to HH damage and long-term function decrease should result in the expression increase of P2X receptors.",
