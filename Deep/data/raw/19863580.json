     "AB": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) in both ventral hippocampi, alone and combined with a subeffective dose of antiepileptic drugs, during the status epilepticus (SE) induced by lithium-pilocarpine (LP). METHODS: Male Wistar rats, stereotactically implanted in both ventral hippocampi, were injected with pilocarpine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 h after lithium (3 mEq/kg) administration. One minute following pilocarpine injection, HFS (pulses of 60 mus width at 130 Hz at subthreshold intensities and applied during 3 h) was applied alone or combined with subeffective doses of antiepileptic drugs. RESULTS: HFS alone reduced the incidence of severe generalized seizures. This effect was not evident when HFS was combined with phenytoin (33.3 mg/kg, i.p.). HFS combined with diazepam (0.41 mg/kg, i.p.) or phenobarbital (10 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced the incidence of severe generalized seizures and mortality rate, and augmented the latency to first forelimb clonus, generalized seizure, and status epilepticus (SE). When combined with gabapentin (46 mg/kg, i.p.), HFS reduced the incidence of severe generalized seizures, enhanced latency to SE, and decreased mortality rate. DISCUSSION: Subeffective doses of antiepileptic drugs that increase the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission may represent a therapeutic tool to augment the HFS-induced anticonvulsant effects.",
