     "AB": "AIMS: Hypercholesterolemia is known to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and diet-induced hypercholesterolemia has been shown to accelerate amyloid pathology in animals. While growing evidence has shown that synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in AD is associated with intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta, the relationships between hypercholesterolemia, memory impairment, and intraneuronal Abeta remains unclear. The present study aims to clarify this association. MAIN METHODS: Transgenic mice expressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) harboring the Osaka (E693) mutation (APP(OSK)-Tg mice) were used. These mice exhibit intraneuronal Abeta oligomers and memory impairment from 8months of age. Five-month-old male APP(OSK)-Tg mice and non-Tg littermates were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 1 month to induce hypercholesterolemia. At 6 months of age, their cognitive function was evaluated by the Morris water maze. Intraneuronal Abeta, synaptic density, and tau phosphorylation were examined by immunohistochemistry. KEY FINDINGS: Serum and brain cholesterol levels were significantly higher in APP(OSK)-Tg mice and non-Tg littermates that were fed a high-cholesterol diet than in control mice that were fed normal chow, indicating that hypercholesterolemia was successfully induced. Hypercholesterolemic APP(OSK)-Tg mice, but not control APP(OSK)-Tg mice or hypercholesterolemic non-Tg littermates, exhibited impaired spatial reference memory, which was accompanied with intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta oligomers, reduced synaptophysin immunoreactivity, and abnormal tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus. Hypercholesterolemia-accelerated accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta oligomers was also observed in another model mouse, Tg2576. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that hypercholesterolemia accelerates intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta oligomers and subsequent synapse loss, resulting in memory impairment.",
