     "AB": "Numerous kinds of visual event challenge our ability to keep track of the objects that populate our visual environment from moment to moment. These include blinks, occlusion, shifting visual attention, and changes to object's visual and spatial properties over time. These visual events may lead to objects falling out of our visual awareness, but can also lead to unnoticed changes, such as undetected object replacements and positional exchanges. Current visual memory models do not predict which visual changes are likely to be the most difficult to detect. We examine the accuracy with which switches (where two objects exchange locations) and substitutions (where one or two objects are replaced) are detected. Inferior performance for one-object substitutions versus two-objects switches, along with superior performance for two-object substitutions versus two-object switches was found. Our results are interpreted in terms of object file theory, trade-offs between diffused and localized attention, and net visual change.",
