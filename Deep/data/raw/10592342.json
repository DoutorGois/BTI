We determined the oxygen consumption of single hippocampal slices or subfields applying high-resolution respirometry adapted for slice measurements and measured the redox state of mitochondrial NAD(P)H in single hippocampal slices by laser-excited fluorimetry. These methods allow the sensitive detection of two parameters of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation which depend on supply of substrates and respiratory chain function.",
