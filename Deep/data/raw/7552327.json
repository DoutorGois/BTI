     "AB": "Using a monoclonal antibody the translocation of the Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes alpha/beta was studied in hippocampal slices after stimulation of glutamate receptors or induction of long-term potentiation. In submerged slices preincubated for 60 min in a medium usually used in electrophysiological studies, cytosolic PKC was not detectable and the amount of membrane-associated enzyme was increased. The treatment of these slices with 10(-6) M phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate induced a time-dependent translocation of alpha/beta PKC from the membrane-associated into the membrane-inserted state. The glutamatergic agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate, quisqualate and trans-ACPD did not cause a membrane insertion of alpha/beta PKC as observed for the phorbol ester when applied alone or in combination. Furthermore, 2 min and 15 min after induction of LTP in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway the distribution of alpha/beta PKC between the two membrane fractions remained unchanged. An increase in the total amount of PKC immunoreactivity was measured immediately after tetanization (142.6% of controls). The data suggest that a membrane insertion of alpha/beta PKC is not a prerequisite for the LTP-induced increased phosphorylation of PKC substrates and that the enzyme might be recruited from a previously inactive pool.",
