     "AB": "Alcohol (EtOH) intoxication causes changes in the rodent brain gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAAR) subunit composition and function, playing a crucial role in EtOH withdrawal symptoms and dependence. Building evidence indicates that withdrawal from acute EtOH and chronic intermittent EtOH (CIE) results in decreased EtOH-enhanced GABAAR delta subunit-containing extrasynaptic and EtOH-insensitive alpha1betagamma2 subtype synaptic GABAARs but increased synaptic alpha4betagamma2 subtype, and increased EtOH sensitivity of GABAAR miniature postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) correlated with EtOH dependence. Here we demonstrate that after acute EtOH intoxication and CIE, upregulation of hippocampal alpha4betagamma2 subtypes, as well as increased cell-surface levels of GABAAR alpha2 and gamma1 subunits, along with increased alpha2beta1gamma1 GABAAR pentamers in hippocampal slices using cell-surface cross-linking, followed by Western blot and coimmunoprecipitation. One-dose and two-dose acute EtOH treatments produced temporal plastic changes in EtOH-induced anxiolysis or withdrawal anxiety, and the presence or absence of EtOH-sensitive synaptic currents correlated with cell surface peptide levels of both alpha4 and gamma1(new alpha2) subunits. CIE increased the abundance of novel mIPSC patterns differing in activation/deactivation kinetics, charge transfer, and sensitivity to EtOH. The different mIPSC patterns in CIE could be correlated with upregulated highly EtOH-sensitive alpha2betagamma subtypes and EtOH-sensitive alpha4betagamma2 subtypes. Naive alpha4 subunit knockout mice express EtOH-sensitive mIPSCs in hippocampal slices, correlating with upregulated GABAAR alpha2 (and not alpha4) subunits. Consistent with alpha2, beta1, and gamma1 subunits genetically linked to alcoholism in humans, our findings indicate that these new alpha2-containing synaptic GABAARs could mediate the maintained anxiolytic response to EtOH in dependent individuals, rat or human, contributing to elevated EtOH consumption.",
