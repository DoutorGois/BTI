     "AB": "In the present study, the distribution of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) isoforms in the hippocampus of the Mongolian gerbil and its association with different sequelae of spontaneous seizure were investigated to identify the roles of balance of GAD isoforms in the epileptogenesis and the recovery mechanisms in these animals. The GAD67/GAD65 ratio in the hippocampus of pre-seizure seizure sensitive (SS) gerbil was approximately 3.5-fold higher as compared to seizure resistant (SR) gerbil. Following seizure, this ratio shifted to the level of SR gerbils up to 12 h postical. Therefore, the mismatched GAD67/GAD65 ratio (imbalance of GAD isoform expressions) in the hippocampus of SS gerbil implies that GABAergic neurons may be highly activated in order to regulate the increased neuronal excitability. In addition, the alteration in this ratio after seizure may be the compensatory response for reduction of epileptic activity in this animal.",
