     "AB": "When rats were trained preoperatively with a three-panel runway task and were then exposed to 10-min ischemia by the method of 4-vessel occlusion, they showed no increase in the number of errors (attempts to pass through two incorrect panels of the three panel-gates at four choice points), having normal retention of memory performance learned before the ischemic insult. Next, we investigated the abilities of ischemic rats to acquire the three-panel runway task and to learn a subsequent reversal task, where the correct panel-gate locations were changed. Rats with 5-min ischemia exhibited performance as good as that of control rats, but rats exposed to 10- and 20-min ischemia showed more errors than control rats during 10 acquisition sessions and 5 subsequent reversal sessions, each of which (consisting of 6 trials) was given once a day. Marked neuronal degeneration was observed in the hippocampal CA1 sector from the rats with 10- and 20-min ischemia. Exposure to sublethal 5-min ischemia followed by 10-min ischemia at a 2-h interval had no effect on either the memory impairment during acquisition and reversal tests or the hippocampal CA1 damage. When rats were exposed to 5-min ischemia 2 days before lethal 10-min ischemia, they showed acquisition and subsequent reversal learning as good as that of control rats. Preconditioning with sublethal 5-min ischemia followed by 2 days of reperfusion also prevented the neuronal destruction of the hippocampal CA1 sector induced by 10-min ischemia. These findings suggest that postischemic hippocampal CA1 neuronal damage does not affect retention of spatial memory acquired before ischemia, but produces a significant impairment of acquisition and subsequent reversal learning. The present results also demonstrate that preconditioning with sublethal ischemia can develop tolerance to subsequent lethal ischemia to prevent the learning impairment related to the hippocampal CA1 neuronal damage.",
