     "AB": "The objective of this study was to determine the neuropathological correlates of regional medial temporal lobe volume measures on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in subjects with Lewy body dementia (LBD). Twenty-three autopsy-confirmed LBD cases with an MRI scan close to death (mean 1.5 years) were studied. MRI-based volumetric measures were calculated for total intracranial volume, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. Quantitative neuropathological analysis of plaques, tangles, and Lewy bodies were carried out in the same regions. Spearman's rho was used to examine correlations between MRI volumes and neuropathology measures and linear regression to assess the relationship between neuropathology and MRI volumes. A significant inverse correlation was observed between normalized amygdala volume and percent area of Lewy bodies in the amygdala (r = -0.461, p = 0.035). There were no other significant correlations between regional MRI volume and measures of neuropathology. Lewy body, but not Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology was associated with reduced amygdala volume in pathologically-verified LBD cases but neither Lewy body nor Alzheimer's disease pathology was associated with volume loss in the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex, suggesting other neuropathological factors account for atrophy in these structures in LBD.",
