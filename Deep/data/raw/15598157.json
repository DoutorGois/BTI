     "AB": "Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the hippocampal and amygdalar volumes of 60 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). An asymmetry quotient (AQ) was then used to calculate the asymmetry for each of the structures. A one-sample t test indicated that there was a population-level right hemisphere asymmetry for the hippocampus. There was no significant population-level asymmetry for the amygdala. An analysis of variance using sex and rearing history as between-group variables showed no significant main effects or interaction effects on the AQ scores; however, males were more strongly lateralized than females. Several of these findings are consistent with results found in the human literature.",
