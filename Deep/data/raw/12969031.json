     "AB": "Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that glucocorticoids have a profound influence on the survival of hippocampal neurones, and that the depletion of glucocorticoids as a result of adrenalectomy (ADX) reduces nerve growth factor levels in the hippocampus. It is also believed that ADX is associated with the seizure susceptibility of the Mongolian gerbil. In the present study, the choronological changes of c-jun immunoreactivity were investigated after ADX in the hippocampal formations in the seizure-prone gerbil model. In the sham hippocampus, c-jun immunoreactivity was not observed in the neurones of the hippocampus proper and dentate gyrus. C-jun immunoreactive neurones appeared 3 h after ADX in the neurones of the CA1 area and dentate gyrus, and these immunoreactivities peaked 24 h after ADX and then gradually decreased. These results suggest that, in the adrenalectomized gerbil, c-jun may be expressed in the neurones of the hippocampus in compensation for glucocorticoid deficit. The result of enhanced c-jun expression of the hippocampal formation provides anatomical support for the hypothesis that c-jun may play a role in the reduction of seizure activity.",
