     "AB": "Schizophrenia is conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental disorder in which developmental alterations in immature brain systems are not clear. Rats with neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions (NVHL) can exhibit schizophrenia-like behaviors, and these rats have been widely used to study the developmental mechanisms of schizophrenia. The nuclear restricted protein/brain (NRP/B) is a nuclear matrix protein that is critical for the normal development of the neuronal system. This study assessed the effect of NVHL induced by the administration of ibotenic acid on the protein expression of NRP/B in the hippocampus, cortex and striatum in pre- and post-pubertal rats. The expressions of NeuN in various developmental periods were assessed accordingly. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were administered ibotenic acid at postnatal day (PD) 7. Western blotting and an immunofluorescence staining analysis showed that the expression of NRP/B was significantly decreased in the hippocampus, cortex and striatum of the NVHL rats at PD14, 28 and 42. The expressions of NeuN were decreased accordingly. In vitro experiment showed the NRP/B knockdown can decrease the Tuj1 expression in cultured cortical neurons. The data suggest that NVHL induces a change in NRP/B expression that affects neurons in the developmental period.",
