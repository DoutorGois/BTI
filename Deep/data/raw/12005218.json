     "AB": "Fatty acid status in humans is usually related to plasma or red blood cell fatty acid profiles. The aim of the study was to explore whether a maternal deficiency in dietary essential fatty acids would differentially affect lipid fractions in several tissues of the offspring, including brain. Female Wistar rats were fed an essential fatty acid-deficient diet during 3 months before mating. The fatty acid composition of different lipid fractions was examined in maternal milk, and in plasma, red blood cells, liver, adipose tissue, cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the offspring using thin layer and capillary column gas chromatography. Lipid fractions from most tissues of deprived offspring showed a common fatty acid profile characterized by elevated 20:3 omega9/20:4 omega6 ratio, and decreased docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid. However, arachidonic acid was not affected in brain, even though 22:5 omega6 was increased in phospholipids of cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The present results demonstrate different degrees of resistance to essential fatty acid deficiency in lipid fractions and tissues. This suggests a priority distribution of arachidonic acid to preferential areas and shows that blood phospholipid fatty acids do not exactly reflect brain phospholipid status.",
