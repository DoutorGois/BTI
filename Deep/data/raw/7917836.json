     "AB": "Prolonged benzodiazepine treatment of rats results in anticonvulsant tolerance in vivo. Studies of in vitro hippocampal slices following 1 wk flurazepam administration show reduced GABA-mediated inhibition in the CA1 region, and a decrease in GABAA agonist and benzodiazepine potency to inhibit CA1 pyramidal cell-evoked responses. To investigate the molecular basis of benzodiazepine tolerance in the hippocampus, in situ hybridization techniques were used to evaluate the expression of the mRNAs for the alpha 1, alpha 5, and gamma 2 subunits of the GABAA receptor in the hippocampal formation and frontal cortex of chronic flurazepam-treated rats. A discretely localized decrease in alpha 1, but not alpha 5 or gamma 2 mRNA expression was found in the CA1 region (35-40%) and in layers II-III and IV of cortex (50-60%) 2 d after cessation of flurazepam treatment. The decrease in the expression of alpha 1 subunit mRNA in cortex is similar to that reported following other chronic benzodiazepine treatment regimens. This is the first report of a reduction in alpha 1 subunit mRNA expression in the hippocampal formation.",
