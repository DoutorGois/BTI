     "AB": "NKCC1 and KCC2 are encoded by slc12 gene family and involved in the maintenance of intracellular chloride concentration which may be associated with epileptogenesis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the long-term expression profiles of NKCC1 and KCC2 in CA1 region in the mice model of lithium-pilocarpine induced status epilepticus (PISE) and their relationship with epileptogenesis. We found NKCC1 mRNA and proteins were up-regulated at 1 d, 14 d and 45 d after pilocarpine injection, while KCC2 was down-regulated. According to obtained results, there were some expressional changes of NKCC1 and KCC2. Deregulation of their expression may break the balance of intracellular and extracellular chloride concentration which contributes to the mechanism of hyperexcitability leading to seizures. Also it may provide new drug targets for development of new antiepileptic medicine.",
