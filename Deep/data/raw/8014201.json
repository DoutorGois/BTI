     "AB": "The objective of this study was to determine whether brief focal ischemia induces ischemic tolerance in rat brain. Focal ischemia was produced in Wistar rats by occluding the middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 20 min at a distal site. Following recovery for 24 h, the animals were subjected to a 10-min episode of forebrain ischemia using a combination of bilateral carotid artery occlusion and systemic hypotension. Histologic injury, assessed after a survival period of 3-4 days, consisted of selective neuronal necrosis bilaterally in cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus superimposed upon a small cortical infarct adjacent to the site of MCA occlusion. However, the intensity of neuronal necrosis in the MCA territory of the neocortex ipsilateral to MCA occlusion was markedly less than that in the contralateral MCA cortex. In contrast, the extent of neuronal necrosis in subcortical structures was similar in both hemispheres. Unexpectedly, animals in which the MCA was manipulated, but not occluded, also exhibited a marked reduction of neuronal necrosis in the ipsilateral MCA neocortex following forebrain ischemia. However, in animals with craniotomy alone, forebrain ischemia caused a similar extent of neuronal necrosis in the MCA neocortex of both hemispheres. Transient occlusion of the MCA induced the focal expression of the 72-kDa heat-shock protein (hsp72) in the MCA territory of the neocortex. Limited expression of hsp72 was also detected following sham occlusion, but not after craniotomy alone. These results demonstrate focal induction of ischemic tolerance in rat neocortex that may be related to expression of heat-shock proteins.",
