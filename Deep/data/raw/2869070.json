     "AB": "The morphology and distribution of somatostatinlike immunoreactive perikarya in the central nervous system of the hedgehog and sheep have been studied by means of the peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistochemical method. Intracerebroventricular colchicine infusion not only enhanced the immunostaining but also revealed new immunoreactive cell bodies. In both hedgehog and sheep immunoreactive neurons of various forms, ranging from 12 to 28 microns in diameter, were observed in a number of homologous brain structures. However, some species-related differences were noticed. Thus, somatostatinlike immunoreactive neurons were found only in the hedgehog anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, medial parabrachial nucleus, raphe nuclei of the medulla, and spinal trigeminal nucleus, whereas some somatostatin-positive neurons were observed in the locus coeruleus and the pontine reticular formation of the sheep only. Mapping of peptides in species like sheep and hedgehog, with basically different orientations of living behaviour, may contribute in strengthening or extending our views concerning the role of peptides in the central nervous system of mammals.",
