     "AB": "Activation of the enzyme phospholipase (PLA 2) has been proposed to be part of the molecular mechanism involved in the alteration of 2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) glutamate receptor responsiveness during long term changes in synaptic plasticity (long term potentiation). This study assesses the effect of the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (CSD) on the activity of the regulatory enzyme PLA2. Caveolin-1 is a 22-kDa cholesterol-binding membrane protein known to inhibit the activity of most of its interacting partners. Our results show that the calcium-dependent cytosolic form of PLA2 (cPLA2) and caveolin-1 co-localized in mouse primary hippocampal neuron cultures and that they were co-immunoprecipitated from mouse hippocampal homogenates. A peptide corresponding to the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 (Cav-(82-101)) dramatically inhibited cPLA2 activity in purified hippocampal synaptoneurosomes. Activation of endogenous PLA2 activity with KCl or melittin increased the binding of [3H]AMPA to its receptor. This effect was almost completely abolished by the addition of the CSD peptide to these preparations. Moreover, we demonstrated that the inhibitory action of the CSD peptide on AMPA receptor binding properties is specific (because a scrambled version of this peptide failed to have any effect) and that it is mediated by an inhibition of PLA2 enzymatic activity (because the CSD peptide failed to have an effect in membrane preparations lacking endogenous PLA2 activity). These results raised the possibility that caveolin-1, via the inhibition of cPLA2 enzymatic activity, may interfere with synaptic facilitation and long term potentiation formation in the hippocampus.",
