     "AB": "Cold exposure is an external stress factor that causes skin frostbite as well as a variety of diseases. Estrogen might participate in neuroprotection after cold exposure, but its precise mechanism remains unclear. In this study, mice were exposed to 10 degrees C for 7 days and 0-4 degrees C for 30 days to induce a model of chronic cold exposure. Results showed that oxidative stress-related c-fos and cyclooxygenase 2 expressions, MAP1LC3-labeled autophagic cells, Iba1-labeled activated microglia, and interleukin-1beta-positive pyramidal cells were increased in the hippocampal CA1 area. Chronic cold exposure markedly elevated the levels of estrogen in the blood and the estrogen receptor, G protein-coupled receptor 30. These results indicate that neuroimmunoreactivity is involved in chronic cold exposure-induced pathological alterations, including oxidative stress, neuronal autophagy, and neuroimmunoreactivity. Moreover, estrogen exerts a neuroprotective effect on cold exposure.",
