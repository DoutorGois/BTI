     "AB": "The older notion of a central nervous system existing in essential isolation from the immune system has changed dramatically in recent years as the body of evidence relating to the interactions between these two systems has grown. Here we address the role of a particular subset of immune modulatory molecules, the pro-inflammatory cytokines, in regulating neuronal function and viability in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These inflammatory mediators are known to be elevated in many neuropathological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and ischaemic injury that follows stroke. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin 18 (IL-18), have been shown to regulate neurotoxicity; although, due to the complexity of the cytokine action in neurons and glia, the effect may be either facilitatory or protective, depending on the circumstances. As well as their role in neurotoxicity and neuroprotection, the pro-inflammatory cytokines have also been shown to be potent regulators of synaptic function. In particular, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-18 have all been shown to inhibit long-term potentiation, a form of neuronal plasticity widely believed to underlie learning and memory, both in the early p38 mitogen activated protein kinase-dependant phase and the later protein synthesis-dependant phase. In this article we address the mechanisms underlying these cytokine effects in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.",
