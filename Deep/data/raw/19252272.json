     "AB": "Here we reviewed our recent work on the chronic effects of nicotine on the Na+ -Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) gene and protein expressions in various organs of rats treated with nicotine in the drinking water for 4-12 weeks. Microarray analysis and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) did not detect significant changes in NCX mRNA expression in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, heart and skeletal muscle. However, NCX1 protein was up-regulated by nicotine in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, but was down-regulated in the heart. NCX2 protein was up-regulated by nicotine in hippocampus. We suggest that although mRNA change was insignificant, NCX protein expression was altered by chronic nicotine administration in brain and heart in rats. We also reviewed our work on modulators of NCX gene expression and function in cardiac myocytes.",
