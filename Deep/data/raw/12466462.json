     "AB": "The Valsalva maneuver, a test frequently used to evaluate autonomic function, recruits discrete neural sites. The time courses of neural recruitment relative to accompanying cardiovascular and breathing patterns are unknown. We examined functional magnetic resonance imaging signal changes within the brain to repeated Valsalva maneuvers and correlated these changes with physiological trends. In 12 healthy subjects (age, 30-58 yr), a series of 25 volumes (20 gradient echo echo-planar image slices per volume) was collected using a 1.5-Tesla scanner during a 60-s baseline and 90-s challenge period consisting of three Valsalva maneuvers. Regions of interest were examined for signal intensity changes over baseline and challenge conditions in cardiorespiratory-related regions. In addition, whole brain correlations between signal intensity and heart rate and airway load pressure were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Significant signal changes, correlated with the time course of load pressure and heart rate, emerged within multiple areas, including the amygdala and hippocampus, insular and lateral frontal cortices, dorsal pons, dorsal medulla, lentiform nucleus, and fastigial and dentate nuclei of the cerebellum. Signal intensities peaked early in the Valsalva maneuver within the hippocampus and amygdala, later within the dorsal medulla, pons and midbrain, and deep cerebellar nuclei, and last within the lentiform nuclei and the lateral prefrontal cortex. The ventral pontine signals increased during the challenge, but not in a fashion correlated to load pressure or heart rate. Sites showing little or no correlation included the vermis and medial prefrontal cortex. These data suggest an initiating component arising in rostral brain areas, a later contribution from cerebellar nuclei, basal ganglia, and lateral prefrontal cortex, and a role for the ventral pons in mediating longer term processes.",
