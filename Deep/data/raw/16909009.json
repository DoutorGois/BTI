     "AB": "Clinical observations with AN-1792 using tissue amyloid plaque immunoreactivity (TAPIR) analyses established for the first time evidence in humans that antibodies against beta-amyloid-related epitopes are capable of slowing progression in Alzheimer's disease. Antibodies derived upon TAPIR assay selection may specifically target the pathologic neoepitopes of aggregated A beta species present in amyloid plaques and some of their aggregated, protofibrillar and low molecular weight oligomeric precursors. We briefly summarize here how the proof of concept was established and why it provides the basis for a potential cure for Alzheimer's disease.",
