From psychopharmacological point of view most interesting results are those showing neurogenesis that neurogenesis is increased by SSRI. However, the role of serotonin system in neurogenesis as well as significance of neurogenesis in the beneficial effect of psychotropic drugs requires a lot of additional and new inventive research.",
