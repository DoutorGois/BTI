     "AB": "Behavioural stress facilitates long-term depression in Schaffer collaterals-CA1 pathway, but it is unknown whether it influences long-term depression in temporoammonic fibres-CA1. Here, we report that low-frequency stimulation induced long-term depression and foot shock stress before slice preparation facilitated long-term depression in both pathways of young rat slices. When the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded by stimulating the two pathways alternately and low-frequency stimulation was given to the two pathways simultaneously, a reliable long-term depression was induced in Schaffer collaterals-CA1 but a reliable long-term potentiation took place in temporoammonic fibres-CA1. Interestingly, foot shock stress now enabled low-frequency stimulation to induce reliable long-term depressions in both pathways. These findings suggested that acute behavioural stress facilitated long-term depressions in both pathways and disrupted the interactions between pathways.",
