     "AB": "Recent advances in cDNA microarray technology have made it possible to analyze expression of more than 8000 genes. Using this technology, gene expression in the hippocampus containing neurofibrillary tangle-associated lesions from an Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient was compared with expression in the parietal cortex from the same patient that lacked these lesions. We also compared gene expression using a control brain. The top 20 named genes significantly up-regulated or down-regulated only in the AD brain were determined. The most up-regulated gene proved to be calcineurin Abeta mRNA (CAbeta). In situ hybridization histochemistry revealed that CAbeta was significantly up-regulated in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus in the AD brain. RT-PCR analysis revealed that CAbeta was up-regulated in the hippocampus from two out of three AD brains while there were no changes in three control brains. Our study suggests that CAbeta may play a crucial role in the pathophysiological mechanisms in AD.",
