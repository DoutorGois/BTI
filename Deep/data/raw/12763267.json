     "AB": "The present work shows the effects of a typical neuroleptic drug (haloperidol, HAL) on rat behavior (catalepsy and locomotor activity) and dopaminergic D2-like receptor densities in the hippocampus and striatum. Male Wistar rats (2-3 months old) were treated daily for 30 days with HAL (0.2 or 1mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)). At the end of treatment and 1h or 1, 3, 7 and 15 days after drug withdrawal, animals were subjected to behavioral tests and sacrificed afterwards for binding assays. The results showed that behavioral effects with both doses were significant only 1h and 1 day after withdrawal, and similar to controls at the third day. An up-regulation of D2 receptors was observed in the striatum (28% increase) but not in the hippocampus after 24h HAL (1mg/kg) withdrawal. However, an up-regulation was seen in both areas (1mg/kg) 3 days after drug withdrawal (58 and 42% increases in the hippocampus and striatum, respectively), and continued after 7 days of withdrawal only in the striatum (43 and 49% for the doses of 0.2 and 1mg/kg, respectively), suggesting the influence of dose, age, and time of drug withdrawal on these parameters. The up-regulation disappeared after 15 days of haloperidol withdrawal. Increases (72 and 140%) in constant dissociation values (K(d)) values were also observed 7 days after withdrawal. Results show differences on a time-basis between behavioral alterations and dopaminergic D2 receptors up-regulation.",
