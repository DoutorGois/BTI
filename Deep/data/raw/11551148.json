     "AB": "An ontogenetic study of ecto-ATPase activity and the content of enzyme proteins was assessed in the caudate nucleus and hippocampal synaptic plasma membranes isolated from rats at various ages (15, 30, 90, 180 and 365 days). The ontogenetic profile revealed that the enzyme activities in both brain areas were the highest on day 30 and 365, while the ecto-ATPase protein abundance was the highest on day 15 after birth. Possible explanation for obtained ontogenetic profile and the discrepancy between activity and abundance may reside in the fact that ecto-ATPase during development could exert additional roles other than those related to metabolism of ATP. It is likely that ecto-ATPase, regulating the concentration of ATP and adenosine in synaptic cleft, has important role in the processes of brain development and aging.",
