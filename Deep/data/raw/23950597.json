     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the putative protective effect of calcium channel blockers on hippocampal neurons in the experimental model of excitotoxic damage. METHODS: Seven-day old primary dissociated cultures of rat hippocampal neural cells containing one of the following calcium channel blockers: cinnarizine, flunarizine or nimodipine were exposed to glutamate-induced injury. Quantitative assessments of neuronal injury were accomplished by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the media 24 h after exposure to glutamate and by counting and establishing the apoptotic and necrotic cells in flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. RESULTS: In our experiment, glutamate induced a 339% elevation of apoptotic cells and a 289% increase of necrotic cells in hippocampal neurons as compared to control cultures without drugs. In cultures containing flunarizine, glutamate-induced cell apoptosis was suppressed by 62% while necrosis showed no significant alternation. Cinnarizine exerted no anti-apoptotic effects on glutamate-injured cultured hippocampal neurons, while nimodipine intensified the apoptotic pathway of cell death and promoted an increase in the number of apoptotic neurons by 26%. When cinnarizine or nimodipine were used, the percentage of necrotic cells was significantly lower when compared with glutamate-injured cultures and it amounted to 44% and 24% for cinnarizine and nimodipine, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results suggest the beneficial anti-apoptotic potential of flunarizine and the anti-necrotic potential of cinnarizine against glutamate-induced death of cultured hippocampal neurons. Nimodipine can protect neurons against necrosis, but has an intensified adverse pro-apoptotic effect on cultured neurons in the experimental model of excitotoxic injury.",
