     "AB": "Biliverdin reductase-A is a pleiotropic enzyme involved not only in the reduction of biliverdin-IX-alpha into bilirubin-IX-alpha, but also in the regulation of glucose metabolism and cell growth secondary to its serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity. Together with heme oxygenase, whose metabolic role is to degrade heme into biliverdin-IX-alpha, it forms a powerful system involved in the cell stress response during neurodegenerative disorders. In this paper, an up-regulation of the biliverdin reductase-A protein levels was found in the hippocampus of the subjects with Alzheimer disease and arguably its earliest form, mild cognitive impairment. Moreover a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues of biliverdin reductase-A was found, and this was paralleled by a marked reduction in its reductase activity. Interestingly, the levels of both total and phosphorylated biliverdin reductase-A were unchanged as well as its enzymatic activity in the cerebella. These results demonstrated a dichotomy between biliverdin reductase-A protein levels and activity in the hippocampus of subjects affected by Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment, and this effect likely is attributable to a reduction in the phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues of biliverdin reductase-A. Consequently, not just the increased levels of biliverdin reductase-A, but also its changed activity and phosphorylation state, should be taken into account when considering potential biomarkers for Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment.",
