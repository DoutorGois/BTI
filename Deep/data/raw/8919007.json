     "AB": "N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists impair performance in some tasks, but whether they impair learning directly or through effects on sensorimotor performance remains controversial. Rats administered a competitive NMDA antagonist, CGP-39551, 24 hr before training could not acquire a classically conditioned eyeblink response. The associative deficit remained evident during training with a high-intensity conditioned stimulus, even though sensory reactivity was unaffected. The antagonist did not alter retention and thus did not affect motor performance of the task. These results extend and confirm studies that implicate NMDA-receptor activation in the acquisition of classically conditioned associations and specifically in tasks not dependent on the hippocampus for learning itself. Moreover, they substantiate recent claims that NMDA receptor activation (and by association, long-term potentiation) may be involved in early processes of procedural memory formation.",
