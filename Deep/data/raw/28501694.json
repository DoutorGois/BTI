     "AB": "Vasogenic edema induced by blood brain barrier disruption and neuronal loss play an important role in the epileptogenic process. 4,4'- diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) is a commonly used anion channel inhibitor that has been reported to exert an anticonvulsant effect in rat hippocampus in vitro. The present study aimed to investigate whether DIDS could prevent epileptogenic process in rat lithium-pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. The tight junction proteins and serum extravasation were examined in the piriform cortex 3days after status epilepticus. The findings showed that status epilepticus induced vasogenic edema. Based on these findings, rats were intracerebroventricularly infused with saline and DIDS 1 week after surgery, DIDS reduced vasogenic edema and prevented neuronal loss following status epilepticus in the piriform cortex. Moreover, spontaneous recurrent seizures were recorded by continuous video monitoring. DIDS significantly reduced the frequency and duration of spontaneous recurrent seizures from day 28 to day 42 post status epilepticus. These findings demonstrated that DIDS attenuated vasogenic edema and neuronal apoptosis and might exert disease-modifying effect in animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy. These results explored a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of epilepsy.",
