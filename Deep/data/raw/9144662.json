     "AB": "The present study has examined the glycine/N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, R-(+)-3-amino-1-hydroxypyrrolid-2-one (R-(+)-HA-966) and the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, cis-4-(phosphonomethyl)piperidine-2-carboxylic acid (CGS 19755) on the behavioural syndrome and increased hipppocampal acetylcholine efflux induced during morphine-withdrawal in the rat. Subcutaneous naltrexone (1 mg/kg) injection, 48 hr after implantation of a 75 mg morphine pellet, induced a robust withdrawal syndrome consisting of wet dog shakes, ejaculations, mouth movement, ptosis, irritability to touch and diarrhoea. Pretreatment with the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (0.1-0.4 mg/kg), R-(+)-HA-966 (10-60 mg/kg) or CGS 19755 (5 or 10 mg/kg) significantly reduced the incidence of withdrawal behaviours. In addition, all three compounds significantly attenuated the increase in hippocampal acetylcholine efflux induced following naltrexone (1 mg/kg, s.c.) injection in morphine-dependent rats. These results provide further evidence demonstrating that NMDA receptor antagonists attenuate both the behavioural and neurochemical effects observed during morphine withdrawal in the rat.",
