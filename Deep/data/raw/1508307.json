     "AB": "Concentrations of 11 amino acids, including the neurotransmitters GABA, glutamate, aspartate, glycine and taurine, were determined in 12 brain regions of female rats during different stages of the estrous cycle. In addition, amino acids and sex hormone levels were determined in plasma. All sample collections were done in the forenoon between 9 and 11 a.m. Most regional amino acid levels measured did not change significantly during estrous cycle, but significant alterations were found for GABA and glutamate in hypothalamus. Both amino acids were slightly decreased in hypothalamus during proestrus, which might reflect an alteration of GABA turnover in response to the high estrogen levels during this stage. A decreased glutamate level during proestrus was also found in thalamus, while both glutamate and GABA did not vary throughout estrous cycle in any of the other examined regions, including substantia nigra, amygdala, striatum, cortex and hippocampus. When diestrus was subdivided according to progesterone levels, high levels of this hormone seemed to be associated with effects on metabolism of certain amino acids, including glycine in substantia nigra, alanine in thalamus and threonine in pons/medulla. However, the few changes in regional amino acid concentrations found during the estrous cycle were so small that the functional significance of these changes cannot be ascertained without further determination of the cellular or subcellular compartments of brain tissue involved.",
