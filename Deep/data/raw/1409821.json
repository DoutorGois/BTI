     "AB": "The present study investigated whether stimulation of the GABAergic system affects spatial navigation [water-maze (WM)] deficit induced by muscarinic blockade (scopolamine). The effects of various doses of gamma-vinyl-GABA (GVG) (50, 150, and 300 mg/kg) and scopolamine (0.4 and 0.1 mg/kg) were examined alone and in combination. GVG at 50 and 150 mg/kg alone did not impair the performance of rats in the WM yask. At 300 mg/kg, GVG caused slight impairment, increasing latency and total distance swim during training trials. Scopolamine at 0.4 mg/kg clearly impaired the performance of rats in the WM task. When the two drugs were coadministered, no interaction between scopolamine and GVG was observed. Our results do not provide support for any interaction between cholinergic muscarinic and GABAergic mechanisms.",
