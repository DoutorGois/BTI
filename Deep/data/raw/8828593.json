     "AB": "Cryostat sections of the rat hippocampus were used as tissue culture substrates for embryonic chick sympathetic explants. Neurite outgrowth from these explants was found to be significantly greater on sections taken from animals with septal lesions as compared to those receiving sham operations. This finding suggests that septal denervation leads to hippocampal substrate changes that enhance sympathetic neurite outgrowth in vitro, perhaps analogous to the sympathetic sprouting response that occurs in vivo.",
