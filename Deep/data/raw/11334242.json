     "AB": "CaM-KII exhibits broad distribution within neurons and discrete localization inside the cell, and it is highly abundant in the postsynaptic densities. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of chronic imipramine administration on the CaM-KII activity in postsynaptic densities and synaptosomal plasma membrane fraction isolated from the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus. In the present study, we showed that chronic imipramine administration did not affect the CaM-KII activity localized postsynaptically. Moreover, our results indicated that chronic imipramine treatment evoked a large (300%) increase in CaM-KII activity in synaptosomal plasma membranes fraction isolated from frontal cortex.",
