     "AB": "Levels of noradrenaline (NA) and its major metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol sulfate (MHPG-SO4), were determined in eight brain regions of non-stressed rats at 2, 10 and 15 months of age, and of rats at 2 and 15 months of age stressed by immobilization for 3 hours. The NA levels in older rats were significantly lower in the hypothalamus, pons + med.obl. and midbrain, and higher in the amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus and cerebral cortex as compared to those of 2 month old rats. The MHPG-SO4 levels in the older rats were significantly lower in the hypothalamus, amygdala, pons + med.obl. and midbrain, and higher only in the cerebral cortex than those in 2 month old rats. Immobilization stress caused significant increases in NA turnover in all brain regions of both 2 and 15 month old rats. Age-related difference in the degree of stress-induced change in NA metabolism was found only in the hypothalamus; the increase of MHPG-SO4 by stress was greater in 2 month old rats than in 15 month old rats, although both age groups of rats showed the same degree of NA reduction by stress. These data suggest that brain NA metabolism changes in an age-related fashion, and that apparent regional differences exist in the pattern of these changes. Specifically, it appears that there is an age-related difference in the response of noradrenergic neurons to stress in the hypothalamus.",
