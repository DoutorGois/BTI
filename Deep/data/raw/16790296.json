     "AB": "Previous studies indicate that long-term dietary supplementation with arachidonic acid (AA) in 20-month-old rats (OA) effectively restores performance in a memory task and the induction of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus to the level of young control animals (YC). The present study examined protein mobility using the live cell imaging technique \"Fluorescent Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP)\" in YC, old control (OC) and OA neurons in hippocampal slice preparations. Three measures; mobile fraction (M(f)), diffusion constant (D) and time constant (tau), were estimated among YC, OC and OA. Each of these parameters was significantly different between OC and YC, suggesting that membrane fluidity is lower in OC than in YC. In contrast, D and tau were comparable in OA and YC, indicating that hippocampal neuronal membranes supplemented with AA were more fluid than those in OC, whereas the fraction of diffusible protein in the bleached region remained smaller than in YC. Long-term administration of AA to senescent rats might help to preserve membrane fluidity and maintain hippocampal plasticity.",
