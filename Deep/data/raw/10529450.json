     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment with high-dose human serum albumin (HSA) would offer protection in a model of high-grade transient forebrain ischemia. Twenty-six fasted Wistar rats underwent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion and severe hypotension (50 mmHg) for 10 min. The agent (25% HSA) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) was administered i.v. 5 min after termination of ischemia. HSA-treated rats showed significantly improved neurological deficits throughout a 7-day survival period. Histologically, HSA-treated rats showed 2.4- to 5.3-fold increases in numbers of surviving CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons compared to saline-treated animals. These results document that high-dose albumin therapy instituted 5 min after global ischemia significantly improves neurological score and reduces histological damage.",
