     "AB": "The distribution of immunoreactive (ir)-metorphamide (adrenorphin) in 101 microdissected rat brain and spinal cord regions was determined using a highly specific radioimmunoassay. The highest concentration of metorphamide in brain was found in globus pallidus (280.1 fmol/mg protein). High concentrations of ir-metorphamide (greater than 120 fmol/mg protein) were found in 9 nuclei, including central amygdaloid nucleus, lateral preoptic area, anterior hypothalamic nucleus, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, periaqueductal grey matter and nucleus of the solitary tract. Moderate concentrations of the peptide (between 60 and 120 fmol/mg protein) were found in 47 brain nuclei such as nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, several septal and amygdaloid nuclei, most of the hypothalamic nuclei, ventral tegmental area, red nucleus, raphe nuclei, lateral reticular nucleus, area postrema and others. Low concentrations or ir-metorphamide (less than 60 fmol/mg protein) were measured in 41 nuclei, e.g., cortical structures, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, thalamic nuclei, supraoptic nucleus, substantia nigra, vestibular nuclei, cerebellum (nuclei and cortex). The olfactory bulb has the lowest metorphamide concentration (5.8 fmol/mg protein). Spinal cord segments exhibit very low peptide concentrations.",
