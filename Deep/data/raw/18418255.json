     "AB": "We demonstrated scission of a living neuronal network on multielectrode arrays (MEAs) using a focused femtosecond laser and evaluated the resynchronization of spontaneous electrical activity within the network. By an irradiation of femtosecond laser into hippocampal neurons cultured on a multielectrode array dish, neurites were cut at the focal point. After the irradiation, synchronization of neuronal activity within the network drastically decreased over the divided area, indicating diminished functional connections between neurons. Cross-correlation analysis revealed that spontaneous activity between the divided areas gradually resynchronized within 10 days. These findings indicate that hippocampal neurons have the potential to regenerate functional connections and to reconstruct a network by self-assembly.",
