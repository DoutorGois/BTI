While a significant proportion of the individual specimens exhibited left-right asymmetries in cholinergic deficits, bilateral symmetry was the rule for frontal and temporal cortex, basal nucleus, and the prosubiculum of the hippocampus. In contrast to these four regions, left-right asymmetries in choline acetyltransferase activity and muscarinic receptor density appeared to be typical in the entorhinal cortex of the hippocampus.",
