     "AB": "Microinjections of substance P (SP, 100 pmol) into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in conscious rats increased blood pressure and heart rate for 30-40 min. Concomitantly, the extracellular levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the ventral hippocampus, monitored by microdialysis, increased by 30% for 20 min compared with the vehicle control. Pretreatment with the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ritanserin (1 mg/kg i.v.), prevented the pressor response to SP but not the increase in heart rate. Pretreatment with the partial 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-methoxy-2-(N-2-chloroethyl-N-n-propyl)amino tetralin (8-MeO-CLEPAT, 10 micrograms/kg i.v.) prevented the increase in both blood pressure and heart rate. It is suggested that microinjections of SP into the DRN increase blood pressure through activation of serotonergic DRN neurons and that the postsynaptic receptor responsible for the pressor response is of the 5-HT2 type.",
