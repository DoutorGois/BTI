     "AB": "We examined the time course of expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) protein in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus following unilateral intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid (KA). Recurrent behavioral seizures were observed approximately 1 h after KA injection, which lasted for 4-6 h. GDNF immunoreactivity began to increase bilaterally in the granule cells within 3 h after KA injection, continued to increase until post-injection day (PID) 4, and returned to the control level by PID 7. The results suggest that the increase of GDNF protein in the granule cells may be ascribable to seizures induced by the KA injection. The increase of GDNF protein might promote survival of the granule cells after the intrahippocampal KA injection.",
