     "AB": "Dephosphorylation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) GluA1 subunits at two sites, serine 845 (S845) and threonine 840 (T840), is thought to be involved in NMDA receptor-dependent forms of long-term depression (LTD). Importantly, the notion that dephosphorylation of these sites contributes to LTD assumes that a significant fraction of GluA1 subunits are basally phosphorylated at these sites. To examine this question, we used immunoprecipitation/depletion assays to estimate the proportion of GluA1 subunits basally phosphorylated at S845 and T840. Although dephosphorylation of S845 is thought to have a key role in LTD, our results indicate that few GluA1 subunits in hippocampal neurons are phosphorylated at this site. In contrast, approximately 50% of GluA1 subunits are basally phosphorylated at T840, suggesting that dephosphorylation of this site can contribute to the down-regulation of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in LTD.",
