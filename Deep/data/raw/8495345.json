     "AB": "This study was undertaken to determine whether endogenous adenosine modulates 'in vivo' neurotransmitter amino acid release via its presynaptic receptors. Two conditions were compared: neuronal depolarization by local infusion of veratridine (600 microM), and transient global ischemia by four-vessel occlusion. Both stimuli were applied for 20 min. Extracellular amino acid (glutamate, taurine/GABA, glycine) variations in concentration were determined in the rat hippocampus by microdialysis and HPLC. Modulation of adenosine receptor activity was objectified by continuous local infusion of an adenosine agonist (R-phenylisopropyladenosine R-PIA) or an antagonist (theophylline), starting one hour before stimulation of amino acid release. R-PIA (100 microM) significantly decreased the glutamate release (50%) evoked by veratridine, whereas it did not significantly modify the ischemia-induced glutamate release. In contrast, theophylline did not significantly affect veratridine-induced glutamate release, but it significantly potentiated glutamate efflux (400%) under ischemic conditions. Neither treatment altered the release of the other amino acids. These data suggest that endogenous adenosine appearing in the extracellular space during veratridine-induced depolarization cannot control glutamate release. In contrast, ischemia-induced glutamate release was strongly inhibited by the concomitant increase in extracellular adenosine.",
