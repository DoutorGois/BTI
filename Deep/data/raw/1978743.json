     "AB": "The present paper contains a description of a prolonged potentiation of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential in the CA1 region of the hippocampal slice preparation following afferent tetanization. In contrast to long-term potentiation, this novel potentiation is not specific to the activated synapses, and manifests itself as a change in the shape of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential with a prolongation of the rising phase and an increased peak amplitude. The potentiation is fully developed within minutes after tetanization and shows no decrement for at least an hour. Although it can appear together with long-term potentiation following tetanization at moderate strength (single volley excitatory postsynaptic potential below threshold for spike initiation), it is more readily seen following tetanization at higher strengths. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate prevents the induction but not the maintenance of the shape modification. The potentiation is observed in the presence of the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin (100 microM) and is thus not secondary to changes in postsynaptic inhibition. 4-Aminopyridine (50-100 microM) produced changes in the field excitatory postsynaptic potential resembling the shape modification produced by afferent tetanization, suggesting that the potentiation may be due to a blockade of potassium channels, pre- or postsynaptically located. The potentiation is also found to be associated with an increase in the population spike for a given initial slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential, and may thus contribute to the excitatory postsynaptic potential-spike potentiation that can be observed following afferent tetanization.",
