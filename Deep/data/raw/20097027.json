     "AB": "Although there are several studies describing bacteria associated with marine fish, the bacterial composition associated with seahorses has not been extensively investigated since these studies have been restricted to the identification of bacterial pathogens. In this study, the phylogenetic affiliation of seahorse-associated bacteria was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of cloned DNA fragments. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to confirm the presence of the predominant groups indicated by 16S rRNA analysis. Both methods revealed that Vibrionaceae was the dominant population in Artemia sp. (live prey) and intestinal content of the seahorses, while Rhodobacteraceae was dominant in water samples from the aquaculture system and cutaneous mucus of the seahorses. To our knowledge, this is the first time that bacterial communities associated with healthy seahorses in captivity have been described.",
