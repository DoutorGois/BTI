     "AB": "The Ca(++)-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine was used in these studies to investigate presynaptic regulation of norepinephrine release. In hippocampal synaptosomes, previously unexposed to Ca++ during isolation and superfusion, 1.25 mM Ca++ evoked a modest (4 to 7% of total stores) release of [3H]norepinephrine with 4.5 mM [K+] present. The alpha-2 adrenergic agonist clonidine inhibited 60% of the Ca(++)-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release. The alpha-2 adrenergic antagonists idazoxan and yohimbine reversed clonidine inhibition of release whereas the alpha-1 antagonist prazosin did not. Increasing the [K+] before Ca++ exposure increased [3H]norepinephrine release, and at 20 [K+] the release increased to over 20% of total stores. However, at [K+] above 9 mM, inhibition of Ca(++)-evoked release by clonidine decreased, and by 20 mM [K+] clonidine no longer inhibited release. Release was unaffected by 5 microM idazoxan or the opiate antagonist naloxone at 15 or 20 mM [K+]. The K+ channel blockers tetraethylammonium (5 mM) and 4-aminopyridine (0.1 mM) increased Ca(++)-evoked release almost 4-fold above control (4.5 mM [K+] present). Neither clonidine nor idazoxan affected Ca(++)-evoked release with the K+ channel blockers present. Therefore, even though K+ channel blockers and 20 mM [K+] increase neurotransmitter release, it is not autoreceptor activation by released endogenous norepinephrine that is responsible for blocking alpha-2 inhibition, but the depolarization produced by these treatments. The 20 mM [K+] blockade of alpha-2 inhibition was decreased by lowering the [Ca++] in the superfusion buffer. Therefore, synaptosomal accumulation of Ca++ may partially explain the loss of alpha-2 inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
