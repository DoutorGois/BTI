     "AB": "The diversity of neuronal morphologies and the complexity of synaptic connections in the mammalian brain provide striking examples of cell polarity. Over the past decade, the identification of the PAR (for partitioning-defective) proteins, their function in polarity in the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, and the conservation of polarity proteins related to the PAR polarity complex in Drosophila and vertebrates, kindled intense interest in polarity pathways. Although the existence of a conserved polarity protein complex does not prove that these proteins function the same way in different systems, the emergence of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that regulates cell polarity provides an exciting opportunity to define the role of polarity proteins in the generation of the diverse array of cell types and patterns of connections in the developing mammalian brain. This review addresses emerging genetic, molecular genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches and mechanisms that control neuronal polarity, focusing on recent studies using the neonatal cerebellum and hippocampus as model systems.",
