The relative content of the most acidic protein corresponding to the nerve-specific protein S-100 under the same experimental conditions was determined in various physiological states. It is shown that the quantity of this protein in the brain stem increased in awakening animals as compared to the hibernating ones whereas its content in the cortex and hippocampus was stable.",
