     "AB": "There is increasing evidence that major depressive disorder (MDD) is also a progressive neurodegeneration disorder and neuronal damage is the major pathology of MDD. Umbelliferone, a coumarin derivative, was found in a range of plants with proved anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. The primary purpose of this investigation was to evaluate whether umbelliferone could confer an antidepressant-like effect on the depressive model in rats developed by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and explore the possible mechanism involved in its neuroprotective effects. We found that treatments with umbelliferone (15mg/kg, 30mg/kg) significantly ameliorated CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors, such as decreased sucrose consumption, reduced locomotor activity and prolonged immobility time. Rats under CUMS stimulation treated with umbelliferone (15mg/kg, 30mg/kg) showed reduced neuronal apoptosis, as well as inhibited inflammatory cytokines levels by down-regulating Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling and up-regulating protein kinase B (Akt) signaling. In conclusion, umbelliferone showed neuroprotective effects on CUMS-induced model of depression, which was associated with the inhibition of neuronal apoptosis modulated by ROCK/Akt pathway.",
