     "AB": "Expression of the immediate-early gene, NGFI-B (nerve growth factor inducible gene B), was examined in the amygdala, hippocampus, and neocortex following contextual fear conditioning. Rats were either handled, placed within the testing context without receiving the footshock, received a footshock immediately upon placement within the context, or received a footshock after a 3-min delay (delayed-shock). Only the delayed-shock group displayed a fear response (freezing) in the post-shock period and in a retention test 24 h after fear conditioning. Expression of NGFI-B mRNA was increased in the dorsolateral part of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LaDL) and the neocortex 30 min following conditioning in the delayed-shock group compared to the other three groups. In addition, following a retention test conducted 24 h after fear conditioning, NGFI-B mRNA expression was increased in the neocortex of the delayed-shock group compared to the handled group. In a subsequent experiment, the effects of pretreatment with the anxiolytic drug, diazepam, on fear conditioning and the concomitant increases in NGFI-B mRNA were investigated. Rats administered a 2.5 mg/kg, i.p. dose of diazepam before fear conditioning did not acquire contextual fear as demonstrated by a lack of freezing in a retention test. Although diazepam blocked fear conditioning while the 40% propylene glycol, 10% ethanol vehicle solution did not, both diazepam and the vehicle reduced the conditioning-induced increase in NGFI-B expression in the LaDL. In contrast, the fear-conditioning-induced NGFI-B increase in the neocortex was blocked by diazepam, but not by the vehicle. The data suggest that the transcriptional factor NGFI-B in the LaDL and neocortex may play a functional role in learning and memory of contextual fear, but blocking the increase in NGFI-B expression in the LaDL is not essential for diazepam to interfere with fear conditioning.",
