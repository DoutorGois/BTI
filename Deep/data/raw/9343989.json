     "AB": "Manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) was localized in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of patients with Alzheimer-type senile dementia (ATD) by immunocytochemistry and the relationship of Mn-SOD with two major pathological features of ATD, i.e., senile plaques and neurofibrillar tangles (NFTs), was examined. Many astrocytes in senile plaques exhibited strong immunoreactivity for both Mn-SOD and glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) on serial section analysis. This suggests that Mn-SOD scavenger system is associated with the formation of senile plaques. On the other hand, Mn-SOD immunoreactivity was not significant in NFT-loaded neurons.",
