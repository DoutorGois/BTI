     "AB": "Global ischemia promotes neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the adult mouse hippocampus. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, the principal isoenzyme in the brain, modulates inflammation, glutamate-mediated cytotoxicity, and synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated that delayed treatment with different classes of COX inhibitor significantly blunted enhancement of dentate gyrus proliferation of neural progenitor cells after ischemia. COX-2 immunoreactivity was observed in both neurons and astrocytes in the dentate gyrus, but not in neural progenitor cells in the subgranular zone. Moreover, in the postischemic dentate gyrus of heterozygous and homozygous COX-2 knockout mice, proliferating bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells were significantly fewer than in wild-type littermates. These results demonstrate that COX-2 is an important modulator in enhancement of proliferation of neural progenitor cells after ischemia.",
