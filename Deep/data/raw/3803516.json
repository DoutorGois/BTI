     "AB": "The effect of short- and long-term chronic ethanol consumption on the fine structure of the dentate gyrus was examined in two lines of mice selected for their differential sensitivity to acute ethanol administration. Quantitative electron microscopic analysis of dendritic spines, axon terminals, and synaptic appositions revealed significant differences between the long-sleep and short-sleep mice. In control preparations, long-sleep mice were found to have larger spine areas and perimeters, larger axon terminals, and longer synaptic appositions than short-sleep mice. In addition, the shape of dendritic spines in the long-sleep mice was significantly more complex than those of short-sleep mice. Ethanol tended to increase this complexity in long-sleep mice only. Ethanol had only a limited effect on the other anatomical measures. The results provide evidence for ultrastructural differences between the nervous systems of these lines of mice which may have a role in their differential sensitivity to acute ethanol administration.",
