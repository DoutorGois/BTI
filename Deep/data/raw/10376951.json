     "AB": "The primary goal of the study was to identify the types of catecholamines and the associated receptors which might be involved in the recall of the conditioned NK cell response. Specific catecholamine receptor antagonists were selected to block the conditioned NK cell response at the recall step. The regional contents of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine were determined in the brain of the conditioned animals by using the high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC/ED). Results showed that pre-disruption of the central alpha1-, alpha2-, beta1-, beta2-, D1-, or D2-receptors at the conditioned recall stage, interrupted the conditioned enhancement in NK cell activity. The NE contents at the cerebellum, and DA contents at the striatum and hippocampus, were significantly higher in the brain of the conditioned animals when compared to that of the control animals. These information indicated the possible roles of the central noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in regulating the recall of the conditioned NK cell response.",
