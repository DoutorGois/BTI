     "AB": "The ability to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that modulate programmed cell death (PCD) may provide the crucial clues to unravel the cellular basis of neurodegenerative disorders. Employing both a novel assay to follow serially PCD in individual living neurons and the neuroprotective agent lubeluzole as an investigative tool, we examined the development of nitric oxide (NO)-induced PCD over time through the reversible annexin V labelling of membrane phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and the electron microscopy of genomic DNA in primary rat hippocampal neurons. Exposure to the NO generators SNP (300 microM) or NOC-9 (300 microM) alone increased annexin V-positive neurons in the population from 7% +/- 4% in untreated cultures to 13% +/- 4% at 1 hr and to 61% +/- 5% at 24 hr. Administration of a neuroprotective concentration of lubeluzole (750 nM) at the time of NO exposure initially prevented the exposure of PS residues, but consistently maintained DNA integrity over a 24 hr period. During posttreatment paradigms of lubeluzole (750 nM) at 2, 4, and 6 hr following NO exposure, progression of membrane PS inversion was reversed and subsequently suppressed over a 24 hr course. Our work illustrates that neuronal PCD is composed of at least two physiologically distinct and separate pathways that consist of the externalization of membrane PS residues and the independent maintenance of genomic DNA integrity. In addition, neuronal injury is fluid and reversible in nature, suggesting a \"window of opportunity\" for the repair and reversal of neurons yet to be committed to PCD.",
