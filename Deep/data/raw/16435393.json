     "AB": "Intrauterine infection may be causally related to inflammation and injury of the fetal brain, however the mechanisms by which this occurs are unclear. We have investigated whether nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a transcription factor for proinflammatory cytokines, is activated in the fetal brain after acute LPS-exposure. At 95 days of gestation (term = approximately 147 days), 5 fetuses received a single intravenous bolus dose of LPS (1 microg/kg); 6 fetuses served as controls. Fetal blood samples were taken hourly for 6 hr post LPS-exposure to assess physiological status. Ewes and fetuses were then euthanased, placental and brain tissue examined histologically, and NF-kappaB activation assessed in several regions of the fetal brain using an electromobility shift assay (EMSA). Oxidative stress was measured using lipid peroxidation and 8-isoprostane biochemical assays and brain cytokine concentrations analysed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). LPS-exposed fetuses (relative to controls) were hypoxemic and the haematocrit and lactate levels had increased. In the brains of LPS-exposed fetuses compared to controls, NF-kappaB binding activity was elevated in the hippocampus and the thalamus/basal ganglia; 8-isoprostane levels were elevated overall (P < 0.05) in the parietal/occipital/temporal lobes and thalamus/basal ganglia. TNF-alpha and IL-6 concentrations were not elevated, however, there was a tendency for an elevation of IFN-gamma concentrations in the thalamus/basal ganglia. IFN-gamma concentration was elevated (P < 0.05) in the plasma 4 hr after LPS-exposure. In the placenta, NF-kappaB binding activity was increased (P < 0.05). We conclude that acute systemic administration of LPS leads to increased binding activity of NF-kappaB subunits in specific regions of the fetal brain and in the placenta, but that there is no clear-cut relationship between this elevation and vulnerability to endotoxic damage.",
