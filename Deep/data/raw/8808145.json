     "AB": "Pregnant Wistar rats were treated on gestational day 8 (GD 8) with two IP injections of either ethanol (2.9 g/kg in 24% v/v saline solution) or saline. Offspring were tested in the water-maze task at 45 or 90 days of age. The escape latencies of rats trained with a submerged escape platform at a fixed location were similar between control and experimental rats. Analyses of responses on a probe trial carried out 10 days after the training period, revealed that 90-day-old females prenatally exposed to alcohol were less likely to swim in the target region. No differences were observed in this free-swim trial in 45- and 90-day-old male, and 45-day-old female animals. Binding studies of low-affinity GABAA sites in the hippocampus showed an increase in affinity of [3H]GABAA for their binding sites in 90-day-old female offspring prenatally intoxicated with ethanol. Our results demonstrate that acute intoxication with ethanol on GD 8 did not modify acquisition but impaired the retention of spatial learning only in adult female rats. It is possible that the impaired retention will be consequence of higher GABAA receptor affinity.",
