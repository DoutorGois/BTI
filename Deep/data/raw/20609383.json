     "AB": "Unlike steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), one of the cholesterol transport protein, little attention is given to StarD6 which belongs to a family of StAR-related lipid transfer domain proteins. Although we undertook previous works with StarD6 in the nervous system, the characteristics are in controversy to date. Therefore, we attempted to investigate the morphological characteristics of StarD6 in the nervous system are the same as StAR in vitro and in vivo. The number of immunoreactive cells was significantly different by StAR or StarD6 in the cultured glioblastoma cell lines and dopaminergic neuronal cell lines. StarD6 immunoreactivity was changed by the presence of DNA-dependent protein kinase, while the dependency was not observed in StAR immunoreactivity. Besides, StarD6 was mainly observed in the stratum pyramidale and StAR in the other strata of normal rat hippocampus proper. Increased immunolocalization of StAR and StarD6 was seen in the stratum pyramidale and the strata lacunosum-moleculare, respectively, 3h after pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. Taken together, morphological aspects of StarD6 were significantly different from those of StAR in cultured glial and neuronal cells, as well as the distribution in the normal and epileptic rat hippocampus. These results suggested that StarD6 did not mark the same as StAR in vitro and in vivo.",
