     "AB": "The present study investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO) in epileptogenesis and whether this role correlated with ionotropic glutamate receptor (IGR). Using a self-constructed NO-sensitive microelectrode (SNM), we observed the effect of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors, NMDA and non-NMDA selective antagonists on penicillin(PEN)-treated hippocampal slices by simultaneously recording evoked field potentials and nitric oxide release from CA1 pyramidal neurons. 7-nitroindazole (7-NI),Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) and DL-2-amino-phospho-novaleric acid (APV), but not 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3 (1h,4h)-dione(DNQX), depressed NO release and partly reversed PEN's epileptogenetic effect, while APV + 7-NI + L-NNA did not display a further inhibitory effect. These findings suggest both NOS inhibitor and NMDA antagonist involve as anticonvulsant factors in epileptogenesis, providing direct evidence for NO release in response to NMDA receptor activation. The anticonvulsant effect of NMDA antagonist may ascribe to its action on NO release.",
