     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of the total flavonoids of Jiawei Wuzi Yanzong prescription on the Voltage-gated calcium channel of the CA1 pyramidal cell of rat hippocampus. METHOD: The inward calcium current was recorded by the whole-cell patch clamp and the amplitude of it was thought to observe the effect of Abeta25-35 and the total flavonoids. The hippocampus of rat was separated and cut into slices. Active pyramidal cells of slices were chosen for the whole-cell patch clamp recording. After exposure to Abeta25-35, voltage steps (500 ms) were used to depolarize stepwise in a range from 50 to +50 mV (increment: 5 mV). An inward Ca2+ current which was suggested to be survey was evoked. Application of the total flavonoids was to be observed if it had effect on this voltage-depended inward current. RESULT: Abeta25-35 could enhance the calcium current to induce intracellular calcium overload. The amplitude of the control group was--(157.1 +/- 19.9) pA, but after application of Abeta25-35 the current enhanced to--(323.2 +/- 23.4) pA. When the total flavonoids at concentration of 125, 250, 500 g x L(-1) were added, the current declined to--(257.9 +/- 31.6), - (196.4 +/- 29.8) and--(169.3 +/- 34.0) pA, respectively. CONCLUSION: Abeta-induced intracellular calcium overload may be one of neurotoxic of beta-amyloid peptide. The total flavonoids of Jiawei Wuzi Yanzong prescription can suppress inward calcium current to protect neurons.",
