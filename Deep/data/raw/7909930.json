     "AB": "The contribution of NMDA receptors to neuronal hyperexcitability following in vitro ethanol withdrawal was examined using afterdischarges (ADs) in rat dentate gyrus as a model system. ADs were evoked by high frequency stimuli and blocked by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Ethanol (75 mM) inhibited ADs, and following in vitro ethanol withdrawal, the duration of afterdischarges was significantly enhanced (37 +/- 2%, n = 21). Therefore, in vitro ethanol exposure with subsequent withdrawal is associated with an enhancement of NMDA receptor-dependent afterdischarges. These results are consistent with the involvement of NMDA receptors in ethanol withdrawal hyperexcitability.",
