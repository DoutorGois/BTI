     "AB": "It has been proposed that assembly of the final NMDA receptor complex may be modified by prenatal ethanol exposure, resulting in long-term alterations of NMDA receptor pharmacology. We investigated the effect of prenatal and postnatal ethanol exposure on the developmental profile of mRNAs encoding NMDA receptor subunits in rat hippocampus. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically intoxicated for 4 weeks with a 10% (v/v) ethanol solution administered throughout pregnancy and lactation. Hippocampus and cerebellum were isolated from pups (postnatal days 1-28) of the ethanol-exposed and ad libitum groups. Our results, using a semiquantitative RT-PCR technique, showed a selective effect of ethanol exposure on the various NMDA receptor subunits. Ethanol exposure significantly increased the levels of NR1(1XX), NR1(X11) and NR2(D) mRNAs on postnatal days 7 and 14 and decreased the level of NR2(C) on postnatal day 1. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that NR2(D) protein levels were increased on postnatal day 7 after ethanol exposure. However, the developmental profile of mRNAs encoding for NR2(A-B), NR3(L/S), GBP and Gly/TCP-BP subunits were not affected. Moreover, no significant effects of ethanol exposure were observed on the developmental transition from expression of NR1(0XX) to NR(1XX) splice variants occurring in the cerebellum on postnatal day 19. Unexpectedly, [(3) H]MK-801 binding experiments showed that ethanol exposure increased the B (max) values of high-affinity sites on postnatal days 14 and 28, with no change of K (d) values. These findings indicate that prenatal and/or postnatal ethanol exposure alters the hippocampal levels of mRNAs encoding for certain subunits and the density of high-affinity [(3) H]MK-801 binding sites. As these subunits have been shown to modulate the functional properties of NMDA receptors, these results suggest that this altered expression could be involved in the neurodevelopmental disorders associated with fetal ethanol exposure.",
