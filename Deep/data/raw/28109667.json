     "AB": "Clinical symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with altered cortical neuronal oscillations in multiple frequency bands such as alpha (7-13Hz) and gamma (30-90Hz) rhythms. NMDA receptor antagonists induce psychotic symptoms in humans and a schizophrenia-like phenotype in animals, suggesting NMDA receptor dysfunction is involved in the generation of many symptoms of the disorder. We investigated the effects of a single intraperitoneal injection of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 in rats, a model of first-episode schizophrenia, on network oscillations recorded ex vivo in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. We found that spontaneous gamma oscillations in hippocampal slices of MK-801-treated animals had a higher peak frequency, but that their rate of occurrence, peak power and Q factor (ratio of peak frequency to half bandwidth) were not affected. Hippocampal gamma oscillations induced by application of acetylcholine displayed a higher peak power, a reduced peak frequency and a shortened induction latency, whereas the Q factor did not change. In the prefrontal cortex, co-application of carbachol and kainate induced two types of network activity in sham animals: continuous gamma oscillations and alternating alpha/gamma oscillations. In MK-801-treated animals, the alternating pattern completely disappeared, and only continuous gamma oscillations could be detected, possessing an increased peak power, decreased peak frequency and decreased Q factor. Alpha oscillations recorded in MK-801-treated animals also had a significantly lower Q factor. In conclusion, our data suggest that NMDA receptor antagonists fundamentally alter the power, peak frequency, dynamics and periodicity of neuronal oscillations in the alpha and gamma frequency band.",
