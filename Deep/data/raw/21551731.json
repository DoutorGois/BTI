     "AB": "The aim of the present paper was to ascertain whether experimental hyperthyroidism promotes the regenerative action of predegenerated peripheral nerve grafts implanted into the transected hippocampus. Hyperthyroidism was induced by subcutaneous injections of T4. Autologous peripheral nerve grafts were implanted immediately, 7 and 35 days following transection of the sciatic nerve. Cells extending their neurites into the grafts were traced by means of horseradish peroxidase conjugated with fluoresceine isothiocyanate (FITC-HRP). Fluorescence microscope examination revealed that experimentally induced hyperthyroidism considerably enhanced the regenerative influence of peripheral nerve grafts. This effect was particularly pronounced in hyperthyrotic animals treated with either nonpredegenerated or 35 day predegenerated nerve grafts.",
