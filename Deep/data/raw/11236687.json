     "AB": "AIM AND METHODS: A chronic stress model in 21 days with multi-stressors was applied to question the effects of stress on the learning and memory ability and the hippocampal neuronal synaptic plasticity in rats, using the Y maze test and LTP electrophysiological recording in vivo. RESULTS: The impairment of spatial learning and memory ability and an obvious suppression in LTP in hippocampal dentate gyrus was observed in stress group after chronic stress. CONCLUSION: The hippocampal synaptic plasticity may be decreased by the chronic stress. And then, the learning and memory ability may also be impaired consequently.",
