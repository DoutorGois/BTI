     "AB": "Theta-frequency (4-12 Hz) electroencephalographic activity is thought to play a role in mechanisms mediating sensory and mnemonic processing in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, but the effects of acetylcholine on excitatory synaptic inputs to the entorhinal cortex are not well understood. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked by stimulation of the piriform (olfactory) cortex were recorded in the medial entorhinal cortex during behaviors associated with theta activity (active mobility) and were compared with those recorded during nontheta behaviors (awake immobility and slow wave sleep). Synaptic responses were smaller during behavioral activity than during awake immobility and sleep, and responses recorded during movement were largest during the negative phase of the theta rhythm. Systemic administration of cholinergic agonists reduced the amplitude of fEPSPs, and the muscarinic receptor blocker scopolamine strongly enhanced fEPSPs, suggesting that the theta-related suppression of fEPSPs is mediated in part by cholinergic inputs. The reduction in fEPSPs was investigated using in vitro intracellular recordings of EPSPs in Layer II neurons evoked by stimulation of Layer I afferents. Constant bath application of the muscarinic agonist carbachol depolarized membrane potential and suppressed EPSP amplitude in Layer II neurons. The suppression of EPSPs was not associated with a substantial change in input resistance, and could not be accounted for by a depolarization-induced reduction in driving force on the EPSP. The GABA(A) receptor-blocker bicuculline (50 microM) did not prevent the cholinergic suppression of EPSPs, suggesting that the suppression is not dependent on inhibitory mechanisms. Paired-pulse facilitation of field and intracellular EPSPs were enhanced by carbachol, indicating that the suppression is likely due to inhibition of presynaptic glutamate release. These results indicate that, in addition to well known effects on postsynaptic conductances that increase cellular excitability, cholinergic activation in the entorhinal cortex results in a strong reduction in strength of excitatory synaptic inputs from the piriform cortex.",
