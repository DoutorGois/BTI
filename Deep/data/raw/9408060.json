The duration of the CA1 epileptiform bursting produced by 0.05 mM picrotoxin or 1 mM penicillin or 0.075 mM ACPD was significantly (p<0.05) and dose-dependently decreased by 0.3-0.5 mM MCPG or L-AP3, but not by 0.05 mM ACPD. The data demonstrate an involvement of class I and II mGLURs in the basal neuronal excitability and in the expression of in vitro epileptiform activity produced by some convulsants.",
