     "AB": "Accumulating evidence indicates that extensive microglia activation-mediated local inflammation contributes to neuronal injury in cerebral ischemia. We have previously shown that 4-(2-butyl-6, 7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-indan-1-on-5-yl) oxobutyric acid (DCPIB), a potent volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) inhibitor, suppresses pathological glutamate release and excitatory neurotoxicity in reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (rMCAO) model in vivo. In the present study, we sought to determine whether DCPIB also attenuates microglia activation that could contribute to neuronal injury in the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion pathology. We show that oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) induced microglia proliferation, migration, and secretion of cytokines and all these pathological changes were effectively inhibited by DCPIB in vitro. In the microglia/neuron co-cultures, OGD induced neuronal damage was reduced markedly in the presence of DCPIB. In rat rMCAO animal model, DCPIB significantly attenuated microglia activation and neuronal death. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is known to be a critical signaling pathway for microglia activation. We further explored a potential involvement of DCPIB in this pathway by western blot analysis. Under the conditions that MAPK pathway was activated either by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or OGD, the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, JNK and p38 were reduced significantly in the presence of DCPIB. Altogether, our study demonstrated that DCPIB inhibits microglia activation potently under ischemic conditions both in vitro and in vivo. The DCPIB effect is likely attributable to both direct inhibition VRAC and indirect inhibition of MAPK pathway in microglia that are beneficial for the survival of neurons in cerebral ischemic conditions.",
