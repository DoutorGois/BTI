     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation necrosis remains an irreversible long-term side-effect following radiotherapy to the brain. The ability to predict areas that could ultimately develop into necrosis could lead to prevention and management of radiation necrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fischer 344 rats were irradiated using two platforms (micro-CT irradiator and x-Rad 225 IGRT) with radiation up to 30 Gy for the micro-CT and 40 Gy for the xRAD-224 to half the brain. Animals were subsequently imaged using a 9.4 T MRI scanner every 2-4 weeks for up to 28 weeks using a 7-echo gradient echo sequence. The apparent transverse relaxation constant ([Formula: see text]) was calculated and retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Animals irradiated with the low-dose rate micro-CT did not exhibit any symptoms or imaging changes associated with RN. Animals irradiated with the xRAD-225 exhibited imaging changes consistent with RN at week 24. Analysis of the [Formula: see text] coefficient within the lesion and hippocampus shows the potential for detection of RN up to 10 weeks prior to morphological changes. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to predict areas of RN and increases of [Formula: see text] within the hippocampus provides a method for long-term monitoring and prediction of RN.",
