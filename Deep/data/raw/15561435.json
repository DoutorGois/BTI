     "AB": "Toluene, a representative member of the large class of abused inhalants, decreases neuronal activity and depresses behavior in both animals and humans. The sites of action of toluene are not completely known but recent studies suggest that ion channels that regulate neuronal excitability may be particularly sensitive. Previous studies with recombinant receptors showed that toluene decreases currents carried by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-glutamate receptors without affecting those gated by non-NMDA receptors. In addition, toluene increases currents generated by GABA and glycine receptors. In the present study, primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were used to investigate the effects of acute and chronic toluene exposure on native excitatory and inhibitory ligand-gated ion channels. Toluene dose-dependently inhibited NMDA-mediated currents (IC50 1.5 mM) but had no effect on responses evoked by the non-NMDA agonist kainic acid. Prolonged treatment of neurons with toluene (1 mM; 4 days) increased whole-cell responses to exogenously applied NMDA, reduced those evoked by GABA but did not alter responses generated by kainic acid. Immunoblot analysis revealed that prolonged toluene exposure increased levels of NR2A and NR2B NMDA receptor subunits with no change in NR1. Immunohistochemical analysis with confocal imaging showed that toluene-treated neurons had significant increases in the density of NR1 subunits as compared with control neurons. Toluene exposure increased the amplitude of synaptic NMDA currents and decreased those activated by GABA. The results from this study suggest that toluene induces compensatory responses in the functional expression of ion channels that regulate neuronal excitability.",
