     "AB": "The characteristics of the binding of [3H]paroxetine, a selective serotonin (5-HT) uptake blocker, were investigated in human brain. The Kd value was 0.23 +/- 0.07 nM, and the Bmax value was 190 +/- 39 fmol/mg protein in the putamen. The capacity of various antidepressive drugs to inhibit [3H]paroxetine-specific binding in human brain was well correlated with their capacity to inhibit [3H]5-HT uptake in rat brain. The highest concentrations of [3H]paroxetine-specific binding sites were found in the substantia nigra, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Lower values were obtained in the basal ganglia and the thalamus. The specific binding was very low in cerebral and cerebellar cortices. The regional distribution of [3H]paroxetine binding sites differs from that of [3H]ketanserin binding to S2 serotonin receptors. The subcellular distribution of the [3H]paroxetine-specific binding sites obtained by differential centrifugation revealed a synaptosomal enrichment in the frontal cortex and striatum, whereas an enrichment in the microsomal fraction was found in striatum. The results show that [3H]paroxetine is a ligand of choice to label the 5-HT uptake molecular complex in human brain.",
