     "AB": "In the present study effect of dietary restriction (DR) on neuronal plasticity markers neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and its polysialylated form PSA-NCAM and astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was assessed following brain injury by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid or physiological saline in adult male wistar rats. After 7-day recovery period, rats were sacrificed to study the NCAM-ir, PSA-NCAM-ir, and GFAP-ir in all the groups with immunohistofluorescence and immunoblotting. We noticed increase in NCAM and PSA-NCAM expression after KA excitotoxicity, and DR enhanced this increase in NCAM and PSA-NCAM expression. A marked increase in NCAM and PSA-NCAM-ir was observed in CA3 region of hippocampus, subgranular region and hilus of dentate gyrus, hypothalamus, and piriform cortex in both vehicle treated as well KA-treated DR rats as compared to vehicle and KA-treated AL rats, respectively. Whenever, CNS is damaged it undergoes an injury response called reactive gliosis. Our study confirmed the neuroprotective role of DR as evident from attenuation of GFAP-ir and enhanced levels of neuronal plasticity markers NCAM and PSA-NCAM. The potential beneficial role of DR regimen in attenuating KA-induced reactive astrogliosis and enhancing expression of neuronal plasticity markers may point the way to new strategies of intervention therapy by DR that will facilitate recovery from ageing and disease related neuronal dysfunction and enhance restorative processes by modulating astrogliosis.",
