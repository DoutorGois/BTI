     "AB": "Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are trophic factors, widely distributed in the adult brain, whose expression can be modulated by psychoactive drugs. Administration of the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine resulted in a marked elevation of FGF-2 and BDNF mRNA levels in the rat hippocampus, but only under conditions of reduced NMDA receptor activity. These effects were drug-specific, given that they were not observed with the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol; and anatomically defined, since no similar effect was observed in striatum, prefrontal or frontal cortex. These results suggest that quetiapine may promote neuroplasticity via the up-regulation of neurotrophic factors when NMDA-mediated transmission is perturbed.",
