     "AB": "The present study examined the in vivo role of Rnd2, a Rho family small GTPase, in brain development. Rnd2 was expressed by radially migrating cells, which primarily develop to pyramidal neurons, during their stay in the subventricular zone of embryonic cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Exogenous expression of wild-type and a constitutively active Rnd2, but not a negative mutant of Rnd2, in radially migrating cells by in utero electroporation disturbed their morphology and migration to upper layers. These results indicate that Rnd2 functions in vivo as a regulator of the migration and morphological changes associated with the development of pyramidal neurons.",
