     "AB": "Mammalian protein kinase D (PKD) isoforms have been proposed to regulate diverse biological processes, including the establishment and maintenance of neuronal polarity. To investigate the function of PKD in neuronal polarization in vivo, we generated PKD knockout (KO) mice. Here, we show that the brain, particularly the hippocampus, of both PKD1 KO and PKD2 KO mice was similar to that of control animals. Neurite length in cultured PKD1 KO and PKD2 KO hippocampal neurons was similar to that of wild-type neurons. However, hippocampal neurons deficient in both PKD1 and PKD2 genes showed a reduction in axonal elongation and an increase in the percentage of neurons with multiple axons relative to control neurons. These results reveal that whereas PKD1 and PKD2 are essential for neuronal polarity, there exists a functional redundancy between the two proteins.",
