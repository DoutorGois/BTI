     "AB": "cDNAs encoding gamma-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-T) were isolated from a lambda ZAP rat hippocampal cDNA expression library by two independent cloning methods, immunological screening with an antimouse GABA-T antibody and plaque hybridization with a GABA-T cDNA probe derived by polymerase chain reaction. We have produced enzymatically active GABA-T from a rat brain cDNA containing the full-length GABA-T coding region. Our rat brain GABA-T cDNAs hybridize to mRNAs in brain and peripheral tissues, including liver, kidney, and testis. We have also detected GABA-T mRNA in GABAergic cells of rat cerebellar cortex by in situ hybridization. Our rat brain GABA-T probe hybridizes to Purkinje, basket, stellate, and Golgi II cells, the same GABAergic neurons previously shown to contain glutamate decarboxylase GAD65 and GAD67.",
