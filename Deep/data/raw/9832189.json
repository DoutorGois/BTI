     "AB": "The effects of cholinergic agonists on nitric oxide (NO) release in hippocampal slices from male Sprague-Dawley rats were investigated using electrochemical recording procedures using Nafion and O-phenylenediamine-treated carbon fiber microelectrodes. These microelectrodes are highly selective for NO versus other interferents. Acetylcholine (Ach) with neostigmine, or nicotine was delivered by pressure ejection from pipettes placed within 300 microm of the NO sensors. Both Ach and nicotine produced NO signals ranging from 0.04 to 2.14 microM in the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus that lasted for 2-5 min. The Ach responses were not antagonized by the muscarinic antagonist atropine. However, nicotine-evoked responses were partially antagonized by alpha-bungarotoxin, a finding consistent with alpha7-nicotinic cholinergic receptors being involved with the effects of nicotine. These data support the hypothesis that nicotine is capable of evoking long lasting NO release in the hippocampus.",
