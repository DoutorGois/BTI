     "AB": "Although high-fat diet intake is known to cause obesity and diabetes, the effect of high-fat diet itself on cognitive function remains to be clarified. We have previously shown that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is responsible for cognitive impairment caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. The present work, by using ASK1 deficient mice, was undertaken to explore the influence of chronic high-fat diet intake on cognitive function and the role of ASK1. Cognitive function in wild-type mice fed high-fat diet from 2 to 24 months of age was significantly impaired compared to those fed control diet, which was associated with the significant white matter lesions, reduction of hippocampal capillary density, and decrement of hippocampal neuronal cell. However, ASK1 deficiency abolished the development of cognitive impairment and cerebral injury caused by high-fat diet. Our results provided the evidence that high-fat diet itself causes cognitive impairment and ASK1 participates in such cognitive impairment.",
