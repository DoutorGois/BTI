     "AB": "Quantitative in situ hybridization and northern blot analysis techniques were used to determine the effects of removal of the cholinergic input on levels and topographical distribution of brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in the hippocampus of adult rats. First, the effects of partial and full fimbrial transections, which result in partial and near-total cholinergic deafferentation respectively, were compared. Twenty-one days after partial unilateral fimbrial transections, there were significant decreases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA expression throughout the hippocampal formation. Decreased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA was evident in all areas of localization within the hippocampal formation. The decreases amounted to 22-36% reductions compared with unlesioned control animals. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels were decreased to a greater extent (50-69%) following full unilateral fimbrial transections. Quantitative northern blot analysis indicated that hippocampal BDNF mRNA was decreased by 29 and 68%, three weeks after partial or full unilateral fimbrial transections, respectively. The extent of the reductions in brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels correlated with reductions in acetylcholinesterase staining density and cholinergic terminal density determined by quantitative autoradiographic analysis of [3H]vesamicol binding sites. Second, we found that chronic treatment with atropine (20 mg/kg per day for 14 days) decreased (by 54%) brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels in all areas of localization within the hippocampus. In contrast, chronic treatment with nicotine (1.18 mg/kg per day for 14 days), a treatment known to desensitize nicotinic receptors, did not affect brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA expression in the hippocampal formation. The findings provide evidence for cholinergic muscarinic regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA expression in the adult rat hippocampal formation and they suggest the existence of a tonic stimulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor synthesis by the cholinergic afferents.",
