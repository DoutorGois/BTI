     "AB": "The aim of this study was to investigate the possible relationship between changes in neuronal and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (nNOS and eNOS) and arginase expression in the vestibular nucleus complex and the hippocampus (CA1, CA2/3 and the dentate gyrus (DG) at 10 h or 2 weeks following a unilateral vestibular deafferentation (UVD) in rats. There were no significant differences in nNOS or arginase II expression in the ipsilateral or contralateral VNC at either 10 h or 2 weeks post-UVD. For eNOS, there was only a significant decrease in expression in the ipsilateral VNC at 2 weeks post-UVD (P<0.01). In the hippocampus, the only significant difference in nNOS expression was a decrease in the ipsilateral DG at 2 weeks post-UVD (P<0.05). There was a significant decrease in eNOS expression in the contralateral CA2/3 region at 10 h post-UVD (P<0.01). The only other significant change in eNOS was an increase in the contralateral DG at 10 h post-UVD (P<0.01). Although arginase II was expressed in all regions of the hippocampus, there were no significant differences in arginase II expression at any time point following UVD. These results suggest that the changes in NOS expression that occur in the VNC and hippocampus following UVD are not correlated with one another or with changes in arginase II.",
