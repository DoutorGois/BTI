     "AB": "Calcineurin, protein phosphatase 2B, is a calcium-binding protein that has been shown to modulate NMDA receptor activity (Regulation of NMDA channel function by endogenous Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase. Nature 369 (1994) 235; Regulation of glycine-insensitive desensitisation of the NMDA receptor in outside-out patches. J. Neurophysiol. 71 (1994) 754; Calcineurin acts via the C-terminus of NR2A to modulate desensitization of NMDA receptors. Neuropharmacology 42 (2002) 593) and synaptic transmission (Synaptic desensitization of NMDA receptors by calcineurin. Science 267 (1995) 1510; beta-adrenergic regulation of synaptic NMDA receptors by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Neuron 16 (1996) 415). Calmodulin, a necessary co-factor for calcineurin (Calmodulin binding by calcineurin. J. Biol. Chem. 262 (1987) 15062), has also been shown to inhibit NMDA receptor activity (Inactivation of NMDA receptors by direct interaction of calmodulin with the NR1 subunit. Cell 84 (1996) 745; Direct effects of calmodulin on NMDA receptor single-channel gating in rat hippocampal granule cells. J. Neurosci. 22 (2002) 8860) in a calcium dependent manner (Calmodulin mediates calcium-dependent inactivation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. Neuron 21 (1998) 443; Interactions of calmodulin and alpha-actinin with the NR1 subunit modulate calcium-dependent inactivation of NMDA receptors. J. Neurosci. 19 (1999) 1165). In order to gain insight into the likely actions and interactions of calcineurin and calmodulin at excitatory synapses, we have investigated the effects of these two proteins on single NMDA receptor channel activity. Calcineurin and calmodulin are both known to reduce channel open time (Regulation of NMDA channel function by endogenous Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase. Nature 369 (1994) 235; Inactivation of NMDA receptors by direct interaction of calmodulin with the NR1 subunit. Cell 84 (1996) 745), and the duration of receptor activations or superclusters. They are, therefore, predicted to shorten the synaptic current decay (Regulation of NMDA channel function by endogenous Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase. Nature 369 (1994) 235; Direct effects of calmodulin on NMDA receptor single-channel gating in rat hippocampal granule cells. J. Neurosci. 22 (2002) 8860). In agreement with Lieberman and Mody (Regulation of NMDA channel function by endogenous Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase. Nature 369 (1994) 235), the results of this study indicate calcineurin plus calmodulin reduces channel open time. However, this effect is not as pronounced as that observed in the presence of calmodulin alone. Calcineurin plus calmodulin was also found to increase single channel shut time. We conclude that in addition to its direct effects on single channel activity, calcineurin regulates the effects of calmodulin on NMDA receptor activity.",
