     "AB": "Noda epileptic rat (NER) is a new epileptic rat strain, which was developed by inbreeding rats with spontaneous tonic-clonic seizures in a stock of Crj:Wistar. In the present study, possible changes of two neuropeptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), in the brains of NER were investigated. Increased contents of immunoreactive (IR) NPY were found in the striatum and amygdala of 8-week NERs with partial seizure, while these changes extended to the limbic region including hippocampus in 16-week NERs with fully developed generalized tonic-clonic seizure. IR-CRF were elevated only in the entorhinal and pyriform cortex of both 8-week and 16-week NERs. Generalized tonic-clonic seizure in NERs induced a transient increase of NPY mRNA in the granular layer of dentate gyrus. These results suggest that NPY metabolism in the limbic brain contributes to the seizure susceptibility in this model of epilepsy.",
