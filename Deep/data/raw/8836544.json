We examined BDNF and NGF mRNA levels in several brain areas of adult male rats following 0, 2, 4, or 7 nights with ad libitum access to running wheels. BDNF mRNA was significantly increased in several brain areas, most notably in the hippocampus and caudal 1/3 of cerebral cortex following 2, 4, and 7 nights with exercise. Significant elevations in BDNF mRNA were localized in Ammon's horn areas 1 (CA1) and 4 (CA4) of the hippocampus, and layers II-III of the caudal neocortex and retrosplenial cortex. NGF mRNA was also significantly elevated in the hippocampus and caudal 1/3 of the cortex, affecting primarily the dentate gyrus granular layer (DG) and CA4 of the hippocampus and layers II-III in caudal neocortex.",
