     "AB": "Asphyxia was induced in male rat pups by performing a delayed cesarean section on pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats. Oxygen saturation and heart rate were recorded during induction of asphyxia. Animals were sacrificed at 3 weeks of age. Brain sections were stained for tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH), dopamine-and-cyclic-AMP-regulated-phosphoprotein-32 (DARPP-32) immunoreactivity (IR) and thionein. Increasing time of asphyxia caused a reduction in the number of nerve cell bodies in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus reflecting neuronal death. Furthermore, asphyxia resulted in an increased number of TH-IR nerve cell bodies indicative of a proliferation of dopaminergic neurons in the zona compacta of the substantia nigra. Finally, a significant decrease in rearing was observed in asphyctic animals during the habituation phase, as well as following apomorphine-induced (1 mg/kg s.c.) postsynaptic dopamine receptor stimulation. On the other hand, the apomorphine-induced increase in locomotion was enhanced in asphyctic animals. The implications of these findings for hyperkinesia and attention deficits in disorders resulting from asphyxia are discussed.",
