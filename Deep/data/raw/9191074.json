     "AB": "EHK-1 is a neuronal ELK-related receptor tyrosine kinase which interacts with multiple, membrane-anchored ligands. Recent experiments have suggested a role for some of these ligands in the formation of neuronal pathways. Here, we report the isolation of human EHK-1 cDNAs and the localization of the human EHK-1 gene to chromosome 4q12. Six EHK-1 mRNA splice variants encoding cell-surface receptors with catalytic domains were identified in adult human brain where a 120-kDa EHK-1 protein predominates. Immunohistochemistry for EHK-1 reveals a dendritic staining pattern in cortical neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells and a marked accumulation of EHK-1 in the somas of pyramidal neurons within the cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, we have identified lineage aberrant expression of EHK-1 in a number of human gliomas. In addition to functions during development, EHK-1 may be involved in the maintenance of the adult nervous system and contribute to glioma development.",
