     "AB": "The activity was measured of the acetylcholine catabolising enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in brain after necropsy of seven patients from one established pedigree with dominantly-inherited olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), a cerebellar ataxia disorder in which neuropathological changes are assumed to be primarily restricted to cerebellum, lower brain stem and spinal cord. Mean AChE activity was significantly reduced in cerebral (-51% to 65%) and cerebellar (-47%) cortex with a less severe change (-37%) in the hippocampus. The magnitude of the enzyme reduction in cerebral cortex was equal to or greater than that reported in brain of demented Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients having loss of AChE-containing nucleus basalis cholinergic neurons. It is concluded that the data provide additional biochemical evidence suggesting a cerebral cortical cholinergic denervation in OPCA.",
