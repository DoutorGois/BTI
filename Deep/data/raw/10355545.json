     "AB": "Styrene was evaluated to determine its neurochemical effects in the offspring of rats exposed during the gestation period. Maternal Wistar rats were exposed to 0, 50 or 300 ppm styrene during gestation days 6 to 20 and the neurochemical effects on their offspring were compared with their pair-feeding and ad lib. feeding controls. The cerebrum weights at birth on day 0 were significantly lower than those for an ad lib. feeding control group. Neurotransmitter analyses showed decreases of neuroamines, especially 5-hydroxytryptamine and homovanillic acid in the cerebrum of newborn offspring of dams receiving a 300 ppm styrene exposure compared with the ad lib. fed control group and homovanillic acid was also decreased compared to the pair-feeding control. On postnatal day 21, the styrene-exposure pups showed a significant decrease of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the frontal neocortex compared with the ad lib. control group. In the hippocampus a significant decrease of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid was observed compared with both control groups. Moreover, the ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT in the hippocampus was significantly decreased among the styrene-exposure groups. The 50 ppm styrene exposed group induced increase of concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the striatum. These results suggest that prenatal styrene exposure affects the developing fetal brain in terms of a few signs of neurochemical alteration.",
