     "AB": "The effect of paired successive electrical stimulation of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus head and mediodorsal nucleus of thalamus on the delayed spatial choice was studied in two rhesus monkeys. During the first second of delay one structure was stimulated, during its last second--another one. It was found that some combinations of paired successive stimulation interfere with the precision of solving the experimental problem by animals. The obtained results are discussed with regard to the complex temporal dynamics of brain structures interactions during short-term memorizing.",
