     "AB": "Senile plaques, neurofibrillary change and granulovacuolar degeneration characterize Alzheimer's disease (presenile dementia) and senile dementia and are also seen in the aged human brain. The development of these lesions was studied in 13 patients with Down's syndrome, ages 12 to 65, with the purpose of defining similarities and dissimilarities, if any, between their morphologies in these four conditions. Evaluation by light and, when applied, electron microscopy established apparent identities. The findings suggest that Down's syndrome, with its partially characterized genotypic and phenotypic abnormalities, is an appropriate model for the study of the pathogenesis of these lesions.",
