     "AB": "AIM: To explore the expression of Fas and FasL genes after ischemia-reperfusion in rats and the effect of flunarizine. METHODS: Ischemia was induced by four-vessel occlusion for 30 min following reperfusion in rats. The biopsy tissues from brain were immunohistochemically assayed with Fas and FasL genes polyclonal antibody. RESULTS: The expression of Fas was increased as early as 6 h after the onset of reperfusion. The peak of the expression of Fas occurred 24-48 h after ischemia-reperfusion. The expression of FasL was observed 12 h after ischemia-reperfusion and peaked at 48-72 h. The expression of Fas and FasL gene was quite obvious in the cortex and hippocampus CA1, the more sensitive areas to ischemic injury. Flunarizine i.p. 10 mg.kg-1 and 20 mg.kg-1 obviously inhibited the expression of Fas and FasL in dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Expression of Fas and FasL in cerebral cortex and hippocampus can be induced by global ischemia-reperfusion. Flunarizine significantly inhibited the expression of Fas and FasL genes following ischemia-reperfusion.",
