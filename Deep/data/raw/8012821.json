     "AB": "The distribution of high-affinity binding sites for the histamine H3 agonist [3H]-N alpha-methylhistamine ([3H]NAMH, 4 nM) in the rat brain was examined by autoradiography. Binding in all brain regions was displaceable with the H3 antagonist thioperamide (2 microM). The pattern of H3 binding was heterogeneous: highest levels were in the striatum and substantia nigra, which receives sparse histaminergic innervations. Intermediate H3 binding was present in neocortex and diencephalon, while low binding was evident in the medial septum and dorsal hippocampus. Hitherto unreported H3 binding sites were noted in the dorsolateral tegmentum and in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Because the NTS receives a dense histaminergic innervation, [3H]NAMH binding in the NTS was further studied by Scatchard analysis. The presence of saturable binding (Bmax = 10 +/- 4 fmol/mg, Kd = 0.6 +/- 0.3 nM, n = 3) suggested that histamine may act via H3 receptors in the NTS.",
