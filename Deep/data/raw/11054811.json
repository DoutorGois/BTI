     "AB": "In the mature hippocampus, kainic acid seizures lead to excitotoxic cell death and synaptic reorganization in which granule cell axons (mossy fibers) form ectopic synapses on granule cell dendrites. In the present study, we examined the expression of four major, developmentally regulated protein kinase C (PKC) substrates (MARCKS, MLP, GAP-43, RC3), which have different subcellular and regional localizations in the hippocampus at several time points (6 hr, 12 hr, 18 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, 5 days, or 15 days) following kainic acid seizures using in situ hybridization. Consistent with previous reports, following kainate seizures, GAP-43 mRNA expression exhibited a delayed and protracted elevation in the granule cell layer, which peaked at 24 hr, whereas expression in fields CA1 and CA3 remained relatively unchanged. Conversely, RC3 mRNA expression exhibited a delayed reduction in the granule cell layer that was maximal at 18 hr, as well as a reduction CA1 at 48 hr, whereas CA3 levels did not change. MARCKS mRNA expression in the granule cell layer and CA1 remained stable following kainate, although an elevation was observed in subfield CA3c at 12 hr. Similarly, MLP mRNA expression did not change in the granule cell layer or CA1 following kainate but exhibited a protracted elevation in subfields CA3b,c beginning at 6 hr post-kainate. Collectively these data demonstrate that different PKC substrate mRNAs exhibit unique expression profiles and regulation in the different cell fields of the mature hippocampus following kainic acid seizures and during subsequent synaptic reorganization. The expression profiles following kainate seizures bear resemblance to those observed during postnatal hippocampal development, which may indicate the recruitment of common regulatory mechanisms.",
