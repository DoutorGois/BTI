     "AB": "We investigated the effect of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) ligands on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in CA1 of rat hippocampus, in particular the manner by which the nonsubtype selective mGluR ligand alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine [(+)-MCPG] blocks LTP induction. Normalized control LTP was blocked by (+)-MCPG (250 microM), but not by the mGluRI selective antagonist (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine (4-CPG), the mGluRII selective antagonist 1/(2S,3S, 4S)-2-methyl-2-(carboxycyclopropyl) glycine (MCCG), or the mGluRIII antagonist (S)-2-amino-2-methyl-4-phosphonobutanoic acid/alpha-methyl (MAP4). In contrast the mGluRII agonist ((1S, 3S)-1-aminocyclopentante-1,3-dicarboxylic acid -(1S,3S)-ACPD-; 10 or 25 microM) completely and consistently blocked LTP. The block of LTP by both (1S,3S)-ACPD and (+)-MCPG could be prevented by preincubation with the mGluRII antagonist MCCG. These studies demonstrate that (+)-MCPG blocks LTP induction through an agonist action at an mGluRII receptor and not through a nonselective antagonist action.",
