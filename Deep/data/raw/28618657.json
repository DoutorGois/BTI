     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity is a well-established pathological feature of major depression, accompanied by the persistent increase of glucocorticoid level and the dysfunction of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) is one of the most active ingredients of Panax ginseng, which has various biological activity. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the antidepressive effects of Rg1 and elucidate its impact on neuroendocrine system. METHODS: The antidepressive effects of Rg1 were first analysed in mice, and was further identified in the chronic-unpredictable-mild-stress (CUMS) model and the gonadectomized (GDX) model. The effects of Rg1 on depression-like behaviour were analysed by the forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), sucrose preference test, and measurement of pentobarbital-induced sleep. The serum corticosterone and testosterone levels were detected by ELISA. The protein levels of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) were analysed by western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis. RESULTS: Rg1 significantly decreased the immobility time of mice in FST and TST. Furthermore, Rg1 alleviated anhedonia and hopelessness, decreased serum corticosterone level, and increased serum testosterone level, and the GR protein level in the PFC and hippocampus of the CUMS-treated rats. Moreover, Rg1 improved sleep disruption, down-regulated the serum corticosterone level, and increased AR protein level in the PFC of the GDX-treated mice. CONCLUSION: Together, these studies suggest that Rg1 displayed antidepressant activity through the modulation of the HPA and the HPG axis. These findings provide new mechanism involved in the antidepressive effects of Rg1 and propose theoretical clues for clinical therapies.",
