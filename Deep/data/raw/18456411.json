     "AB": "Nicotine is attractive as an analgesic component despite that its antinociceptive mechanism is not well known until now. In the present study, we examined the antinociceptive effect of nicotine administered supra-spinally on acetic acid-induced visceral pain induction (writhing test), and found that the antinociceptive effect of nicotine was abolished by mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptor antagonist administered i.c.v. In addition, s.c. 5% formalin pretreatment at 5 h, 20 h, 40 h, and 1 week prior to i.c.v. nicotine injection abolished the antinociceptive effect of nicotine in the writhing test, suggesting that s.c. formalin pretreatment induced tolerance to the antinociceptive effect of nicotine in the supra-spinal region. Furthermore, neuronal loss of the hippocampal cornus ammonis (CA) 3 region reduced nicotine-induced an antinociceptive effect in the writhing test. In Western blot assay, we examined s.c. formalin injection down-regulated mu-opioid receptor in the hippocampus after 40 h, and its effect was maintained for 1 week. However, various acetylcholine receptor subunits and delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors were not altered. These results suggest that s.c. formalin pretreatment can contribute to induce tolerance on nicotine-induced antinociception as down-regulating mu-opioid receptor in the hippocampus, especially 40 h after s.c. formalin injection.",
