     "AB": "Adult male Wistar rats were bilaterally implanted with indwelling cannulae in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus. Once recovered from surgery, animals were submitted to one session of step-down inhibitory avoidance training (3.0 s, 0.4 mA footshock). Animals received a 0.5-microl infusion of saline, or of LY294002 (5, 50 or 500 microM), an inhibitor of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) family. Infusions were given 10 min before training, immediately post-training or 10 min prior to a 24-h retention test. In the pre- and post-training groups, the animals were tested twice: at 1.5 and 24 h after training, for short- (STM) and long-term memory (LTM), respectively. Pre- and post-training infusion of the drug inhibited both STM and LTM. Pre-test infusions impaired LTM retrieval. The effects can not be attributed to influences on locomotor, exploratory, pro- or anti-conflict behaviour, since LY294002 had no influence on elevated plus-maze behaviour. The results suggest that hippocampal PI 3-K is necessary for memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of the consolidation of step-down inhibitory avoidance in rats. This could be due to an interaction with the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex or with activity of the extracellularly regulated protein kinase (ERK)-Ras signalling pathway.",
