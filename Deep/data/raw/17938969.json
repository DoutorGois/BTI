     "AB": "New neurons continue to be generated in two privileged areas of the adult brain: the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation and the olfactory bulb. Adult neurogenesis has been found in all mammals studied to date, including humans. The process of adult neurogenesis encompasses the proliferation of resident neural stem and progenitor cells and their subsequent differentiation, migration, and functional integration into the pre-existing circuitry. This article summarizes recent findings regarding the developmental steps involved in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and the possible functional roles that new hippocampal neurons might play.",
