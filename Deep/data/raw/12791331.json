     "PG": "291-7",
     "AB": "Bilateral symmetrical hippocampal atrophy (BHA) has been implicated as a possible causal element in various neuropsychiatric disorders, in particular depressive disorder and schizophrenia. To test the hypothesis that bilateral symmetrical severe volume loss of the hippocampi is of causal relevance to these psychiatric syndromes rather than an epiphenomenon we assessed the psychopathology in a group of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and very severe bilateral symmetrical hippocampal atrophy and compared it with that of a patient control group. Patients with TLE and hippocampal volumes smaller than three standard deviations below the mean of a control population were identified and compared with a matched patient population with normal hippocampal volumes. Psychopathology was assessed by blinded trained psychiatrists using the Present State Examination and Neurobehavioral Inventory. The prevalence of psychiatric syndromes was high in both patient groups; however, there was no significant difference between the two groups. With use of the more specific Neurobehavioral Inventory a psychopathological pattern reminiscent of the Geschwind syndrome emerged when patients with BHA were characterized by caregivers. While BHA does not result in an increased prevalence of specific psychiatric syndromes, specific symptoms that characterize the Geschwind syndrome like hypergraphia and hyposexuality might be pathogenically related to hippocampal atrophy.",
