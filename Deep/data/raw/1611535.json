     "AB": "To clarify monoaminergic regulation of acetylcholine (ACh) release in the rat hippocampus, the effects of administration of monoamines through a dialysis probe on extracellular ACh levels were examined using in vivo brain microdialysis combined with a novel column-switching HPLC system. Infusion of dopamine or 5-hydroxytryptamine, but not noradrenaline, increased ACh levels. The ACh levels also increased following infusion of apomorphine and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine. These results demonstrate that hippocampal ACh release is regulated by dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine.",
