     "AB": "Beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition likely plays a causal role in the lesions that occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 is widely prescribed in the treatment of cognitive deficits that are associated with normal and pathological brain aging such as AD. We have investigated here the potential effectiveness of EGb 761 against cell death produced by Abeta fragments on primary cultures of hippocampal cells, these cells being severely damaged in AD. A co-treatment with EGb 761 protected cells against toxicity induced by Abeta fragments in a concentration dependent manner. The effect of EGb 761 was even significant if added up to 8 hr to cells and was shared by its flavonoid fraction CP 205, whereas the terpenes bilobalide and ginkgolide B were ineffective. EGb 761 also displayed protective effects against toxicity produced by either H2O2 or nitric oxide, two neurotoxic agents that possibly mediate Abeta toxicity. Moreover, EGb 761, and to a lesser extent CP 205, completely blocked Abeta-induced events, such as reactive oxygen species accumulation and apoptosis. Taken together, these results and those obtained by other groups highlight the neuroprotective abilities of EGb 761 against dysfunction and death of neurons caused by Abeta deposits.",
