We find that DAMP is more sharply localized and that the immunocytochemical reaction is stronger when horseradish peroxidase or other proteins are included in the medium used to administer DAMP to the cells. A likely explanation is that the proteins enter acidified endocytic compartments and there provide sites to which DAMP molecules can be attached during fixation.",
