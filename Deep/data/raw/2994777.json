     "AB": "A study was made of the density and affinity of benzodiazepine receptors in the cortex of the cerebral hemispheres and hippocampus of rats with different predisposition to alcohol consumption. No differences were revealed in the parameters under study in animals with varying duration of ethanol anesthesia and in rats after voluntary consumption of ethanol for 3.5 and 10 months. In a state of abstinence rats with physical dependence manifested a dramatic decrease in the density and affinity of benzodiazepine receptors in the cortex of the cerebral hemispheres. No changes described were detected in the hippocampus. The role of benzodiazepine receptors in the development of abstinence is discussed.",
