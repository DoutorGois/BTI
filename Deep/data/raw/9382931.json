     "AB": "Using the Monte Carlo method, spontaneous fast excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) at a hippocampal synapse were simulated by releasing 150-20,000 glutamate molecules from a point source centred 15 nm above a rectangular grid of 14 x 14 alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-methyl-isoxazole (AMPA) receptors and assuming the channel kinetics to be as reported by Jonas et al. [J Physiol (Lond) 472:615; 1993]. The relationship between the amplitudes of mEPSCs and their time constants of decay is positive, but not pronounced in physiological conditions (except when the number of molecules released is very high). It increases as desensitization is reduced and becomes highly pronounced when it is eliminated. mEPSCs are prolonged with repeated opening of AMPA channels due to enhancement of two concentration-dependent processes: (1) binding of glutamate molecules by AMPA receptors, and (2) occupancy of both activatable bound states. In contrast, the time constant of decay of the patch currents evoked by a short glutamate pulse is independent of glutamate concentration and current amplitude in control conditions, and only moderately concentration dependent in the absence of desensitization. The fast application protocol thus fails to reproduce synaptic currents reliably when there is repeated binding of glutamate molecules to AMPA receptors. During an mEPSC, the occupancy of desensitized states increases rapidly and it strongly depends on the number of glutamate molecules released. Desensitization reaches its maximum after an mEPSC decays to very low levels, and recovers very slowly (from tens to hundreds of milliseconds), and in a concentration-dependent manner. In conclusion, under physiological conditions the desensitization of AMPA receptors plays a major role in shaping the time course of mEPSCs by minimizing the repeated opening of AMPA channels.",
