     "AB": "The effects of glutamate (Glu) and melatonin (MEL) on the evoked populaion spike (PS) following stimulation of the schaffer collateral fiber were studied by extracellular recording technique in perfused slices of rat hippocampus: 5.0 mmol/L Glu decreased the PS peak values to 4.1% of control. This effect of Glu (5.0 mmol/L) on PS peak values was changed to 14.7%, 105.2% and 24.3% of control by 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 mumol/L of MEL. But when the interaction between MEL (0.5 mumol/L) and Glu (5.0 mmol/L) was entirely suppressed by CDP (0.5 mumol/L), the PS values reduced to zero. These results suggest that the inhibitory action of MEL on Glu-induced neurotoxicity may be mediated by 5-HT receptors.",
