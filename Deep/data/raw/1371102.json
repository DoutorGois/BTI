     "AB": "Large differences are usually observed when standard staining methods for a number of pathological lesions in neurodegenerative disorders are compared. With the modified thioflavine S method presented here (easy and cheap to perform), the morphological appearance of the stained neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and senile plaques (SP) is greatly improved. Furthermore, the intense contrast between stained lesions and background obtained with this technique permits an accurate automatic quantification of NFT and SP using a computer-assisted image analysis system.",
