     "AB": "The effect of dopamine receptor agonists on the spontaneous bioelectrical activity of CA1 layer neurons in the hippocampal slice preparation from the Acomys and rat has been studied. The selective D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 diminished the neuronal firing rate while the selective D2 receptor agonist LY 171555 (quinpirole) evoked an excitatory reaction, however, a great proportion of hippocampal neurons remained unresponsive to SKF 38393 and LY 171555. Both dopamine and apomorphine elicited mainly an increase in the neuronal discharge rate, the effect of the former having been antagonized by sulpiride. The present data reveal that the action of dopamine agonists on the hippocampal neurons of the Acomys generally resembles their activity on the rat hippocampal cells, however, the potency of dopamine and apomorphine in evoking the excitatory reaction is higher in the Acomys.",
