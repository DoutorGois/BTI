     "AB": "HIV-1 proteins, such as Tat and gp120, are believed to play a crucial role in the central nervous system (CNS) pathology of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The present study sought to determine the potential role of Tat and/or gp120 on behavioral development and the relationship to the long-term effects of the HIV-1 proteins on the rat hippocampus. Male pups of 13 Sprague-Dawley litters were bilaterally injected on postnatal day (P)1. Every litter contributed an animal to each of four treatment condition: VEH (0.5 microl sterile buffer), gp120 (100 ng), Tat (25 microg) or combined gp120+Tat (100 ng+25 microg). Body weight was not affected by either protein treatment. Tat revealed a transient effect on many of the behavioral assessments early in development as well as on preattentive processes and spatial memory in adulthood. Gp120 had more selective effects on negative geotaxis (P8-P10) and on locomotor activity (P94-P96). Combined gp120+Tat effects were noted for eye opening with potential interactive effects of gp120 and Tat on negative geotaxis. Anatomical assessment at approximately 7 1/2 months of age was conducted by using design-based stereology to quantify the total cell number in five hippocampal subregions [granule layer (GL), hilus of the dentate gyrus (DGH), cornu ammonis fields (CA)2/3, CA1, and subiculum (SUB)] [Fitting, S., Booze, R.M., Hasselrot, U., Mactutus, C.F., 2007a. Differential long-term neurotoxicity of HIV-1 proteins in the rat hippocampal formation: a design-based stereological study. Hippocampus 18(2), 135-147]. A relationship between early reflex development and estimated cell number in the adult hippocampus was indicated by simple regression analyses. In addition, estimated number of neurons and astrocytes in the DGH explained 81% of the variance of the distribution of searching behavior in the probe test. Collectively, these data indicate that the DGH may participate in the spatial memory alterations observed in adulthood consequent to neonatal exposure to HIV-1 proteins.",
