     "AB": "Immunohistochemical staining with mouse monoclonal antibody R24 recognizing the ganglioside GD3 was used to study the distribution of GD3 in the human brain. Positive staining was primarily found in the surrounding neuropil of many neuronal groups in the brainstem and spinal cord, cerebellum, retina and dentate gyrus of hippocampus. In addition, staining was found in ependymal cells and glial processes around blood vessels and in the subependymal region.",
