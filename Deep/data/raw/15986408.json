     "AB": "Concrete words, whose meanings are readily imagined, are better remembered than abstract words. However, the neural correlates of this effect are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of imageability on brain activity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) processes underlying recognition memory. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) via depth electrodes from within the MTL in 14 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Patients performed a continuous word recognition task with words of high and low imageability (controlled for word frequency). Behaviorally, recognition performance was better for high, compared to low, imageable words. Two ERP components associated with recognition memory, the AMTL-N400 and the hippocampal late negative component, showed an old/new effect, but only the hippocampal P600 showed a main effect of imageability. We suggest that the hippocampal effect of imageability in recognition memory may be associated with conceptual or pictorial information processing of concrete words.",
