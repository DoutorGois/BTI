     "AB": "The principal difference in the effect of the preparations investigated resided in the fact that the nootropic agents did not change the effect of painful reinforcement on the synchronicity of neurons of the cerebral cortex of rabbits of the inhibitory type (coincidence of both the presence and absence of impulse activity), and of the activational type (the time of coincidence of only the presence of impulse activity). Both preparations mainly attenuated the initial influences of both the inhibitory and reinforced conditional stimuli on the synchronicity in the activity of the cortical neurons of both the activational and the inhibitory types.",
