     "AB": "Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including mGluR5, play a central role in regulating the strength and plasticity of synaptic connections in the brain. However, the signaling pathways that connect mGluRs to their downstream effectors are not yet fully understood. Here, we report that stimulation of mGluR5 in hippocampal cultures and slices results in phosphorylation of protein kinase D (PKD) at the autophosphorylation site Ser-916. This phosphorylation event occurs within 30 s of stimulation, persists for at least 24 h, and is dependent on activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C. Our data suggest that activation of PKD may represent a novel signaling pathway linking mGluR5 to its downstream targets. These findings have important implications for the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying mGluR-dependent synaptic plasticity.",
