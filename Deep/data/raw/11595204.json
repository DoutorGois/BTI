     "AB": "Exogenously administered morphine can have both convulsive or anticonvulsive effects, depending on the dose and species. The levels of the endogenous opiate alkaloids morphine and codeine were significantly elevated in specific rat brain regions by the convulsive drug, pentylenetetrazole, as well as by the anticonvulsant drugs, carbamazepine and phenytoin. Morphine and codeine levels in peripheral tissues (heart, lung, spleen and adrenal) were unaffected by these drugs. Maximal increases in morphine levels were seen in the hypothalamus and striatum (2-10-fold), while lesser increases occurred in the midbrain and brain stem (2-4-fold). Codeine levels were also markedly increased in hypothalamus (5-10 fold), In contrast to morphine, codeine levels were also increased in the hippocampus (2-10-fold), but were unchanged in the striatum. These studies suggest that the endogenous alkaloids morphine and codeine are involved in the modulation of convulsions and that morphine and/or codeine may act as an endogenous anticonvulsant.",
