     "AB": "We have previously shown that, in HEK 293 cells, overexpression of acidic calponin, an actin-binding protein, induces remodeling of actin filaments, leading to a change in cell morphology. In addition, this protein is found in dendritic spines of adult hippocampal neurons. We hypothesized that this protein plays a role in regulating actin-based filaments during dendritic spine plasticity. To assess this hypothesis, the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy was selected because an important reorganization of the glutamatergic network, which includes an aberrant sprouting of granule cell axons, neo-synaptogenesis, and dendritic spine remodeling, is well established in the dentate gyrus. This reorganization begins after the initial period of status epilepticus after pilocarpine injection, during the silent period when animals display a normal behavior, and reaches a plateau at the chronic stage when the animals have developed spontaneous recurrent seizures. Our data show that the intensity of immunolabeling for acidic calponin was clearly increased in the inner one-third of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, the site of mossy fiber sprouting, and neo-synaptogenesis, at 1 and 2 weeks after pilocarpine injection (silent period) when the reorganization was taking place. In contrast, in chronic pilocarpine-treated animals, when the reorganization was established, the levels of labeling for acidic calponin in the inner molecular layer were similar to those observed in control rats. In addition, double immunostaining studies suggested that the increase in acidic calponin levels occurred within the dendritic spines. Altogether, these results are consistent with an involvement of acidic calponin in dendritic spine plasticity.",
