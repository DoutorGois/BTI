     "AB": "Administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (30 mg/kg s.c. for 5 days) to mice resulted in complete abolishment of strychnine seizure and of the tonic phase of the maximal electroshock response. Bicuculline and picrotoxin convulsions were not significantly affected by MPTP treatment. The severity of the pentylenetetrazole seizures was mildly, but significantly affected in the protective way. MPTP depleted neostriatal dopamine and its metabolites, together with hippocampal norepinephrine. No nigral neuronal loss was detected histologically. Strychnine seizures and the tonic phase of the maximal electroshock response are thought to depend mostly on hindbrain (bulbo-spinal) structures. Thus, these experiments suggest that a caudally projecting system originates from the substantia nigra, pars compacta, and/or locus coeruleus, controlling seizures that involve bulbo-spinal centers. While neostriatal dopamine depletion offers a good index of seizure resistance, its role in the protection from seizures remains to be established.",
