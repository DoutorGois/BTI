     "AB": "The Ref-1 protein is a bifunctional nuclear enzyme involved in repair of DNA lesions and in redox regulation of DNA-binding activity of AP-1 family members, such as Fos and Jun transcription factors. In the present study, we demonstrate by in situ hybridization that transient global ischemia induced by cardiac arrest activates ref-1 mRNA expression in the granular cells of the rat dentate gyrus after 6 h and in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus proper after 24 h, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed nuclear accumulation of Ref-1 protein in granular cells of the ischemia-resistant dentate gyrus, whereas Ref-1 protein expression progressively decreased in vulnerable CA1 neurons of the post-ischemic hippocampus from 24 h onwards. At the same time point, intense nuclear c-Jun immunoreactivity was observed in both neuronal cell populations. Our data suggest that oxidative stress induced by ischemia-reperfusion may increase neuronal ref-1 expression. However, inability of ref-1 mRNA translation and nuclear translocation of encoded protein in CA1 pyramidal neurons may inhibit repair of oxidative DNA damage or cellular adaptive responses leading to delayed neuronal cell death.",
