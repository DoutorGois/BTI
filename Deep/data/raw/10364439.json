     "AB": "Meynert's basal nucleus is innervated by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive axons synapsing with cholinergic principal cells. Origin of CGRP-immunopositive axons was studied in the albino rat. Since beaded axons containing the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) are also present in the basal nucleus, the microstructural arrangement raises the question whether or not an interaction between CGRP and nAChR exists like in the neuromuscular junction. We found that electrolytic lesion of the parabrachial nucleus results in degeneration of CGRP-immunoreactive axons in the ipsilateral nucleus basalis and induces shrinkage of principal cholinergic neurons while the contralateral nucleus basalis remains intact. Electrolytic lesions in the thalamus, caudate-putamen, and hippocampus did not induce alterations in Meynert's basal nucleus. Disappearance of CGRP after lesions of the parabrachial nucleus does not impair presynaptic nAChR in the basal nucleus, suggesting that, unlike in the neuromuscular junction, CGRP is not involved in the maintenance of nAChR in the basal forebrain. It is concluded that the parabrachial nucleus is involved in the activation of the nucleus basalis-prefrontal cortex system, essential in gnostic and mnemonic functions.",
