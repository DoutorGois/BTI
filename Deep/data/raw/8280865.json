     "AB": "The role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA glutamate, metabotropic and muscarinic receptors in the maintenance of status epilepticus (SE) was investigated. SE induced in rat brain by continuous electrical stimulation to the hippocampus was terminated by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of the non-NMDA antagonists DNQX and NBQX, but not by the muscarinic antagonists scopolamine or atropine, or the metabotropic antagonist AP3. The NMDA antagonist, MK-801 suppressed motor seizure activity but did not terminate electrographic seizures when generalized SE was induced, suggesting that both non-NMDA and NMDA receptors maintain generalized convulsive SE. However, when limbic SE was induced, MK-801 also had an anticonvulsant effect suggesting differences in the mechanisms maintaining limbic SE and generalized SE.",
