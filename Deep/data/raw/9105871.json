     "AB": "We investigated the effects of acute oral pretraining treatment with an indirect acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, metrifonate, on water maze spatial navigation in medial septum-lesioned rats. We observed that metrifonate (30 mg/kg, orally) (1) does not alter the pattern of exploration of lesioned rats at the water maze pool or retrieval of spatial memory, (2) effectively reverses the acquisition defect, (3) enhances reversal learning, and (4) improves acquisition of water maze navigation by facilitating the encoding of the spatial representation of a specific environment. These results indicate that metrifonate does not improve escape performance to the hidden platform by modulating exploration strategy, but that metrifonate enhances the speed and accuracy of development and durability of spatial memory engrams, and facilitates learning capacity that depends on activity of the septo-hippocampal projection.",
