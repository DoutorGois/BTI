     "AB": "Estradiol protects against hippocampal damage and some learning impairments resulting from transient global ischemia in rats. Here, we seek to validate a mouse model of transient global ischemia and evaluate the effects of estradiol on ischemia-induced hippocampal damage and behavioral impairments. Female C57Bl6/J mice were ovariectomized and implanted with estradiol- or oil-secreting capsules. One week later, mice experienced 15-min of 2-vessel occlusion (2-VO) or sham surgical procedures. Five days later, mice were exposed to a fear conditioning protocol in which a specific context and novel tone were paired with mild footshock. Twenty-four hours following conditioning, contextual fear was assessed by measuring freezing behavior in the conditioned context (in the absence of the tone). This was followed by assessment of cue fear by measuring freezing behavior to the conditioned tone presented in a new context. When tested in the conditioned context, oil-treated mice that experienced 2-VO exhibited a significant reduction in freezing behavior whereas estradiol-treated mice that experienced 2-VO showed no disruption in freezing behavior. Freezing behavior when presented with the conditioned tone was unaffected by either surgery or hormone treatment. These findings suggest that global ischemia causes impairments in performance on the hippocampally-dependent contextual fear task but not conditioned cue-based fear. Furthermore, estradiol prevented the ischemia-induced impairment in contextual fear conditioning. Fluoro-Jade (FJ) staining revealed neuronal degeneration throughout the dorsal hippocampus of mice that experienced 2-VO. Estradiol treatment reduced the number of FJ+ cells in CA1 and CA2, but not in CA3 or in the dentate gyrus. Together, these findings suggest that 15 min of global ischemia causes extensive hippocampal neurodegeneration and disrupts contextual fear conditioning processes in mice and that estradiol protects against these adverse effects.",
