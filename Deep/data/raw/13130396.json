     "AB": "Supplementation of diets with plant extracts such as ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) (definition see editorial) for health and prevention of degenerative diseases is popular. However, it is often difficult to analyse the biological activities of plant extracts due to their complex nature and the possible synergistic and/or antagonistic effects of their components. Genome-wide expression monitoring with high-density oligonucleotide arrays provides one way to examine the molecular targets of plant extracts and may prove a useful tool in evaluating their therapeutic claims. Here, we will briefly describe some of our work on the effect of EGb 761 on differential gene expression in relation to its potential anti-carcinogenic, photoprotective and neuromodulatory properties.",
