     "AB": "We studied the contribution of GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid) neurotransmission to epileptiform activity using the horizontal hippocampal rat brain slice. Seizure-like (ictal) activity was evoked in the CA1 area by applying high-frequency trains (80 Hz for 2 s) to the Schaffer collaterals. Whole-cell recordings from stratum oriens-alveus interneurons revealed burst firing with superimposed high-frequency spiking which was synchronous with field events and pyramidal cell firing during ictal activity. On the other hand, interictal interneuronal bursts were synchronous with large-amplitude inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in pyramidal cells. Excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were simultaneously received by pyramidal neurons during the ictal afterdischarge, and were synchronous with interneuronal bursting and field potential ictal events. The GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline greatly reduced the duration of the ictal activity in the CA1 layer, and evoked rhythmic interictal synchronous bursting of interneurons and pyramidal cells. With intact GABAergic transmission, interictal field potential events were synchronous with large amplitude IPSPs (9.8 +/- 2.4 mV) in CA1 pyramidal cells, and with interneuronal bursting. Simultaneous dual recordings revealed synchronous IPSPs received by widely separated pyramidal neurons during ictal and interictal periods, indicative of widespread interneuronal firing synchrony throughout the hippocampus. CA3 pyramidal neurons fired in synchrony with interictal field potential events recorded in the CA1 layer, and glutamate receptor antagonists abolished interictal interneuronal firing and synchronous large amplitude IPSPs received by CA1 pyramidal cells. These observations provide evidence that the interneuronal network may be entrained in hyperexcitable states by GABAergic and glutamatergic mechanisms.",
