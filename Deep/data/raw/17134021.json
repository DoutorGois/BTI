     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in free benzodiazepine receptor density in response to repeated, long-term administration of diazepam in epilepsy, we assessed 125I-iomazenil (125I-IMZ) binding in a mouse model. METHODS: El mice were divided into two groups of 12 mice each which received either no diazepam (E1(D[-]) group) or 2 mg/kg of diazepam per week (El(D[+]) group). Nine ddY mice were used as a control. Once each week from the age of 5 to 19 weeks, the El mice received stimulation to produce epileptic seizures 20 minutes after receiving intraperitoneal injections. At 20 weeks of age, a total dose of 0.37 MBq of 125I-IMZ was injected in all mice and their brains were rapidly removed 3 hours later. The incidence of epileptic seizures at the age of 19 weeks and the autoradiograms of the brain were compared. RESULTS: The incidence of epileptic seizures in response to weekly stimulation was significantly lower in the E1(D[+]) group than in the E1(D[-]) group (p < 0.001). The percent injected doses of 125I-IMZ per gram of tissue in the cortex, hippocampus and amygdala were significantly lower in the E1(D[+]) group than in the E1(D[-]) group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that diazepam binds competitively to 125I-IMZ as an agonist to free benzodiazepine receptor sites in the cortex, hippocampus and amygdala and shows anticonvulsant effect in E1 mice.",
