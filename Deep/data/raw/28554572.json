     "AB": "Gangliosides (GGs), a particular class of glycosphingolipids ubiquitously found in tissues and body fluids, exhibit the highest expression in the central nervous system, especially in brain. GGs are involved in crucial processes, such as neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, synaptic transmission, cell adhesion, growth and proliferation. For these reasons, efforts are constantly invested into development and refinement of specific methods for GG analysis. We have recently shown that ion mobility separation (IMS) mass spectrometry (MS) has the capability to provide consistent compositional and structural information on GGs at high sensitivity, resolution and mass accuracy. In the present paper, we have implemented IMS MS for the first time in the study of a highly complex native GG mixture extracted and purified from human fetal hippocampus. As compared to previous studies, where no separation techniques prior to MS were applied, IMS MS technique has not just generated valuable novel information on the GG pattern characteristic for hippocampus in early developmental stage, but also provided data related to the GG molecular involvement in the synaptic functions by the discovery of 25 novel structures modified by CH3COO(-). The detection and identification in fetal hippocampus of a much larger number of GG species than ever reported before was possible due to the ion mobility separation according to the charge state, the carbohydrate chain length and the degree of sialylation. By applying IMS in conjunction with collision induced dissociation (CID) tandem MS (MS/MS), novel GG species modified by CH3COO(-) attachment, discovered here for the first time, were sequenced and structurally investigated in details. The present findings, based on IMS MS, provide a more reliable insight into the expression and role of gangliosides in human hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on their cholinergic activity at this level.",
