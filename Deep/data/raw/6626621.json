It has been shown that the hypothalamo-reticulo-limbic system are involved under the action of adrenal hormones. Under the influence of corticosteroids the dynamics of changes of these structures ensuring the functions of hypophysal-adrenal complex are condition to transfer the neuroendocrine system into the new state forming definite behavioral reactions to support homeostasis.",
