     "AB": "In order to demonstrate axonal connections preserved in rat temporal cortex slices the authors used rhodamine-dextran-amine as a tracer. The slices contained the neocortical areas Te2 and Te3, the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices (MEC and LEC), the subicular regions, and the dentate gyrus and hippocampus proper. Rhodamine-dextran-amine crystals were placed by microinjection into a given area. Following this local lesioning the dye was permitted to diffuse and migrate intraaxonally in antero- and retrograde directions for about 8 hours. The slices were then formaldehyde-fixed and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Most of the known connections within and between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus and dentate gyrus were preserved in the slice preparation, provided that the slices were cut with a near horizontal orientation corresponding to plates 99-108 in Paxinos and Watson (1986). Only the lateral perforant path between the LEC and the hippocampus could not be followed to its full extent. The authors conclude that most aspects of the intrinsic synaptic organization of the temporal lobe can be reliably studied in hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slice preparations.",
