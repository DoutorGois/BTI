     "AB": "We have used the styryl dye FM 2-10 to monitor changes in synaptic activity mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on cultured hippocampal neurons. We show that both 100 microM ACh and nicotine at 20 microM causes a significant increase in staining intensities of presynaptic boutons in the presence of 0.5 microM tetrodotoxin (TTX). This effect of nicotine is blocked by d-tubocurarine. Interestingly, nicotine also had a long-lasting effect on high potassium-induced staining of boutons. These results suggest that nicotine can have significant and sustained effects on synaptic efficacy in cultured hippocampal neurons.",
