     "AB": "Neurological dysfunction caused by traumatic brain injury results in profound changes in net synaptic efficacy, leading to impaired cognition. Because excitability is directly controlled by the balance of excitatory and inhibitory activity, underlying mechanisms causing these changes were investigated using lateral fluid percussion brain injury in mice. Although injury-induced shifts in net synaptic efficacy were not accompanied by changes in hippocampal glutamate and GABA levels, significant reductions were seen in the concentration of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), which are key precursors to de novo glutamate synthesis. Dietary consumption of BCAAs restored hippocampal BCAA concentrations to normal, reversed injury-induced shifts in net synaptic efficacy, and led to reinstatement of cognitive performance after concussive brain injury. All brain-injured mice that consumed BCAAs demonstrated cognitive improvement with a simultaneous restoration in net synaptic efficacy. Posttraumatic changes in the expression of cytosolic branched chain aminotransferase, branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and glutamic acid decarboxylase support a perturbation of BCAA and neurotransmitter metabolism. Ex vivo application of BCAAs to hippocampal slices from injured animals restored posttraumatic regional shifts in net synaptic efficacy as measured by field excitatory postsynaptic potentials. These results suggest that dietary BCAA intervention could promote cognitive improvement by restoring hippocampal function after a traumatic brain injury.",
