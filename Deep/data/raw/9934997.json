     "PG": "235-57",
     "AB": "S100A6 (calcyclin) is a member of the large S100 Ca2+-binding protein family, considered to activate several processes along the calcium signal transduction pathway including the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, secretion, and exocytosis. In the present study, the distribution of S100A6 in the rat nervous system was examined by immunohistochemistry with a goat antiserum against recombinant human S100A6, which recognizes the rat S100A6 homologue. The main S100A6-immunoreactive elements were 1) neuronal somata and dendrites in some specific regions of the limbic system (e.g., the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, ventral tip of the CA1-subicular border region, entorhinal cortex, and parasubiculum), most of which were identified as a subpopulation of pyramidal cells; 2) olfactory receptor cells and olfactory nerve fibers and terminals in the olfactory bulb; 3) some tracts of the hindbrain and spinal cord (e.g., the spinal trigeminal tract, solitary tract, dorsal root fibers, and the tract of Lissauer) and their terminals (e.g., the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, marginal zone, substantia gelatinosa, and proper sensory nucleus of the dorsal horn), as well as some sensory neurons of their origins in the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia; 4) a subpopulation of astrocytes in the white matter (e.g., the corpus callosum, cingulum, external capsule, internal capsule, and fimbria of the hippocampus) and around the ventricles; 5) some ependymal cells, especially around the central canal; and 6) Schwann cells. These results will improve our understanding of the diverse function of Ca2+-binding proteins in the CNS.",
