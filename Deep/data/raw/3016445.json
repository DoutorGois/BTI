     "AB": "Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)-responsive areas in rat brain were examined by measuring ANF-stimulated cyclic GMP production in rat brain slice preparations. The medulla oblongata, thalamus, and pituitary gland responded most sensitively, the septum, hypothalamus, pons, midbrain and olfactory bulb responded moderately, but neocortex, cerebellum, striatum and hippocampus were unresponsive to ANF. The most responsive regions in spontaneously hypertensive rats brains showed 2 to 5 times higher cyclic GMP production than those from the control Wistar-Kyoto rats. These findings provide evidence for biological action of ANF on brain tissues, and indicate the action of ANF produced in the brain.",
