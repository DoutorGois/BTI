     "AB": "Hippocampal sharp waves (SPWs) and associated fast (\"ripple\") oscillations (SPW-Rs) in the CA1 region are among the most synchronous physiological patterns in the mammalian brain. Using two-dimensional arrays of electrodes for recording local field potentials and unit discharges in freely moving rats, we studied the emergence of ripple oscillations (140-220 Hz) and compared their origin and cellular-synaptic mechanisms with fast gamma oscillations (90-140 Hz). We show that (1) hippocampal SPW-Rs and fast gamma oscillations are quantitatively distinct patterns but involve the same networks and share similar mechanisms; (2) both the frequency and magnitude of fast oscillations are positively correlated with the magnitude of SPWs; (3) during both ripples and fast gamma oscillations the frequency of network oscillation is higher in CA1 than in CA3; and (4) the emergence of CA3 population bursts, a prerequisite for SPW-Rs, is biased by activity patterns in the dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex, with the highest probability of ripples associated with an \"optimum\" level of dentate gamma power. We hypothesize that each hippocampal subnetwork possesses distinct resonant properties, tuned by the magnitude of the excitatory drive.",
