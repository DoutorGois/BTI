     "AB": "Adult animals subjected to chronic stress show an inflammatory response in the hippocampus which has been related to cognitive dysfunction and psychopathology. However the immediate consequences of early life stress on hippocampal glial cells have not been studied. Here we analyzed the effects of maternal separation (MS) on astrocyte and microglial cell morphology in the hippocampal hilus, compared the expression of cytokines in the hippocampus and hypothalamus, and the peripheral response of cytokines, on postnatal day (PD) 15. Male rat pups of MS (3h/day, PD1-PD14) and Control (CONT) pups showed similar microglial cell densities in the hilus, but MS pups presented more activated microglia. MS decreased astrocyte density and the number of processes in the hilus. Cytokine mRNA expression (qPCR) was analyzed in MS and CONT groups, sacrificed (i) under basal (B) conditions or (ii) after a single stress event (SS) at PN15. In hippocampal extracts, MS increased IL-1beta mRNA, under B and SS conditions while IL-6 and TNF-alpha did not change. In hypothalamic tissue, MS increased TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA, but not IL-1b, after SS. Peripheral concentrations of IL-1beta were decreased under B and SS conditions in MS; IL-6 concentration increased after SS in MS pups, and TNF-alpha concentration was unchanged. In conclusion, MS activates microglial cells and decreases astrocyte density in the hippocampus. A differential cytokine expression is observed in the hippocampus and the hypothalamus after MS, and after SS. Also, MS triggers an independent response of peripheral cytokines. These specific responses together could contribute to decrease hippocampal neurogenesis and alter the neuroendocrine axis.",
