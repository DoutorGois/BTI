     "AB": "beta-Caryophyllene (BCP) has been reported to be protective against focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury by its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory features. Recent study demonstrates that the BCP exhibits potential neuroprotection against I/R injury induced apoptosis, however, the mechanism remains unknown. Therefore, we investigate the underlying anti-apoptotic mechanism of BCP pretreatment in I/R injury. Sprague-Dawley rats (pretreated with BCP suspensions or solvent orally for 7 days) were subjected to transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min, followed by 24 h reperfusion. Results showed that BCP pretreatment improved the neurologic deficit score, lowered the infarct volume and decreased number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus. Moreover, in western blot and RT-qPCR detections, BCP pretreatment down-regulated the expressions of Bax and p53, up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, and enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473. Blockage of PI3K activity by wortmannin not only abolished the BCP-induced decreases in infarct volume and neurologic deficit score, but also dramatically abrogated the enhancement of AKt phosphorylation. Our results suggested that BCP pre-treatment protects against I/R injury partly by suppressing apoptosis via PI3K/AKt signaling pathway activation.",
