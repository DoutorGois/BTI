     "AB": "Previous studies have shown that inhibitors of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) attenuate seizure activity in drug-induced epilepsy models, but the role of NCX in epilepsy is not fully understood. The present study examined the effects of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling on the mRNA expression of NCX isoforms (NCX1, NCX2 and NCX3) in mouse brain. Chronic administration of PTZ at 40mg/kg resulted in kindling seizure development. It caused decreases in the mRNA levels of NCX1 and NCX2, but not NCX3, in the hippocampus. Changes in NCX isoform expression levels were not observed in the prefrontal cortex or striatum. Acute PTZ at 40mg/kg, which caused little seizure activity, also decreased NCX2, but not NCX1 mRNA levels in the hippocampus. These results suggest that down-regulation of hippocampal NCX1 expression is associated with PTZ-induced kindling seizure development.",
