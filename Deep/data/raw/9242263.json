     "AB": "Excitatory synaptic transmission was investigated in interneurons of the parvocellular nucleus tractus solitarius (pNTS) by performing patch-clamp experiments in thin slice preparations from rat brain stem. Stimulation of single afferent fibers evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) mediated by glutamate receptors of the DL-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate types. AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs displayed decay time constants of 3.5 +/- 1.2 (SD) ms (13 cells), which were slow compared with EPSC decay time constants in neurons of the cerebellum or hippocampus. Slow EPSC decay was not explained by dendritic filtering, because the passive membrane properties of pNTS interneurons provided favorable voltage-clamp conditions. Also, the slowness of EPSC decay did not result from slow deactivation of AMPA receptors (0.7 +/- 0.2 ms, 5 cells), which was investigated during rapid application of agonist to outside-out patches. Comparison of AMPA receptor kinetics with EPSC decay time constants suggested that the slow time course of EPSCs resulted from the prolonged presence of glutamate in the synaptic cleft.",
