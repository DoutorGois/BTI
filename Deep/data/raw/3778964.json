     "AB": "The paper deals with thermovisional studies of thermal activity of hippocampus transplants placed in the eye anterior chamber of the rat. The method permits investigation into the dynamics of temperature field in the nervous tissue directly. In the transplants with synchronous spontaneous activity of large neuron groups there were found zones of high thermoactivity with mean amplitude 0.1 degree C, as well as thermopassive zones with temperature variations not above 0.03 degree C. Under certain conditions transfer of heat-up regions along the transplant surface, synchronous thermoactivation of single zones and chaotic regime of thermoactivation were observed. Causes of the observed effects are analysed. The method applied opens a new approach to the studies of space and time organization of the nervous tissue functioning in the course of its living activity.",
