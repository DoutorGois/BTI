     "AB": "The topographic distribution of degenerative changes in large brain sections from five sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with dementia and three without dementia was examined. The dementia characteristics were impaired shifting from one line of thinking to another, perseveration, and emotional disinhibition as well as impairment of cognition, and judgment. Neuropathological examinations showed definite ALS changes in all the patients studied. In addition, the five patients with dementia showed neuronal loss, gliosis, and sponginess of the superficial layers throughout the cerebral cortices, predominantly in the dorsomedial cortex of the temporal tip and the parahippocampal, ambiens, anterior cingulate, rectal, orbital, and insular gyri as well as neuronal loss in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and subiculum of the hippocampus. Ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions were present in some neurons in the granular cell layers of the hippocampus. Fibrous gliosis was extensive in the subcortical and deep white matter of the frontotemporal lobes. The affected regions take in the limbic system and its associated areas which are the sources of the psychological problems, including emotional disturbance, experienced by these ALS patients. The psychological problems of ALS need to be investigated in relation to the involvement of the limbic system.",
