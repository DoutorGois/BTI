     "AB": "Opioids such as morphine are commonly used analgesics in clinical practice. Three opioid receptors (mu, micro; delta, delta; and kappa, kappa) that mediate opioid effects have been identified by molecular cloning: delta (enkephalin-preferring), kappa (dynorphin-preferring), and micro (morphine and ss-endorphin-preferring) (1). Each type of opioid receptor consists of subtypes of receptors as suggested by pharmacological studies (2, 3). Their specificity and ubiquitous location are present in both the central and peripheral nervous system. The opioid receptors (G-protein coupled, resulting in decrease in adenylyl cyclase activity) play an important role in the regulation of analgesia, shock, appetite, thermoregulation, cardiovascular, mental and endocrine function (2-5). Although micro opioid receptors are the major receptor to mediate the analgesic effects of opioids, delta and kappa receptors are also important in antinociception. Opioids have been found to protect cells from ischemia injury in the heart and brain via the delta receptors. On the other hand, kappa antagonist prevents neurodegeneration. The micro opioid receptors are localized predominately in the hypothalamus and thalamus, and the delta opioid receptors are localized predominately in the striatum, limbic system, and cerebral cortex (6, 7). The kappa opioid receptors (kappa1 and kappa2 ) are the most abundant brain opioid receptors and are widely distributed in deeper layers of the neocortex (temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices), striatum, amygdala, and thalamus, with lower levels in the hippocampus, occipital cortex, and cerebellum (8-10). The micro opioid receptors have been implicated in several clinical brain disorders, including drug and alcohol abuses, epilepsy, and pain pathways (11-14). Diprenorphine is a highly potent and nonselective opioid receptor antagonist with subnanomolar affinity (7). Diprenorphine was labeled as [6-O-methyl-(11)C]diprenorphine ([(11)C]DPN) (15, 16). [(11)C]DPN has been employed as a positron emission tomography (PET) agent for the non-invasive studies of opioid receptors in the brain of patients with pain, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. Carfentanil (CFN) is a highly potent and selective micro opioid receptor agonist with subnanomolar affinity (Ki, 0.024 nM) (17). [(11)C]CFN is being developed as a PET agent for the non-invasive study of micro opioid receptors in the brain.",
