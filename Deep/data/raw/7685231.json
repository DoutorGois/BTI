This is similar to the effects seen with interleukin-3 (IL-3) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Moreover, in vivo GM-CSF and EPO promoted survival of septal cholinergic neurons in adult rats which had undergone fimbria-fornix transections. These results suggest that some of the hematopoietic factors act on cholinergic neurons as 'neurotrophic factors' to influence the differentiation, maintenance and regeneration of these neurons.",
