     "AB": "Embryonic midbrain raphe was grafted into serotonin-deficient adult rat hippocampus. Serotonin-containing neurons in the graft survive for at least 6 months after grafting. Grafted neurons develop physiological properties, not present on the day of grafting, identical to those of normal adult serotonin-containing neurons. These include (a) high input resistance and slow membrane time constant, (b) lack of inward rectification in response to hyperpolarizing current pulses and (c) a potent, 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient outward rectification. The grafted neurons innervate the host tissue with axons that have a slow conduction velocity and refractoriness. It is suggested that grafted CNS neurons may possess normal physiological properties.",
