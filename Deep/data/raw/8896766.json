     "AB": "In a previous study we reported that muscarinic receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide breakdown in rat cortical slices is significantly reduced by modification of critical thiols located at the post-receptor level. We have now extended this observation by investigating whether this effect is a general response in different brain areas and is differentially regulated, within the cortex, in the neonatal and adult brain. Experimental results have demonstrated that indeed the effect of sulfhydryl group modification on muscarinic receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide breakdown appears to be mediated by a general mechanism operative in different brain regions (cortex, hippocampus and striatum). In addition, this response is more pronounced in the early stages of brain development, when muscarinic receptor agonists lead to the highest inositol phosphate accumulation.",
