     "AB": "Extracellular action potentials were recorded from identified cells in the dentate gyrus of the awake freely moving rat during performance of a two-tone discrimination task. The effects of low doses of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC) were assessed on the firing patterns of granule cells to the tone stimuli. Intraperitoneal injections of delta 9-THC at 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, but not 0.5 mg/kg, produced a significant suppression of granule cell activity lasting up to 4 hr. This suppression was present in both the spontaneous (pretone) activity and tone-evoked responses of granule cells. The tone responses of cells recorded from the inferior colliculus were unaffected by THC injection at 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, implicating further the hippocampus as a site of specific action of delta 9-THC. In the preceding paper it was demonstrated that such doses produced both impairment of discrimination behavior and modifications of sensory-evoked potentials recorded from the dentate gyrus. However, the influence of delta 9-THC on cell firing in the dentate gyrus was more severe both in magnitude and duration of suppression than were the effects on behavior and on sensory-evoked potentials.",
