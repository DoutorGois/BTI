     "AB": "Hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mammals is influenced by many factors. Lesioning of the entorhinal cortex is a standard model used to study injury and repair in the hippocampus. Here we use bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling combined with immunohistochemical identification using cell type specific markers to follow the fate of neural progenitors in the hippocampus following entorhinal cortex lesioning in mice. We show that unilateral entorhinal cortex lesioning does not alter the rate of neural progenitor proliferation in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus during the first 3 days after lesioning. However it enhances cell survival at 42 days post-lesioning leading to an increased number of beta-III tubulin and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons being produced. By contrast, when BrdU was administered 21 days post-lesioning, the number of surviving cells 21 days later was similar on the lesioned and non-lesioned sides. Thus, acutely entorhinal cortex lesioning promotes neurogenesis by enhancing survival of either neural progenitors or their progeny. However, this stimulus to neurogenesis is not sustained into the recovery period.",
