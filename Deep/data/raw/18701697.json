     "AB": "During the early developmental stage, a neural circuit is established between the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) via the perforant pathway. However, the manner in which the perforant fibers are navigated has mostly remained a mystery. Here, we analyzed the functional role of a chemokine, namely, stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha), in the navigation of the perforant fibers. SDF-1alpha was observed to promote neurite growth, which is dependent on mDia1, in cultured entorhinal cortical neurons obtained from rats at postnatal day 0. We then used entorhino-hippocampal cocultures comprising green fluorescence-labeled EC and DG slices to assess the projection of the perforant fibers from the EC. Although the specific laminar termination of the entorhinal axons was observed with this system, the number of appropriately terminating entorhinal axons decreased significantly when the SDF-1alpha signaling pathway was blocked by a neutralizing antibody against SDF-1alpha or by the specific SDF-1alpha receptor antagonist AMD3100 (1,1'-[1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)]bis-1,4,8,11-tetra-azacyclotetradecane octahydrochloride). Furthermore, inhibition of the SDF-1alpha signaling pathway resulted in a decrease in the immunoreactivity for PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein-95) in the DG, possibly because of a reduction in the number of projecting perforant fibers. These results demonstrate that SDF-1alpha plays a critical role in promoting the growth of perforant fibers from the EC to the DG.",
