     "AB": "Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is an environmental endocrine disrupter. Currently, little is known about neurodevelopmental toxicity of DEHP in wildlife and humans. The present study investigated the effects of DEHP, focusing on the changes in the behavior of offspring mice at the ages of 6 and 12w, respectively, following utero and lactational exposure to DEHP (10, 50, and 200mg/kg/d) from gestation day 7 through postnatal day 21. The results of open field tasks showed that DEHP increased the grooming of males at age 6w and females at age 12w but decreased the frequency of rearing of 6-w-old females and the number of grid crossings of 12-w-old females. In the Morris water maze task, 50 and 200mg/kg/d DEHP significantly prolonged the time of searching the hidden platform in water maze and reduced the time staying in the target quadrant during a probe trial of 6-w-old male mice, but not of 6-w-old females nor 12-w-old mice of both sexes, suggesting an impaired spatial learning and memory among younger males after perinatal exposure to DEHP. Western blot analyses further showed that DEHP at 50 and 200mg/kg/d decreased the levels of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B in the hippocampus of 6-w-old males. These results suggest that uterine and lactational exposure to low doses of DEHP sex-specifically impacted behaviors, including locomotion activity and spatial memory, via the concomitant inhibition of the NMDA receptor of the hippocampus in offspring mice.",
