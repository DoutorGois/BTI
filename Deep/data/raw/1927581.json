     "AB": "Specific and localized lesions of the 5-HT fibers in the hippocampus induce homotypic collateral sprouting and enhance serotonergic fiber outgrowth from adult neurons and transplanted fetal tissue. In this study, hippocampal extracts were prepared and applied to primary cultures of fetal serotonergic neurons. The effects of plating density and serum additives were examined. The growth of the serotonergic neurons in the rostral brainstem dissociated cultures were estimated by measuring the specific uptake of [3H]5-HT. The results indicate the presence of a trypsin-sensitive factor which is active when prepared fresh at dilutions up to 1/10,000. The factor is higher in hippocampus than cerebellum. Young male tissue contained more activity than either female or aged hippocampus. Although both positive and negative effects are described, higher dilutions of factor (1/1,000) were generally stimulatory in high density cultures while lower dilutions (1/10) were inhibitory in low density cultures. Specific removal of 5-HT hippocampal afferents with fornix-fimbria microinjections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine resulted in an initial loss of activity (2 days and 2 weeks) followed by an enhanced activity (2 months) compared to normal hippocampal extract. Several possibilities are discussed as to the identity of the serotonergic growth factor from hippocampal supernatant.",
