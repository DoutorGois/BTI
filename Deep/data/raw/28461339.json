     "AB": "The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway is involved in numerous cellular processes and it is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer disease. Recent studies identified a crucial role for this pathway in activity-dependent long-term depression (LTD) at hippocampal Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA1 synapses. However, it is unclear whether JAK-STAT signaling also regulates excitatory synaptic function at the anatomically distinct temporoammonic (TA) input to CA1 neurons. Here we demonstrate that LTD at adult TA-CA1 synapses involves JAK-STAT signaling, but unlike SC-CA1 synapses, requires rapid gene transcription. TA-CA1 LTD requires NMDA receptor activation and is independent of PI3K or ERK signaling. JAK-STAT signaling was critical for TA-CA1 LTD as inhibition of JAK or STAT blocked LTD induction and prevented NMDA-induced AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor internalization in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, an increase in phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT3 accompanied chemical induction of LTD and AMPA receptor internalization. STAT3-driven gene transcription was required for LTD as inhibition of STAT3-DNA binding, nuclear export, and gene transcription all prevented LTD induction. These data indicate an essential role for canonical JAK-STAT signaling in activity-dependent LTD at TA-CA1 synapses and provide valuable insight into the role of the TA input in hippocampal synaptic plasticity.-McGregor, G., Irving, A.
