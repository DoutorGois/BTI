     "AB": "Quetiapine is a new atypical antipsychotic drug widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. This study examined the influence of quetiapine on the decrease of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, induced by chronic immobilization stress, in the hippocampus of the rat. Pretreatment with 10 mg/kg of quetiapine markedly attenuated the stress-induced decrease in levels of BDNF protein, as determined by Western blot analyses, and the reduction of BDNF immunoreactivity, in hippocampal pyramidal and dentate granular neurons. These results suggest that the chronic administration of quetiapine could be neuroprotective to hippocampal neurons in schizophrenia and this effect may be related to its antipsychotic effect in patients with schizophrenia.",
