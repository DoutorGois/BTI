     "AB": "Episodic memory impairment is commonly observed in patients with epilepsy associated with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Prospective memory (PM) is a set cognitive abilities that allow future performance of a present intention, in response to time- or event-based evocation cues, that trigger the intended action at the appropriate time. PM has not been evaluated in mesial temporal sclerosis. We evaluated the role of right and left hippocampal lesions on performance in both the retrospective and prospective PM components in patients with epilepsy secondary to mesial temporal sclerosis and correlated with performance in traditional neuropsychological tests, as well as with self-perception of memory impairment. We tested the hypotheses that a hippocampal lesion impacts on the prospective components of PM, and that a left-sided lesion had a greater impact on performance in the prospective component of PM than a right-sided lesion. We evaluated PM in 26 patients with right MTS, 22 left MTS patients, and 26 age-gender and education matched controls. The prospective component of PM was impaired in both patient groups, with both a lesion (patients performed significantly worse in the PM battery) and laterality effect (left MTS patients performed significantly worse than right MTS patients in the PM battery). Performance in the prospective component of the PM battery correlated with long-term delay performance in episodic verbal memory and self-perception of memory impairment in the left MTS group. The retrospective component was impaired in left MTS patients. Impaired performance was not accounted for solely by depression, anxiety or an antiepileptic drug effect. We conclude that mesial temporal lobe structures, including the hippocampus, play an important role in both the prospective and retrospective components of PM processes in tasks involving long delay intervals.",
