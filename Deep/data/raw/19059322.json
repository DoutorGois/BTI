     "AB": "Epilepsy in children is associated with a broad spectrum of cognitive deficits, which is associated with hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting. The underlying molecular mechanisms involved in mossy fiber sprouting in hippocampus following developmental seizures are not completely known. We studied the timing of cognitive dysfunction following neonatal seizures and the relation of this cognitive impairment to zinc transporter 1 (ZnT-1), 3 (ZnT-3), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II), plasticity-related gene 1 (PRG-1) expression in hippocampus. A seizure was induced by inhalant flurothyl daily in neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats from postnatal day 6 (P6). Rats were assigned into the single-seizure group (SS), the recurrent-seizure group (RS, seizures induced in six consecutive days), and the control group. During P41-P46 and P85-P90, the rats were tested for spatial learning and memory abilities with automatic Morris water maze task. At P90, mossy fiber sprouting and gene expression in hippocampus were determined subsequently by Timm staining and RT-PCR methods. The escape latencies from the water maze were significantly longer in rats of RS group than those of the control and SS groups at d4 of the first maze test and at d3, d4 of the second maze test. As far as Spatial Probe Test was concerned, the frequency of passing through the platform quadrant was significantly decreased in RS group than that in control and SS groups in the entire two probe tests. In rats with recurrent seizures (RS group), there was an increased distribution of Timm granules in both the supragranular region of the dentate gyrus and the stratum pyramidale of CA3 subfield in RS group, while remaining barely visible in control and SS groups; the Timm scores in CA3 and dentate gyrus in the RS animals were significantly higher than that in the control and SS groups. RT-PCR densitometry analysis showed that the ratios of hippocampal ZnT-1 to beta-actin of SS and RS group were decreased significantly compared with that of control group. Meanwhile, CaMK II to beta-actin of RS group was markedly lower compared with those of SS and control groups. Our results suggest that the long-term adverse effects of recurrent neonatal seizures on cognition and mossy fiber sprouting may be associated with the down-regulated expression of ZnT-1 and CaMK II in hippocampus.",
