     "AB": "The effects of monolateral lesioning of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) and of choline alphoscerate treatment on histochemically reactive vesicular zinc stores were assessed in the rat brain using the sulphide-silver histochemical technique. Histochemically reactive zinc stores are located primarily within association fibres of the neuropil of the cerebral cortex as well as in the mossy fibres of the hippocampus. The density of cortical and hippocampal sulphide-silver positive fibres, which might have a role in cognitive and mnemonic processes, parallels the density of zinc-containing presynaptic buttons. Unilateral lesions of NBM caused a remarkable decrease of sulphide-silver positive fibres from the 4th week after lesioning in the neuropil of the ipsilateral fronto-parietal cortex and from the 3rd week in the mossy fibres of the ipsilateral hippocampus. Treatment with choline alphoscerate, which is a precursor in the biosynthesis of brain phospholipids that increases the bioavailability of acetylcholine in the nervous tissue, restored, in part, the density and pattern of sulphide-silver positive fibres in the fronto-parietal cortex and in the hippocampus. The data suggest that, analogously to reports from Alzheimer's disease patients, lesions of the NBM cause a decrease of zinc stores in the rat brain. Choline alphoscerate treatment is able to counter the expression of this phenomenon which accompanies experimental lesions of the NBM.",
