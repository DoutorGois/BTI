     "AB": "Maternal alcohol-intoxication during pregnancy exerts detrimental effects on fetal development and is known to influence learning ability and memory capability by altering neuronal activity in the hippocampus. c-Fos expression represents neuronal activity and plays a crucial role in the brain development. Physical exercise is known to enhance neuronal plasticity and activity. In the present study, we investigated the influence of postnatal treadmill running on the c-Fos expression in the hippocampus of rat pups born from the alcohol-intoxicated mothers. The results obtained show that maternal alcohol-intoxication suppressed c-Fos expression in the hippocampus of rat pups and that postnatal treadmill exercise enhanced c-Fos expression in the hippocampus of these rat pups. The present study suggests that exercise should be considered as a therapeutic means of countering the effects of maternal alcohol-intoxication, and that it may provide a useful strategy for enhancing the neuronal activity of children born from the mothers who abuse alcohol during pregnancy.",
