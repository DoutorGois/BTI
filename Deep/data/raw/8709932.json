     "AB": "Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg/kg d-methamphetamine (MA), expressed as the free base, by SC injection (b.i.d., 8 h apart) on days 7-12 or 13-18 of gestation. Plasma concentration of MA and amphetamine were determined after the last dose. MA reduced gestation weight gain. The late exposure resulted in an increase in maternal and offspring mortality and reduced offspring growth. Offspring treated early in gestation with MA showed delayed development of early locomotion. In addition, memory impairment, evidenced by decreased target quadrant times and platform crossings on test trials and increased latency on reversal trials in the Morris spatial navigation maze, reduced spontaneous alternation, and lengthened passive avoidance retention latency was seen in the early treated high-dose groups. A reduction of serotonin was found in the nucleus accumbens following late exposure to MA at 20 mg/kg. Animals in both exposure groups had eye defects; however, the type of defect was dependent on the developmental stage at the time of dosing. Anophthalmia occurred only after early MA exposure, whereas folded retina was drug related only after late MA exposure. The behavioral effects did not show graded dose dependency; however, the effects were sensitive to exposure period. The early exposed animals had more alterations in behavior whereas the late exposed group showed higher mortality, reduced body weights, and neurochemical alterations.",
