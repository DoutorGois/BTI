     "AB": "We have previously reported that limbic seizures regulate the gene expression of fibroblast growth factor-2 (basic, FGF-2) according to a specific spatio-temporal pattern. In the present paper we have investigated the role of adrenal hormones on seizure-induced elevation of fibroblast growth factor-1 (acidic, FGF-1) and FGF-2 gene expression. Adrenalectomy reduces FGF-2 mRNA expression in specific brain regions, such as frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum, whereas FGF-1 mRNA levels were decreased only in the frontal cortex. The injection of kainic acid in adrenalectomized rats produced a widespread increase of FGF-2 mRNA with a pattern similar to sham animals as indicated by in situ hybridization. In contrast, although kainate-induced elevation of FGF-1 mRNA in the hippocampus was not influenced by adrenalectomy, its induction in frontal cortex was prevented by this surgery procedure. Taken together, these data indicate that adrenal hormones play a role in the regulation of the gene expression for fibroblast growth factors, but different mechanisms are operative in their induction following seizure activity.",
