     "AB": "Unilateral contusion injury to the sensorimotor cortex causes, among other symptoms, a transient contralateral hindlimb hemiparesis in rats. A single i.p. 2 mg/kg dose of d-amphetamine (d-AMPH) 24 h after injury accelerates spontaneous recovery from this particular deficit. The mechanism(s) of spontaneous and d-AMPH enhanced recovery are unknown but alleviation of a neuronal depression has been proposed. This quantitative CMRglu study was designed to determine effects of cortical contusion injury and d-AMPH on CMRglu in cortical and subcortical structures. At 2 days after injury, CMRglu was significantly reduced compared to sham-operated controls only in structures ipsilateral to contusion. Affected structures included the caudate putamen, medial geniculate nucleus, lateral geniculate nucleus and the parietal cortex immediately posterior to injury. By 6 days post-contusion, the hypometabolism partially reversed in all structures. A single low dose of d-AMPH significantly alleviated the post-traumatic CMRglu reduction at 2 days after injury. Importantly, while this alleviation was not significant for any single structure, the main effect of treatment was highly significant. d-AMPH increased CMRglu at 2 days post-injury by 18-33% compared to contused/saline-treated rats. These results suggest that alleviation of neuronal metabolic depression may contribute to spontaneous and d-AMPH enhanced recovery.",
