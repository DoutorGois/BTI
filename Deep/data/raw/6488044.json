     "AB": "Serotonin (S-2) binding sites were characterized in human frontal cortex and hippocampus throughout the lifespan. We found that the S-2 binding sites (labeled by [3H]spiperone and displaced by ketanserin) consisted of two subtypes (S-2A and S-2B) which are discriminated by competition with methysergide. The total S-2 sites in frontal cortex had a Bmax of 360 fmol/mg protein, which is approximately twice that of the hippocampus (160 fmol/mg protein). The density of total S-2 sites decreased with age in the frontal cortex of normal adults (17-100 years, n = 24). The receptor loss was primarily in the S-2A subclass. This loss of S-2A sites occurred primarily after 60 years and decreased to 50% of young adult values by the 10th decade. In the hippocampus, S-2A binding sites decreased with age, but no effects on total S-2 or S-2B sites were detected. A study of infant brains suggested the S-2A subtype in frontal cortex increases postnatally. However, in the infant hippocampus the S-2 binding approximated adult levels.",
