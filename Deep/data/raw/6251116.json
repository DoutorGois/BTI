     "AB": "A previous investigation established a modulatory effect of adrenal glucocorticoids on a behavior generally believed to require participation of the hippocampus for normal expression. For further delineation of whether the observed effects on appetitive extinction are consistent with a glucocorticoid action on hippocampus, adrenalectomized rats were administered either corticosterone or dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid that is accumulated much less intensively by the hippocampus than is corticosterone. While corticosterone normalized extinction, dexamethasone did not. In two other hippocampal-dependent behaviors, alternation and exploration, there was no glucocorticoid modulation of behavior, which may indicate that factors such as the level of activation of the type of learning determine whether a glucocorticoid effect will occur. These findings of a glucocorticoid action on one of three tasks that involve hippocampal function reinforce the notion that in addition to their well-studied actions in protein and carbohydrate metabolism, the adrenal glucocorticoids may also be subtle modulators of behavior.",
