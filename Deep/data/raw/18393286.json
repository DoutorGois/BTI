     "AB": "We investigated developmental changes in myelin formation in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, and behavioral effects of early weaning in Wistar rats. Early-weaned rats showed decreased numbers of open-arm entries in an elevated plus-maze in both sexes at 4 weeks old; this effect persisted in males, but ceased in females after this age. Expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) showed both age-dependent increases and sex differences; 4-week-old males exhibited higher MBP levels in the hippocampus, whereas 7-week-old males showed lower MBP levels in the prefrontal cortex compared to females of the same age. There was a tendency for group differences from weaning for the 21.5-kDa isoform in the prefrontal cortex. Although these results suggest that male rats are more vulnerable than females to early-weaning effects on anxiety-related behaviors, further detailed analysis is needed to clarify the functional relationship between myelination and anxiety-related behaviors.",
