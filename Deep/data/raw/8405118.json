     "AB": "A peptide, muscarinic toxin 2 (MTX2), isolated from Dendroaspis angusticeps venom was previously shown to displace the specific binding of [3H]pirenzepine, a muscarinic M1 receptor ligand, from rat brain synaptosomal membranes. We have tested MTX2 for muscarinic agonist or antagonist actions in an inhibitory avoidance task in rats. Infusion of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine into the hippocampus of rats immediately after the training period produced amnesia, whereas the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine increased retention. When MTX2 was injected into the hippocampus of rats after the inhibitory avoidance task, it caused memory facilitation, which could be suppressed by the concomitant infusion of scopolamine. Hence, in this test, MTX2 showed muscarinic receptor agonist-like actions, which are probably mediated by the M1 subtype of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.",
