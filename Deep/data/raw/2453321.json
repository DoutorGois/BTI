     "AB": "Time-pregnant rats were fed a regular laboratory diet until delivery. Litters delivered within an 8-hour period were combined and 8 randomly selected pups were assigned to each dam. Dams were then divided into two groups. Group I received a 20% protein diet. Group II was pair-fed to group I with a 20% protein diet containing caffeine (1 mg/100 g body weight) until day 22 postpartum. On weaning (day 22), only male pups were selected and fed the 20% protein or 20% protein + caffeine diet according to which diet their respective dams had been fed. On day 43, rats were killed and the brains were divided into 6 different areas. DNA, RNA, protein and cholesterol contents were measured. Caffeine supplementation resulted in a decrease in the total brain weight, and DNA and RNA content. DNA value of cortex-midbrain was smaller in the caffeine group whereas the values of medulla oblongata and striatum were greater in comparison with the controls. Caffeine's effects on RNA included an increase in the cerebellum, cortex-midbrain and hippocampus and a decrease in the medulla oblongata. Protein content of cerebellum was increased and of hippocampus decreased due to caffeine supplementation. Cholesterol content of the medulla oblongata and hippocampus was less in the caffeine group than in the control group. The present study shows that chronic caffeine intake during rapid periods of growth influences various parts of the brain in entirely different biochemical manners.",
