     "AB": "The distribution of vasopressin receptors in the brain of the jerboa (Jaculus orientalis) was studied using tritiated arginin vasopressin ([3H]vasopressin). beta-Particles emitted from tritiated ligand bound to brain sections were detected by a newly developed beta-radio imager to generate a light spot which was read by a charge coupled device camera. The number and coordinate of the center of gravity of the light spot were recorded. After summation in pixels of the counts collected during 2-20 h, an image was produced representing the distribution of [3H]vasopressin bound to brain sections. Specific vasopressin binding was detected in various brain regions such as the cerebral cortex, islands of Calleja, pallidum, amygdala and the hippocampus as well as in the pituitary gland. The intensity of the binding was quantified directly from the images obtained and expressed in decays/min/surface unit. The linearity of this method of detection allowed a relevant measurement of non-specific binding, therefore its subtraction from images representing the total binding. Three-dimensional reconstructions of labeled structures were also performed. The presence of numerous vasopressin receptors in the jerboa hippocampus suggests a major role for this neuropeptide in this part of the brain.",
