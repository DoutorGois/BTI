     "AB": "The catecholaminergic and serotoninergic neurons in the brain change their performance according to the physiological need via a catecholaminergic/serotoninergic activity enhancer (CAE/SAE) mechanism. Phenylethylamine (PEA), tyramine and tryptamine are the presently known endogenous CAE/SAE substances which enhance the impulse propagation mediated release of catecholamines and serotonin in the brain. A PEA derivative, (-)deprenyl (selegiline), known as a selective inhibitor of MAO-B, is for the time being the only CAE/SAE substance in clinical use. Aiming to develop a selective CAE/SAE substance much more potent than (-)deprenyl, a series of new 1-aryl-2-alkylaminoalkanes, structurally unrelated to PEA and the amphetamines, was designed and prepared. Among them, (-)1-(benzofuran-2-yl)-2-propylaminopentane ((-)BPAP) was selected as a promising candidate substance for further studies. (-)BPAP significantly enhanced in rats the impulse propagation mediated release of catecholamines and serotonin in the brain 30min after acute injection of 0.36nmol/kg sc. In the shuttle box, (-)BPAP was in rats about 130 times more potent than (-)deprenyl in antagonizing tetrabenazine induced inhibition of performance. (+/-)BPAP protected cultured hippocampal neurons from the neurotoxic effect of beta-amyloid in 10(-14)-10(-15)M concentration.",
