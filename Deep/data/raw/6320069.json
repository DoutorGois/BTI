     "AB": "The binding of calcium antagonists in the rat hippocampal formation was studied using autoradiography. Hippocampal slices were labeled in vitro with [3H]PN 200-110. High densities of binding sites for calcium antagonists were found in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus. After ablation of the granule cells by local injection of colchicine a marked decrease in the number of [3H]PN 200-110 binding sites density was observed on these areas, while binding to other parts of the hippocampal formation and brain was spared. These results strongly suggest the localization of high densities of calcium channels to the granule cells of the dentate gyrus.",
