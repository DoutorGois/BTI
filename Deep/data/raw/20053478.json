     "AB": "Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), an enzyme that primarily degrades insulin, has recently been demonstrated to play a significant role in the catabolism of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein in the brain. Reduced IDE expression and/or activity have been associated with the etiology and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using three model systems, the present investigation provides the first documentation indicating that estrogen robustly regulates the expression of IDE in normal, menopausal and early-stage AD brains. In vitro analyses in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons revealed that 17beta-estradiol (17beta-E2) increased IDE in both mRNA and protein levels in a time-dependent manner. Further pharmacological analyses indicated that 17beta-E2-induced IDE expression was dependent upon estrogen receptor (ER) beta and required activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). In vivo analyses in adult female rats revealed a brain region-specific responsive profile. Ovariectomy (OVX) induced a significant decline in IDE expression in the hippocampus, which was prevented by 17beta-E2. Neither OVX nor 17beta-E2 affected IDE expression in the cerebellum. In vivo analyses in triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) female mice revealed an inverse correlation between the age-related increase in Abeta load and the decrease in IDE expression in the hippocampal formation. Treatment with 17beta-E2 attenuated Abeta accumulation/plaque formation and elevated hippocampal IDE expression in 12-month-old 3xTg-AD OVX mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that 17beta-E2 regulates IDE expression in a brain region-specific manner and such a regulatory role in the hippocampus, mediated by an ERbeta/PI3-K pathway, could serve as a direct mechanism underlying estrogen-mediated preventative effect against AD when initiated at the onset of menopause.",
