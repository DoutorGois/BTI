     "AB": "The motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mouse has been documented to accumulate proteolipid and thus is a model of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis [Dunn, W.A., Raizada, M.K., Vogt, E.S. and Brown, E.A., Int. J. Dev. Neurosci., 12 (1994) 185-196; Faust, J.R., Rodman, J.S., Daniel, P.F., Dice, J.F. and Bronson, R.T., J. Biol. Chem., 269 (1994) 10150-10155]. While accumulation of proteolipid in the hippocampus of chimeric mice composed of mnd and +/+ cells was found to be proportional to the contribution of mnd in the brain, accumulation within individual cells was the same for cells from chimeric and age-matched mnd mice. Bone marrow transplantation was used to altering the milieu of circulating factors to determine whether this might modify the disease phenotype in mnd mice. Transplantation of bone marrow in neonatal or young mice did not reduce the age-associated accumulation of proteolipid within hippocampal neurons. The results of these experiments indicate that mnd results in a cell autonomous defect.",
