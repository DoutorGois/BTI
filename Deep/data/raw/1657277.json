     "AB": "We identified a 50 kDa neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor from human hippocampus by affinity labeling. NPY specific binding and labeling of the receptor were inhibited in parallel by increasing concentrations of unlabeled NPY (IC50 = 0.27 nM and 0.18 nM, respectively). Peptide YY (PYY), but none of the pancreatic polypeptides, was as effective as NPY in displacing [125I]NPY. NPY fragments inhibited binding with the rank order of potency: NPY greater than NPY13-36 greater than NPY20-36 greater than or equal to NPY18-36 greater than NPY1-36 free acid greater than or equal to NPY26-36. These results demonstrate that the human hippocampal NPY receptor is a 50 kDa protein fitting the classification of a Y2 receptor subtype.",
