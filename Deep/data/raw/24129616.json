     "AB": "Recently identified new potential functions of antidepressants in the treatment of neurodegenerative will be introduced. Antidepressants are reported to regulate stem cell fate to regenerate neurons in the adult hippocampus and are effective in reducing toxic amyloid peptides and are known to increase neurotrophic factor such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Clinical trial data support that antidepressants have potential to treat Alzheimer's disease.",
