     "AB": "By fura-2 fluorometry, we investigated the direct effects of Ca2+ antagonists including a new benzothiazepine, clentiazem, on the high-K(+)-evoked increase in the concentration of cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in rat cerebral synaptosomes and cultured hippocampal neurons. In both preparations, metal ions inhibited the high-K(+)-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, in the following order: La3+ greater than Cd2+ much greater than Ni2+. Although flunarizine and nicardipine inhibited the K(+)-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in synaptosomes, other Ca2+ antagonists, including clentiazem and nitrendipine, had little effect at 10 microM. In hippocampal neurons, clentiazem inhibited the K(+)-induced increase in [Ca2+]i at 10 microM, as did flunarizine and nicardipine. However, nifedipine and nitrendipine had little effect in either cultured neurons or in synaptosomes.",
