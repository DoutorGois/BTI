     "AB": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are expressed in the hippocampus, and their functional roles are beginning to be delineated. The effect of nAChR activation on the activity of both interneurons and pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region was studied in rat hippocampal slices. In CA1 stratum radiatum with muscarinic receptors inhibited, local pressure application of acetylcholine (ACh) elicited a nicotinic current in 82% of the neurons. The majority of the ACh-induced currents were sensitive to methyllycaconitine, which is a specific inhibitor of alpha7-containing nAChRs. Methyllycaconitine-insensitive nicotinic currents also were present as detected by a nonspecific nAChR inhibitor. The ACh-sensitive neurons in the s. radiatum were identified as GABAergic interneurons by their electrophysiological properties. Pressure application of ACh induced firing of action potentials in approximately 70% of the interneurons. The ACh-induced excitation of interneurons could induce either inhibition or disinhibition of pyramidal neurons. The inhibition was recorded from the pyramidal neuron as a burst of GABAergic synaptic activity. That synaptic activity was sensitive to bicuculline, indicating that GABA(A) receptors mediated the ACh-induced synaptic currents. The disinhibition was recorded from the pyramidal neuron as a reduction of spontaneous GABAergic synaptic activity when ACh was delivered onto an interneuron. Both the inhibition and disinhibition were sensitive to either methyllycaconitine or mecamylamine, indicating that activation of nicotinic receptors on interneurons was necessary for the effects. These results show that nAChRs are capable of regulating hippocampal circuits by exciting interneurons and, subsequently, inhibiting or disinhibiting pyramidal neurons.",
