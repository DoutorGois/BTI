     "AB": "The influence of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on learning process in mice and on neuronal excitability of the hippocampal tissue obtained from stimulated animals were investigated. While the stimulation with rTMS at higher frequency (15 Hz) improved animals' performance in novel object recognition test (NOR), lower frequency (1 and 8 Hz) impaired the memory. The effect was observed when evaluated immediately after rTMS exposure and declined with time. In parallel to the results of behavioral test, there was a significant enhancement of the synaptic efficiency expressed as of the long-term potentiation (LTP) recorded from hippocampal slices prepared from the animals exposed to 15 Hz rTMS. The stimulation with 1 and 8 Hz had no influence on the magnitude of LTP. Our results demonstrate that rTMS modifies mechanisms involved in memory formation. The effects of rTMS in vivo are preserved and expressed in the hippocampus tested in vitro.",
