     "AB": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of methamphetamine (MA) exposure during pregnancy and lactation on doublecortin (DCX) expression in the hippocampus of rat offspring and also on learning/memory. Thirty-five pregnant Wistar rats were randomly divided into seven groups of 5 rats each: three experimental groups, each receiving 5 mg/kg body weight (BW) intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of MA during pregnancy or/and lactation; three sham groups, each receiving saline injections; one control group, receiving no injection. After the interventions, two male pups (1 and 22 days old) were randomly selected from each mother, sacrificed and their brains subjected to DCX immunohistochemistry. One additional male pup from each mother was randomly selected and maintained for 60 days for testing in the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests. MA administration during pregnancy was found to have significantly decreased the number of DCX-positive cells in the CA1, CA3 and DG regions of the hippocampus in the 1-day pups (P </= 0.05) and to have significantly decreased the number of DCX-positive cells in only two regions of the hippocampus, the CA1 and DG regions, in 22-day old pups. In comparison, exposure to MA during lactation was only associated with a significant decrease in the number of DCX-positive cells in the DG. Exposure to MA during pregnancy had significant impact on the intensity of DCX expression in the hippocampus of 1- and 22-day pups (P </= 0.05). There was no significant difference in memory/learning among the study groups. Our results indicate the administration of MA during pregnancy had a greater effect that during the lactation period on DCX expression in the hippocampus of rat offspring.",
