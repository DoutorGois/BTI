     "AB": "Acutely prepared rabbits were used to study, electrophysiologically, tetanic and post-tetanic potentiation of the pathway from the medial septal region to hippocampal field CA1. It was found that tetanic potentiation, evoked by short stimulus trains, was maximal at 6--8 Hz. Responses recovered from post-tetanic potentiation in 5--35 seconds. Acetylcholine, physostigmine, and cyclic GMP each had an excitatory effect on pyramidal cell responses when applied in stratum radiatum. The time course studies showed that these effects outlasted the duration of the injection current by many minutes. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., isobutyl methyl xanthine) prolonged the time course of recovery with test responses which were post-tetanically potentiated. K+, on the other hand, selectively enhanced tetanic potentiation. It is suggested, with respect to the potentiation phenomena, that K+ acted primarily presynaptically to facilitate transmitter release, whereas cyclic GMP acted primarily postsynaptically for the enhancement of pyramidal cell excitability.",
