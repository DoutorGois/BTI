     "AB": "8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) is a selective 5-HT1A serotonin agonist. Derivatives of 8-OH-DPAT with amine substituents larger or more bulky than n-propyl appear to be inactive in a presynaptic biochemical assay measuring agonist-induced feedback inhibition of 5-HT synthesis but have never been examined in brain binding assays. A series of N-phenylalkyl derivatives of 8-methoxy-2-aminotetralin was evaluated at [3H]-8-OH-DPAT-labeled 5-HT1A sites in rat brain hippocampal membranes. All of the phenylalkyl derivatives displayed significant affinity for these sites and, of the agents examined, the 3-phenylpropyl 8-hydroxy analogue appears to be optimal and had an affinity (Ki = 1.9 nM) comparable to that of 8-OH-DPAT (Ki = 1.2 nM). In addition, the presence of an oxygen-containing substituent at the 8-position of the tetralin ring is not necessary for good affinity, and secondary amines and tertiary amines displayed equal affinity at central 5-HT1A binding sites. 5-HT1A sites are found both pre- and postsynaptically; thus, differences observed in the biochemical assay as compared to the results of the present binding study could be due to different structural requirements of these two receptors. This seems unlikely, however, because there was little difference in the affinities of several selected analogues for striatal versus hippocampal binding sites. Because we have now demonstrated that amine substituents larger than propyl, and an unsubstituted 8-position, are well tolerated by central 5-HT1A sites, future studies aimed at the development of new serotonergic tetralin analogues need not be limited to N-propyl or 8-hydroxy derivatives of 2-aminotetralin.",
