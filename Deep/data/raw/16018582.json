     "AB": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was studied in different rat brain regions (cerebellum, hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus and cortex) in the presence of different organic solvents normally used in the in vitro assay. The organic solvents used were acetone (C3H6O), acetonitrile (C2H3N), ethyl alcohol (C2H6O), isopropyl alcohol (C3H8O), methyl alcohol (CH4O), tert-butyl alcohol (C4H10O) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, C2H6OS) ranging from 0.6 to 10%. Ethyl and methyl alcohol presented no effect on AChE activity at any of the concentrations and brain structures tested. In the hippocampus, isopropyl alcohol did not demonstrate a significant inhibitory effect, even at high concentrations. Tert-butyl alcohol presented an interesting result, increased AChE activity (P < .05) in the hypothalamus (1.8%), cortex (1.8 and 2.5) and striatum (1.2, 1.8 and 2.5%) and decreased activity at a concentration of 10% in the cortex (P < .05) and striatum (P < .01). Acetone and acetonitrile presented similar results, both significantly inhibiting AChE in all structures (5%, P < .05 and 10%, P < .01). DMSO exhibited a highly inhibitory effect at practically all concentrations tested (P < .01). In conclusion, for testing new compounds on AChE activity in vitro, methyl and ethyl alcohol may be the best organic solvent choice.",
