     "AB": "In the retinogeniculate pathway of the ferret, in addition to the separation of the inputs from the two eyes to form eye-specific layers, there is also an anatomical segregation of the terminal arbors of on-center retinal ganglion cells from the terminal arbors of off-center retinal ganglion cell axons to form on/off sublaminae. Sublamination normally occurs during postnatal weeks 3-4 and requires the activity of retinal afferents, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, nitric oxide synthase, and a target of nitric oxide, cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin dependent serine, threonine protein phosphatase suggested to mediate NMDA-receptor dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. We have examined whether calcineurin plays a role during on/off sublamination in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the ferret. Immunohistochemistry showed that calcineurin expression is transiently up-regulated in dLGN cells and neuropil during the period of on/off sublamination. A functional role for calcineurin during sublamination was investigated by blocking the enzyme locally via intracranial infusion of FK506. Treatment with FK506 during postnatal weeks 3-4 disrupted the appearance of sublaminae. These results suggest that calcineurin may play a role during this process of activity-dependent pattern formation in the visual pathway.",
