     "AB": "Modern diagnostics for the determination of neurologically relevant autoantibodies are based on indirect immunofluorescence using tissue sections of the hippocampus, cerebellum and other tissues. For monospecific detection human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells transfected with different neurological antigens are used. Biochip mosaics are designed to give a quick overview and contain 20 or more substances positioned next to each other on a reaction field, which are incubated with the serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample. Western blots based on cerebellum or hippocampus extracts or line blots containing defined recombinant antigens are used additionally. Initial investigations should always comprise the parallel analysis of all major antineural autoantibodies instead of performing only single parameter tests. Up until a few years ago autoantibodies against intracellular neuronal antigens were mainly investigated. Antibodies against structures of the neural cell surface, however, are much more frequently found, especially those against glutamate receptors (type NMDA).",
