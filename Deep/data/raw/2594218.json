     "AB": "The properties of high [K+]o-induced spontaneous bursting and electrographic seizures in hippocampal slices prepared from rats subjected to kindling from either the lateral entorhinal cortex or the angular bundle were compared to those in control slices. Kindling enhanced the frequency of K+-induced burst-firing in the CA3 region and the duration of triggered bursts in the dentate gyrus, as previously reported. However, kindling had no influence on the characteristics or occurrence of electrographic seizures in the CA1 region of slices bathed in elevated [K+]o. In addition, the development of electrographic seizures in slices from control animals did not require a preconditioning period of burst input from the CA3 region.",
