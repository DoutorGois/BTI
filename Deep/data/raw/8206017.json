     "AB": "The intracarotid amobarbital procedure and direct cortical stimulation are commonly used techniques for functional mapping in candidates for epilepsy surgery. The role of these two procedures has been challenged recently. Emerging technologies recently applied to functional mapping include optical imaging, functional positron emission tomography studies, transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetoencephalography, and fast magnetic resonance imaging. Studies have used these new technologies and the potential for these procedures to replace the established but more invasive techniques is being considered.",
