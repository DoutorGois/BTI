     "AB": "Endocannabinoids control hippocampal inhibitory synaptic transmission through activation of presynaptic CB(1) receptors. During depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), endocannabinoids are synthesized upon postsynaptic depolarization. The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) may mediate hippocampal DSI. Currently, the best studied pathway for biosynthesis of 2-AG involves the enzyme diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL). However, whether DAGL is necessary for hippocampal DSI is controversial and was not systematically addressed. Here, we investigate DSI at unitary connections between CB(1) receptor-containing interneurons and pyramidal neurons in CA1. We found that the novel DAGL inhibitor OMDM-188, as well as the established inhibitor RHC-80267, did not affect DSI. As reported previously, effects of the DAGL inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin depended on the application method: postsynaptic intracellular application left DSI intact, while incubation blocked DSI. We show that all DAGL inhibitors tested block slow self-inhibition in neocortical interneurons, which involves DAGL. We conclude that DAGL is not involved in DSI at unitary connections in hippocampus.",
