     "AB": "In situ hybridization was used to examine the distribution of neurons containing cholecystokinin (CCK) mRNA in human, monkey and rat brain. In rat and monkey brain CCK mRNA was visualized in the substantia nigra pars compacta and in the ventral tegmental area. The dopaminergic cell bodies in the human substantia nigra did not however show detectable amounts of CCK mRNA. Low levels of CCK mRNA were observed in the nucleus paranigralis, the human equivalent of the rodent ventral tegmental area. High levels of CCK mRNA were seen in other regions of the same brains including the cortex and the hippocampus. Thus, the adult human substantia nigra dopaminergic cells, in contrast to primate and rodent substantia nigra, do not express CCK. These results question the hypothesis of an involvement of CCK in the regulation of dopaminergic neurons and help to explain the absence of decreased CCK levels in the caudate and putamen of Parkinson's disease victims.",
