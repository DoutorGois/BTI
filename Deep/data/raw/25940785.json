     "AB": "Brain peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors, is involved in neuroprotection. It is activated by the drug rosiglitazone, which then can increase the pro-survival protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), to mediate neuroprotection. However, the mechanism underlying this molecular cascade remains unknown. Here, we show that the neuroprotective protein neurotrophic factor-alpha1 (NF-alpha1), which also induces the expression of BCL-2, has a promoter that contains PPARgamma-binding sites that are activated by rosiglitazone. Treatment of Neuro2a cells and primary hippocampal neurons with rosiglitazone increased endogenous NF-alpha1 expression and prevented H2 O2 -induced cytotoxicity. Concomitant with the increase in NF-alpha1, BCL-2 was also increased in these cells. When siRNA against NF-alpha1 was used, the induction of BCL-2 by rosiglitazone was prevented, and the neuroprotective effect of rosiglitazone was reduced. These results demonstrate that rosiglitazone-activated PPARgamma directly induces the transcription of NF-alpha1, contributing to neuroprotection in neurons. We proposed the following cascade for neuroprotection against oxidative stress by rosiglitazone: Rosiglitazone enters the neuron and binds to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) in the nucleus. The PPARgamma-rosiglitazone complex binds to the neurotrophic factor-alpha1 (NF-alpha1) promoter and activates the transcription of NF-alpha1 mRNA which is then translated to the protein. NF-alpha1 is the secreted, binds to a cognate receptor and activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway. This in turn enhances the expression of the pro-survival protein, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and inhibition of caspase 3 (Csp-3) to mediate neuroprotection under oxidative stress.
