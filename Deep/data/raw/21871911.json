     "AB": "Lead (Pb) exposure during development has been associated with impaired long-term potentiation (LTP). Hypothyroidism happening upon subjects with occupational exposure to Pb is suggestive of an adverse effect of Pb on thyroid homeostasis, leading to the hypothesis that Pb exposure may alter thyroid hormone homeostasis. Hippocampus is one of the targets of Pb exposure, and is sensitive to and dependent on thyroid hormones, leading us to explore whether levothyroxine (L-T(4)) administration could alter the thyroid disequilibrium and impairment of LTP in rat hippocampus caused by Pb exposure. Our results show that Pb exposure caused a decrease in triiodothyronine (T(3)) and tetraiodothyronine (T(4)) levels accompanied by a dramatic decrease of TSH and application of L-T(4) restored these changes to about control levels. Hippocampal and blood Pb concentration were significantly reduced following L-T(4) treatment. L-T(4) treatment rescued the impairment of LTP induced by the Pb exposure. These results suggest that Pb exposure may lead to thyroid dysfunction and induce hypothyroidism and provide a direct electrophysiological proof that L-T(4) relieves chronic Pb exposure-induced impairment of synaptic plasticity.",
