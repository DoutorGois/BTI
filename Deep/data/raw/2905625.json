     "AB": "Borna disease (BD) agent is an infectious pathogen that causes progressive central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction in a wide range of vertebrate hosts. The course of BD in adult rats is biphasic. The acute phase is characterized by aggressive behavior and inflammatory cell infiltrates in brain. With chronic infection animals become listless and inflammation resolves. BD antigens are similarly distributed in neurons in hippocampus, neocortex, cerebellum and brainstem in acutely and chronically infected animals. We have recently examined brain levels of neuronal transcripts in rats with acute and chronic BD. Levels for 3 of these mRNAs, cholecystokinin, glutamic acid decarboxylase and somatostatin, were decreased in acutely infected rats and increased toward control values in chronically infected rats. A fourth transcript, MuBr8, correlated in distribution with BD antigen, was persistently decreased throughout the course of infection. These data may have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of neurologic disturbances in BD and other inflammatory CNS diseases.",
