     "AB": "The effects of the cholinoceptor agonist, carbachol (CCh), were examined in the rat hippocampal slice preparation. Intracellular recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurones revealed that CCh (1-3 microM) inhibited excitatory postsynaptic responses evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway while, at the same time, direct excitability was enhanced. Extracellularly, CCh produced a concentration-dependent reduction of the amplitude of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (field EPSP) recorded in the CA1 apical dendritic region. The muscarinic receptor antagonist, pirenzepine, competitively antagonized the effects of CCh on the field EPSP with a pA2 of 7.4. These results confirm earlier reports of a presynaptic inhibitory action of CCh in the hippocampal CA1 region and provide strong evidence that this effect is mediated by muscarinic receptors of the M1 subtype.",
