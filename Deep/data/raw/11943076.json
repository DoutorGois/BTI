     "AB": "Carbon dioxide euthanasia is an established method for the termination of small laboratory animals. It has also been employed by the authors in neurobiological research on the post-mortem glutamate concentration in the structures of rat brains. The following investigations were aimed at optimizing the termination procedure based on the CO2 saturation rate of the inhaled air. Two rates of CO2 flow were applied, and the higher one significantly augmented the glutamate level in the hippocampus and cerebellum. The relationship between this finding and signs of central fear reaction is discussed. The authors conclude that lower rather than higher CO2 flow in euthanasia procedures is gentler and is therefore preferable for use with laboratory animals.",
