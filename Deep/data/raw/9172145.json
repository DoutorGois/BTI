     "AB": "The extracellular Ca2+ (Cao)-sensing receptor (CaR) is expressed in hippocampus and other brain regions, suggesting that it could mediate some of the well recognized but poorly understood direct actions of Cao on neuronal function. This study presents evidence that the CaR is functionally coupled to Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels. The effects of CaR agonists on these channels in neurons from wild type (WT) and CaR-deficient (CaR -/-) mice were compared. Neomycin (100 mM) and elevation of Cao from 0.5 to 3 mM significantly increased the probability of channel opening (Po) in neurons from WT but not in those from CaR -/- mice. Thus the CaR activates neuronal K+ channels and could potentially inhibit neuronal excitability and neurotransmission via membrane repolarization.",
