     "AB": "Cardiac arrest (CA) causes ischemia-reperfusion injury in the whole body among victims. Especially in the brain, inflammation and neuronal cell death can lead to irreversible dysfunction. Our goal was to determine whether a single administration of soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor (AS2586144-CL) has a neuroprotective effect and decreases the inflammatory response after CA and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Global cerebral ischemia was induced in male C57BL/6 mice with 8min of CA. Thirty minutes after recovery of spontaneous circulation, the mice were randomly assigned to three groups and administered AS2586144-CL: 1mg/kg (n=25), 10mg/kg (n=25), or 0mg/kg (vehicle, n=25). At 6 and 7 days after CA/CPR, behavioral tests were conducted and brains were removed for histological evaluation. Analysis of histological damage 7 days after CA/CPR revealed that 10mg/kg of AS2586144-CL protected neurons, and suppressed cytokine production and microglial migration into the hippocampus. Two hours after CA/CPR, 10mg/kg of AS2586144-CL suppressed serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha and hippocampal nuclear factor kappaB expression. Our data show that 10mg/kg of AS2586144-CL administered following CA/CPR suppresses inflammation and decreases neuronal damage.",
