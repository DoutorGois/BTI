     "AB": "The specific pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor, PAC(1)-R, consists of at least seven isoforms, and they are differentially coupled to signal transduction pathways by alternative splicing. We have found that the major splice variants of the PAC(1) receptor seen during development are the short splice isoform, PAC(1)-R-s (which does not contain either the \"hip\" or \"hop\" cassette), and another form, PAC(1)-R-hop (which contains the \"hop\" cassette). We also have applied an innovative molecular histochemical technique, in situ reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and determined that these two splice isoforms are colocalized in the neuroepithelia from the primitive streak stage.",
