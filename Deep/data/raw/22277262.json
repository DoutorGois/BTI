     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide. In man, [18F]AV-45 with positron emission tomography (PET) is currently studied and used to track in vivo amyloid accumulation. Here, [18F]-AV45-PET was used to visualize amyloid deposition in a transgenic murine model of amyloidosis (APP/PS1-21). Studies were performed ex vivo by autoradiography and in vivo by microPET. Autoradiograms of the brain sections highlighted an increased uptake of [18F]AV-45 in APP/PS1-21 mice compared with age-matched control mice. From 8 months, an intense labeling was observed in cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. The marked accumulation of radiotracer was found in close association with thioflavin S-positive amyloid plaques. The longitudinal microPET assessment, performed from 3 to 12 months of age, demonstrated an increased [18F]AV-45 uptake in APP/PS1-21 compared with control mice. The elevated tracer uptake was increased in association with age. This study opens the possibility of [18F]AV-45, coupled with microPET, to visualize and quantitatively measure amyloid deposits in the brains of living APP/PS1 mice.",
