     "AB": "This magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was designed to investigate whether patients with schizophrenia have focal or lateralized deficits in the volumes of temporal lobe structures. Estimated volumes of the temporal lobes, hippocampi, superior temporal gyri, lateral ventricles, third ventricle, temporal horns of the lateral ventricles, and a frontal-parietal reference area (FPRA) were quantified for each hemisphere. The schizophrenic group had less gray matter (GM) in the temporal lobes and the FPRA relative to controls. Ventricular volumes were significantly larger in the schizophrenic group, as was cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume for temporal lobe sulci. No significant differences in hippocampal volumes emerged between groups. The magnitude of GM deficit was not greater in the temporal lobes relative to the FPRA. These results confirm the presence of bilateral GM volume deficits of the temporal lobes in schizophrenia but do not support the hypothesis that structural changes preferentially affect the temporal lobes or the left cerebral hemisphere.",
