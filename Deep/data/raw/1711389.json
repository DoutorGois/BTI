     "AB": "An ability of substance P (30 micrograms/kg intravenously) to prevent deleterious effects of ethanol (E) (0.5 g/kg intravenously) on central mechanisms of escape reaction elicited by threshold electrical stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus was investigated in chronic experiments upon rabbits. Substance P was found to prevent E effects on excitability of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and on facilitatory influences of the midbrain reticular formation on this emotional centre which were observed in intact animals. Inhibitory effects of the dorsal hippocampus on the VMH could not be evaluated due to its alterations in response to previous substance P administration. The authors suggest that substance P can be considered to be a possible endogenous factor to increase a tolerance of emotional behavioural reactions of an organism to alcohol.",
