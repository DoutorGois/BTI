     "AB": "The primary transmitter deficit is cholinergic in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the amygdala receives a major cholinergic projection from the nucleus basalis of Meynert (Ch4), which may play an important role in the retention of affective conditioning and/or memory consolidation. We measured brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in 54 patients with AD and in 22 normal controls by positron emission tomography and N-[(11)C]methylpiperidin-4-yl acetate to characterize the cholinergic pathology in AD. The k(3) values were calculated as an index of AChE activity in a three-compartment model analysis using the metabolite-corrected arterial input function. The k(3) values were highly significantly reduced by 20% in the cerebral neocortex (P <0.0001 in the two-tailed t test), 14% in the hippocampus (P <0.001), and 33% in the amygdala (P <0.0001) in AD patients compared with normal controls. The k(3) values were significantly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination scores in both the cerebral cortex (P <0.001) and the amygdala (P <0.05) in AD patients, supporting the cholinergic hypothesis of cognitive dysfuncion in AD. Further studies are required, however, to elucidate the specific role of the cholinergic deficit in the amygdala in the emotional and behavioral symptoms in AD.",
