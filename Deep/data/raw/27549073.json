     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: To quantify associations between inflammatory biomarkers and hippocampal volume (HV) and to examine effect modification according to sex, race, and age. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analyses using generalized estimating equations to account for familial clustering; standardized beta-coefficients adjusted for age, sex, race, and education. SETTING: Community cohorts in Jackson, Mississippi and Rochester, Minnesota. PARTICIPANTS: The Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy study. MEASUREMENTS: C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors 1 (sTNFR-1) and 2 (sTNFR-2) from peripheral blood were measured in a sample of 773 non-Hispanic whites (61% women, aged 60.2 +/- 9.8) and 514 African Americans (70% women, aged 63.9 +/- 8.1) who also underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging. Biomarkers were standardized and compared according to sex, race and age with HV. RESULTS: In the full sample, higher sTNFR-1 and sTNFR-2 were associated with smaller HV. Each standard deviation (SD) increase in sTNFR-1 was associated with 59.1 mm(3) (95% confidence interval (CI) = -101.4 to -16.7 mm(3) ) smaller HV and each SD increase in sTNFR-2 associated with 48.8 mm(3) (95% CI = -92.2 to -5.3 mm(3) ) smaller HV. Relationships were stronger for sTNFR-2 in men (HV = -116.6 mm(3) for each SD increase, 95% CI = -201.0 to -32.1) than women (HV = -26.0 per SD increase, 95% CI = -72.4-20.5) and sTNFR-1 in non-Hispanic whites (HV = -84.7 mm(3) per SD increase, 95% CI = -142.2 to -27.1) than African Americans (HV = -14.1 mm(3) per SD increase, 95% CI = -78.3-50.1). Associations between IL-6 or CRP and HV were not supported. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of sTNFRs were associated cross-sectionally with smaller hippocampi. Longitudinal data are needed to determine whether these biomarkers may help to identify risk of late-life cognitive impairment.",
