     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The study examined whether enhanced limbic mineralocorticoid receptor activity resulting in negative glucocorticoid feedback could contribute to the diminished basal and stress-induced cortisol output reported in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHOD: The effects of acute antimineralocorticoid (spironolactone) versus placebo pretreatment on levels of plasma cortisol at baseline and after stimulations with corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and on adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level were measured in 12 PTSD patients and 12 healthy comparison subjects. RESULTS: Spironolactone significantly elevated basal cortisol and ACTH concentrations as well as cortisol secretion after CRH stimulation, but no differential effect between PTSD patients and comparison subjects was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate intact, but not enhanced, mineralocorticoid receptor function in PTSD. The study's experimental conditions did not allow determination of whether other compensatory factors might have masked the putative mineralocorticoid receptor changes.",
