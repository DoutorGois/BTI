     "AB": "Pregnancy involves changes in brain function that implicate a re-organization in neuronal cytoskeleton. We analyzed the content of the microtubule associated protein Tau (65kDa isoform) and its phosphorylated form (PhosphoTau) in several rat brain regions throughout pregnancy and on day 2 of lactation by Western blot. In hypothalamus the content of Tau increased on days 2 and 18 of gestation compared with days 14, 21 and in lactation. PhosphoTau content increased throughout pregnancy. In preoptic area Tau content did not show significant changes throughout pregnancy or lactation, however, the content of PhosphoTau presented a decrease on day 21 of gestation. In hippocampus Tau content decreased on day 14 until day 21 compared with day 2 of gestation, however, in lactation day 2 the content of Tau increased meanwhile PhosphoTau content progressively increased throughout pregnancy. In frontal cortex Tau content decreased on day 21 of gestation compared with days 2, 14 and 18, with an increase in lactation, whereas PhosphoTau did not show significant changes. In cerebellum Tau protein decreased on days 14, 18 and 21 of pregnancy with an increase in lactation. PhosphoTau content increased throughout pregnancy and on day 2 of lactation. PhosphoTau/Tau ratio changes in each brain area along pregnancy and in lactation. Our data suggest that Tau expression and its phosphorylation pattern change in a tissue-dependent manner throughout pregnancy and the beginning of lactation in the rat brain.",
