     "AB": "The regional, laminar, and longitudinal organization of intrinsic projections in the presubiculum was examined in the rat with the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin and the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin. Cells of origin of intrinsic projections in the presubiculum were distributed in layers II and V, with almost none in layers III and VI. Projections from layer II cells were bilateral and confined to layers II and V and also to the deep portion of layer I, whereas projections from layer V cells were ipsilateral and confined largely to layer V, with fewer projections to layer II. Septotemporal and proximodistal differences in both the projection and the distribution of layer II cells were found: layer II cells in the septal and mid presubiculum, especially those located in the distal part, provided long projections to the temporal presubiculum, whereas layer II cells in the temporal presubiculum provided slightly shorter projections almost entirely within the mid and temporal presubiculum. Layer II cells aggregated massively in the distal portions of the septal and mid presubiculum, but very few layer II cells were found in the most proximal part, especially in the temporal presubiculum. On the other hand, in layer V, cells of origin and their terminals were diffusely and equally distributed throughout the entire proximodistal extent of the presubiculum. Layer V cells did not project longitudinally as far as layer II cells. These longitudinal connections, in layers II and V, make it possible to merge information conveyed by parallel pathways in the presubiculum.",
