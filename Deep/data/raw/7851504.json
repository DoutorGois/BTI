     "AB": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether or not the reduction of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by the cerebral cortical slices in aged rats (22-23 months old) was attenuated by somatostatin or carbachol. In 8-week-old rats, somatostatin and carbachol produced concentration-dependent increases in 2-deoxyglucose uptake. 2-Deoxyglucose uptake of the cortical slices in 22-23-month-old rats was significantly facilitated by treatment with 0.1-1 microM somatostatin or 1-100 microM carbachol. Metabolic responses to somatostatin or carbachol were quite similar in young and aged rats. The present results demonstrated that 2-deoxyglucose uptake by the cerebral cortex was facilitated by somatostatin and carbachol in both young and old rats.",
