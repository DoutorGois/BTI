     "AB": "A cDNA clone of an alpha subunit of the human GABA-A receptor has been isolated. The human clone (pCLL800) contains 1055 nucleotides in an open reading frame and 260 nucleotides in the 5' non-coding region. The 351 amino acid sequence of this human alpha subunit shows 97% homology with its bovine counterpart. Hybridization of pCLL800 to Northern blots shows a 3.9/4.3 Kb RNA doublet in human cortex, rat whole brain, cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, olfactory bulb and cerebellum. Developmental studies show that the levels of the rat alpha mRNA increase between one and three weeks of age in a manner similar to the development of the benzodiazepine binding sites.",
