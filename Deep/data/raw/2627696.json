     "AB": "Hyperpolarizations, or outward currents, recorded in CA1 pyramidal cells during brief anoxia (2-3 min) (but not postanoxic hyperpolarizations) are markedly reduced (92 +/- 4.8%) by dantrolene sodium, applied by superfusion (10-20 microM). This effect, which is at least partly reversible by prolonged washing, is in keeping with the idea that anoxia activates a Ca2(+)-sensitive K conductance by releasing Ca2+ from internal stores.",
