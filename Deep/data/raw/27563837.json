     "AB": "Liraglutide is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue that was recently approved to treat obesity in some countries. Considering that liraglutide effects on brain energy metabolism are little known, we evaluated the effects of liraglutide on the energy metabolism. Animals received a single or daily injection of saline or liraglutide during 7 days (25, 50, 100, or 300 mug/kg i.p.). Twenty-four hours after the single or last injection, the rats were euthanized and the hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, and posterior cortex were isolated. Our results demonstrated that a single dose of liraglutide in young rats increased the activity of complexes and inhibited creatine kinase activity. Repeated administrations of liraglutide in young rats reduced the activity of complexes and activated creatine kinase activity. In adult rats, a single dose of liraglutide reduced the activity of complex I and creatine kinase and increased the activity of complexes II and IV. Repeated administrations of liraglutide in adult rats increased the activity of complexes I and IV and reduced the activity of complex II and creatine kinase. We concluded that liraglutide may interfere in energy metabolism, because analysis of different times of administrations, concentrations, and level of brain development leads to divergent results.",
