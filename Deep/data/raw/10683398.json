     "AB": "Two patients with severe global amnesia are described who differ in the extent to which they have acquired new semantic information. Patient SS, who has extensive medial temporal lobe damage including the hippocampus as well as surrounding cortical areas, has failed to acquire virtually any new information regarding vocabulary or famous faces that entered the public domain since the onset of his amnesia. In contrast, patient PS, who has a selective lesion of the hippocampus proper, has gained a sense of familiarity of novel vocabulary and famous people, even though her effortful retrieval of this new semantic knowledge remains impaired. These findings extend to amnesia of adult onset, the proposal of Vargha-Khadem and colleagues that in patients with selective hippocampal injury, cortical areas surrounding the hippocampus may play an important role in new semantic learning [Vargha-Khadem, F., Gadian, D.G., Watkins, K. E., Connelly, A., Van Paesschen, W. and Mishkin, M., regarding the importance of the subhippocampal cortices in the mediation of new semantic learning in children with hippocampal lesions, Science, 1997, 277, 376-380].",
