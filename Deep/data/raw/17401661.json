     "AB": "ATP is an important excitatory neurotransmitter and adenosine acts as a neuromodulatory structure inhibiting neurotransmitters release in the central nervous system. Since the ecto-nucleotidase cascade that hydrolyzes ATP to adenosine is involved in the control of brain functions and previous studies realized in our laboratory have recently reported that acute administration of Arg decreases the NTPDase and 5'-nucleotidase activities of rat blood serum, in the present study we investigated the effect of arginine administration on NTPDase and 5'-nucleotidase activities by synaptosomes from hippocampus of rats. First, sixty-days-old rats were treated with a single or a triple intraperitoneal injection of arginine (0.8 g/Kg) or an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline solution (control) and were killed 1 h later. Second, rats received an intracerebroventricular injection of 1.5 mM arginine solution or saline (5 microL) and were killed 1 h later. We also tested the in vitro effect of arginine (0.1-1.5 mM) on nucleotide hydrolysis in synaptosomes from rat hippocampus. Results showed that intraperitoneal arginine administration did not alter nucleotide hydrolysis. On the other hand, arginine administered intracerebroventricularly reduced ATP (32%), ADP (30%) and AMP (21%) hydrolysis, respectively. In addition, arginine added to the incubation medium, provoked a decrease on ATP (19%), ADP (17%) and AMP (23%) hydrolysis, respectively. Furthermore, kinetic studies showed that the inhibitory effect of arginine was uncompetitive in relation to ATP, ADP and AMP. In conclusion, according to our results it seems reasonable to postulate that arginine alters the cascade involved in the extracellular degradation of ATP to adenosine.",
