     "AB": "The repetition paradigm offers a useful technique for assessing recognition memory by evaluating how an individual responds to new versus old stimuli. While this paradigm has been extensively used in adults with and without clinical conditions, it has not, to our knowledge, been studied in a clinical pediatric population. Children with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) identified by newborn screening and treated early in life have normal intelligence but demonstrate residual cognitive deficits including selective memory problems that are attributed to their loss of thyroid hormone during hippocampal formation. Since the hippocampus is integral for recognition memory, we hypothesized that children with CH would perform atypically on the repetition paradigm. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during word and face recognition in nine children aged 11 to 13 years with CH and nine typically developing children matched for age. Results revealed that while the groups did not differ in accuracy or reaction time, they did differ significantly on selective ERP components. Like normal adults, the comparison children showed a positive elevation in P3 amplitude for repeated relative to new words at the parietal electrodes, whereas children with CH did not. Both groups produced weak repetition effects when viewing faces, although the amplitudes of children with CH were somewhat smaller. It is proposed that the dampened neurophysiological response to repeated verbal stimuli by children with CH may explain some of their clinically observed difficulties in short-term recognition memory.",
