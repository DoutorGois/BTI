     "AB": "Cell adhesion through binding between specific cell membrane receptors and corresponding cell-adhesion-molecule (CAM)-coated solid surfaces is examined. The morphology of surfaces at various modification steps leading to functionalization with cell-binding CAMs is characterized. In one week neuron cultures, enhanced growth on surfaces modified with neuron-binding versus astrocyte-binding CAMs is observed. However, nonspecific adhesion on a poly-D-lysine-coated positive control surface is found to be even higher. Potential reasons and further studies needed are discussed.",
