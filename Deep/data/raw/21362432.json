     "AB": "AIMS: Diabetes increases the chances of stroke and the stroke itself is thought to induce hyperglycemia and diabetes. However, this latter contention remains uncorroborated. We investigated whether ischemic hippocampal neuronal cell death induces glucose dysregulation by modulating insulin resistance, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and beta-cell mass in Mongolian gerbils fed either a high fat or low fat diet. MAIN METHODS: Gerbils were subjected to either an occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries for 8 mins to render them ischemic, or a sham operation. Ischemic gerbils were fed either an 11% fat diet (LFD) or a 40% fat diet (HFD) for 7, 14 or 28 days. KEY FINDINGS: Artery occlusion resulted in a 70% or greater initial reduction in hippocampal CA1 neurons and only HFD decreased the percentage of CA1 neurons as the ischemic periods became longer. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results revealed that ischemia induced glucose intolerance, and longer ischemic periods and HFD exacerbated this glucose intolerance in ischemic gerbils. Insulin secretion during the OGTT was lower in ischemic gerbils than sham gerbils and the decrease was greatest in the 28 day-HFD among all the groups. Insulin resistance was elevated the most in 28 day-HFD ischemic gerbils. There was a progressive loss of pancreatic beta-cell mass as the post-ischemic time period increased as consequence of HFD; the decrease being caused by increased apoptosis. This increase in apoptosis was partly associated with increased serum levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and non-esterified fatty acids. SIGNIFICANCE: Hippocampal neuronal cell death deteriorates glucose homeostasis initially through the modulation of insulin secretion and also causes a decrease in beta-cell mass while HFD negatively impacts glucose regulation.",
