     "AB": "We recorded magnetic and electrical responses simultaneously in an auditory detection task to elucidate the brain areas involved in auditory processing. Target stimuli evoked magnetic fields peaking at approximately the same latency of around about 400 msec (M400) over the anterior temporal, superior temporal, and parietal regions on each hemisphere. Equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) were analyzed with a time-varying multidipole model and superimposed on each subject's magnetic resonance image (MRI). Multiple independent dipoles located in the superior temporal plane, inferior parietal lobe, and mesial temporal region best accounted for the recorded M400 fields. These findings suggest that distributed activity in multiple structures including the mesial temporal, superior temporal, and inferior parietal regions on both hemispheres is engaged during auditory attention and memory updating.",
