     "AB": "The in vivo sensitivity of presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors (autoreceptors and heteroreceptors) modulating the synthesis of 5-hydroxytryptophan/serotonin (5-HTP/5-HT) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine/dopamine (DOPA/DA) in rat brain was investigated after ethanol treatment and withdrawal. In saline-treated rats as well as in acute ethanol (2 g/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.), 2 h)- and chronic ethanol (2 g/kg for 7 days)-treated rats, a low dose of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylamino-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.1 mg/kg, i.p., 1 h) did not decrease the synthesis of 5-HTP in brain (except modestly in striatum; 20% after the chronic treatment) or that of DOPA in striatum. In contrast, in chronic ethanol-withdrawn rats (24 h), 8-OH-DPAT significantly decreased the synthesis of 5-HTP in the hippocampus (29%), cerebral cortex (41%) and striatum (33%) and that of DOPA in the striatum (28%). Similar effects were induced by the mixed 5-HT(1A) agonist/D(2) antagonist buspirone (1 mg/kg, i.p., 1 h) which also decreased 5-HTP synthesis in the hippocampus (24%), cerebral cortex (36%) and striatum (35%) of chronic ethanol-withdrawn rats. These results indicate that chronic ethanol and more clearly the spontaneous withdrawal from chronic ethanol induce supersensitivity of 5-HT(1A)-auto/heteroreceptors modulating the synthesis of 5-HT and DA in rat brain.",
