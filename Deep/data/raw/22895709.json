     "AB": "Mitochondrial oxidative stress and damage have been implicated in the etiology of temporal lobe epilepsy, but whether or not they have a functional impact on mitochondrial processes during epilepsy development (epileptogenesis) is unknown. One consequence of increased steady-state mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels is protein post-translational modification (PTM). We hypothesize that complex I (CI), a protein complex of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, is a target for oxidant-induced PTMs, such as carbonylation, leading to impaired function during epileptogenesis. The goal of this study was to determine whether oxidative modifications occur and what impact they have on CI enzymatic activity in the rat hippocampus in response to kainate (KA)-induced epileptogenesis. Rats were injected with a single high dose of KA or vehicle and evidence for CI modifications was measured during the acute, latent, and chronic stages of epilepsy. Mitochondrial-specific carbonylation was increased acutely (48 h) and chronically (6 week), coincident with decreased CI activity. Mass spectrometry analysis of immunocaptured CI identified specific metal catalyzed carbonylation to Arg76 within the 75 kDa subunit concomitant with inhibition of CI activity during epileptogenesis. Computational-based molecular modeling studies revealed that Arg76 is in close proximity to the active site of CI and carbonylation of the residue is predicted to induce substantial structural alterations to the protein complex. These data provide evidence for the occurrence of a specific and irreversible oxidative modification of an important mitochondrial enzyme complex critical for cellular bioenergetics during the process of epileptogenesis.",
