     "AB": "The effect of muscarinic cholinergic drugs on (3H)-acetylcholine [3H)-Ach) release from slices of rat hippocampus was investigated either in the presence of eserine or hemicholinium-3 (HC-3), 10 microM each. BM-5 (N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-4-pyrolidino-2-butyl)acetamide) is a partial muscarinic cholinergic agonist. Like oxotremorine, BM-5 significantly (p less than 0.012) decreased the release of (3H)-Ach in the presence of HC-3. In the presence of eserine, (3H)-Ach release was significantly (p less than 0.001) enhanced both by atropine and BM-5. The decrease or increase in release of (3H)-Ach by BM-5, in the presence of HC-3 or eserine, respectively, may be due to its partial agonist effect on hippocampal muscarinic cholinergic receptors.",
