     "AB": "Immunoreactivities of beta/A4 amyloid precursor protein (APP) and soluble derivative of APP (APPs) were determined in the hippocampus and the striatum of reserpinized rat brains. Significant decrease of APPs immunoreactivity was observed in the cytosolic fraction of hippocampus, but not of striatum, whereas APP immunoreactivity was found to be increased in the membrane fraction of hippocampus. These findings suggest that processing of APP in hippocampus may be regulated through the monoaminergic signal transduction system.",
