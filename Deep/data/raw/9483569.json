     "AB": "The adenomatous polyposis coli gene is mutated in familial adenomatous polyposis and in sporadic colorectal tumours. The adenomatous polyposis coli gene product is a 300,000 mol. wt cytoplasmic protein that binds to at least three other proteins; beta-catenin, a cytoplasmic E-cadherin-associated protein; hDLG, a human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumour suppressor protein and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila ZESTE WHITE 3 protein. The adenomatous polyposis coli gene is highly expressed in the brain, suggesting that it may be involved in nerve function. Here we show that adenomatous polyposis coli is localized in the pericapillary astrocytic endfeet throughout the mouse central nervous system. Adenomatous polyposis coli is also localized in the astrocytic processes in the cerebellar granular layer, and displays concentrated expression in the terminal plexuses of the basket cell fibres around Purkinje cells. Adenomatous polyposis coli is further expressed in neuronal cell bodies and/or nerve fibres in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, brain stem, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. Adenomatous polyposis coli is demonstrated to be co-localized with beta-catenin and/or hDLG in neurons and nerve fibres, but not in astrocytes. From these results, adenomatous polyposis coli is suggested to participate in a signal transduction pathway in astrocytes which is independent of beta-catenin and hDLG, and also in regulation of neuronal functions in association with beta-catenin and hDLG.",
