     "AB": "Recent studies in rodents have shown that withdrawal from chronic drug abuse is associated with a significant decrease in dopamine (DA) release in mesolimbic structures, especially in the shell region of the nucleus accumbens. Since the DA system is known to play an important role in reward processes, a withdrawal-associated impairment in mesolimbic DA-mediated transmission could possibly implicate reward deficit and thus enhance vulnerability to drug craving and relapse. We have previously demonstrated that acute repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has a modulatory effect on DA release in several areas of the rat brain, including dorsal striatum, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens shell. In the present study, we investigated the possible use of rTMS as a tool in re-establishing the dysregulated DA secretion observed during withdrawal in morphine-sensitized male Sprague-Dawley rats. Using intracerebral microdialysis, we monitored the effects of acute rTMS (20 Hz) on the intra-accumbal release-patterns of DA in freely moving animals that were subjected to a morphine sensitization scheme for a period of 8 days. We provide first evidence that acute rTMS (20 Hz) is able to increase DA concentration in the shell region of the nucleus accumbens in both control animals and morphine-sensitized rats during abstinence. The DA release in morphine-sensitized rats was significantly higher than in controls. rTMS, therefore, might gain a potential therapeutic role in the treatment of dysphoric and anhedonic states during drug withdrawal in humans.",
