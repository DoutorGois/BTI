     "AB": "Recent breakthroughs in fluorescence microscopy have pushed spatial resolution well beyond the classical limit imposed by diffraction. As a result, the field of nanoscopy has emerged, and diffraction-unlimited resolution is becoming increasingly common in biomedical imaging applications. In this review, we recap the principles behind STED nanoscopy that allow imaging beyond the diffraction limit, and highlight both historical and recent advances made in the field of neuroscience as a result of this technology.",
