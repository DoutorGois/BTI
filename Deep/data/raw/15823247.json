     "AB": "Recently, we reported that the repeated activation of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in the rat hippocampus under tissue culture conditions induced the enhancement of excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which lasted more than 2 weeks and was accompanied by the formation of morphologically identifiable synapses. Here we examined whether an equivalent synapse formation is induced in dissociated cell cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. Brief (15-min) application of Sp-cAMPS (a membrane-permeable analog of cyclic AMP) induced an increase in the number of synaptic sites (identified by the apposition of immunocytochemically labeled pre- and postsynaptic structures). There were two types of increase: a short-lasting one that lasted less than 24 h after a single application of Sp-cAMPS, and a long-lasting one that lasted more than 2 weeks after repeated applications. The long-lasting increase in synaptic sites was dependent on the time and interval of application and was suppressed by Rp-cAMPS (a PKA inhibitor). The synapses were judged to be active based on the endocytosis of FM1-43, a fluorescent dye. Electron microscopy confirmed the increase in the number of synaptic ultrastructures. The present results show that the synaptogenesis induced by repeated PKA activation is reproducible in a neuronal network that is reconstituted under dissociated cell culture conditions. This experimental system, together with the synaptogenesis in the slice culture system described previously, serves as a good in vitro model for the analysis of the process of conversion from short-lasting plasticity (lasting for hours) into a long-lasting one (lasting for days-weeks).",
