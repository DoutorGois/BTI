     "AB": "Injection of kappa-agonist dynorphins and non-peptide kappa-agonists into the hippocampus induces a reduction in blood pressure. It has been postulated that kappa-opioid agonists and kappa-receptors are important in one mechanism of antihypertension and might have clinical potential for the treatment of hypertension. We have investigated whether chronic treatment with U-50488H and U-62066E, two non-peptide kappa-agonists, effects brain kappa 1- or kappa 2-receptor numbers or affinities in areas that might correlate with changes in blood pressure. kappa 1- and kappa 2-Opioid receptor affinities and densities were determined in cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain and pons after 14 days subcutaneous infusion of two non-peptide kappa-agonists, U-50488H and U-62066E, 9.6 mg kg day-1, by means of osmotic minipumps, to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and to Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. This infusion significantly reduced blood pressure. Brains were removed within 48 h of the end of drug infusion and kappa-receptor binding studies were performed on homogenates from each brain area using [3H]U-69593 to assay kappa 1-receptors and [3H]bremazocine to assay kappa 2-receptors. U-62066E treatment seemed to cause a slight decrease in the number of [3H]bremazocine binding sites (kappa 2-receptors) from 98.2 +/- 9 to 74.9 +/- 8 fmol (mg protein)-1 in the hippocampus when compared with SHR controls. A small decrease in kappa 2-receptor density in the pons of WKY rats was also observed after U-50488H treatment (control, 51.2 +/- 5; U-50488H-treated, 24.3 +/- 9 fmol (mg protein)-1. Although SHR blood pressure values were consistently reduced by treatment with kappa-agonists, there was little if any significant change in apparent numbers of kappa 1- or kappa 2-receptors or their affinities in any of the brain regions examined. These data indicate that although chronic treatment with kappa-agonists reduces blood pressure in SHR, the treatment does not elicit major changes in brain kappa-receptors either in SHR or in WKY rats. The potential use of kappa-agonists for treating hypertension might not cause receptor changes in the brain and might, therefore, result in fewer side effects or negligible rebound hypertension.",
