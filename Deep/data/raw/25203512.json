     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: We examined verbal list memory in participants with pathology-confirmed or biomarker-supported diagnoses to clarify inconsistencies in comparative memory performance. We hypothesized that Alzheimer disease (AD) participants would show more rapid forgetting, whereas behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) participants would show a more dysexecutive pattern. We also explored differences in medial temporal volumes, and relative frontal and medial temporal area contributions to memory consolidation. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Participants had clinical diagnoses of AD and bvFTD who were pathologically confirmed at autopsy or supported with Pittsburgh compound B amyloid imaging. We used cognitive and imaging data collected at baseline visits for a sample of 26 participants with AD (mean age=63.7, education=16.2, Clinical Dementia Rating=0.8), 25 participants with bvFTD (mean age=60.7; education=15.7; CRD=1.1), and 25 healthy controls (mean age=65.6; education=17.5; Clinical Dementia Rating=0.2). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: AD participants showed more rapid forgetting than bvFTD, and both groups showed more rapid forgetting than controls. In contrast, bvFTD did not conform to a more dysexecutive pattern of performance as patient groups committed similar number of intrusion errors and showed comparably low rates of improvement on cued recall and recognition trials. For patients with neuroimaging, there were no group differences in medial temporal volumes, which was the only significant predictor of consolidation for both dementia groups.",
