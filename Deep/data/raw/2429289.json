     "AB": "Using an antiserum directed against synthetic galanin (GAL) a sensitive radioimmunoassay was developed. The antiserum interaction with GAL was characterized by displacement curve characteristics and high performance liquid chromatography. Besides the main GAL-immunoreactive peak several small peaks with GAL-like immunoreactivity were observed. No cross-reactivity of the GAL-antiserum with several other peptides was observed. GAL-like immunoreactivity was measured in 37 microdissected areas of the rat central nervous system. High concentrations (greater than 2000 fmol/mg protein) were observed in the amygdaloid nuclei, the septum, globus pallidus, bed nuclei of the stria terminalis, all hypothalamic nuclei, the superior colliculus, locus coeruleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary. Moderate concentrations (1000-2000 fmol/mg protein) were observed in the hippocampus, the nucleus accumbens and nucleus of the diagonal tract, the caudate-putamen, the central gray, the nucleus, tract and substantia gelatinosa of the spinal trigeminal nerve. The results generally correlate with those previously published by immunocytochemistry. The widespread distribution of GAL-like immunoreactivity in the rat central nervous system suggests an involvement of GAL in a variety of brain functions.",
