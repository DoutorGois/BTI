     "AB": "Arthropod venoms are potential sources of neuroactive substances, providing new tools for the design of drugs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Dinoponera quadriceps venom (DqV) on seizure models in mice induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), pilocarpine, and strychnine. In the PTZ model, intraperitoneal treatment with DqV (0.5mg/kg) increased the time until the first seizure and the percentage of survival (155.4+/-27.7s/12.5%, p<0.05) compared to the control group (79.75+/-3.97s/0%), whereas endovenous treatment (0.1 and 0.5mg/kg) decreased the time until the first seizure (0.1mg/kg: 77.83+/-5.3s versus 101.0+/-3.3s in the control group; 0.5mg/kg: 74.43+/-3.9s versus 101.0+/-3.3s for the control group, p<0.05). We did not observe significant changes in the pilocarpine- and strychnine-induced seizure models. In assays that measured oxidative parameters in the PTZ model, intraperitoneal treatment with DqV (0.5 and 2.0mg/kg) only decreased the levels of MDA and nitrite in the cortex. However, endovenous treatment with DqV (0.1 and 0.5mg/kg) increased the levels of MDA in the cortex and hippocampus and at a dose of 0.5mg/kg in the striatum. Moreover, increased in nitrite content was observed in all three of the brain regions analyzed. Taken together, the D. quadriceps venom caused both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects in a PTZ-induced seizure model, and this effect was dependent on the route of administration used.",
