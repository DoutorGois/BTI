     "AB": "Severe traumatic brain injury in childhood, particularly that complicated by raised intracranial pressure, has significant long-term effects on the brain. Since magnetic resonance imaging provides a means of visualizing neuroanatomic structure in exquisite detail, the scope of this review is to revisit the pathology of traumatic brain injury described in recent clinical imaging studies. Acute imaging provides insight into the acute mechanism of focal and diffuse injury. There is some reduction in threshold for white matter pathology in the hemisphere ipsilateral to injury. After injury, there may be long-term effects on white matter architecture and the potential for brain growth. In this context, the pattern of hippocampal rather than parahippocampal gyrus tissue loss provides insight into the likely cause of white matter injury being cerebral hypoperfusion.",
