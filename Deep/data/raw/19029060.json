     "AB": "It is well established that brain ischemia can cause neuronal death via different signaling cascades. The relative importance and interrelationships between these pathways, however, remain poorly understood. Here is presented an overview of studies using oxygen-glucose deprivation of organotypic hippocampal slice cultures to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in ischemia. The culturing techniques, setup of the oxygen-glucose deprivation model, and analytical tools are reviewed. The authors focus on SUMOylation, a posttranslational protein modification that has recently been implicated in ischemia from whole animal studies as an example of how these powerful tools can be applied and could be of interest to investigate the molecular pathways underlying ischemic cell death.",
