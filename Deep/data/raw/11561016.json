     "AB": "The histochemical distribution of sialoglycoconjugates in the CA1 region in the hippocampus formation of 9-week-old rats and 30-month-old rats was examined using electron microscopy in combination with two lectins, Maackia amurensis lectin, specific for Sia(alpha)2-3Gal, and Sambucus sieboldiana agglutinin, specific for Sia(alpha)2-6Gal. Each lectin stained the plasma membranes of pyramidal cells, indicating that the Sia(alpha)2-3Gal and Sia(alpha)2-6Gal groups were expressed on their plasma membranes. These lectins also bound to synapses in the stratum lacunosum molecular. The staining intensity of the lectins in the synapses in these layers was downregulated in the 30-month-old rats. These results indicated that both the Sia(alpha)2-3Gal and Sia(alpha)2-6Gal groups are expressed on these synapses and that the expression of these sialyl linkages decreases in the aged brain",
