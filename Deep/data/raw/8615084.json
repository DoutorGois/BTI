     "AB": "We examined the histochemical localization of monoamine oxidase in the hippocampus of young and old senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM). We found a monoamine oxidase-B-positive granular structure (MGS) in the hippocampus of old SAMP8, an accelerated senescence-prone line of SAM. The MGS was a round-shaped granular structure of 0.5 to 5 microns diameter and usually formed a cluster, the largest diameter of which ranged from 50 to 150 microns. No MGS were found in the hippocampus of young SAMP8 or of young SAMR1, an accelerated senescence resistant line of SAM, and only few, if any, were seen in old SAMR1. A monoamine oxidase-positive astrocyte was usually observed in the central area of each cluster of MGS. Furthermore, the MGS was in close anatomical relationship with monoamine oxidase-positive astrocytic processes. The enzyme inhibition experiments showed that monoamine oxidase activities localized in the MGS and astrocytes were both predominantly of type B. These findings suggest MGS occurs at least partly in monoamine oxidase-B-positive astrocytes. Furthermore, the MGS was similar to a periodic acid-Schiff-positive granular structure, a polyglucosan body previously documented in the brains of old SAMP8 and some other aged mice strains including C57BL/6 and nude mice, in terms of their size, morphological appearances and topographical distribution in the hippocampus. Thus, the present results suggest that monoamine oxidase type B is a proteinaceous component of the periodic acid-Schiff-positive granular structure in aged mice brains, and might provide some clues for clarifying the mechanisms of age-related occurrence of periodic acid-Schiff-positive granular structures in mice brains.",
