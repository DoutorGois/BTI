     "AB": "We compared (+/-)epibatidine with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) in releasing adenosine and [3H]noradrenaline from slices of rat hippocampus and parietal cortex. (+/-)Epibatidine (0.1 microM) released [3H]noradrenaline but not adenosine from hippocampal slices incubated either with or without extracellular Mg2+. In contrast, NMDA (300 microM) released much more [3H]noradrenaline and also adenosine from hippocampal slices incubated in medium lacking Mg2+. (+/-)Epibatidine released neither adenosine nor [3H]noradrenaline from slices of rat parietal cortex, in contrast to NMDA which released both substances. These findings suggest that those behavioral responses to (+/-)epibatidine that are mediated by noradrenaline may involve the hippocampus but not the parietal cortex. Moreover, it seems unlikely that any of the behavioral effects of (+/-)epibatidine are mediated by adenosine release in either the parietal cortex or the hippocampus.",
