     "AB": "It has been shown in chronic experiments on rats that two periods of EEG and behavioral alterations may be distinguished during korazol kindling. The bursts of slow waves and spike-wave activity appear on the EEG during the first period as response to subthreshold doses of korazol, which is accompanied behaviorally by standing and myoclonuses. The second period is characterized by the appearance of high-frequency polymorphous generalized seizure discharges on the EEG accompanied by clonicotonic seizures. Interictal and ictal epileptic discharges appear primarily in the hippocamp and then in other brain structures during the development of korazol kindling. The conclusion is made that the hippocamp plays the role of a pathological determinant structure in the development of chronic brain epileptization during korazol kindling.",
