     "AB": "Action of 2-amino-5-bromo-2'-chlorobenzophenone (ABPH), a metabolite of phenazepam, on currents evoked by the activation of glycine and glutamate NMDA receptors has been investigated in enzymatically isolated hippocampal rat pyramidal neurones. It is demonstrated that 3-10 microM ABPH caused an inhibitory effect on glycine receptors which was more prominent after pre-incubation with the drug. Peak amplitude of NMDA receptor-mediated currents was weakly potentiated after prolonged (4-6 min) incubation with 10 microM ABPH. Thus, the effects of the benzophenone metabolites should be taken into account when analysing the action of phenazepam and other benzodiazepine drugs.",
