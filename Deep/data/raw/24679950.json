     "AB": "The efficacy of chronic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on depression is paralleled by the recovery of deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis related to sustained stress and elevated glucocorticoids. Previous studies have shown that atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is implicated in the regulation of neurogenesis and the antidepressant response. Whether the specific aPKC isoforms (PKCzeta, PKMzeta and PKCiota) are involved in SSRI-induced hippocampal neurogenesis and the underlying mechanisms is unknown. The present study shows that PKMzeta and PKCiota but not PKCzeta are expressed in rat embryonic hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs), whereas PKMzeta but not PKCiota expression is increased by the SSRI fluoxetine both in the absence and presence of the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone. PKMzeta shRNA significantly decreased neuronal proliferation and neuron-oriented differentiation, increased NSC apoptosis, and blocked the stimulatory effect of fluoxetine on NSC neurogenesis. Fluoxetine significantly increased PKMzeta expression in hippocampal NSCs in a 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) receptor-dependent manner in both the absence and presence of dexamethasone. The PKMzeta peptide blocker ZIP and MEK inhibitor U0126 significantly inhibited the increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein phosphorylation in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hippocampal NSC neurogenesis in response to fluoxetine and the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH DPAT. Collectively, our results suggest that the SSRI fl uoxetine increases hippocampal NSC neurogenesis via a PKMzeta-mediated mechanism that links 5-HT1A receptor activation with the phosphorylation of the downstream MAPK signaling pathway.",
