     "AB": "Neuropeptides represent by far the most common signalling molecules in the central nervous system. They are involved in a wide range of physiological functions and can act as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators or hormones in the central nervous system and in the periphery. Accumulating evidence during the past 40 years has implicated a number of neuropeptides in various cognitive functions including learning and memory. A major focus has been on the possibility that neuropeptides, by coexisting with classical neurotransmitters, can modulate classical transmitter function of importance for cognition. It has become increasingly clear that most transmitter systems in the brain can release a cocktail of signalling molecules including classical transmitters and several neuropeptides. However, the neuropeptides seem to come into action mainly under conditions of severe stress or aversive events, which have linked their action also to regulation of affective components of behaviour. This paper summarises some of the results of three neuropeptides, which can impact on hippocampal cognition by intrinsic (dynorphins, nociceptin) or extrinsic (galanin) modulation. The results obtained with these neuropeptides in rodent studies indicate that they are important for various aspects of hippocampal learning and memory as well as hippocampal plasticity. Recent studies in humans have also shown that dysregulation of these neuropeptides may be of importance for both neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with cognitive impairments. It is concluded that compounds acting on neuropeptide receptor subtypes will represent novel targets for a number of disorders, which involve cognitive deficiencies.",
