     "AB": "PURPOSE: We used a whole-brain, isotropic-voxel acquisition technique to improve the geometric distortion in diffusion-weighted (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in coronal directions, which is remarkable at high magnetic fields. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed magnetic resonance imaging of 17 healthy volunteers using a 3T scanner and obtained coronal DWI/DTI as well as coronal images that were reformatted from isotropic volume data acquired by 1.6-mm-thick axial DWI/DTI. We visually evaluated the degree of image distortion and quantitated the findings by co-registration analysis. RESULTS: In-plane geometric distortions in coronal DWI/DTI, particularly at the frontal base and medial temporal lobe, were dramatically diminished when the isotropic-voxel acquisition technique was used. Quantitative measurement revealed a reduction in areas of misregistration, but not their absence, in reformatted coronal images, mainly because of distortion in the anteroposterior direction in the source images. CONCLUSION: The isotropic-voxel DWI/DTI technique enabled acquisition of coronal images that represented anatomical details accurately with permissible spatial distortion while maintaining spatial resolution, even at 3T.",
