     "AB": "Ghrelin, an orexigenic peptide synthesized by endocrine cells of the gastric mucosa, plays a major role in inhibiting seizures. However, the underlying mechanism of ghrelin's anticonvulsant action is still unclear. Nowadays, there are considerable evidences showing that ghrelin is implicated in various neurophysiological processes, including learning and memory, neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and inflammatory effects. In this review, we will summarize the effects of ghrelin on epilepsy. It may provide a comprehensive picture of the role of ghrelin in epilepsy.",
