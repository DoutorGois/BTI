     "AB": "AIM: To observe protein expression changes of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor and related regulatory protein in the hippocampus and amygdala in chronic immobilization stressed rat and Xiaoyaosan's regulatory effect. METHODS: Rats were tied 3 h per day to establish immobilization stress condition and treatment with Xiaoyaosan. After 7 days and 21 days stress, the protein expression of AMPA receptor subunit (GluR2/3), N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) and protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1) in hippocampus and amygdala were detected by using Western blot techniques. RESULTS: The expression of GluR2/3, NSF in dentate gyrus (DG) and amygdala were markedly attenuated (P < 0.05) and PICK1 in CA1 region were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in 7 d immobilization stressed rats while 7 days xiaoyaosan treatment showed an effective regulatory result to PICK1's changes. Under 21 days immobilization stressed condition, the expression of GluR2/3, NSF in CA1 region showed an increasing trend, and GluR2/3 showed a markedly increase (P < 0.01), but showed an significantly decreased trend in amygdala, Xiaoyaosan showed an effective result to such changes above (P < 0.05). The expression of PICK1 showed increasing trend in amygdala and xiaoyaosan could lower its expression (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There are different trends of the expression of AMPA receptor in repeat short-term stress versus chronic immobilization stress, and in hippocampal CA1 region versus amygdala. Xiaoyaosan has better regulation effect on the expression of AMPA receptors in the condition of chronic immobilization stress than those of repeat shortterm stress.",
