     "AB": "Housing rats in an enriched environment after focal brain ischemia improves functional outcome without changes in infarct volume, suggesting neuroplastic changes outside the lesion. In this study, permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was followed by housing in an enriched or a standard environment. Nerve growth factor-induced gene A and glucocorticoid receptor messenger RNA expression were determined by in situ hybridization two to 30 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Stroke induced a decrease in nerve growth factor-induced gene A messenger RNA expression in cortical areas outside the ischemic lesion and in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus two to three days after ischemia. This decrease was more prolonged with environmental enrichment, lasting until 20 days. However, 30 days after focal cerebral ischemia, environmental enrichment increased nerve growth factor-induced gene A expression compared to standard housing. A reduction of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (type II) messenger RNA two to 12 days after stroke in standard housed rats was restored by environmental enrichment. These data suggest that improved functional outcome induced by environmental enrichment after middle cerebral artery occlusion is associated with dynamically altered expression of nerve growth factor-induced gene A messenger RNA in brain regions outside the ischemic lesion, and sustained levels of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor messenger RNA expression.",
