     "AB": "AIM: To test the antiepileptic effect of phencynonate hydrochloride and investigate its antiepileptic mechanism. METHODS: Through establishment of different epilepsy models, antiepileptic effects of phencynonate hydrochloride and other drugs were examined. Besides, the effect of phencynonate hydrochloride and other compounds against NMDA-induced lethality in mice, NMDA-induced injury in rat primary hippocampal neuronal cultures and NMDA-induced current were also observed. RESULTS: Phencynonate hydrochloride produced a significant anticonvulsant effect on different epilepsy models. Furthermore, phencynonate hydrochloride also exerted its obvious protection against the lethal effects of NMDA in mice, antagonized the NMDA-induced injury in rat primary hippocampal neuronal cultures and blocked NMDA-induced current in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Phencynonate hydrochloride had a notable anticonvulsant effect on typical epilepsy models, its antiepileptic mechanism might relate to its antagonism against NMDA receptor.",
