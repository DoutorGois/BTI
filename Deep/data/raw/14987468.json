     "AB": "Using a novel in vivo model for cerebral ischemia produced by short-lasting compression of a well-defined brain area of sensorimotor cortex we studied neuroprotective effects of the NMDA NR2B subunit selective antagonist, CP-101,606, in Sprague-Dawley rats. Cortical compression for 30 min produced a consistent and highly reproducible functional impairment, that is paresis of contralateral hind and fore limbs. The neurological deficit was accompanied by marked brain damage in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and thalamus as identified by Fluoro-Jade, a marker of general neuronal cell death. Using a daily performed beam walking test it was shown that untreated animals recovered from their functional impairment within 5-7 days following surgery. Intravenous administration of increasing doses (1, 5, 10, 20 mg/kg) of the NMDA NR2B subunit receptor specific antagonist, CP-101,606, dose-dependently improved the rate of functional recovery and protected against the ischemic brain damage in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus as identified 2 days after the ischemic insult. Based upon these results, we conclude that NMDA NR2B receptor subunits represent potential targets to reduce not only the functional deficits, but also neuronal death in cortex and several midbrain regions produced by moderate, transient, cerebral ischemia.",
