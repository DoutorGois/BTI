     "AB": "It is well established that spatial memory is dependent on the hippocampus in both mammals and birds. As memory capacity can fluctuate on a temporal basis, it is important to understand the mechanisms mediating such changes. It is known that early memory-dependent experiences in young animals result in hippocampal enlargement and in increased neurogenesis, including cell proliferation and neuron survival. It is less clear, however, whether temporal changes in spatial memory are also associated with changes in hippocampal anatomy and cell proliferation in fully grown and experienced adult animals. In a previous study, we experimentally demonstrated that socially subordinate mountain chickadees (Poecile gambeli) showed inferior spatial memory performance compared to their dominant group mates, in the absence of significant differences in baseline corticosterone levels. Here we investigated whether these differences in memory between dominant and subordinate birds were associated with changes in the hippocampus. Following memory tests, chickadees were injected with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine to label dividing cells and sacrificed 2 days after the injections. We found no significant differences in volume or the total number of neurons in the hippocampal formation between dominant and subordinate chickadees, but subordinate birds had significantly lower cell proliferation rates in the ventricular zone adjacent to both the hippocampus and mesopallium compared to the dominants. Individuals, which performed better on spatial memory tests tended to have higher levels of cell proliferation. These results suggest that social status can affect cell proliferation rates in the ventricular zone and support the hypothesis that neurogenesis might be involved in memory function in adult animals.",
