     "AB": "In our previous study, a novel factor, TA2O, was isolated from NGlO8-l5 cells. The TA2O mRNA was increased by stimulation which also induced neuronal differentiation. Neuronal cells overexpressed with TA2O extended long neurites and stopped cell growth (Tohda et al., 1995, Neurosci. Res., 23: 21-27). We investigated the expression pattern of TA2O mRNA in developing rat brains to predict physiological roles of TA2O. TA2O mRNA began to increase between embryonic days 13 and 16. TA2O mRNA was observed mainly in neocortical, hippocampal and precerebellar neuroepithelium on embryonic day 16. Although the level of TA2O mRNA in the cerebral cortex was higher before birth than after birth, the level in cerebellar Purkinje cells increased gradually even after birth. The high expression level of TA2O mRNA in the hippocampus was maintained before and after birth. Thus, TA2O was expressed highly in brain regions in which neurons were changing morphologically and qualitatively, suggesting that TA2O may be involved in neuronal formation in vivo.",
