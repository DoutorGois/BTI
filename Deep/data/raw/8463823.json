     "AB": "The possibility that the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) is followed by changes in protein synthesis has been examined using high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. 35S-methionine, infused into the third ventricle of anesthetized rats, was used to label hippocampal proteins. LTP was induced unilaterally in the dentate gyrus by tetanic stimulation of the perforant path, and followed either for 1 hr or for 3 hr. Two-dimensional gel autoradiographs were quantitatively analyzed using the PDQUEST system (Protein Databases Inc.). One hour after the unilateral induction of LTP, only one protein spot was found to be statistically different in intensity from corresponding spots in the contralateral control side. Three hours after LTP, however, 11 spots were found to have altered densities. Examination of basic proteins using the nonequilibrium pH gel electrophoresis system revealed changes in three proteins in the 3 hr group. Reductions as well as increases in spot intensities were observed. The results indicate that LTP is associated with a complex pattern of changes in protein synthesis.",
