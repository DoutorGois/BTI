     "AB": "Interaction between the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-R and the neuronal adhesion molecule F3 might be involved in the formation of neuronal networks. In this study, the fragment of tenascin-R comprising epithelial growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and the cysteine-rich NH2 terminal stretch (EGF-L), known to be inhibitory for growing neurites and repellent for growth cones, was used to investigate the signaling events following the F3/EGF-L interaction. We addressed this question using an in vitro test with F3-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that allowed us to measure the kinetics, magnitude and specificity of the repellent effect resulting from the specific F3/EGF-L interaction. We showed that the repellent effect was counteracted by addition of the serine/threonine kinase and -phosphatase modulators (staurosporine, okadaic acid and H7) but not by modulators of tyrosine kinase or -phosphatases. This result indicates that the intracellular signals activated by the repellent effect involve a serine/threonine kinase pathway. Furthermore, the repellent effect of the EGF-L fragment for growth cones of cultured cerebellar neurons was also abolished by the identical modulators of serine/threonine kinase and -phosphatases. The inhibition of neurite outgrowth from hippocampal neurons by EGF-L was abolished in the presence of the serine threonine-kinase inhibitor H7. These results strongly suggest that the F3/tenascin-R interaction through EGF-L involves an intracellular activation of serine/ threonine kinase(s) in all F3-expressing cells tested.",
