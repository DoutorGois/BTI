     "AB": "Although MRS measurements are useful in assessing the biochemical alterations underlying human epilepsy, to date their use has been limited primarily by three factors: (a) the lack of widespread methods and appropriate hardware for acquiring high-resolution spectroscopic imaging data, (b) difficulties in spectral interpretation associated with metabolic heterogeneity, and (c) difficulties in biological interpretation due to a lack of correlative histologic studies. In this work, we (a) describe approaches to overcome these hurdles, and (b) discuss the biological interpretation of the spectroscopic findings in TLE.",
