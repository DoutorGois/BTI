     "AB": "The effect of two closely related xanthine derivatives, pentoxifylline and HWA 285, on cyclic AMP accumulation in rat hippocampal slices and on adenosine uptake in erythrocytes was examined. Pentoxifylline was a weak competitive antagonist of adenosine effects on cyclic AMP accumulation. HWA 285, by contrast, had a small stimulatory effect per se and also potentiated the effect of adenosine (10-30 microM). Neither pentoxifylline nor HWA 285 significantly affected the cyclic AMP accumulation induced by the stable adenosine analogue NECA or by alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor activation. HWA 285 was a much more potent inhibitor of adenosine uptake into human erythrocytes than pentoxifylline and other examined xanthines including thiocaffeine, 8-p-sulphophenyltheophylline, theophylline, caffeine and enprofylline. It is suggested that HWA 285 may potentiate, rather than antagonize, the effects of endogenous as well as exogenous adenosine, partly as a consequence of adenosine uptake inhibition.",
