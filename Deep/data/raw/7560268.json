     "AB": "CA3 pyramidal neurons were stained with biocytin during intracellular recording in rat hippocampus in vivo and reconstructed using a computer-based system. The in vivo CA3 neurons were characterized primarily according to their proximity to the hilus and secondarily with respect to the septotemporal location. Neurons measured in CA3a (n = 4), in CA3b (n = 4), and in posterior/ventral locations (n = 3) had the greatest dendritic lengths (19.8, 19.1, and 26.8 mm on average, respectively). Cells closer to the hilus showed much shorter dendritic lengths, averaging 10.4 mm for CA3c neurons (n = 4) and 11.6 mm for zone 3 neurons (n = 2). Half of the cells showed more than one major apical dendrite, and dendritic trees were highly variable even within CA3 subregions. The mean electronic length for these cell groups averaged between 0.30 lambda (CA3c) and 0.45 lambda (posterior/ventral), assuming a constant specific-membrane resistivity of 60 K omega-cm2. These CA3 neurons form a database of reconstructed neurons for further morphometric and electrical modelling studies. The large degree of variability between individual CA3 neurons indicates that both dendritic and electrical properties should be specifically calculated for each cell rather than assuming a \"typical\" morphology.",
