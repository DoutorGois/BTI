     "AB": "The effect of As2 and Cinnarizin on cerebral circulation is studied on rabbits using the method of local cerebral rheography. Rheoencephalograms (REG) are recorded from the following brain structures; sensomotor cortex, substantia alba, poseterior hippocampus amygdala; nucleus caudatus and coliculus superior. Arterial blood pressure and ECG are studied simultaneously. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the REG wave is made. Quantitative analysis involves the calculation of the following parameters: amplitude, anacrotic section of the curve and its relative part, spreading time and dicrotic index. The complex of REG-changes under the effect of the two drugs is very similar and suggests dilatation of the cerebral blood vessels. The difference is in the time of occurrence of the maximum effect: 5th min for As2 and 45th min for Cinnarizine.",
