     "AB": "40 normal male Wistar rats were trained for 8 successive days to consume water ad libitum during once-daily 20-min. sessions. On the following day (training day) the rats were presented with a novel solution of 10% sucrose for 20 min. followed by a single exposure for 2 hr. to one of two weak (200 to 500 nanoTesla) complex magnetic fields or to sham-field conditions. The patterns of the two magnetic fields and the durations of their repeated presentations (interstimulus interval) were designed to be resonant with the intrinsic firing of hippocampal pyramidal and solitary neurons, respectively. Immediately after the applications of the fields one-half the number of rats were injected with lithium to evoke gastrointestinal malaise. Although on the test day, three days later, rats previously injected with the lithium exhibited the usual robust reduction in the consumption of sucrose compared to the training day, there were no statistically significant differences between field-exposed and sham-field groups for these ratios. We conclude that a 2-hr. exposure to weak magnetic fields designed to simulate the pattern of two structures likely involved with conditioned taste aversion between the conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus did not affect this behavior.",
