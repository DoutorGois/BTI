     "AB": "Exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids (GCs) during early life induces long-lasting neuroinflammation. GCs induce rapid degranulation of mast cells, which release proinflammatory molecules promoting activation of microglia and astrocytes. The possible involvement of oligodendrocytes, however, remains poorly understood. It was studied whether high GC levels during gestation activates the inflammasome in hippocampal oligodendrocytes of mouse offspring. Oligodendrocytes of control pups showed expression of inflammasome components (NLRP3, ACS, and caspase-1) and their levels were increased by prenatal administration of dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic GC. These cells also showed high levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, revealing activation of the inflammasome. Moreover, they showed increased levels of the P2X7 receptor and pannexin1, which are associated to inflammasome activation. However, levels of connexins either were not affected (Cx29) or reduced (Cx32 and Cx47). Nonetheless, the functional states of pannexin1 and connexin hemichannels were elevated and directly associated to functional P2X7 receptors. As observed in DEX-treated brain slices, hemichannel activity first increased in hippocampal mast cells and later in microglia and macroglia. DEX-induced oligodendrocyte hemichannel activity was mimicked by urocortin-II, which is a corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR) agonist. Response to DEX and urocortin-II was inhibited by antalarmin (a CRHR blocker) or by mast cells or microglia inhibitors. The increase in hemichannel activity persisted for several weeks after birth and cross-fostering with a control mother did not reverse this condition. It is proposed that activation of the oligodendrocyte inflammasome might be relevant in demyelinating diseases associated with early life exposure to high GC levels. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
