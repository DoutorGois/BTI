     "AB": "Some immune system proteins have recently been implicated in the development and plasticity of neuronal connections. Notably, proteins of the major histocompatibility complex 1 (MHC class 1) have been shown to be involved in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and the development of projection patterns in the visual system. We examined the possible role for the MHC class 1 proteins in one well-characterized example of synaptic exuberance and subsequent refinement, the climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje cell (PC) synapse. Cerebella from adult mice deficient for two MHC genes, H2-D1 and H2-K1, and for beta2-microglobulin gene were examined for evidence of deficient elimination of supernumerary CF synapses on their PCs. Electrophysiological and morphological evidence showed that, despite the absence of these MHC class 1 molecules, adult PCs in these transgenic mice are monoinnervated as in wild-type animals. These findings indicate that, at the level of restriction of afferent number at this synapse, functional MHC class 1 proteins are not required.",
