     "PG": "9728-38",
     "AB": "The involvement of adenosine on the development of time-dependent reversal of long-term potentiation (LTP) by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) was investigated at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses of rat hippocampal slices. A train of LFS (2 Hz, 10 min, 1200 pulses) had no long-term effects on synaptic transmission but produced lasting depression of previously potentiated responses. This reversal of LTP (depotentiation) was observed when the stimulus was delivered </=3 min after induction of LTP. However, application at 10 min after induction had no detectable effect on potentiation. This time-dependent reversal of LTP by LFS appeared to be mediated by extracellular adenosine, because it was mimicked by bath-applied adenosine and was specifically inhibited by the selective A(1) adenosine receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (100 nM). The effect of adenosine could be mimicked by 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist buspirone, but the LFS-induced depotentiation could not be antagonized by 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist NAN-190. The source of extracellular adenosine in response to LFS appeared to be attributable to the efflux of cAMP. In addition, this LFS-induced depotentiation was blocked by bath application of adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin or injection of a cAMP analog Sp-adenosine cAMP (10 mM) into postsynaptic neurons. Moreover, the selective protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A prevented the LFS-induced depotentiation. These results thus suggest that increasing extracellular adenosine appears to underlie the LFS-induced depotentiation via acting on the A(1) receptor subtype to interrupt the cAMP-dependent biochemical processes leading to the LTP expression.",
