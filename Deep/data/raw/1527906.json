     "AB": "The histological localization of S-100 beta protein in the hippocampus of human autopsy brains of 47 males (71-103 years old) and 90 females (56-104 years old) was studied immunohistochemically. Astrocytes and their processes were positively stained, but neuronal cells were not stained. However, Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangle-like, senile plaque-like and fibrillary spindle figures were stained positively. S-100 beta positive structures increased in grade with age, but not always equally on Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles or senile plaques stained by Bodian method. Astrocytes decreased in number with age, and showed marked compensatory hypertrophy of their processes. S-100 beta positive structures seemed to be related to astroglial changes in terms of degeneration or loss of synapses.",
