     "AB": "We studied the possibility of objective diagnosis of Alzheimer-type dementia through radiological findings by evaluating cerebral and hippocampal atrophy in magnetic resonance images of patients with dementia. A statistically significant difference was seen in the hippocampus area index (HAI) and the ventricle area index (VAI) of healthy elderly individuals. Discriminant analysis with these two indexes demonstrated a sensitivity of 90.2% and a specificity of 81.8%, with an overall accuracy of 87.7%. Multiple discriminant analysis with VAI and HAI by stage of dementia showed an overall accuracy of 61.6% for discrimination of four stages. These results indicate that quantitative magnetic resonance imaging measurements can be used as an objective diagnostic technique for Alzheimer-type dementia.",
