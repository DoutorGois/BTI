     "AB": "We recently cloned an extracellular calcium (Ca2+0)-sensing receptor (CaR) from bovine parathyroid. The CaR is also expressed in various regions of brain, suggesting that it could potentially mediate some of the well-known but poorly understood effects of Ca2+0 on neuronal function. We have now examined the effects of polycationic CaR agonists on the activity of nonselective cation channels (NCC) in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, using the cell-attached configuration of the patch clamp technique and applying CaR active agents to the external bath solution. The polycationic CaR agonist, neomycin (100 microM), as well as an elevated concentration of Ca2+0 (3 mM), which is known to activate the cloned CaR, significantly increased the probability of channel opening (Po). The polyamine, spermine (300 microM), which also mimics the actions of Ca2+0 on the cloned CaR, produced similar changes in Po in rat hippocampal neurons. Elevation of Ca2+0 also increased Po for a similar NCC in HEK293 cells transfected with the cloned human CaR but not in nontransfected HEK cells. Thus the CaR can regulate the activity of Ca(2+)-permeable NCC in hippocampal neurons and could potentially modulate key functions of these cells, including neurotransmission and neuronal excitability.",
