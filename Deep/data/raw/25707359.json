     "AB": "Autism is a human developmental brain disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication. Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2, CNTNAP2) is a known genetic risk factor of autism. However, how this protein might contribute to pathology is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that Caspr2 is abundantly present in lipid raft and in the synaptic membrane but is highly depleted in the postsynaptic density. The Caspr2 protein level in hippocampus is present at a constant level during synapse formation and myelination from P0 to P84. Interaction proteomics revealed the interactors of Caspr2, including CNTN2, KCNAs, members of the ADAM family (ADAM22, ADAM23 and ADAM11), members of LGI family and MAGUKs (DLGs and MPPs). Interestingly, a short form of Caspr2 was detected, which lacks most of the extracellular domains, however, is still associated with ADAM22 and to a lesser extent LGI1 and Kv1 channels. The comprehensive Caspr2 interactome revealed here might aid in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying autism.
