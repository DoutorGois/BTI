     "AB": "Rats with lesions to the hippocampus proper and the subiculum were tested for timing behavior and temporal memory. Using the peak procedure, they were trained to discriminate a 40 s interval and a retention gap tested the memory for time. Results were interpreted within the theoretical framework of the internal clock and with respect to current theories on hippocampal function. Timing behavior was unaffected by either lesion and no shifts in the temporal discrimination functions were observed. The lesions also failed to show a deficit in the memory for temporal events. For all groups, the retention gap increased the mean peak time by the time of the gap. This indicated that all rats used the stop rule which required the use of working memory. Thus, it was concluded that the hippocampus is neither necessary for accurate timing behavior nor for the memory of temporal events.",
