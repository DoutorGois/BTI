     "AB": "Rats were treated with repeated intraventricular injections of ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) (10 micrograms/rat, twice daily for 8 days), 36 h after the last injection, the total number of 3H-diazepam binding sites was increased in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus by 63, 51 and 38%, respectively. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the dissociation constants (KD) between beta-CCE and solvent treated rats. In contrast, chronic beta-CCE administration failed to change the number of the apparent affinity of 3H-beta-CCE binding sites in all the brain areas examined. The results suggest that beta-CCE is an antagonist at the 3H-diazepam binding sites.",
