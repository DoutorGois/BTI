While both patient groups had smaller volumes of several medial temporal regions (e.g. entorhinal cortex, left hippocampus), schizophrenics had significantly smaller anterior superior temporal gyri (STG) than normal controls, but AD patients did not. We have previously demonstrated anterior STG volume to be reduced in early life onset schizophrenia.",
