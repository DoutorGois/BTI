     "AB": "The metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) response in dissociated rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons was recorded, using the nystatin-perforated patch-clamp technique. The mGlu response was localized in the ventral site of the hippocampal CA1 region. In both the ventral and dorsal sites of the CA1 region, the current amplitude of the mGlu responses as well as their induction probability (responsiveness) were reduced with development of the brain.",
