     "AB": "The endogenous glucocorticoid (GC) surge in late gestation plays a vital role in maturation of several organ systems. For this reason, pregnant women at risk of preterm labor are administered synthetic glucocorticoids (sGCs) to promote fetal lung development. Animal studies have shown that fetal sGC exposure can cause life-long changes in endocrine and metabolic function. We have previously shown that antenatal sGC treatment is associated with alterations in global DNA methylation and modifications to the hippocampal methylome and acetylome. In this study, we hypothesized that: 1) there are changes in the transcriptional landscape of the fetal hippocampus in late gestation, associated with the endogenous cortisol surge; 2) fetal sGC exposure alters genome-wide transcription in the hippocampus; and 3) these changes in transcription are associated with modified glucocorticoid receptor (GR) DNA binding and DNA methylation. sGC was administered as 2 courses on gestational days (GD) 40, 41, 50, and 51, and the hippocampi of fetal guinea pigs were examined before (GD52) and after (GD65) the endogenous cortisol surge (Term approximately GD67). We also analyzed fetal hippocampi 24 hours and 14 days following maternal sGC injections (n = 3-4/group). Genome-wide modification of transcription and GR DNA binding occurred in late gestation, in parallel with the normal GC surge. Further, sGC exposure had a substantial impact on the hippocampal transcriptome, GR-DNA binding, and DNA methylation at 24 hours and 14 days following the final sGC treatment. These data support the hypothesis that GC exposure in late gestation plays a significant role in modifying the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of the developing fetal hippocampus and that substantial effects are evident for at least 2 weeks after sGC exposure.",
