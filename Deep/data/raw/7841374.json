     "AB": "The spontaneous activity of neurones of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in urethane-anaesthetized rats was examined for the presence of very slow oscillatory activity. Fifty-four of the 86 dLGN neurones (63%) recorded extracellularly displayed oscillatory activity in the 0.02-0.03 Hz range. Similar very slow oscillations were observed in the ventral part of the LGN and the nucleus lateralis posterior (LP), but not in the hippocampus. Diffuse light stimuli dampened or blocked these oscillations in 23 of the 29 neurones tested. In a second group of experiments (iontophoretic studies) the very slow oscillatory activity was efficiently blocked by N-methyl-D-aspartate.",
