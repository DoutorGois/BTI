     "AB": "Autoradiographic studies have shown that many neurones in explant cultures of rat neocortex, hippocampus, preoptic area and spinal cord express binding sites for [3H]-estradiol which are distributed over the cell bodies and primary processes. By means of immunohistochemistry, it was observed that neurones were labelled by monoclonal antibodies against estrogen alpha-receptors and a polyclonal antibody against estrogen beta-receptors. Immunoreactivity was distributed over the soma and primary processes of the cells, the nuclei being more intensely stained. Double-immunostaining revealed a colocalization of estrogen alpha- and beta-receptors on approximately half of the neurones in cultures from neocortex and hippocampus whereas in cultures from preoptic area and spinal cord only few cells were double-stained. On many neurones, a coexistence of estrogen receptors and cholinergic muscarinic or nicotinic sites was found. Furthermore, combined autoradiographic and immunohistochemical studies have shown a colocalization of receptors for estrogen and the neuropeptide [125I]-galanin. The coexistence of estrogen and cholinergic sites as well as of estrogen and galanin receptors on the same neurones are discussed with respect to neurodegenerative events such as Alzheimer's disease.",
