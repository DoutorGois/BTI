     "AB": "Nucleic acid and protein content in various cellular fractions of different regions of the brain were investigated in male albino rats following aluminum (Al) exposure (at the dose of 15% of LD50 i.p. for 28 days) on either an adequate or inadequate protein diet. It was observed that there was a decrease in homogenate DNA content in the thalamic area (Th), midbrain-hippocampal region (MH) and cerebellum (CL), but not in the cerebrum (CC) of the protein-restricted group of animals. Increased RNA content was recorded in the ribosomal and soluble fractions of CL of the adequately protein-fed animals compared to pair-fed controls. In the low-protein-fed animals, on the other hand, a decrease in RNA content was observed in the whole homogenate and nuclear fractions of CC, MH and CL, the ribosomal and soluble fractions of MH and CL, and in the mitochondrial fraction of TH. Ribonucleolytic activity was found to be increased only in the Th and CL of the adequately protein-fed group. Protein contents in the subcellular fractions of these four regions remain almost unaltered with the present dose and duration of Al-exposure; only the soluble fraction of CC and microsomal fraction of Th of the low-protein-fed group showed a significant decrease. The results of the present investigation confirm that Al has generally depressive effects on the nucleic acid metabolism of the brain and suggest that these effects are region-specific as well as dependent on dietary protein level. It is further suggested that alterations in the cellular microenvironment, caused by protein malnutrition, may play a significant role in the modification of the effects of Al in the brain.",
