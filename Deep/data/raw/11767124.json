     "AB": "Genipin, which was shown in our previous investigation to have prominent neuritogenic activity in paraneurons such as PC12h cells, was studied to determine whether it could prevent the toxicity of Alzheimer's amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in cultured hippocampal neurons. Increased release of lactate dehydrogenase from hippocampal neurons after 2 d of Abeta25-35 administration was prevented dose dependently by the addition of genipin 20-40 microm. Morphological observations and trypan blue staining of cells confirmed the protection of hippocampal neurons from Abeta toxicity by genipin. Geniposide had less effect in preventing Abeta toxicity.",
