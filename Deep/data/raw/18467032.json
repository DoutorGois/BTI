     "AB": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of IL1RAPL1 on the human cognitive ability. Four genetic marker sites, i.e., DXS1218, DXS9896, rs6526806 and rs12847959 on IL1RAPL1 were genotyped in 332 Qinba Mountain Area children. Meanwhile, a cognition test with a C-WISC scale was performed to study the relationship of genotype with cognition test scores. Results indicated that genotypes of DXS1218, DXS9896 and rs12847959 were associated with memory/concentration factor intelligence quotient (IQ) (P=0.027, 0.042, 0.029, respectively). DXS1218 also associated with full IQ, verbal IQ, and performance IQ (P=0.006, 0.014, 0.006, respectively). rs12847959 were related to verbal comprehension factor and perceptual organization factor IQ (P=0.021, 0.043, respectively). Further study on rat brain revealed that Il1rapl was mainly expressed in memory/concentration-associated encephalic regions, such as hippocampus, dentate fascia, osmesis perithelium, and piriform cortex. mRNA expression levels of Il1rapl in brains of rats with different learning and memory abilities showed significant difference. Combined data suggested that IL1RAPL1 affected human cognitive ability to some extent, especially the memory and concentration capability.",
