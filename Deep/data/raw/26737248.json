     "AB": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder assumed to involve different areas of CNS and PNS. Thus, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is used to examine the areas engaged in PD neurodegeneration. In the present study, we computed average tract length and fiber volume as a measure of white matter integrity and adopted Network Based Statistics (NBS) to conduct group analyses between age- and gender-matched PD patients and healthy control connectivity matrices. NBS is a powerful statistical tool that utilizes the presence of every link in connectivity matrices and controls family wise error rates (in weak sense). The major regions with significantly reduced interconnecting fiber volume or average tract length were cingulum, temporal lobe, frontal lobe, parahippocampus, hippocampus, olfactory lobe, and occipital lobe.",
