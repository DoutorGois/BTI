     "AB": "Adult rats were subjected to a moderate lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI), followed by survival periods of 2 and 12 h. Regional NMDA subtype glutamate, muscarinic acetylcholine and GABA(A) receptor binding in various brain regions was analysed by quantitative in vitro autoradiography and short-lived positron emission tomography tracers [11C]cyano-dizocilpine, 4-N-[11C]methylpiperidylbenzilate (4-N-[11C]MPB), and [11C]flumazenil, respectively. The binding potential (BP, Bmax/KD) was calculated. The data with [11C]cyano-dizocilpine showed a significant decrease in BP bilaterally for the frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus at both time points, in comparison with that of the sham-operated controls. At 12 h the decrease was significantly more prominent for the ipsilateral cortex and hippocampus than for the contralateral side. The BP of 4-N-[11C]MPB was significantly decreased after 2 h for the trauma-side hippocampus, and after 12 h it had decreased for the trauma-site cortex and the bilateral hippocampus. The [11C]flumazenil exhibited a significant decrease in BP for the trauma-site cortex and the underlying hippocampus by 2 h after the traumatic brain injury. After 12 h a significantly decreased BP was observed only for the trauma-site cortex. The finding of a decreased BP demonstrates the involvement of these receptor systems in the development of cellular dysfunction, which is widespread and not limited to the site of lateral FPI.",
