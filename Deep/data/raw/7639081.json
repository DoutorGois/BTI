     "AB": "In the present experiments, an impairment of memory model was made by cerebral ischemia-reperefusion in mice. Sal A at the dosage of 3 and 10 mg.kg-1 i.v. was shown to improve the impairment of memory function induced by cerebral ischemia-reperefusion in step down and step through tests. In these tests, the number of errors of Sal A treated group was less and the latency was longer than that of control group. Meanwhile, Sal A 3 and 10 mg.kg-1 i.v. was found to reduce the MDA contents in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum of cerebral ischemia-reperfused rats in vivo. Sal A 10-100 nmol.L-1 was shown to inhibit the brain lipid-peroxidation and scavenge the free hydroxyl radical in vitro. These results indicate that the antagonistic effects of Sal A on impairment of learning and memory caused by cerebral ischemia-reperefusion may be related with its anti-oxidant activity.",
