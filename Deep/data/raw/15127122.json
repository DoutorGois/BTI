     "AB": "To evaluate the effects of different antagonists on the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol and the expression of Bcl-2 in mitochondria in rat hippocampus after ischemia, we examined Bcl-2 and cytochrome c expression by immunoblotting using 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) as brain ischemia model. The results showed that after 24 h ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) cytochrome c decreased markedly in mitochondria, which was correspondingly increased in the cytosolic fraction. Bcl-2 expression was time-dependent, reaching its peak level after 6 h I/R. In all those samples, there were no alterations in the subcellular distribution of cytochrome oxidase, a mitochondrial respiratory chain protein. The decreases in Bcl-2 and cytochrome c in mitochondria were restored by pretreatment with non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine or L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (L-VGCC) antagonist nifedipine at 20 min prior to ischemia. The results demonstrate that the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol and the up-regulation of Bcl-2 are possibly mediated by NMDA receptors or L-VGCC following brain ischemia. Cytochrome c release may be injurious while Bcl-2 up-regulation may be protective to ischemic hippocampus.",
