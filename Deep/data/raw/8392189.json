     "AB": "Patients with severe temporal lobe epilepsy lose neurons within the CA3 and hilar regions of the hippocampus. Loss of CA3 and hilar neurons was also induced by transducing organotypic hippocampal slice cultures with a replication-defective herpes simplex virus (HSV) vector expressing the GluR6 kainate subtype of the glutamate receptor (HSVGluR6). In transduced fibroblasts, HSVGluR6 expressed a M(r) 115,000 protein that reacted with anti-GluR6 serum. After exposure of fibroblast to HSVGluR6, a kainate-dependent toxicity appeared in cells that were previously resistant to kainate. Microapplication of nanoliter amounts of recombinant HSV stocks into organotypic hippocampal slice cultures resulted in localized transduction and gene transfer at the site of microapplication. Microapplication of 100 HSVGluR6 virions into CA3 stratum pyramidale induced a large loss of CA3 pyramidal cells and hilar neurons, despite the small number of transduced neurons. This effect was not seen when 100 virions of HSVGluR6 were microapplied to CA1 stratum pyramidale. Tetrodotoxin or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists inhibited the large loss of CA3 and hilar neurons, suggesting that the small cluster of HSVGluR6-transduced cells induced an N-methyl-D-aspartate-dependent transsynaptic loss of non-transduced neurons.",
