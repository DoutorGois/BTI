     "AB": "beta-Amyloid peptide (Abeta) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease, but in lower amounts it is found in normal brains where it participates in physiological processes and probably regulates synaptic plasticity. This study investigated the effects of physiologically relevant concentrations of Abeta (1 pM-100 nM), fragment 25-35, on glycine-mediated membrane current in acutely isolated rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp technique. We have found that short (600 ms) co-application of glycine with Abeta caused reversible dose-dependent and voltage-independent acceleration of desensitization of glycine current. The peak amplitude of the current remained unchanged. The effect of picomolar Abeta concentrations persisted in the presence of 1 microM Abeta in the pipette solution, implying that Abeta bounds to extracellular site(s). Concentration-dependence curve was N-shaped with maximums at 100 pM and 100 nM, suggesting the existence of two binding sites, which may interact with each other. Glycine current resistant to 100 microM picrotoxin, was insensitive to Abeta, which suggests that Abeta affected mainly homomeric glycine receptors. When Abeta was added to bath solution, besides acceleration of desensitization, it caused reversible dose-dependent reduction of glycine current peak amplitude. These results demonstrate that physiological (picomolar) concentrations of Abeta reversibly augment the desensitization of glycine current, probably by binding to external sites on homomeric glycine receptors. Furthermore, Abeta can suppress the peak amplitude of glycine current, but this effect develops slowly and may be mediated through some intracellular machinery.",
