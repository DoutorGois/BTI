     "AB": "We previously described a modification of the whole genome PCR method which allowed us to characterize several genes whose expression is regulated by thyroid hormone in the mouse liver. Following this procedure, we now report the identification of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3) gene as target of thyroid hormone. ND3 gene expression is regulated by thyroid hormone in rat brain and heart. Sequencing and electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed the presence of a thyroid hormone receptor (TR)/c-erbA specific binding site in the mitochondrial ND3 gene. Hypothyroidism decreases ND3 mRNA levels in several brain areas such as cortex and hippocampus during the early postnatal development. In line with the recent findings showing the presence of TR/c-erbA alpha and beta proteins inside the mitochondria, our results suggest the possibility of direct transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial genes by thyroid hormone.",
