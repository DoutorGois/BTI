     "AB": "Postsynaptic density and synaptic membrane fractions isolated from hippocampal tissue have been compared to those previously isolated from cerebellum and cerebral cortex. In all respects examined, the isolated hippocampal preparations are similar to the cerebral cortex fractions. The morphology of the postsynaptic density (PSD) preparation is the same and the protein composition is similar, but with higher concentrations of the 51-kDa major protein and of calmodulin, and lower concentrations of actin, in the hippocampal PSD fraction. The binding characteristics for glutamate and GABA are also similar between the two fractions, but with higher Bmax and KD glutamate values and lower Bmax and higher KD GABA values for the hippocampal PSD preparation. Both preparations contain GABAA and GABAB receptors. The PSD fraction contains, as does the cerebral cortex fraction, a calmodulin-dependent binding of the Ca2+ channel antagonist, nitrendipine, as well as a cAMP-dependent and a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, with the same respective substrates. The value of the hippocampal fractions for studies on long-term potentiation and on kindling in the hippocampus is discussed.",
