It has been shown repeatedly that expression of transcription factors correlates with different forms of cell activation, probably being functionally involved in the coupling of extracellular signals with long-term cellular responses. This study describes that c-fos and zif/268 mRNA accumulation, as measured by northern blot analysis, occurs in the rat hippocampus as well as the visual cortex following behavioral training of two-way active avoidance response.",
