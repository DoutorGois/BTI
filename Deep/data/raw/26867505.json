     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) shows memory-like consolidation and thus becomes increasingly resistant to disruption by low-frequency stimulation (LFS). However, it is known that nicotine application during LFS uniquely depotentiates consolidated LTP. Here, we investigated how nicotine contributes to the disruption of stabilized LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region. We found that nicotine-induced depotentiation is not due to masking LTP by inducing long-term depression and requires the activation of GluN2A-containing NMDARs. We further examined whether nicotine-induced depotentiation involves the reversal of LTP mechanisms. LTP causes phosphorylation of Ser-831 on GluA1 subunits of AMPARs that increases the single-channel conductance of AMPARs. This phosphorylation remained unchanged after depotentiation. LTP involves the insertion of new AMPARs into the synapse and the internalization of AMPARs is associated with dephosphorylation of Ser-845 on GluA1 and caspase-3 activity. Nicotine-induced depotentiation occurred without dephosphorylation of the Ser-845 and in the presence of a caspase-3 inhibitor. LTP is also accompanied by increased filamentous actin (F-actin), which controls spine size. Nicotine-induced depotentiation was prevented by jasplakinolide, which stabilizes F-actin, suggesting that nicotine depotentiates consolidated LTP by destabilizing F-actin. alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonists mimicked the effect of nicotine and selective removal of hippocampal cholinergic input caused depotentiation in the absence of nicotine, suggesting that nicotine depotentiates consolidated LTP by inducing alpha7 nAChR desensitization. Our results demonstrate a new role for nicotinic cholinergic systems in protecting potentiated synapses from depotentiation by preventing GluN2A-NMDAR-mediated signaling for actin destabilization.",
