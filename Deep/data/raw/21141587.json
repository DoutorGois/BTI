     "AB": "AIM: To investigate the mechanisms of Naoyikang (Traditional Chinese Medicine) on the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) model mice induced by D-galactose (D-gal) and NaNO2. METHODS: The mouse model was established by intraperitoneal injection of D-gal and NaNO2. The capacity of learning and memory was tested on mice with electrical maze; the content of nitric oxide (NO) and the activity of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), Na(+) -K(+) -ATP enzyme and Ca(2+) -ATP enzyme in cerebral cortex and hippocampus were assayed by biochemical methods; expression of Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA was detested by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Naoyikang could ameliorate the capacity of learning and memory of AD model mice and reduce MAO-B activity in the brain tissue and activate the activity of Na(+) -K(+) -ATP enzyme and Ca(2+) -ATP enzyme in the brain tissue and decrease the expression of Bax mRNA, but increase the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA in the model brain tissue. CONCLUSION: Naoyikang could protect AD model mice induced by D-gal and NaNO2. It could modify the metabolism of monoamine neurotransmitter in brain through reducing MAO-B activity and protect neurons by activating the activity of Na(+) -K(+) -ATP enzyme and Ca(2+) -ATP enzyme and decrease Bax expression and increase Bcl-2 expression in the model brain tissue.",
