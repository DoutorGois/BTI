     "AB": "Selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH) is now widely used in the surgical treatment of patients with medically intractable medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). We present our single-centre experience of a uniform series of drug-resistant MTLE patients treated exclusively with SelAH. A retrospective study of 50 adult patients (25 males, 25 females, mean age 34 years) suffering from medically intractable MTLE was conducted. All patients has been investigated under the same protocol and operated by SelAH performed by one surgeon. Immediate and long-term follow-up was also available and is presented. Forty-two patients (84%) became seizure free (Engel's I); eight of them (16%) were classified as Engel's II; four (8%) as Engel's III; and one as Engel's IV (2%). In 42 of them the final result has been achieved after a single operation, while in the rest eight after a second or third surgical procedure. The mean follow-up period was 6.2 years. Two permanent complications (4%) with no treatment-related mortality have been detected. SelAH performed in well selected cases, where concordance between electrophysiological and MR findings exists, can be a safe and effective surgical treatment method for medically intractable MTLE.",
