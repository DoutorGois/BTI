     "AB": "AIMS: The present study examined whether Abeta(1-42) can induce endogenous expression of interleukin-13 (IL-13) or (IL-4) within activated microglia in the rat hippocampus in vivo. We further investigated whether these cytokines mediate ROS/RNS generation through activation of NADPH oxidase and/or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and thus contribute to the degeneration of hippocampal neurons in vivo. RESULTS: Here, we show that IL-13 and IL-4, endogenously expressed in Abeta(1-42)-activated microglia in hippocampus in vivo, contribute to degeneration of hippocampal neurons in vivo. Neutralization of IL-13 and IL-4 protected hippocampal neurons in vivo against neurotoxicity by inhibiting activation of microglial NADPH oxidase and iNOS, resulting in attenuation of ROS generation and oxidative damage of protein, lipid and DNA. INNOVATION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the possible involvement of endogenously expressed IL-13 and/or IL-4 in activated microglia after Abeta(1-42) injection in the degeneration of hippocampal neurons in vivo. The current findings suggest that the deleterious effects of microglia-derived endogenous IL-13 and/or IL-4 are involved in oxidative stress-mediated neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. CONCLUSION: We carefully hypothesize that IL-13 and IL-4, well-known as anti-inflammatory cytokines might serve as neurotoxic mediators by enhancing microglia-derived oxidative stress in Abeta(1-42)-treated hippocampus in vivo.",
