     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the dynamic expression of GDNF and their receptors in the brain of rats after status epilepticus(SE). METHODS: The lithium-pilocarpine-induced rat SE model was used. The expression patterns of GNDF, GDNFR alpha and Ret were observed dynamically with immunohisto-chemical technique, and the extent of neuron damage was assessed by HE stain. RESULTS: (1) GDNF positive cells began to appear 2 hours after SE and reached the peak in 1 and 3 days, then decreased to the normal level; (2) GDNFR alpha positive cells in the cortex increased rapidly to the peak 2 hours after SE, and only few such cells were found in hippocampus; (3) Ret positive cells were found both in the cortex and hippocampus, with the maximum of expressions 6-8 hours after SE; (4) There were some connection between GDNF expression levels and extent of neurons damage. CONCLUSION: There exist time-dependent upregulations of GDNF, GDNFR alpha and Ret protein in the cortex and hippocampus of rats after SE. GDNF and their receptors involve in the response to neuron damage after SE, which might have the protective effect of neurons.",
