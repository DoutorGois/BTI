     "AB": "Monkeys with immunotoxic lesions of both the basal nucleus of Meynert and the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (NBM+VDB) lost cholinergic innervation throughout the cortex and hippocampus. They were impaired at learning discriminations between objects differing in either few, or many, attributes and at learning visuospatial conditional discriminations. Monkeys with immunotoxic lesions of the NBM lost cholinergic innervation of the neocortex only. Initially, they were unable to learn a simple visual discrimination where the stimuli differed in a limited number of attributes but they were unimpaired at learning discriminations between objects that differed in more attributes. They were mildly impaired at learning a visuospatial conditional task. The impairment exhibited by monkeys with lesions of the NBM alone ameliorated with time but that following NBM+VDB lesions did not. Previous experiments have shown that monkeys with immunotoxic lesions of the VDB alone are impaired at learning visuospatial conditional discriminations but are unimpaired at learning simple visual discriminations. When monkeys with NBM lesions were given excitotoxic lesions of the CA1 field of the hippocampus the learning impairment on discriminations between objects which differed in few attributes was reinstated. Pretreatment with a cholinergic agonist improved learning ability on visual discrimination learning in all monkeys but this improvement was significantly greater in monkeys with lesions of the NBM. On conditional discrimination learning, which is particularly sensitive to hippocampal damage, pilocarpine produced a significant improvement in monkeys with NBM+VDB lesions (where the hippocampal dysfunction was cholinergic) but not in monkeys with NBM+CA1 lesions (where the hippocampal damage was structural).",
