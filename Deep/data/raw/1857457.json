     "AB": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often reveals no pathology in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who are candidates for surgery, even though post-surgery histology reveals atrophy or sclerosis. To differentiate these pathologies in MRI, we performed a standardized acquisition and a quantitative analysis of MRI data (qMRI). The standard values of 43 healthy subjects (both sex, left and right handed) were compared with those of 10 patients with TLE and unilateral EEG focus. A reduced estimated total brain extension, a significant atrophy of both temporal lobes with accentuation on the focus side and a significant hippocampal atrophy on focus-side were seen even in patients with no visually detectable pathology. The analysis of the signal intensities did not give additional information. Thus, qMRI is a helpful additional tool in the course of presurgical evaluation for focus lateralization.",
