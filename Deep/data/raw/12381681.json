     "AB": "Fibril formation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) is considered to be responsible for the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Abeta fibril is formed by a protein misfolding process in which intermolecular beta-sheet interactions become stabilized abnormally. Thus, to develop potential anti-AD drugs, we screened an in-house library to find compounds which have a profile as a beta-sheet breaker. We searched for a beta-sheet breaker profile in an in-house library of approximately 113,000 compounds. From among the screening hits, we focused on N,N'-bis(3-hydroxyphenyl)pyridazine-3,6-diamine (named RS-0406), which had been newly synthesized in our laboratory. This compound (10-100 microg ml(-1)) was found to be capable of significantly inhibiting 25 microM Abeta(1-42) fibrillogenesis and, furthermore, disassembling preformed Abeta(1-42) fibrils in vitro. 3 We then investigated the effect of RS-0406 on 111 nM Abeta(1-42)-induced cytotoxicity in primary hippocampal neurons, and found that 0.3-3 microg ml(-1) RS-0406 ameliorates the cytotoxicity. Moreover, 3 microg ml(-1) RS-0406 reversed 1 micro M Abeta(1-42)-induced impairment of long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices. 4 In this study, we have succeeded in identifying RS-0406 which has potential to inhibit Abeta(1-42) fibrillogenesis, and to protect neurons against Abeta(1-42)-induced biological toxicity in vitro. These results suggest that RS-0406 or one of the derivatives could become a therapeutic agent for AD patients.",
