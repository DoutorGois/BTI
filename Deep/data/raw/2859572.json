     "AB": "Forced imbibition of increasing concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) in rats reduced daytime 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) induced feeding in a concentration dependent manner. Pituitary neurointermediate lobe (NIL) levels of immunoreactive (ir)-dynorphin-A 1-17 and 1-8 were also decreased by the NaCl regimen in a concentration dependent manner. However, there was no significant association between the reduction of NIL dynorphin levels and the suppression of 2-DG induced feeding on a within-animal basis. NaCl imbibition did not affect levels of either ir-dynorphin-A 1-17 or 1-8 in the hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, medulla/pons or anterior pituitary. Neither the acute changes following 2-DG administration, nor the comparison of ir-dynorphin-A 1-8/1-17 ratios appeared useful for the assessment of dynorphin-A turnover. Thus, the present results did not support the hypothesis that anorexia of NaCl treated animals results from the depletion of dynorphin-A.",
