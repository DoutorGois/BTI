     "AB": "In the telencephalon, the corticospinal (CS), callosal, and hippocampal commissural neurons are the major types of neurons that have axons crossing the midline of the brain. To understand the mechanisms involved in crossing the midline structure and to examine whether the expression patterns of L1 and TAG-1 in the commissural neurons are similar to those in the spinal cord, we investigated L1 and TAG-1 expression in these neurons in rats by using a double-labeling technique involving retrograde labeling and in situ hybridization. Expression of L1 messenger RNA was detected in the retrogradely labeled CS projection neurons by 1,1;-dioctadecyl-3,3, 3;,3;-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) injection into the pons at embryonic day (E) 19, but expression of TAG-1 messenger RNA was not detected in these neurons. Also, after their axons crossed the pyramidal decussation, continued expression of L1 but no expression of TAG-1 in the CS projection neurons was shown by an additional double-labeling experiment involving DiI injection into the spinal cord at postnatal day (P) 1. An immunohistochemical study showed that L1 was continuously present in each level of the CS tract at E21 and P3, but TAG-1 immunoreactivity was not found in any level at any stage. Finally, we examined the expression of L1 and TAG-1 messenger RNAs in the callosal and hippocampal commissure neurons after their axons had crossed the midline by using the double-labeling technique. In both cases, hybridization signals of the L1 and TAG-1 messenger RNAs were observed in the retrogradely labeled neurons at P3. These results suggest that the roles of L1 and TAG-1 in the formation of the commissures in the forebrain are different from their roles in the spinal cord.",
