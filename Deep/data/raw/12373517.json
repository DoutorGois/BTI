     "AB": "Historically, all commercially available kainic acid has been derived from a single biological source using a consistent method of extraction and purification. That source became unavailable in 1995. Recently, three new commercial suppliers of kainic acid have made the product available, but the source of the material and the purification processes used differ. Our objective was to systematically compare the response produced by each of these new sources of kainic acid using three established neurobiological techniques: neuronal cell culture, hippocampal slice electrophysiology, and whole animal behavioural toxicity. Results in all three systems indicated no overall differences between the three formulations, although studies in both cerebellar neuron cultures and whole animal toxicity testing in mice, revealed some significant differences that may imply subtle differences in receptor selectivity and/or potency. We conclude that all three sources of kainic acid are viable alternatives to traditional kainate but they may not be identical. Until further information becomes available researchers may want to avoid using the three formulations interchangeably, and take note of the source of kainic acid when evaluating literature describing results from other laboratories.",
