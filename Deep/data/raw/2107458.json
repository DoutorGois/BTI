     "AB": "The present study examined the effect of unilateral frontal- or temporal-lobe excisions on the acquisition of a conditional task requiring that the subjects respond to each one of six different coloured stimuli by selecting, from a set of six abstract designs, the correct design for each stimulus. Patients with excisions from the left or right frontal cortex were impaired in learning this task, whereas patients with left or right temporal-lobe excisions, with or without radical involvement of the hippocampal region, were not impaired. These findings demonstrate that the major role played by the frontal cortex in the acquisition of conditional responses is a general one and not restricted to situations involving different movements.",
