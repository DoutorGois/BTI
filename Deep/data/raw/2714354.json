     "AB": "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in intact, cultured explants of rat hippocampus were investigated in binding experiments with tritiated quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) as ligand. Dissociation constants (Kd) were determined to 320-575 pM and maximal binding capacity (Bmax) to 67-87 fmol/explant. The KdS obtained in kinetic experiments were very similar. Hippocampal explants cultured alone contained more muscarinic receptors than hippocampal explants reinnervated by cholinergic fibers from co-cultured septal explants. Pretreatment of hippocampal explants with carbachol resulted in a down-regulation of receptor number which was counteracted by the simultaneous addition of atropine. Atropine added alone had no effect on receptor number in hippocampal explants cultured alone whereas it occasionally caused an up-regulation in co-cultured hippocampus. Displacement experiments with scopolamine and oxotremorine as competitors, showed that hippocampal explants cultured alone contain multiple types of muscarinic receptors. With atropine, pirenzepine and AF-DX 116, only one class of receptors could be detected.",
