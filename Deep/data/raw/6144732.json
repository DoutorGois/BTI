     "PG": "62-70",
     "AB": "Changes in amino acid concentrations were studied in the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus of the rat brain, after 20 min of seizure activity induced by kainic acid, 47 mumol/kg i.v.; L-allylglycine, 2.4 mmol/kg i.v.; or bicuculline, 3.27 mumol/kg i.v. in paralysed, mechanically ventilated animals. Metabolic changes associated with kainic acid seizures predominate in the hippocampus, where there are decreases in aspartate (-26%), glutamate (-45%), taurine (-20%), and glutamine (-32%) concentrations and an increase in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration (+ 26%). L-Allylglycine seizures are associated with generalized decreases in GABA concentrations (-32 to -54%), increases in glutamine concentrations (+10 to +53%), and a decrease in cortical aspartate concentration (-14%). Bicuculline seizures, in fasted rats, are associated with marked increases in the levels of hippocampal GABA (+106%) and taurine (+40%). In the cerebellum, there are increases in glutamine (+50%) and taurine concentrations (+36%). These changes can be explained partially in terms of known biochemical and neurophysiological mechanisms, but uncertainties remain, particularly concerning the cerebellar changes and the effects of kainic acid on dicarboxylic amino acid metabolism.",
