     "AB": "The concentration of kynurenic acid (KYNA) in the cerebrospinal fluid, which is in the nanomolar range, is known to decrease in epilepsy. The experimental data suggest that treatment with L: -KYN dose dependently increases the concentration of the neuroprotective KYNA in the brain, which itself hardly crosses the blood-brain barrier. However, it is suggested that new synthetic KYNA analogs may readily cross the blood-brain barrier. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a new KYNA analog administered systemically in a sufficient dose results in a decreased population spike activity recorded from the pyramidal layer of area CA1 of the hippocampus, and also provides protection against pentylenetetrazole-induced epileptiform seizures.",
