     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the possible mechanism of antidepressant effect of Bajitian oligosaccharide (MW-97). METHODS AND RESULTS: After incubating with the PC12 cells in the presence of corticosterone(2 x 10(-4) mol.L-1) for 48 h, it was found that MW-97 could protect PC12 cells from the lesion done by corticosterone in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, using RT-PCR mediated cross-species partial cDNA cloning, it was found that MW-97 and desipramine(DIM) increased NGF, BDNF mRNA in the frontal cortex after chronic administration for 21 days, meanwhile, BDNF mRNA in hippocampus was also increased. CONCLUSION: The cytoprotective effect of MW-97 consists in the possible mechanism of its antidepressant action, while the increasing expression of neurotrophic factors (NGF, BDNF mRNA) may be contributes to the cytoprotective effect.",
