     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive dysfunction and injury remain problematic after cardiac procedures requiring hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA). Due to poor blood-brain barrier penetrance and toxicities associated with systemic drug therapies, clinical success has been elusive. Accordingly, we explored targeted dendrimer (a nanoparticle) drug therapies in our well-established canine model of HCA to characterize the biodistribution and cellular localization of these nanoparticles in areas of known neuronal apoptosis and necrosis. METHODS: Class A, 27- to 30-kg male hounds were administered an initial intravenous bolus (10% of the total dose [200 mg]) of generation-six polyamidoamine dendrimer (6.7 nm) labeled with cyanine 5, and cardiopulmonary bypass with peripheral cannulation was initiated. After 90 minutes of HCA, 70% of the total dose was infused over a 6-hour period. The final 20% of the total dose was given 24 hours post-HCA. The brain was harvested 48 hours later (72 hours post-HCA) and analyzed for dendrimer 6-cyanine 5 biodistribution. RESULTS: The dorsal hippocampus demonstrated the highest brain accumulation of dendrimer 6-cyanine 5, which closely corresponds to the distribution of apoptotic neurons evident with histologic staining and on confocal imaging. In injured brain regions, dendrimer traversed the blood-brain barrier and localized within the target cells (injured neurons and microglia). CONCLUSIONS: These findings have exciting implications for the future development of novel therapeutics to mitigate neurocognitive deficits in this group of patients.",
