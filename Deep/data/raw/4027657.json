     "AB": "The effects of halothane, isoflurane and enflurane on the rat hippocampal CA1 neurons in in vitro preparations were studied by intracellular recordings. All volatile anesthetics, at the concentrations which are likely to be in the range of clinical doses, depressed the IPSPs and the spontaneous firing without affecting the resting membrane properties and the EPSPs. The results suggest that the simultaneous blocking effects of the anesthetics on both the spontaneous firing and IPSPs are responsible for production of general anesthesia rather than their blocking actions on the EPSPs in terms of behavior of hippocampal neurons.",
