     "AB": "In the present study, the role of medial septal receptors in behaviour-induced increase in acetylcholine (ACh) release in hippocampus was investigated using dual-probe microdialysis in combination with a simple behavioural procedure. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists were administered by retrograde dialysis into the medial septal area, while ACh was measured in the ventral hippocampus. Rats were behaviourally activated by immobilization or handling, but only handling was performed during drug-treatment. The GABAA receptor agonist muscimol did not affect ACh release, but blocked the handling-induced increase in ACh release completely. In addition, muscimol administration induced behavioural activity. Administration of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline increased ACh release more than 2-fold. However, handling-induced increase in ACh release, expressed as percentage of drug-induced release, was similar to that of controls. Administration of the glutamate receptor agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) in the septal area increased hippocampal ACh levels, but reduced the handling-induced increase in ACh release. The NMDA antagonist, 3-((R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl) (CPP) increased ACh levels moderately, and reduced handling-induced increase in ACh release. However, similarly to muscimol, CPP administration induced behavioural activity. The AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX) did not affect behaviour or basal ACh levels, but attenuated the handling-evoked ACh release. We conclude that the handling-induced increase in hippocampal ACh levels is mediated via stimulation of septal non-NMDA, and possibly NMDA receptors, whereas GABAA receptors are probably not involved. The feasibility of the experimental design is further discussed.",
