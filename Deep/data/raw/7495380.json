     "AB": "Levels of glutathione and activity of glutamine synthetase were assayed in organs of rats following inhalation of a heterogeneous solvent mixture containing both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. This mixture was administered for 3 weeks (6 h daily) at two levels in the inhaled air (400 and 800 ppm) to young adult (5-month-old) and aged (14-month-old) rats. Depression of levels of glutamine synthetase in the P2 fraction of kidney was observed, which was more severe in aged than young adult rats. Glutamine synthetase is a cytosolic enzyme especially susceptible to oxidative damage. A parallel depression of this enzyme was also seen in the corresponding hepatic fractions. However, levels of glutamine synthetase in the hippocampus were elevated by this exposure. Glutathione levels were depressed in P2 fractions of livers of exposed rats, and also in the corresponding renal fraction. Glutathione concentration was unchanged in cerebral fractions. Overall results were interpreted to imply that pro-oxidant events were elevated in kidney and liver following prolonged inhalation of the solvent mixture. The changes found in brain tissue did not reveal evidence of oxidative stress but, however, suggested that glial activation was taking place.",
