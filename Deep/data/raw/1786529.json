     "AB": "Synaptic membranes of rat brain contained specific binding sites of [3H]spermidine (SPD) that exhibited an inverse temperature dependency, structure selectivity, reversibility, saturability, low affinity and high density with an uneven distribution profile. The affinities were not significantly different from each other in the rodent brain, while the highest density was found in the medulla-pons among the central structures examined with progressively lower densities in the midbrain, striatum, cerebellum, hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The binding was insensitive to digestion by various proteases and glycosidases but sensitive to potentiation by phospholipases. A clear correlation was seen between the abilities of several natural and synthetic polyamines to displace [3H]SPD binding and to potentiate [3H] (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine binding to open cation channels associated with an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-sensitive subclass of brain excitatory amino acid receptors. Treatment of brain membranes with deoxycholic acid resulted in a significant solubilization of [3H]SPD binding sites. Furthermore, [3H]SPD markedly associated with the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylserine irrespective of the presence of synaptic membranes in a manner sensitive to inhibition by a variety of calmodulin antagonists. These results suggest that endogenous polyamines may play a stimulatory role in neuronal responses mediated by the NMDA receptor ionophore complex through an interaction between their positive charges and negative charges of membranous phosphatidylserine in rat brain.",
