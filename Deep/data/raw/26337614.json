     "AB": "RATIONALE: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and signaling at its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), are implicated in the rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effects of ketamine. Moreover, a TrkB agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), and/or TrkB antagonist, ANA-12, shows antidepressant effects in animal models of depression. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to compare the influence of ketamine, 7,8-DHF, and ANA-12 on antidepressant activity in the social defeat stress model. RESULTS: In the tail suspension and forced swimming tests, ketamine, 7,8-DHF, or ANA-12 markedly attenuated the increased immobility time in depressed mice compared with the vehicle-treated group. In the sucrose preference test, all drugs significantly improved the reduced preference in depressed mice at both 1 and 3 days after a single dose. Antidepressant effect of ketamine, but not 7,8-DHF or ANA-12, was still detectable 7 days after a single dose. Western blot analyses showed that ketamine, but not 7,8-DHF or ANA-12, markedly attenuated reduced levels of BDNF and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), dentate gyrus (DG), and CA3 of the hippocampus in depressed mice 8 days after a single dose. Furthermore, ketamine markedly increased reduced levels of GluA1 in the PFC and DG of depressed mice. In contrast, ketamine showed no effect against increased levels of BDNF, PSD-95, and GluA1 observed in the nucleus accumbens of depressed mice. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with 7,8-DHF and ANA-12, ketamine is a longer-lasting antidepressant in the social defeat stress model, and synaptogenesis may be required for the mechanisms that promote sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine.",
