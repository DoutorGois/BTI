     "AB": "A comprehensive mapping of ascorbate distribution in human brain was carried out by liquid chromatography analysis. The data agree with earlier literature values where comparable and provide new information on several brain regions, including a detailed distribution in the thalamus. While ascorbate concentrations tend to be high in regions rich in catecholamines, there is no real correlation between the two.",
