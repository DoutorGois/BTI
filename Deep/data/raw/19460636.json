     "AB": "In the present study we show that overexpression of constitutively active Ras amplifies the dendritic remodeling observed when animals were allowed to be physically active. The monomeric G-protein Ras is a key molecular trigger of distinct signal transduction pathways that play an important role in proper functioning of neurons. Our previous studies on Ras-transgenic synRas mice have demonstrated a considerable impact of Ras on dendritic growth, extension and synaptic connectivity of neurons. Voluntary access to a running wheel resulted in enlargement of hippocampal pyramidal cell dendrites in wild-type mice as expected. However, constitutively elevated Ras activity further enhanced dendritic growth and branching especially of apical arbors. The resultant dendritic surface gain was paralleled by a significant increase in dendritic spine density. Since Ras is crucially involved in signaling and cascades of neurotrophins that are elevated after physical activity, these results strongly suggest an important role of Ras in dendritic dynamics during induced neuronal remodeling.",
