     "AB": "Little is known about signaling mechanisms underlying temporal associative learning. Here, we show that mice with a targeted point mutation that prevents autophosphorylation of alphaCaMKII (alphaCaMKII(T286A)) learn trace eyeblink conditioning normally. This forms a sharp contrast to the severely impaired spatial learning in the water maze and contextual fear conditioning observed in alphaCaMKII(T286A) mutants. Importantly, hippocampal lesions impaired trace eyeblink conditioning in alphaCaMKII(T286A) mice, suggesting a potential role of hippocampal alphaCaMKII-independent mechanisms. These results indicate that hippocampal signaling mechanisms that underlie temporal associative learning as assessed by trace eyeblink conditioning may differ from those of spatial and contextual learning.",
