     "AB": "This study shows for the first time that normal brain tissue toxicities after WBI can be reduced with increased dose rate. Spatial memory is preserved after WBI with mean dose rates above 100Gy/s, whereas 10Gy WBI at a conventional radiotherapy dose rate (0.1Gy/s) totally impairs spatial memory.",
