     "AB": "Increased oxidative stress has been implicated in the mechanisms of delayed neuronal cell death (DND) following cerebral ischemic insult. In this study, we investigated whether resveratrol, a polyphenolic antioxidant enriched in grape, may ameliorate ischemia-induced neuron cell death. Mongolian gerbils were divided into three groups, namely, sham control, ischemia and ischemia treated with resveratrol. Transient global cerebral ischemia was induced by occlusion of both common carotid arteries (CCA) for 5 min. Resveratrol was injected i.p. (30 mg/kg body weight), either during or shortly after CCA occlusion, and again at 24 h after ischemia. Cerebral blood flow was monitored before and during CCA occlusion using a laser Doppler flowmeter. Brain sections were immuno-stained for neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells. A time course study was also carried out to assess the bioavailability of resveratrol in serum, liver and brain using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Morphometric measurements indicated extensive DND in the hippocampal CA1 region 4 days after ischemia and that neuron cell death was marked by the increase in reactive astrocytes and microglial cells. Administration of resveratrol, either during or after CCA occlusion, significantly (P<0.05) decreased DND as well as glial cell activation. Analysis of resveratrol after i.p. injection indicated its presence in serum, liver and brain with peak activity at 1, 4 and 4 h, respectively. This study demonstrated for the first time that resveratrol, a polyphenolic antioxidant, can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert protective effects against cerebral ischemic injury.",
