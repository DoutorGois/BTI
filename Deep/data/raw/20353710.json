Neurocognitive function is often involved impairing quality of life. This dysfunction is among the most frequent complications of brain irradiation. Sparing as much as feasible hippocampus and/or other critical structures like the motor unit might reduce neurocognitive dysfunction, motor disturbance and other complications occurring after whole brain radiotherapy or radiosurgery.",
