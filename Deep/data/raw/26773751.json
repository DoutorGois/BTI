     "AB": "Noise exposure can cause structural and functional problem in the auditory cortex (AC) and hippocampus, the two brain regions in the auditory and non-auditory systems respectively. The aim of the present study was to explore which one of these two brain regions may be more susceptible to environmental noise. The AC and hippocampus of mice were separated following 1 or 3 weeks exposure to moderate noise (80 dB SPL, 2 h/day). The levels of oxidative stress and tau phosphorylation were then measured to evaluate the effects by noise. Results showed significant peroxidation and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus with 1 week of noise exposure. However, the AC did not show significant changes until exposure for 3 weeks. These data suggest that although the hippocampus and AC were affected by moderate noise exposure, the hippocampus in the non-auditory system may have been more vulnerable to environmental noise than the AC.",
