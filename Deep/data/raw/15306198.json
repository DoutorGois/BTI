     "AB": "Ionotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors form a large family of molecular isoforms with distinct properties. We have characterized a distinct new type of GABA receptors in CA1 pyramidal cells in rat hippocampal slices. Somatic application of GABA induced currents which were partially suppressed by (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA), a specific antagonist of GABA(C) receptors. This sensitivity was enhanced when we evoked the currents by the GABA(C) receptor agonist cis-4-aminocrotonic acid (CACA). However, both GABA- and CACA-evoked currents were sensitive towards bicuculline and thus lack the defining feature of GABA(C) receptors, which are insensitive towards this antagonist. Spontaneous miniature post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs) revealed a similar pharmacological behaviour. We conclude that juvenile CA1 pyramidal cells express a fraction of ionotropic GABA receptors with mixed pharmacological properties of both, GABA(A) and GABA(C) receptors.",
