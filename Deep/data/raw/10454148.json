     "AB": "In light of controversial reports concerning the effects of chondroitin sulfates on neurite outgrowth, several glycosaminoglycans belonging to this structural class were compared with regard to their influence on axon formation by embryonic day 18 hippocampal neurons. In these studies, chondroitin sulfate A (CS-A), CS-B and CS-C proved weak or inefficient in the neurite outgrowth promotion assay. As expected, CS-D stimulated both the fraction of neurite bearing neurons and the length of their processes. This effect could be neutralized by the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 473HD. In contrast, CS-E enacted a dramatic promotion of neurite outgrowth. This effect persisted in the presence of mAb 473HD, consistent with the observation that this antibody did not react with CS-E in glycosaminoglycan transfer and blotting techniques. We conclude that CSE contains a novel glycosaminoglycan based neurite outgrowth promoting motif, which is distinct from other known activities.",
