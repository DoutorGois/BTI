     "AB": "Netrins are secreted proteins that serve as potent axon guidance molecules in vertebrates and invertebrates. We report the identification of a novel mammalian member of this family. Netrin-4 is similar in predicted size and secondary structure to the other three netrins; all contain, in order, an amino-terminal signal sequence, a laminin-type globular domain of the 'VI' type, three laminin-type epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal 'netrin module'. In terms of primary sequence, however, netrin-4 is a distant relative of netrins-1-3, and its globular domain is more closely related to those of laminins than to those of other netrins. Netrin-4 is broadly expressed in both neural and non-neural tissues of embryonic and adult mice. In embryonic spinal cord, it is selectively expressed by cells at the lateral margins of the floor plate. In postnatal brain, it is selectively expressed in subsets of neurons, including cerebellar granule and hippocampal pyramidal cells.",
