     "AB": "The optical isomers of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were administered to rats to examine their relative potency for destruction of serotonin neurons. Rats were sacrificed one week following a single 10 mg/kg SC injection of one of the four compounds and monoamine and metabolite levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus brain regions were examined by HPLC-EC techniques. In addition, [3H]-paroxetine binding to homogenates of these brain regions was determined. With the exception of hippocampal 5-HT levels following d-fenfluramine treatment, there was a decrease in all the serotonergic markers assayed, following treatment with the d-enantiomers of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine. No decrease in any serotonergic marker was seen at this dose following treatment with the l-enantiomers of fenfluramine or norfenfluramine. Also, none of the drug treatments resulted in a significant decrease in catecholamines or their metabolites. With all the serotonergic markers examined, d-norfenfluramine was found to cause a significantly greater decrease than d-fenfluramine. The significance of these results is discussed in terms of the hypothesis that the long-term serotonergic deficits observed with d-fenfluramine may result from its metabolite, d-norfenfluramine.",
