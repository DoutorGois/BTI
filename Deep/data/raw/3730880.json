     "AB": "Averaged evoked potentials and unitary discharges in response to tooth pulp and acoustic click stimuli were recorded from the hippocampus of freely moving rats. The spatial distribution of evoked field responses to tooth pulp stimulation and acoustic clicks were identical. Averaged evoked potentials consisted of a large negative deflection (N1) preceded by a small positive potential (P1). The shortest latency N1 in response to tooth pulp stimulation was recorded from the middle third of the dentate molecular layer and the outer portion of apical dendrites of CA3 (27 ms). The peak latency of N1 was significantly longer (34 ms) in the stratum radiatum of CA1. Laminar profiles of N1 in the dentate gyrus and CA3 were similar to that evoked by electrical stimulation of the medial entorhinal afferents; in CA1 the depth profiles of the potentials were similar to the response profile evoked by the Schaffer collaterals. Largest amplitude P1 was obtained from above the pyramidal layer of CA1 and the hilus. Both sensory modalities were able to modify the discharge rate of neurons in all hippocampal regions. The amplitude of evoked field potentials and cellular responses were dependent upon both the ongoing behavior of the animal and the nature of its response to the stimulus. The largest amplitude evoked potentials were recorded during immobility and slow wave sleep. On the other hand, virtually no potentials were obtained during exploratory behaviors associated with theta EEG activity. The findings indicate that information about sensory stimuli can reach the hippocampus by two distinctive pathways: a short latency inhibitory input via the fimbria-fornix and a longer latency path via the entorhinal cortex. It is suggested that neuronal mechanisms involved in theta EEG block the sequential activation of the unidirectional entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry.",
