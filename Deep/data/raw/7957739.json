     "AB": "The dicarbamate felbamate has been shown to be capable of competing for the binding of 5,7-[3H]dichlorokynurenic acid ([3H]DCKA) to strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors in sections of human postmortem brain. The IC50 for this interaction was 305.8 microM and the inhibition was complete at 1 mM. Autoradiographic localization of [3H]DCKA binding revealed many regions of human brain in which strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors are manifest. The specific binding in most of these areas was markedly reduced in the presence of 625 microM felbamate. In many regions, [3H]DCKA binding was reduced to background in the presence of felbamate, but some areas retained binding by as much as 41% (i.e., the CA2 region of the hippocampus). This is in contrast to the binding of [3H]DCKA in the presence of carbamazepine, phenytoin, or valproic acid. The binding of the glycine receptor antagonist was not affected by any of these latter agents to the same degree as felbamate. Strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors represent a site of action of felbamate in the human brain.",
