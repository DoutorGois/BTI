     "AB": "Woohwangcheongsimwon (WHC) is a mixture of herbal medicines that is widely prescribed in Korean traditional medicine. SIRT1 is known for its regulatory roles in energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and circadian rhythms. This study was designed to determine whether WHC can increase and mimic the biological reactions of SIRT1 activation. Ten-month-old male mice were divided into four groups: nontreated normal diet (ND), nontreated high-fat diet (HFD), WHC-treated ND, and WHC-treated HFD. Body weight and cognitive functions were evaluated after treatment. The hippocampal expressions of SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha were also measured. The components of WHC were identified by liquid chromatography. High-fat diet-fed mice gained more weight and demonstrated greater deficits in short-term and long-term cognitive functions. WHC suppressed the deleterious effects of a HFD on weight gain and cognitive decline, but showed no prominent effects on animals fed NDs. The herbal treatment also increased the expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha in the hippocampus. Despite the induction of hippocampal SIRT1 expression by WHC, resveratrol was not present among the natural compounds identified. This expression might have contributed to the suppression of high-fat diet-induced memory deficits in mice treated with the herbal mixture.",
