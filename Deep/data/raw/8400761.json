     "AB": "The use of inductively coupled plasma source mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for multi-element analysis has led to the observation, in two separate studies, of increased blood tin in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have therefore applied the technique of ICP-MS to hippocampal tissues obtained post-mortem from patients with AD and from controls. There was no significant difference in tin concentrations in AD. There were increased concentrations of aluminum and silicon, and reduced concentrations of zinc and selenium. It is postulated that displacement of hippocampal zinc by heavy metals may be important in producing clinical memory disturbance. However, analysis of the CA1 region, rather than of the dentate gyrus, would have been preferable.",
