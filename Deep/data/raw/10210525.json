     "AB": "In two species of birds, food-storing marsh tits, P. palustris, and non-storing blue tits, P. caeruleus, quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to localize NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-sensitive [3H]glutamate, [3H]MK801, and [3H]AMPA binding sites, in six regions of the forebrain: hippocampus and parahippocampus, hyperstriatum accessorium (vision) and ventrale (sensory integration), neostriatum (auditory), and lobus parolfactorius (basal ganglia). In both species high levels of labelling to both NMDA and AMPA receptors were observed throughout the forebrain. However, a marked difference in receptor labelling was apparent between the two species, with levels of binding to NMDA ion channel sites being significantly lower (20%) in both the hippocampus and parahippocampus, in food storers compared to non-food storers. The levels of binding to other forebrain regions were remarkably similar in the two species. No differences were seen in the binding to AMPA receptors in forebrain regions of either species.",
