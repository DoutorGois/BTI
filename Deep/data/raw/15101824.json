     "AB": "PURPOSE: We investigated the effects of valproate (VPA) on excitatory synaptic transmission changes induced by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to determine whether the antiepileptic effects shown by VPA can be ascribed to a modulation of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in the CA3-CA1 synapse. METHODS: Rat hippocampal slices were prepared and maintained in vitro with standard methods. Whole-cell current and voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from CA1 pyramidal neurons by using the \"blind\" patch-clamp technique in an immersion recording chamber. Increase in the spontaneous excitatory synaptic activity was induced by addition of 4-AP to the medium. RESULTS: Perfusion with VPA significantly counteracted the increase of frequency and amplitude of the sEPSCs induced by application of 4-AP and suppressed the epileptiform activity. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that VPA decreases the 4-AP-induced enhancement of excitatory synaptic activity at the CA3-CA1 synapse, and that this reduction of excitation input to CA1 contributes to the anticonvulsant effects of VPA.",
