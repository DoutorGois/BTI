     "AB": "The response of an endogenous inhibitor of protein kinases (type II inhibitor) to clonidine was used as an index of sensitivity of central alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Low doses of clonidine (20-50 micrograms/kg) induced an increase in type II inhibitor activity in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and in the anterior and posterior hypothalamus by stimulating presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Stimulation of postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors by high doses of clonidine 0.5-1.0 mg/kg resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in type II inhibitor activity. Prolonged treatment with ethanol (5 g/kg/day po for 21 days) greatly reduced the action of high doses of clonidine in all the examined brain areas, suggesting subsensitivity of postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors lasting for at least 48 h after the last ethanol administration. A single dose of ethanol induced a short lasting subsensitivity of postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the anterior hypothalamus. 12 h after administration of alcohol the response of type II inhibitor to high doses of clonidine in this brain area was the same as in untreated rats.",
