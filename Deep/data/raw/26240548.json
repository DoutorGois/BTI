     "AB": "AIM: We aimed to determine the neurotoxic effect of repeated ketamine administration on brain tissue and if neurotoxic effect was present, whether this effect continued 16 days later using histological stereological method, a quantitative and objective method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female rats were divided into three groups, each containing five rats. Rats in Group I were given 0.9% saline solution 4 times a day for 5 days. The rats in Groups II and III were given ketamine as intraperitoneal injections. Rats in Groups I and II were sacrificed on 5(th) day while the ones in Group III on 21(st) day. Cornu ammonis (CA) and gyrus dentatus (GD) regions in hippocampus tissue of rats were studied using optic fractionation method. FINDINGS: There were significantly less number of cells in hippocampal CA and GD regions of rats from Groups II and III compared to the ones from Group I. Difference in cell number was also significantly higher in Group III than in Group II, but this difference was not as pronounced as the one between Groups III and I. CONCLUSION: Repeated ketamine doses caused neurotoxicity in rat hippocampus.",
