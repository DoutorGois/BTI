     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to investigate different forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by different compounds. As shown in results, the influx of calcium via voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) was responsible for ( - )-clausenamide-induced LTP in hippocampus, while Rg1 induced LTP is mediated by the entry of calcium via N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate (NMDA) receptor. The findings in the present study provide pharmacological basis for the nootropic mechanisms of these two compounds.",
