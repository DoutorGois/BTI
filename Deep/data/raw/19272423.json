     "AB": "Pregnenolone sulfate (PS), an endogenously occurring neurosteroid, has been shown to modulate the activity of several neurotransmitter-gated channels, including the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). NMDARs are glutamate-gated ion channels involved in excitatory synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and excitotoxicity. To determine the mechanism that controls PS sensitivity of NMDARs, we measured NMDAR responses induced by exogenous agonist application in voltage-clamped HEK293 cells expressing NR1/NR2B NMDARs and cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We report that PS potentiates the amplitude of whole-cell recorded NMDAR responses in cultured hippocampal neurons and HEK293 cells; however, the potentiating effect of PS on NMDAR in outside-out patches isolated from cultured hippocampal neurons and HEK293 cells was lost within 2 min after patch isolation in a neurosteroid-specific manner. The rate of diminution of the PS potentiating effect was slowed by protein phosphatase inhibitors. Treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with a nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor and a specific protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor diminished PS-induced potentiation, which was recovered by adding a PKA, but not a protein kinase C (PKC), activator. These results suggest that the effect of PS on NMDARs is controlled by cellular mechanisms that are mediated by dephosphorylation/phosphorylation pathways.",
