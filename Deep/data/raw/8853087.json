     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The development of tolerance to the sympatholytic and anesthetic-reducing effects of alpha(2) agonists after prolonged administration of dexmedetomidine and how the number of available alpha(2) adrenoceptors affects these dexmedetomidine-induced responses was studied. METHODS: The sympatholytic action of acute and chronic (3 and 10 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 for 7 days) dexmedetomidine, was assessed by the decrease in norepinephrine turnover in the locus coeruleus and hippocampus. The anesthetic-reducing effect of chronic (7 days) dexmedetomidine (5 and 10 micrograms.kg-1.h-1) was studied by determining the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for halothane that prevented rats from responding to a supramaximal noxious stimulus of dexmedetomidine (10 or 30 micrograms.kg-1), doses in the steep part of the dose-response curve. The receptor reserve for the norepinephrine turnover and anesthetic-sparing responses to dexmedetomidine was delineated with 0.3-1.0 mg.kg-1 N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline, an irreversible alkylating agent. RESULTS: After chronic administration of dexmedetomidine at both doses, acute dexmedetomidine significantly decreased norepinephrine turnover in the hippocampus and locus coeruleus. The baseline minimum anesthetic concentration (MAC) and the MAC-sparing effect to acutely administered dexmedetomidine were preserved after chronic dexmedetomidine treatment. In the N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline experiments, the dexmedetomidine-induced norepinephrine turnover effect required less than 20% and greater than 4% alpha(2) adrenoceptor availability in the locus coeruleus and the dexmedetomidine induced MAC-sparing effect required less than 40% and greater than 20% alpha(2) adrenoceptor availability in the locus coeruleus. CONCLUSION: Tolerance does not develop for either the sympatholytic or MAC-sparing actions of dexmedetomidine, although it is present for the hypnotic response. The durable quality of the sympatholytic and MAC-sparing responses to dexmedetomidine after chronic treatment is explained by a comparatively larger receptor reserve than is needed for the hypnotic and analgesic responses, which are blunted by the same drug treatment regimen.",
