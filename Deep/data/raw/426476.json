     "PG": "127-38",
     "AB": "Unilateral (50 to 118 minutes) and bilateral (2 to 33 minutes) carotid artery occlusion in gerbils resulted in two distinct types of neuronal alteration: ischemic cell change (ICC) in selectively vulnerable brain regions, and selective chromatolysis (SC) confined to the deeper layers of the cortex, the Sommer sector of zone h-1, and the paramedian region (PM) of the hippocampus. In typical SC the nucleus was eccentric and the Nissl substance was lost in the central eosinophilic cytoplasm. In electron micrographs this area of cytoplasm showed disruption of smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum with disaggregation of polyribosomes and accumulation of mitochrondria and various dense bodies. SC was identified at 2 to 3 hours and was still recognizable at five days. When bilateral carotid artery occlusion lasted 5 to 6 minutes, SC was seen in the hippocampal Sommer sector and cerebral cortex, while ICC was restricted to the endfolium (h3-5). Unlike ICC, the frequency of SC was not related to the duration of ischemia but probably to the epileptic seizures (overt and subclinical) initiated by ischemia in the gerbil. These changes must be considered when the gerbil is employed as a model of experimental stroke.",
