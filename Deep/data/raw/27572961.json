     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is suggested to be potentially associated with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that cerebral ischemia deteriorates cognitive impairment in AD, through angiotensin II. METHODS: We used 5XFAD mouse, a model of AD with vascular and cerebral amyloid-beta deposition. Transient cerebral ischemia of mice was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) for 17 minutes. The posttreatment with olmesartan, an ARB, or vehicle was started at 24 hours after BCCAO and was performed for 5 weeks. Experimental mice consisted of 5 groups: (i) wild-type mice, (ii) wild-type mice with BCCAO, (iii) 5XFAD mice, (iv) 5XFAD mice with BCCAO, (v) 5XFAD mice with BCCAO and olmesartan postadministration. RESULTS: BCCAO in 5XFAD caused greater escape latency (P < 0.01) on water maze test than that in wild type, indicating that transient brief cerebral ischemia enhanced cognitive decline in 5XFAD mice. Posttreatment with olmesartan significantly reduced escape latency (P < 0.01) on water maze test, retention trial latency (P < 0.05) on passive avoidance test, and retention time of outer zone (P < 0.01) on open-field test in 5XFAD subjected to BCCAO. This protective effect of olmesartan against cognitive impairment in 5XFAD with BCCAO was associated with the protection of neuron and attenuation of oxidative stress in hippocampus and the suppression of blood-brain barrier disruption. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained the evidence that transient brief cerebral ischemia deteriorated cognitive impairment in AD model through AT1 receptor.",
