     "AB": "Tinnitus is an auditory phantom percept with a tone, hissing or buzzing sound in the absence of an objective physical sound source. It has been shown that tinnitus can lead to emotional and cognitive impairment and people with tinnitus perform worse than a control group on different cognitive tasks. The hippocampus is known to play an important role in cognitive performance, and also in the pathophysiology of tinnitus. Hippocampal deficits have been described in animal models of tinnitus and in tinnitus patients a decrease in grey matter in the hippocampus has been demonstrated. Nineteen patients with tinnitus and fifteen healthy controls performed different cognitive processing tasks and underwent an EEG with source analysis to investigate the relationship between tinnitus loudness, tinnitus distress and tinnitus duration, cognitive impairment and neurophysiological changes in the hippocampus. Results show that both tinnitus loudness, tinnitus distress and tinnitus duration correlated positively with different cognitive measures (trail making test, Montreal cognitive assessment, mini mental state examination). It was also shown that these cognitive measures correlate with beta activity in the hippocampus, the pregenual and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex extending into the right insula. A region of interest analysis further confirms that beta activity in the left and right hippocampal area correlated with the trail making performance. In conclusion, these results support for the first time the notion that cognitive changes in tinnitus patients are associated with changes in hippocampal activity as well as the anterior cingulate and insula.",
