Experimentally-induced migration disorders provide interesting insights in the mechanisms of the determination of neuronal phenotype and connectivity, of congenital cortical dysgenesis and the pathophysiology of associated neurological disorders, such as epilepsy. We investigated the effects of E14 administration of methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM), which induces microencephaly by ablating dividing cells. Brains from newborn and adult rats were reacted for NADPH-d and CO histochemistry. Moreover, callosally-projecting neurons were retrogradely labeled with DiI at P9 or with BDA in adults. MAM-treated rats displayed a remarkable reduction in cortical thickness, mainly due to reduction in layer IV and in supragranular layers. Heterotopic nodules appeared in the supragranular layers and in the hippocampus. CO-positive barrels in somatosensory cortex were almost absent. The distribution of NADPH-d-positive neurons was regular, but they were rare in heterotopic nodules. Callosally-projecting neurons displayed abnormal orientation of the apical dendrite and increase in the basal dendritic length. Alterations in the dendritic arborization of pyramidal neurons may be one of the substrates for the increased sensitivity to drugs which induce epileptic seizures in these animals.",
