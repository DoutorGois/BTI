     "AB": "The post-treatment effects of the selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor, valdecoxib, were investigated in a rat model of temporary focal ischemia. Valdecoxib reduced basal brain prostaglandin E(2) concentrations at dosages that did not affect serum thromboxane B(2), consistent with a selective COX-2 effect. Temporary focal cerebral ischemia was produced in rats by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90 min. There was increased expression of COX-2 protein detected by Western blot and immunocytochemistry within neurons in the ischemic cortex at 4 and 24 h after ischemia. Rats were treated with vehicle or valdecoxib 15 min before or 1.5, 3 and 6 h after cerebral ischemia. Rats were sacrificed and brain infarction volume determined 24 h after ischemia. Valdecoxib treatment was associated with a decrease in infarction volume when administered 15 min before, and 1.5 or 3 h but not 6 h after cerebral ischemia. There were no differences in physiological parameters during the procedure. Valdecoxib administered at 1.5 h after ischemia significantly reduced the concentrations of prostaglandin E(2) in ischemic penumbral cortex as compared to the vehicle-treated group and contralateral non-ischemic cortex. These results suggest that COX-2 inhibition with valdecoxib is effective when initiated both before and after middle cerebral artery occlusion.",
