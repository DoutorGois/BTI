     "AB": "Peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) elevates production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and motivates the expression of sickness behaviors. In this study, we tested the ability of an LPS-derived adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), to prevent LPS-induced sickness behaviors in a burrowing paradigm. Testing occurred over a three-day period. Animals received a single injection of either MPLA or saline the first two days of testing. On day three, animals received either LPS or saline. Tissue from the dorsal hippocampus was collected for qRT-PCR to assess expression of IL-1beta and IL-4. Results indicate that, during the pre-treatment phase, administration of MPLA induces an immune response sufficient to trigger sickness behaviors. However, we observed that animals pre-treated with MPLA for two days were resistant to LPS-induced sickness behaviors on day three. Results from the qRT-PCR analysis indicated that LPS-treated animals pre-treated with MPLA expressed significantly less IL-1beta compared to LPS-treated animals pre-treated with saline. However, we did not observe a significant difference in IL-4 expression between groups. Therefore, results indicate that under the given parameters of the study, MPLA pre-treatment protects against LPS-induced sickness behaviors, at least in part, by decreasing expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta.",
