     "AB": "The scope of this study was to test whether increased levels of the extracellular matrix molecule (ECM) agrin might enhance nicotine effects on those molecular mechanisms that initiate neuroadaptative processes in the hippocampus, a key brain area for learning and memory. We studied the effects of repetitive applications of neuronal agrin to primary hippocampal cell culture on nicotine-induced phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) expression, a marker of neuroadaptation, by using immunofluorescence-based assessment of pCREB-positive neurons. We also tested agrin effects on nicotine-induced expression of a marker of metabolic activation, the immediate early gene c-fos. Agrin was shown to significantly enhance nicotine-induced pCREB, but not c-fos, expression. By using Western blotting analysis, cumulative agrin has been shown to increase nicotine-induced pCREB phosphorylation. These analyses, however, showed that inhibition of the CaMKII pathway blocked general pCREB phosphorylation, whereas inhibition of the MAPK pathway potentiated the synergistic effect of cumulative agrin and nicotine. These findings suggest that increasing the concentration of an ECM molecule, i.e. agrin, may enhance nicotine effects on pCREB and that both MAPK and CaMKII signalling may play a regulatory role.",
