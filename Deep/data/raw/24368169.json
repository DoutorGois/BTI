     "AB": "The GABAAgamma2(R43Q) mouse is an established model of absence epilepsy displaying spontaneous spike-and-wave discharges (SWD) and associated behavioral arrest. Absence epilepsy typically results from cortico-thalamic networks. Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence for changes in hippocampal metabolism and electrical behavior, consistent with a link between absence seizures and hippocampus-related co-morbidities. Hyperpolarization-activated-cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are known to be transcriptionally regulated in a number of seizure models. Here we investigate the expression and function of these channels in the hippocampus of the genetic epilepsy model. A reduction in HCN1, but not HCN2 transcript, was observed in GABAAgamma2(R43Q) mice relative to their littermate controls. In contrast, no change in HCN1 transcript was noted at an age prior to seizure expression or in a SWD-free model in which the R43Q mutation has been crossed into a seizure-resistant genetic background. Whole-cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons confirm a reduction in Ih in the GABAAgamma2(R43Q) mouse. Further, a left-shift in half-activation of the Ih conductance-voltage relationship is consistent with a reduction in HCN1 with no change in HCN2 channel expression. Behavioral analysis using the Morris water maze indicates that GABAAgamma2(R43Q) mice are unable to learn as effectively as their wildtype littermates suggesting a deficit in hippocampal-based learning. SWD-free mice harboring the R43Q mutation had no learning deficit. We conclude that SWDs reduce hippocampal HCN1 expression and function, and that the reduction associates with a spatial learning deficit.",
