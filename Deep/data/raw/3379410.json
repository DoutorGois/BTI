     "AB": "The present experiments show that N-[3H]-methylcarbamylcholine ([3H]MCC) binds specifically and with high affinity to rat hippocampus, frontal cortex, and striatum. The highest maximal density of binding sites was apparent in frontal cortex and the lowest in hippocampus. [3H]MCC binding was potently inhibited by nicotinic, but not muscarinic, agonists and by the nicotinic antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine in all three brain regions studied. The effect of unlabeled MCC on acetylcholine (ACh) release from slices of rat brain was tested. The drug significantly enhanced spontaneous ACh release from slices of hippocampus and frontal cortex, but not from striatal slices. This effect of MCC to increase ACh release from rat hippocampus and frontal cortex was antagonized by the nicotinic antagonists dihydro-beta-erythroidine and d-tubocurarine, but not by alpha-bungarotoxin or by the muscarinic antagonist atropine. The MCC-induced increase in spontaneous ACh release from hippocampal and frontal cortical slices was not affected by tetrodotoxin. The results suggest that MCC might alter cholinergic transmission in rat brain by a direct activation of presynaptic nicotinic receptors on the cholinergic terminals. That this alteration of ACh release is apparent in hippocampus and frontal cortex, but not in striatum, suggests that there may be a regional specificity in the regulation of ACh by nicotinic receptors in rat brain.",
