     "AB": "The G-protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) was de-orphanized after the discovery that kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous tryptophan metabolite, acts as an agonist of this receptor. Abundant evidence supports that GPR35 exists primarily in peripheral tissues. Here, we tested the hypothesis that GPR35 exists in the hippocampus and influences the neuronal activity. Fluorescence immunohistochemical staining using an antibody anti-NeuN (a neuronal marker), an antibody anti-GFAP (a glial marker), and an antibody anti-GPR35 revealed that neurons in the stratum oriens, stratum pyramidale, and stratum radiatum of the CA1 field of the hippocampus express GPR35. To determine the presence of functional GPR35 in the neurocircuitry, we tested the effects of various GPR35 agonists on the frequency of spontaneous action potentials recorded as fast current transients (CTs) from stratum radiatum interneurons (SRIs) under cell-attached configuration in rat hippocampal slices. Bath application of the GPR35 agonists zaprinast (1-10 muM), dicumarol (50-100 muM), pamoic acid (500-1000 muM), and amlexanox (3 muM) produced a concentration- and time-dependent reduction in the frequency of CTs. Superfusion of the hippocampal slices with the GPR35 antagonist ML145 (1 muM) increased the frequency of CTs and reduced the inhibitory effect of zaprinast. Bath application of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil (1 or 5 muM) was ineffective, whereas a subsequent application of zaprinast was effective in reducing the CT frequency. The present results demonstrate for the first time that functional GPR35s are expressed by CA1 neurons and suggest that these receptors can be molecular targets for controlling neuronal activity in the hippocampus.",
