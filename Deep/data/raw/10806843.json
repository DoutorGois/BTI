     "AB": "Experiments were performed on 64 Sprague-Dawley rats under urethane anesthesia. Extracellular recording method was used to investigate the effect of aluminum(Al) microinjected into CA3 on long-term potentiation(LTP) in this area. The relationship between the inhibitory effect of Al and L-arginine-NO pathway was also studied. Microinjection of Al (0.5 mol/L, 1 microliter) into CA3 could block the induction of LTP in CA3. Microinjection of Al (0.5 mol/L, 1 microliter) into CA3 after LTP was induced could also decrease the amplitude of population spike (PS). The inhibitory effect of Al on LTP in CA3 could be enhanced by preinjection of NG-nitro-L-arginine (0.3 mol/L, 1 microliter). Preinjection of L-arginine (0.3 mol/L, 1 microliter) into CA3 could antagonize the inhibitory effect of Al on LTP. These results suggest that Al could block the induction of LTP and decrease the amplitude of PS potentiated in CA3. The effect of Al might be antagonized by L-arginine-NO pathway.",
