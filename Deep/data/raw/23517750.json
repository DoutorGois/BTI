     "AB": "The present study describes the organisation of the cholinergic, catecholaminergic, and serotonergic neurons in the brains of the giant otter shrew, the Hottentot golden mole and the four-toed sengi, and the orexinergic (hypocretinergic) system in the giant otter shrew and four-toed sengi. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible differences in the nuclear complement of these neural systems in comparison to previous studies on other Afrotherian species and mammalian species in general. Brains of the golden mole, sengi and giant otter shrew were coronally sectioned and immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against cholineacetyl-transferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, serotonin and orexin-A. The majority of nuclei revealed in the current study were similar among the species investigated, to other Afrotherian species, and to mammals generally, but certain differences in the nuclear complement highlighted phylogenetic interrelationships. The golden mole was observed to have cholinergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb and amygdala. The four-toed sengi had cholinergic neurons in both colliculi and in the cochlear nucleus, but lacked the catecholaminergic A15d group in the hypothalamus. In both the golden mole and the four-toed sengi, the locus coeruleus (A6d group) was made up of few neurons. The golden mole also exhibited an unusual foreshortening of the brain, such that a major (mesencephalic?) flexure in the brainstem was evident.",
