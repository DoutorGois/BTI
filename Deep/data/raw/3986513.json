     "AB": "Cholecystokinin-like immunoreactive material (CCK-IR) was revealed in the cat's thalamus by using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. The most dense collection of perikarya containing CCK-IR was seen in the rostral group of the intralaminar nuclei, in rostral parts of the rhomboid nucleus and the anterodorsal nucleus. Cells with CCK-IR were also found in the caudal group of the intralaminar nuclei, in the paraventricular nucleus and the parataenial nucleus. The remaining thalamic nuclei were void of CCK-IR. By combining immunohistochemistry with retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase, CCK-IR was shown to be present in neurons of the intralaminar nuclei projecting to the neocortex. Our findings suggest that CCK might act as a transmitter in the efferent projections of the intralaminar and midline nuclei of the cat's thalamus.",
