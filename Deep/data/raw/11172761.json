     "AB": "Global brain ischemia provoked by transient occlusion of the carotid arteries (2VO) in gerbils results in a severe loss of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region. We measured the concentration of the neuron specific N-acetyl-aspartate, [NAA], in the gerbil dorsal hippocampus by proton MR spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in situ, and HPLC, 4 days after global ischemia. The [NAA] was correlated with graded hippocampus damage scoring and stereologically determined neuronal density. A basal hippocampal [NAA] of 8.37+/-0.10 and 9.81+/-0.44 mmol/l were found from HPLC and 1H-MRS, respectively. HPLC measurements of [NAA] obtained from hippocampus 4 days after 2VO showed a 20% reduction in the [NAA] following 4 min of ischemia (P<0.001). 1H-MRS measurements on gerbils subjected to 4 or 8 min of ischemia showed a similar 24% decline in the [NAA] (P<0.05). Thus, there was correlation between the HPLC and 1H-MRS determined NAA decline. There was also a significant correlation between 1H-MRS [NAA] and the corresponding reduction in CA1 neuronal density (P<0.004). In summary our findings show that single voxel 1H-MRS can be used as a supplement to histological evaluation of neuronal injury in studies after global brain ischemia. Accordingly, volume selective spectroscopy has a potential for assessment of neuroprotective therapeutic compounds/strategies with respect to neuronal rescue for delayed ischemic brain damage.",
