     "AB": "The hippocampus, dentate gyrus, cerebellum, amygdala and caudate were examined for degenerating cells in normal neonatal hamsters. Each structure was studied from postnatal day 5 (P5) to P 10. The cerebellum was also studied on P 12. This time span was chosen to coincide with cessation of migration and establishment of connectivity in these structures. Substantial numbers of pycnotic cells were found in all structures except the dentate gyrus. The timing and amount of cell death varied between structures. Both the caudate nucleus and the amygdala showed greater cell losses in their peripheral margins than in their centers. The deep half of the internal granule cell layer of the cerebellum showed greater cell loss than the superficial half on all postnatal days studied.",
