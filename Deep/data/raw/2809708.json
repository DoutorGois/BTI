     "AB": "1. The reversible blocking effect of brief anoxia (2-4 min) on synaptic transmission was studied in submerged hippocampal slices (kept mostly at 34 degrees), obtained from adult (greater than 120 g) and very young (6-50 g) Wistar rats. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded with extra- and intracellular electrodes, sometimes simultaneously: in CA1, they were evoked by stratum radiation stimulation, in CA3 by hilar stimulation. 2. In slices from adults, EPSPs in CA1 were depressed by 90% after 2 min of anoxia, and postanoxic recovery was relatively slow (one-half recovery times 4.0 +/- 0.23 min, mean +/- SE). EPSPs in CA3 were consistently more resistant, especially those generated by mossy fibers; after 2 min of anoxia, these were reduced by only 14.7 +/- 5.4%. 3. In newborn animals (PN1-4), both intra- and extracellular EPSPs (but no population spikes) could be recorded in CA1. Although smaller and more fatigable than in the adult, they were much more resistant to anoxia, after 2 min being reduced by only 44.1 +/- 8.8%; and they were not abolished even after 6-7 min. On the other hand, postanoxic recovery was very rapid, being one-half complete in 2.4 +/- 0.48 min. Only large and very prolonged (giant) depolarizing PSPs [probably inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs)] could be recorded in CA3 neurons; they were rapidly blocked by anoxia. 4. In older pups (PN6-21), the CA1 EPSPs became progressively more sensitive to anoxia. At the end of the second week, they were as rapidly blocked as in slices from adults; but postanoxic recovery remained quicker throughout this period. In CA3, EPSPs could now be evoked that were as resistant to anoxia as in adult slices. 5. In both CA1 and CA3 neurons from adult rats, anoxia (for 2-3 min) reduced the input resistance (RN) by 45.7 +/- 6.25%. In CA1 neurons, there was most often some hyperpolarization (-7.2 +/- 1.8 mV), which was less consistent in CA3 cells. The return of O2 typically led to a second (postanoxic) phase of hyperpolarization (-7.9 +/- 1.93 mV). 6. At PN1-4, the resting potential (Vm) of most cells had to be maintained by current injection; the input resistance (RN) of CA1 neurons was 70% higher than in mature cells, and there was little time-dependent inward rectification. Anoxia produced no regular changes in Vm, and reductions in RN were very small (by only 9.6 +/- 5.0%). A postanoxic hyperpolarization was seen in only 2 neurons out of 11.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
