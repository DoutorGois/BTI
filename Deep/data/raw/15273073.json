     "AB": "The molecular mechanism of the protective effects of peony root extract and its component substances on neuron damage induced by the cobalt focus epilepsy model and the EL mouse was investigated. Long-term administration of peony root extract for 30 days prior to metallic cobalt powder application to the cerebral cortex of mice resulted in increased expression of A20, an inhibitor gene of cell death. In the EL mouse, a hereditary epilepsy animal model with vulnerable neurons, increased expression of A20 was observed even without administration of peony root extract. Long-term administration of peony root extract to the EL mouse resulted in a marked increase of expression of A20. These results suggested that an increase in A20 expression is the main molecular mechanism of protective action of peony root extract on neuron damage.",
