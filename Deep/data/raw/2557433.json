     "AB": "1. Rat dentate granule neurones in hippocampal slices were voltage-clamped at 21-23 degrees C using CsCl-filled microelectrodes. The perfusate contained TTX and K+ channel blockers to isolate pharmacologically inward Ca2+ currents. 2. From hyperpolarized holding potentials of -65 to -85 mV, depolarizing test potentials to between -50 and -40 mV elicited a transient (100-200 ms) low-threshold (TLT) current which was also elicited from more depolarized holding potentials following hyperpolarizing voltage steps of -40 mV or greater. 3. Larger depolarizing steps from a hyperpolarized holding potential triggered a large (2-6 nA), transient high-threshold (THT) inward current, rapidly peaking and decaying over 500 ms, followed by a sustained inward current component. 4. At depolarized holding potentials (-50 to -20 mV), the THT current was apparently inactivated and a sustained high-threshold (SHT) inward current was evident during depolarizing voltage steps of 10 mV or more. 5. From hyperpolarized holding potentials with depolarizing voltage steps of 10-30 mV, most neurones demonstrated a small-amplitude, sustained low-threshold (SLT) inward current with similar characteristics to the SHT current. 6. Zero-Ca2+ perfusate or high concentrations of Ca2+ channel blockers (Cd2+, Mn2+ or Ni2+) diminished or abolished all inward currents. 7. Repetitive voltage step activation of each current at 0.5 Hz reduced the large THT current to less than 25% of an unconditioned control current, reduced the SHT current by 50%, but had little effect on the TLT current. 8. A low concentration of Cd2+ (50 microM) blocked the THT and SHT currents with little effect on the TLT current. Nimodipine (1 microM) attenuated the SHT current. Ni2+ (100 microM) selectively attenuated the TLT current. 9. In low-Ca2+ perfusate, high concentrations of Ca2+ (10-15 mM), focally applied to different parts of the neurone, increased the THT current when applied to the dendrites, the SHT current when applied to the soma and the TLT current at all locations. Conversely, in regular perfusate, Cd2+ (1-5 mM), focally applied to the dendrites decreased the THT current and somatic applications decreased the SHT current. The TLT current was diminished regardless of the site of Cd2+ application. 10. These results suggest the existence of three different Ca2+ currents in dentate granule cells separable by their activation and inactivation characteristics, pharmacology and site of initiation.",
