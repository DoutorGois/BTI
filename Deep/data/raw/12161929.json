     "AB": "We have investigated the effects of various insults on extracellular glutamate and phosphoethanolamine levels as well as electrical activity alterations in the early period following these insults in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Cultures prepared from 7-day-old rats were maintained in vitro for 7-14 days and then metabolic inhibition was induced: cultures were briefly exposed to potassium cyanide to induce chemical anoxia, 2-deoxyglucose with glucose removal to produce hypoglycaemia, or a combination of both to simulate ischaemia. Chemical anoxia induced a small increase in glutamate and a reversible decrease in evoked field potentials and these were greatly potentiated following simulated ischaemia: high, biphasic glutamate efflux and irreversible field potential abolition as well as increase in phosphoethanolamine levels were observed. We have characterised the effects of treatments using NMDA-receptor antagonists and the L-type calcium channel blocker diltiazem. Anoxia-induced glutamate accumulation was prevented by MK-801 and diltiazem D-AP5. Following simulated ischaemia, diltiazem totally prevented glutamate and phosphoethanolamine accumulations, whereas MK-801 did not block the first phase of glutamate accumulation and D-AP5 prevented none. We demonstrated that glutamate and phosphoethanolamine ischaemic-evoked efflux as well as the recovery of electrical activity in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures are sensitive to both NMDA-receptor and calcium-channel blockade. This model thus represents a useful in vitro system for the study of ischaemic neurodegeneration paralleling results reported using in vivo models.",
