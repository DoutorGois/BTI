     "AB": "The pattern of hippocampal cell death has been studied following hippocampal seizure activity and status epilepticus induced by 110-min stimulation of the perforant pathway in awake rats. The order of vulnerability of principal cells in the different hippocampal subfields--as determined by silver impregnation--was found to be very similar to the pattern found in ischemia; i.e., dentate hilus greater than CA1, subiculum greater than CA3c greater than CA3a,b greater than dentate granule cells. The hilar somatostatin-containing cells were the most vulnerable cell type, whereas all other subpopulations of nonprincipal neurons--visualized by immunocytochemistry for the calcium binding proteins parvalbumin and calbindin--were remarkably resistant. Pyramidal cells in the CA3 region containing neither of the examined calcium binding proteins were more resistant to overexcitation than CA1 pyramidal cells, most of which do contain calbindin. This indicates that no simple relationship exists between vulnerability in status epilepticus and neuronal calcium binding protein content, and that local and/or systemic hypoxia during status epilepticus may be responsible for the ischemic pattern of cell death.",
