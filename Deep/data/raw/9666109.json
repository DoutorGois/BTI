     "AB": "Immunocytochemical techniques were employed to examine the distribution of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor alpha1 subunit within the hippocampus of 19 elderly subjects with Alzheimer-related neuropathologic changes. In mild cases (i.e., Braak stages I and II), the most intense neuropil immunolabeling was observed in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 subregion and subiculum, while the weakest labeling was observed in the CA3 subfield. In CA4 region, the proximal dendrites and cell bodies of mossy cells were intensely alpha1 positive. Throughout the hippocampus, we observed a number of alpha1 labeled interneurons. These cells consisted of both large and small multipolar cells as well as small bipolar neurons. In moderate cases (i.e., Braak stages III and IV), the pattern and intensity of alpha1 immunolabeling appeared indistinguishable from mild cases. In severe cases (i.e., Braak stages V and VI), we observed a marked decrease in neuropil immunolabeling within the CA2, CA1 subregions and prosubiculum, while the labeling of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, subiculum proper and presubiculum was indistinguishable from mild and moderate cases. These data together with our previous immunocytochemical study in which we demonstrated a marked preservation of the GABAA receptor subunit beta2/3 suggest that responses of selected GABAA receptor subunits to AD pathology are variable with the alpha1 subunit displaying a high degree of vulnerability.",
