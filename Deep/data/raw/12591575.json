     "AB": "Quantitative high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was utilized to measure anterior, posterior, and total hippocampal volumes in 27 male patients with chronic schizophrenia and 24 male controls. To optimize measurement techniques, hippocampal volumes were: (1) acquired with 1.4-mm slices; (2) excluded with the amygdala; (3) normalized for position; and (4) corrected for total intracranial volume (ICV). The results of a linear mixed effects regression analysis, which made it possible to analyze total anterior and total posterior hippocampal volumes separately, indicated that the anterior hippocampus was significantly smaller in the schizophrenic group relative to the control group. There were no significant group differences with respect to posterior hippocampal volumes, and no significant correlations between hippocampal volumes and illness duration. A significant lateralized asymmetry was also noted in both groups with the right hippocampal volume being larger than the left. These preliminary findings support a significant anterior hippocampal volume reduction in men with schizophrenia as well as a similar hippocampal volume asymmetry in both male controls and schizophrenics.",
