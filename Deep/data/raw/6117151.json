In the acute period of stress reaction activity of Na+, K+-ATPase was increased in synaptosomes of frontal cortex, hypothalamus and hippocamp. The enzymatic activity normalized after chronic action of the stressor agents. But under these conditions the activity of Mg2+-ATPase was distinctly decreased in cortex, hypothalamus and in pons Varolii.",
