     "AB": "The ability of several opioids in potentiating the synaptic activation of CA1 pyramidal cells in the rat hippocampal slice were compared. Morphine and the opioid peptides, (D-ala2, D-leu5)-enkephalin (DADL), morphiceptin, beta-endorphin, and Tyr-D-Ser-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr (DSThr) caused a concentration-dependent, naloxone-reversible shift to the left in the input-output (IO) curve constructed by plotting the population spike as a function of the field EPSP. These opioids then produced an increase in the size of the population spike while leaving the EPSP unaffected. In contrast, the kappa agonist prototype, ethylketazocine, had no effect on the IO curve when perfused in concentrations up to 10 microM. The rank order of potency for the opioids in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was DADL greater than DSThr greater than beta-endorphin greater than morphiceptin greater than morphine much greater than ethylketazocine. Thus, opioids that are more specific for delta opiate receptors were the most potent and mu receptor agonists, the least potent in this action. Taken together with previous studies suggesting that morphine and DADL may interact with a common opiate receptor in the CA1 region, the results are consistent with the notion that these epileptiform effects may be primarily mediated by delta opiate receptors in this area although the potency of morphiceptin indicates that mu receptors play some role in this effect.",
