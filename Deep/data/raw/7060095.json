     "AB": "Autoradiographic studies showed that in the rat hippocampus \"microglia-like reactive cells\" (MRS) and astrocytes are capable of proliferation in response to kainic acid (KA)-induced lesions. A marked increase in the number of labeled MRC was observed during the first four days after the induction of the KA-lesion. A proliferative response of astrocytes occurred at two days after the KA-lesion. After the induction of a KA-lesion brain macrophages and oligodendrocytes were only slightly labeled with 3H-thymidine. It appears likely that MRC is the main cellular element responding to this type of lesion.",
