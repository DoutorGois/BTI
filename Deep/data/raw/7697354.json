     "AB": "This study was performed in order to measure changes in brain N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA) in post-mortem brain tissue in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in comparison to normal control subjects using the technique of magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Brain tissue was obtained at autopsy and frozen until use, from seven patients diagnosed according to current research criteria for AD and 7 control subjects. Detailed clinical evaluations were available for all the dementia cases. Representative brain samples were obtained from three neocortical regions and a limbic region (parahippocampal gyrus) in white and grey matter. NAA was quantified on perchloric acid extracts using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Regional NAA did not vary significantly with age. In AD, reductions were present in the grey matter of the neocortex but not in the white matter. Within the parahippocampal gyrus there were reductions in both tissue types; only cortical levels correlated with clinical scales of dementia severity. A pattern of increasing correlation was observed between dementia severity as measured by the mini mental state examination during life and NAA levels from brain areas of increasing pathological predilection in AD. These post-mortem studies show reductions in brain NAA in AD which correlate with dementia severity during life and which support the use of future in vivo NAA spectroscopic images in the evaluation of AD patients.",
