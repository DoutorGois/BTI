     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the pathological morphological changes of cerebral cortex and hippocampi in rhesus monkey caused by +Gx exposure, and to explore the relation between +Gx level and pathological changes. METHOD: Healthy rhesus monkeys were randomly divided into one control group and three experimental groups (+15 Gx, +18 Gx, +21 Gx). Monkeys in each group were exposed to the corresponding level of +Gx, after that, the required tissue was qualitatively studied on the basis of pathological morphology. RESULT: 1) Different morphology changes were observed in pyramidal neurons and astrocytes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampi by light microscopy. The higher the +Gx level, the more the changes were observed. In addition, the trauma was more serious in the hippocampi. 2) Chromatin marginating, karyotheca fold, apoptosis body and swollen mitochondria with blurred cristae were observed in pyramidal cell under electron microscope after +Gx exposure, and degenerative changes were also observed in some cases after higher +Gx. CONCLUSION: High level of +Gx causes acute pathological trauma of brain tissues in rhesus monkey, and consanguineous relationship exists between pathological changes and level of +Gx.",
