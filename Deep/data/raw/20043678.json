     "AB": "A novel alpha 7 nAChR agonist, 4-(5-methyloxazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-2-yl)-1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane (24, CP-810,123), has been identified as a potential treatment for cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric or neurological conditions including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Compound 24 is a potent and selective compound with excellent pharmaceutical properties. In rodent, the compound displays high oral bioavailability and excellent brain penetration affording high levels of receptor occupancy and in vivo efficacy in auditory sensory gating and novel object recognition. The structural diversity of this compound and its preclinical in vitro and in vivo package support the hypothesis that alpha 7 nAChR agonists may have potential as a pharmacotherapy for the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",
