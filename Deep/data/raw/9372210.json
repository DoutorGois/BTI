     "AB": "Brief periods of global cerebral ischemia are known to produce characteristic patterns of neuronal injury both in human studies and in experimental animal models. Ischemic damage to vulnerable areas such as the CA1 sector of the hippocampus is thought to result from excitotoxic amino acid neurotransmission. The objective of this study was to determine the ability of a novel sodium channel blocking compound, zonisamide, to reduce neuronal damage by preventing the ischemia-associated accumulation of extracellular glutamate. Using a gerbil model, animals were subjected to 5 min ischemic insults. Both pre- and post-ischemic drug administration (zonisamide 150 mg/kg) were studied. Histological brain sections were prepared using a silver stain at 7 and 28 days post ischemia. The animals sacrificed at 28 days also underwent behavioral testing using a modified Morris water maze. In vivo microdialysis was performed on a separate group of animals in order to determine the patterns of ischemia-induced glutamate accumulation in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus. Pyramidal cell damage scores in the CA1 region of the hippocampus were significantly reduced in animals pre-treated with zonisamide compared to saline-treated controls, both at 7 days (drug pre-treated: 0.812 +/- 0.28, n = 8; controls: 1.625 +/- 0.24, n = 8; *P < 0.05) and 28 (drug pre-treated: 0.833 +/- 0.22, n = 12; controls: 1.955 +/- 0.26, n = 11; **P < 0.01) days post ischemia. However, animals receiving zonisamide post-treatment did not display significant differences from controls. Behavioral studies also showed significant preservation of function in drug-treated animals. Microdialysis studies confirmed a reduction in glutamate release in drug-treated animals compared to saline-treated controls. Our data suggest that zonisamide is effective in reducing neuronal damage by a mechanism involving decreased ischemia-induced extracellular glutamate accumulation and interruption of excitotoxic pathways.",
