     "AB": "Endocannabinoids released during cerebral ischemia have been implicated as neuroprotective agents. We assessed the role of cannabinoid receptors in modulating the response of neurons to oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD), a model for in vitro ischemia, in rat hippocampal slices using extracellular recording techniques. Under control conditions, 15 min OGD resulted in only 50% recovery of CA1 field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) 60 min post-insult. This post-OGD depression of function was primarily NMDA receptor-dependent as the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (50 microM) promoted recovery of synaptic transmission to 76% of the baseline. Treatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (1 microM), which prevented the depression of excitatory synaptic transmission caused by WIN55,212-2 (1 microM), also markedly enhanced recovery of function (71% of control). The enhanced recovery after OGD in the presence of AM251 was independent of both GABA(A) receptors and NMDA receptors since co-application of AM251 with either bicuculline (10 microM) or MK-801 (50 microM) did not alter recovery, or further improved recovery, respectively. These results suggest endocannabinoids released during OGD may modulate synaptic transmission and post-OGD neuronal outcome via activation of an AM251-sensitive cannabinoid receptor.",
