     "AB": "PURPOSE: In this study, we developed a quantitative analysis tool based on patient's longitudinal MR images to 1) measure the radiation dose received by each subcortical structure, 2) follow the change of volume and shape of each structure longitudinally. This tool provides a systematic approach to study the radiation therapy (and subsequent chemotherapy) associated with cognitive impairments. METHODS: MRI scans of one patient taken before and after radiation therapy are demonstrated in this study. 3D Conformal radiation therapy was performed on RapidArc. An open source MRI analysis tool, FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST), was used for segmentation. The images are registered to a standard template with expert-defined labeling for all sub-cortical structures, and the labeling of each structure is mapped back to the individual MRI space for segmentation. After the segmentation, the radiation dose map was coregistered to the MRI space to calculate the dose received by each structure. RESULTS: For the structure that is contained within the radiation zone, we can calculate the total dose based on the volumetric distribution of radiation dose. For the structure that is outside the radiation field, we can calculate the distance from the radiation zone. We have demonstrated in this work that the analysis can be done for all segmented sub-cortical structures. The change of volume before and after radiation treatment can be analyzed, and the results can be correlated with the change of cognitive performance over time. CONCLUSIONS: We presented an automated tool for efficient, quantitative and user-independent measurements of radiation dose in subcortical structures. The obtained results can be correlated with the cognitive test score and the clinical outcome to evaluate radiation and the subsequent chemotherapy induced changes in brain structures and functions.",
