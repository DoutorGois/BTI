     "AB": "The brain has the highest Runx1t1 level relative to the levels in other organs. Runx1t1 might have a regulatory function as a transcriptional corepressor in the differentiation/development of the nervous system. Neurogenesis requires factors that regulate the proliferation of progenitors and activate the neuronal differentiation process. However, the precise role of Runx1t1 in hippocampal neurogenesis is unclear. We knocked down Runx1t1 in hippocampal radial glial cells (RGCs) with Runx1t1-RNA interference using lentiviral vectors. We also used LV-Runx1t1 to induce Runx1t1 overexpression in vitro. We have provided experimental evidence that decreased Runx1t1 expression reduced the neuronal differentiation of RGCs, and increased Runx1t1 expression caused a greater number of RGCs to differentiate into neurons. We have concluded that Runx1t1 could be involved in the process through which RGCs differentiate into neurons.",
