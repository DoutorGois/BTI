     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Histone acetylation, which is a chromatin modification of histone tails, can dynamically regulate the expression of various genes in normal development. HDAC2 is a negative regulatory factor of acetylation and closely related to learning and memory. NSE is a nerve marker and vital for maintaining physiological functions in nervous system. Currently, few studies associated with the expression pattern of HDAC2 in postnatal rat hippocampus have been reported. This study aimed to explore the temporal and spatial expression pattern of HDAC2, helping to reveal the expression characteristics of HDAC2 during postnatal neuronal maturation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With NSE as a biomarker of neuronal maturation at postnatal days 1, 3, 7 and weeks 2, 4, and 8 (P1D, P3D, P7D, P2W, P4W, P8W), the expression patterns of HDAC2 in rat hippocampus were examined using real-time PCR and western blotting. Additionally, the subcellular distribution of HDAC2 was analysed by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: We found that HDAC2 was highly expressed in the neonatal period and decreased gradually. HDAC2 expression was widely distributed in neurons of hippocampal CA1, CA3 and DG regions and gradually shifted from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during postnatal development. Altogether, the expression of HDAC2 decreased gradually with different subcellular localizations throughout development. CONCLUSIONS: The observed results indicate that the expression levels of HDAC2 become lower and with different subcellular localizations in neurons during hippocampal neuronal maturation, suggesting the specific expression characteristics of HDAC2 might play an important role during postnatal learning-memory function and development.",
