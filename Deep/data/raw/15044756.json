     "AB": "Like many teenagers, stem cells won't grow up without a push. New research reveals that RNA snippets provide a shove, inciting brain stem cells to mature. The work suggests that RNAs instigate the process by changing a gene-blocking protein into a gene activator. The study is the first to show that the miniature molecules can turn genes on as well as off.",
