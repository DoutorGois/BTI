     "AB": "In addition to Abeta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by increased brain levels of APP C-terminal fragments. In the present investigation, the cholinergic innervation in forebrain regions of transgenic mice (Tg13592) expressing the human betaAPP C99 fragment was compared to that of non-transgenic controls by measuring the activity of the non-specific catabolic enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The AchE activity of Tg13592 mice was altered in several regions implicated in the functional loop of regulation between septum and hippocampus, vulnerable in Alzheimer pathology and critically involved in cognitive functions. In particular, AChE activity was upregulated in three basal forebrain regions containing cholinergic cell bodies, prelimbic cortex, anterior subiculum, and paraventricular thalamus, but downregulated in lateral septum and reticular thalamus. The increased activity in medial septum and anterior subiculum was linearly correlated with poor performances in a spatial learning task, possibly due to cell stress mechanisms. Because of some similarities in terms of neurochemistry and behavior, this mouse model may be of use for studying prodromal AD.",
