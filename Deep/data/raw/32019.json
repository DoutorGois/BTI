     "AB": "Biochemical assays on microdissected samples, denervation studies, subcellular fractionation, and light and electron microscopic autoradiography of high affinity uptake have been performed to study the cellular localization of transmitter candidates in the rat hippocampal formation. High affinity uptake of glutamate and aspartate is localized in the terminals of several excitatory systems, such as the entorhino-dentate fibres (perforant path), mossy fibres (from granular cells) and pyramidal cell axons. Thus, in stratum radiatum and oriens of CA1, 85% of glutamate and asparate uptake and 40% of glutamate and aspartate content are lost after lesions of ipsilateral plus commissural fibres from CA3/CA4. Hippocampal efferents also take up aspartate and glutamate, since these activities are heavily reduced in the lateral septum and mamillary bodies after transection of fimbria and the dorsal fornix. The synthesis (by glutamic acid decarboxylase), content and high affinity uptake of gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) are not reduced after lesions of these or other projection fibre systems. A localization in intrinsic neurons is confirmed by a selective loss of glutamic acid decarboxylase after local injections of kainic acid. Peak concentrations of the enzyme occur near the pyramidal and granular cell bodies, corresponding to the site of the inhibitory basket cell terminals, and in the outer parts of the molecular layers. Some 85% of glutamic acid decarboxylase is situated in 'nerve ending particles'. Acetylcholine synthesis (by choline acetyltransferase) disappears after lesions of septo-hippocampal fibres. Since 80% of the hippocampal choline acetyltransferase is in 'nerve ending particles', the characteristic topographical distribution of this enzyme should reflect the distribution of cholinergic septo-hippocampal afferents. Serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine and histamine are located/synthesized in afferent fibre systems. Some monoamine-containing afferents to the hippocampal formation pass via the septal area, others via the amygdala. The hippocampal formation also contains nerve elements reacting with antibodies against neuroactive peptides, such as enkephalin, substance P, somatostatin and gastrin/cholecystokinin.",
