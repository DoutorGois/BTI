     "AB": "Complex partial seizures originating in the temporal lobe are one of the most common types of seizures in patients with epilepsy. They are frequently intractable to medical treatment and are increasingly considered for surgical therapy. These seizures are often associated with focal epileptogenicity in limbic structures (amygdala and hippocampus) or with rapid spread of seizure activity to these areas. Much research is being undertaken to better understand this disorder and to develop more effective approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Experimental work in animals has contributed to the understanding of epileptogenesis, the interictal state, and the homeostatic mechanisms that limit seizure activity.",
