     "AB": "Endoplasmic reticulum Mg(2+)/Ca(2+) ATPase Ca(2+) sequestration is crucial for maintenance of neuronal Ca(2+) homeostasis. The use of cell culture in conjunction with modern Ca(2+) imaging techniques has been invaluable in elucidating these mechanisms. While imaging protocols evaluate endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) loads, measurement of Mg(2+)/Ca(2+) ATPase activity is indirect, comparing cytosolic Ca(2+) levels in the presence or absence of the Mg(2+)/Ca(2+) ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. Direct measurement of Mg(2+)/Ca(2+) ATPase by isolation of microsomes is impossible due to the minuscule amounts of protein yielded from cultures used for imaging. In the current study, endoplasmic reticulum Mg(2+)/Ca(2+) ATPase Ca(2+) sequestration was measured in mixed homogenates of neurons and glia from primary hippocampal cultures. It was demonstrated that Ca(2+) uptake was mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum Mg(2+)/Ca(2+) ATPase due to its dependence on ATP and Mg(2+), enhancement by oxalate, and inhibition by thapsigargin. It was also shown that neuronal Ca(2+) uptake, mediated by the type 2 sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase isoform, could be distinguished from glial Ca(2+) uptake in homogenates composed of neurons and glia. Finally, it was revealed that Ca(2+) uptake was sensitive to incubation on ice, extremely labile in the absence of protease inhibitors, and significantly more stable under storage conditions at -80 degrees C.",
