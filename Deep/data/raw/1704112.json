     "AB": "Using whole cell recordings in combination with the concentration clamp technique it was shown that even enzymatically isolated hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons exhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and L-aspartate currents. These currents were completely blocked by 0.5 mM Mg2+ or partially blocked (72.7 +/- 2.4%) by DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (50 microM) whereas 10 microM glycine (Gly) potentiated the NMDA responses (3.1 +/- 1.6-fold). A half-maximum dose of 55 microM was calculated from the sigmoid NMDA dose-response curve in the presence of 10 microM Gly. The amplitudes of these currents did not depend on the type of the proteolytic enzyme used for cell isolation.",
