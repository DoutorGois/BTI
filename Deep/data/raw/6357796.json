     "AB": "Using two monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognise alpha-tubulin we describe differences in their light and electron microscopic immunoperoxidase staining of axons in cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. In the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex at the light microscopic level, one of the antibodies (YOL/34) labelled parallel fibre axons (in an identical manner to a beta-tubulin monoclonal antibody) while the other antibody (YL1/2) failed to label them. Extending these studies to the electron microscopic level in the cerebellum we have determined the sub-cellular localisation of alpha-tubulin in microtubules and the postsynaptic density, and also demonstrated a sub-population of parallel fibres and myelinated axons labelled with antibody YL1/2. The monoclonal antibodies were further characterised using immunoblotting against alpha-tubulin separated by isoelectric focusing gels. The results suggest that the contrasting staining patterns between the alpha-tubulin antibodies may reflect axonal sub-populations containing different isotypes of alpha-tubulin.",
