     "AB": "The effect of diazepam on inbred mutant E1 mice, which develop convulsive seizures after repeated sessions of being tossed up, was examined. Acute administration of diazepam (32 mg/kg, i.p.) completely inhibited the convulsions. At that time, the dopamine level was increased in the cortex and hippocampus, and the norepinephrine level in the cerebellum was decreased. 5-Hydroxytryptamine levels were not changed. As for amino acids, the glutamine level increased and the levels of GABA, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine and other amino acids were not changed.",
