     "AB": "We have developed an extremely sensitive technique, termed immuno-detection amplified by T7 RNA polymerase (IDAT) that is capable of monitoring proteins, lipids, and metabolites and their modifications at the single-cell level. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the T7 promoter is conjugated to an antibody (Ab), and then T7 RNA polymerase is used to amplify RNA from the double-stranded oligonucleotides coupled to the Ab in the Ab-antigen complex. By using this technique, we are able to detect the p185(her2/neu) receptor from the crude lysate of T6-17 cells at 10(-13) dilution, which is 10(9)-fold more sensitive than the conventional ELISA method. Single-chain Fv fragments or complementarity determining region peptides of the Ab also can be substituted for the Ab in IDAT. In a modified protocol, the oligonucleotide has been coupled to an Ab against a common epitope to create a universal detector species. With the linear amplification ability of T7 RNA polymerase, IDAT represents a significant improvement over immuno-PCR in terms of sensitivity and has the potential to provide a robotic platform for proteomics.",
