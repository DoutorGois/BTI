     "AB": "Recent evidence indicates that demyelination occurs in epilepsy patients and kindling animal models. Regarding the well-known literature on anti-inflammatory and myelin protective effects of fingolimod (FTY720) in multiple sclerosis patients and animal models, we hypostatized whether FTY720 administration could exert myelin protective effects in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling model. To end this, animals received 0.3 or 1mg/kg dosage of FTY720, 1h before PTZ injections. In another approach, after achieving fully kindling stage, FTY720 was administrated i.p. once daily for 7 consecutive days. Treatment with FTY720 (especially lower dose) reduced the frequency of seizures and epileptiform discharges in both approaches. We found that FTY720 administration decreases cell death and glial activation in CA1 and CA3 regions of hippocampus. Myelin protection effect was shown by increasing myelin levels. Furthermore, post-treatment of FTY720 enhanced endogenous remyelination and the number of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in fully kindled animals. Together, these results demonstrate that FTY720 behind the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotection effects has beneficial role in myelin protection and remyelination enhancement in PTZ kindling model of seizure and it may be provide a new therapeutic option for demyelination associated with epilepsy.",
