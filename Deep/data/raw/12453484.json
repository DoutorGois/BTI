     "AB": "Elevation of circulating corticosterone levels, either through exogenous administration of the hormone or following stress exposure, is known to reduce hippocampal synaptic potentiation in rodents. It is presently debated whether this reduction is due to activation of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors or is primarily caused in other brain structures projecting to the hippocampus. To address this issue, we examined whether synaptic potentiation in hippocampal slices from mice with low basal corticosterone levels was altered 1-4 h after a brief in vitro administration of 100 nM corticosterone. Population spike and field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) were recorded in the cell and dendritic layers, respectively, of the CA1 area, in response to Schaffer collateral/commissural fiber stimulation. Basal characteristics of the stimulus-response relationship were not affected by corticosterone treatment, except that after corticosterone treatment the maximal fEPSP slope was reduced while the excitability ratio was increased. For studies on potentiation of the fEPSP and population spike, stimulus intensities were chosen to evoke half maximal responses before potentiation; this intensity was significantly lower for the fEPSP than for the population spike. Primed burst potentiation of the fEPSP but not population spike was significantly attenuated after corticosterone treatment. When using a more rigorous stimulation paradigm, i.e. theta burst potentiation, synaptic potentiation was not affected by corticosterone. Raising corticosterone levels in mice by exposure to a psychosocial stressor led to comparable results in subsequent in vitro experiments; stress reduced primed burst potentiation only of the fEPSP. These data support that corticosterone affects synaptic potentiation in the mouse via direct activation of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors but only when using mild stimulation conditions.",
