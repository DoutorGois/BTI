     "AB": "The overflow and metabolism of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) from transplants of embryonic medullary and mesencephalic raphe neurones in the previously 5-HT-denervated hippocampus have been analyzed in vivo using intracerebral dialysis. The average density of 5-HT-immunoreactive fibres in the grafted hippocampus was less than in nonlesioned hippocampus. Nonetheless, both basal and potassium-stimulated levels of 5-HT in the dialysates were restored to approximately normal after transplantation of medullary raphe cells, whereas mesencephalic implants resulted in over twice the 5-HT output observed in control hippocampus. However, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) overflow was increased only after grafting of mesencephalic raphe and then only to normal levels; medullary implants, by contrast, failed to enhance 5-HIAA output above that from lesion-only hippocampus. The evidence of a relative hyperactivity of the grafted neurones may explain the disproportionate improvements in various lesion-induced behavioural deficits after grafting of nervous tissue. In addition, differences in the presynaptic regulation of 5-HT release and metabolism are also apparent in the transplants; these variations are dependent on the precise origin of the serotoninergic cells.",
