     "AB": "Depriving rats of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was shown to lower their thresholds and raise their response rates for rewarding brain stimulation. Conversely, allowing rats to self-stimulate while they were being deprived of this sleep form reduced the amount of REM rebound during recovery from deprivation. These results demonstrate a reciprocal relation between rewarding brain stimulation and REM sleep.",
