     "AB": "We report here studies on the effects of an imprinting procedure on cell proliferation in neonatal chicks in brain structures known to undergo plastic changes in imprinting. Proliferating cells were detected immunohistochemically on brain sections by incorporation of pre-training doses of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into DNA; numbers of new cells were counted in the intermediate medial mesopallium, the intermediate arcopallium, the medial part of the mesopallium and the nidopallium, the dorsocaudal nidopallium, the hippocampus, and the parahippocampal region 24 h and seven days after training. The intermediate medial mesopallium showed an increase in the number of BrdU-positive cells 24 h after training. However, at seven days post-training, the number of BrdU-containing cells decreased in the medial nidopallium and mesopallium, in the dorsocaudal nidopallium, and the right intermediate medial mesopallium. Thus, the imprinting procedure had differently directed transient and long-term influences on the genesis of new cells in the chick brain, inducing the appearance of a large number of cells in the parenchyma of the brain one day after training and decreases in the numbers of cells at later time points. This double effect may be associated with the fact that the imprinting procedure simultaneously initiates two brain processes involving the control of cell proliferation - one related to maturation of a species-specific functional system for tracking individuals of the same species and one related to remembering the characteristics of the actual parent.",
