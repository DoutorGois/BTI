     "AB": "Rodent models of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) have revealed discrepant findings in ethanol's (EtOH) ability to alter the survival of principal neurons within hippocampal areas CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus (DG). One issue is the lack of systematic examination of the timing of EtOH exposure over key periods of hippocampal cell development. The present study examined whether systematic developmental EtOH exposure produces long-term hippocampal cell loss that is related to a specific time course in which either generation, migration or synaptogenic events in this neural region occurs. EtOH treatment occurred during the periods equivalent to the first, second, third and all three trimesters in humans using similar administration procedures for both mothers and pups. Unbiased stereological estimates of the total number of pyramidal and granule cells within hippocampal regions CA1, CA3 and DG were performed when rats reached adulthood. The findings confirm previous reports that area CA1 is highly susceptible to EtOH exposure that occurs during either the early neonatal period or all three trimesters equivalent, while areas CA3 and DG are more resistant to EtOH-induced insult during all periods of hippocampal development examined.",
