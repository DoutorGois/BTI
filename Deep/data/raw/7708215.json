     "AB": "Investigations were undertaken to determine whether fetal histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus survive intracranial transplantation to adult hosts. Two methods of transplantation were utilized. Grafts were placed either into the delayed cavity of a fimbria-fornix lesion or directly into the hippocampus using stereotaxic techniques. The tissue was taken from rat fetuses at embryonic days 16-17 and grafted into adult rats of either the Sprague-Dawley or the Fischer 344 strain. Routine histology and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the grafts. All transplants to Sprague-Dawley rats showed signs of rejection, while no signs of rejection were seen in any of the Fischer 344 rats. Transplants placed directly into the delayed fimbria-fornix cavity did not grow as well or contain as many surviving neurons as the intraparenchymal grafts. The largest number of surviving histamine-positive neurons was obtained with grafts of posterolateral blocks of hypothalamus from fetal day 17 placed directly into the CA1 region of the rostral hippocampal formation of Fischer 344 hosts. Histamine-immunoreactive cell bodies with neuritic outgrowth were found in all Fischer 344 rats that received hypothalamic grafts. Cell bodies exhibited histamine immunoreactivity evenly throughout the cytoplasm and had morphological characteristics resembling histaminergic neurons in situ. Axonal outgrowth extended throughout the grafted hypothalamic tissue, and was sometimes seen in the host hippocampal tissue as well. It is concluded that fetal histaminergic neurons survive transplantation to the adult hippocampal formation, and that this allograft procedure can supplement current strategies to investigate the function of histaminergic tuberomamillary neurons in the central nervous system.",
