     "AB": "The effect of AVP4-8 on synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal slices was studied using both extracellular and intracellular recording. AVP4-8 induced a long-lasting potentiation effect on the evoked EPSP and enhanced LTP in pyramidal neurones. The lowest effective concentration of AVP4-8 was 1 x 10(-12) M, three to four orders of magnitude lower than that of AVP. These findings support the concept that AVP4-8 is a new memory-enhancing peptide and should be written as ZNC(C)PR. The results show that the potentiation effect of ZNC(C)PR is mainly due to a presynaptic mechanism of action.",
