     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to identify differentially expressed proteins in the anterior and posterior hippocampus of brains of schizophrenia patients compared to neurologically healthy controls. METHOD: Proteins extracted from fresh frozen post-mortem posterior and anterior hippocampus for nine schizophrenia and nine control individuals, and seven schizophrenia and seven control individuals, respectively, were screened for differential expression using 2-D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. RESULTS: A significantly larger number of protein spots were differentially expressed in the anterior (n = 43) compared to the posterior (n = 16) hippocampus, representing 34 and 14 unique proteins, respectively. These proteins are involved in cytoskeleton structure and function, neurotransmission and mitochondrial function. CONCLUSION: Based on the aberrant protein expression profiles, the anterior hippocampus appears to be more involved in schizophrenia pathogenesis than the posterior hippocampus. Furthermore, consistent with previous findings, we found molecular evidence to support abnormal neuronal cytoarchitecture and function, neurotransmission and mitochondrial function in the schizophrenia hippocampus.",
