     "AB": "The involvement of the cerebellum in procedural learning is demonstrated in visuomotor-sequence tasks, as lesion of this area impedes the acquisition of new sequences. Likewise, the lateral cerebellum appears to be involved in the acquisition of new sequences, but not in the execution of learned sequences. In contrast, the dentate nucleus participates only in the execution of learned visuomotor sequences. In previous studies, disruption of the procedural elements of spatial navigation following cerebellar or dentate lesions has been reported. However, as praxic strategies (egocentric learning) are included in the procedural elements of the navigation, the participation of the cerebellar-dentate nucleus in egocentric procedural learning processes has not been evaluated. Therefore, using colchicine, bilateral lesions were made in the cerebellar-dentate nucleus of Sprague-Dawley rats, and these rats were given two tasks: egocentric-based motor sequence learning in the radial maze and egocentric navigation in the Morris water maze. The lesioned rats were unable to use the sequential information in the short term and showed delayed long-term acquisition, which was probably due to the inability to detect the sequence. No effects on the egocentric navigation task were observed. Our results indicate that the cerebellar-dentate nucleus is involved in the detection of egocentric sequential information but not in the use of this information in the navigation process. Further, they show differential involvement of the cerebellar-dentate nucleus in the execution of learned visuomotor sequences, as the dentate lesion disrupted the acquisition of new egocentric-motor-based sequences.",
