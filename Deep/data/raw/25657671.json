     "AB": "The default mode network is associated with senior cognitive functions in humans. In this study, we performed independent component analysis of blood oxygenation signals from 14 heroin users and 13 matched normal controls in the resting state through functional MRI scans. Results showed that the default mode network was significantly activated in the prefrontal lobe, posterior cingulated cortex and hippocampus of heroin users, and an enhanced activation signal was observed in the right inferior parietal lobule (P < 0.05, corrected for false discovery rate). Experimental findings indicate that the default mode network is altered in heroin users.",
