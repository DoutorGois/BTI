     "AB": "Regional binding of 123I-iododexetimide, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, was measured in vivo in the temporal lobes of 4 patients with complex partial seizures using single-photon emission computed tomography. In the anterior hippocampus ipsilateral to the electrical focus, 123I-iododexetimide binding was decreased by 40 +/- 9% (mean +/- SD, p < 0.01) compared with the contralateral hippocampus; 123I-iododexetimide binding in other temporal lobe regions was symmetrical. The data indicate a regionally specific change of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in anterior hippocampus in complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin.",
