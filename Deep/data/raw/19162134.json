     "AB": "Choline acetyltransferase is the enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Seven types of mRNA for choline acetyltransferase that differ in the 5'-noncoding region are transcribed from the cholinergic gene locus from different promoter regions and produced by alternative splicing in the mouse. Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes and in situ hybridization histochemistry were used to investigate the expression of N1, R1, R2, R3, R4 and total choline acetyltransferase mRNA in the mouse CNS. The relative levels of choline acetyltransferase transcripts differed dramatically in distinct subdivisions of the mature cholinergic nervous system. Neurons hybridizing with antisense riboprobes for all of the five investigated splice variants (R1, R2, R3, R4 and N1) as well as those hybridizing with riboprobe for the common protein-coding region were found in a number of expected regions in the CNS. They include the basal forebrain, striatum, pontomesencephalic tegmentum, motor and autonomic nuclei of the brainstem, and spinal cord. Neurons with a moderate to very high level of expression of R1 and R2 splice variants were distributed in both the forebrain and brainstem nuclei. On the other hand, R3, R4 and N1 splice variants revealed a moderate to high level of expression in the brainstem motor and autonomic nuclei and ventral and lateral horns of the spinal cord compared to a low expression level in forebrain cholinergic structures. No expression of the N1, R1, R2, R3 and R4 splice variants was detectable in the neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and medial habenular nucleus. With the riboprobe for the common protein-coding region, the neurons of the medial habenular nucleus could be labeled at high level, while intrinsic cortical neurons were labeled at low level. Hippocampus revealed no significant hybridization for total choline acetyltransferase mRNA. These findings strongly suggested that: (1) R1 and R2 were the major splice variants expressed in the neurons of forebrain nuclei; (2) R1, R2, R3, R4 and N1 splice variants were almost equally expressed in the brainstem motor and autonomic nuclei and ventral and lateral horns of the spinal cord; (3) inferring from a paucity of other isoforms, M type choline acetyltransferase mRNA is a splice variant predominantly expressed in the cerebral cortex and medial habenular nucleus.",
