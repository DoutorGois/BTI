     "AB": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) has been shown to support the survival of axotomized medial septal cholinergic neurons after aspirative lesions of the fimbria-fornix (FF). This survival effect has been achieved utilizing intraventricular and intraparenchymal delivery of the NGF protein. While the use of NGF for the treatment of the cholinergic deficits present in Alzheimer's disease shows promise based on its efficacy in animal models, concerns about side-effects of intraventricular NGF delivery in humans have been raised. In the present study, NGF was delivered directly to the medial septum via a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV) encoding the cDNA for human NGF prior to a FF lesion in rats. This rAAV-mediated NGF delivery was shown to significantly attenuate the medial septal cholinergic cell loss observed in animals receiving an equivalent injection of a control rAAV vector.",
