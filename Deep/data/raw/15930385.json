     "AB": "Recently, we have shown that the microtubule-associated protein tau is essential for beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity in hippocampal neurons. However, the mechanisms by which tau mediates Abeta-induced neurite degeneration remain poorly understood. In the present study, we analyzed whether tau cleavage played a role in these events. Our results showed that pre-aggregated Abeta induced the generation of a 17 kDa tau fragment in cultured hippocampal neurons. The generation of this fragment was preceded by the activation of calpain-1. Conversely, inhibitors of this protease, but not of caspases, completely prevented tau proteolysis leading to the generation of the 17 kDa fragment and significantly reduced Abeta-induced neuronal death. Furthermore, the expression of this fragment in cultured hippocampal neurons induced the formation of numerous varicosity-bearing tortuous processes, as well as the complete degeneration of some of those neurite processes. These results suggest that Abeta-induced neurotoxicity may be mediated, at least in part, through the calpain-mediated generation of a toxic 17 kDa tau fragment. Collectively, these results provide insight into a novel mechanism by which tau could mediate Abeta-induced neurotoxicity.",
