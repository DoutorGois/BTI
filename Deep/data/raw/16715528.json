     "AB": "Mobile telephones and their base stations are an important source of ultra high frequency electromagnetic fields (UHF-EMFs; 800-1800 MHz) and their utilization is increasing all over the world. Epidemiological studies have suggested that low energy UHF-EMFs may have biological effects, such as changes in oxidative metabolism after exposure. Therefore, we have investigated the effect of acute UHF-EMF exposure on non-enzymatic antioxidant defense and lipid and protein oxidative damage in the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus. We have used malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl assays to assess lipid and protein oxidative damages, respectively. No changes in lipid and protein damage, and also in non-enzymatic defense were found in frontal cortex or hippocampus. These results suggest that acute UHF-EMF exposure is not able to produce detectable oxidative stress in rats from any age tested. However, more tests using a longer period of exposure and evaluating other tissues are necessary to ensure that there is no health risk associated with the use of mobile phones.",
