     "AB": "The modulation of brain LHRH receptors by sex steroids was assessed in the female rat hippocampus using in vitro autoradiography and iodinated [D-Ser (TBU)6, des-Gly-NH2(10)]LHRH ethylamide as the radioligand. As evaluated by optical densitometry, the density of hippocampal LHRH receptors was increased by castration. In castrated animals, estradiol administration produced a small decrease in receptor concentration, whereas the concomitant administration of progesterone and estradiol as well as the injection of dihydrotestosterone induced a marked decrease in receptor density. Progesterone administration did not produce any significant change in receptor concentration. These results indicate that brain LHRH receptors can be modulated by sex steroids. Interestingly, this modulation of hippocampal LHRH receptors is similar to that previously observed in pituitary gland.",
