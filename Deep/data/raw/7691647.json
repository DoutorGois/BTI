     "AB": "beta 1 Integrin-like immunoreactivity was localized in rat brain using a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit against rat liver beta 1 integrin. One-dimensional immunoblotting of whole rat brain membranes indicated that this antiserum recognized a single molecular species at 116,000 M(r), indicative of rat beta 1 integrins. Specific staining of beta 1 integrin-like immunoreactivity was found in the vascular structures of the brain, including microvessels, the ventricular ependymal cells, and pia mater. The pineal gland stained densely, and diffuse staining was present throughout the gray matter of the brain. This diffuse staining had a patterned appearance in certain structures, such as the apical dendritic field of CA1 in hippocampus, and occasional labeling of astrocytes, verified by labeling with GFAP on adjacent sections, was noted.",
