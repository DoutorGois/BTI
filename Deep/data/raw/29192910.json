     "AB": "Copper ions (Cu(2+)) play a critical role in biological processes and are directly involved in beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) aggregation, which is responsible for the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, combined determination of Cu(2+) and Abeta in one analytical system is of great significance to understand the exact nature of the AD event. This work presents a novel ratiometric electrochemical biosensor for the dual determination of Cu(2+) and Abeta1-42. This unique sensor is based on a 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA)-bi functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (ABTS-PDDA/CNTs) composite. The inclusion of ABTS not only enhanced the sensitivity, but it also acted as an inner reference molecule to improve detection accuracy. The specific recognition of Cu(2+) was realized by neurokinin B (NKB) coatings on the ABTS-PDDA/CNTs surface to form a [Cu(II)(NKB)2] complex with Cu(2+). The ABTS-PDDA/CNTs-NKB modified electrode also displayed an excellent electrochemical response toward the Abeta1-42 monomer, when a certain amount of the Abeta1-42 monomer was added to Cu(2+)-contained PBS buffer, which was due to the release of Cu(2+) from the [Cu(II)(NKB)2] complex through Abeta binding to Cu(2+). Meanwhile, our work showed that Cu(2+) bound Abeta1-42 was concentration-dependent. Consequently, the presented electrochemical approach was capable of quantifying two important biological species associated with AD by one single biosensor, with the detection limits of 0.04 muM for Cu(2+) and 0.5 ng mL(-1) for Abeta1-42, respectively. Finally, the ratiometric electrode was successfully applied for monitoring Cu(2+) and Abeta1-42 variations in plasma and hippocampus of normal and AD rats.",
