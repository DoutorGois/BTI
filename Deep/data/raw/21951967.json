     "AB": "Unregulated activation of microglia is a key risk factor contributes to neurodegenerative diseases and suppression of this phenomenon is considered as a potential therapeutic target. The compound isolated from sea horse Hippocampus kuda Bleeler; 1-(5-bromo-2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)ethanone [SE1] was characterized for its ability in suppressing LPS mediated activation of murine BV-2 cells. Despite the presence of various active molecular groups in the structure, SE1 has not well explored for its biological activities. The outcome of this study clearly indicated that SE1 inhibited the production of inflammatory mediators; nitric oxide, prostaglandin E(2) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, it inhibited the protein and gene expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6. The responsible signaling mechanisms leading to these inhibitions were identified as SE1 mediated blocking of phosphorylation of mitogen activate protein kinase (MAPK) molecules; C-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 and p50 subunits. These results suggest that SE1 has the potential to be further developed as therapeutic against neuro-inflammation.",
