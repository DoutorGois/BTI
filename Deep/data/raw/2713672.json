     "AB": "Commissural neurons in the dentate hilus and in the deep dentate granule cell layer were recorded intracellularly in vivo, in conjunction with combined injection of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) at sites of electrical stimulation. Two hilar neurons responded with short latency antidromic spikes to stimulation of the contralateral dentate infrapyramidal molecular layer, but did not show any synaptic potentials, suggesting that these neurons do not receive commissural hilar input, either directly or indirectly, from the stimulating sites. On the other hand, 3 dentate-hilar border neurons responded to the contralateral hilar stimulation with antidromic spikes, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), orthodromic spikes, and inhibitory PSPs (IPSPs), suggesting a rich synaptic interaction both commissurally and locally in this region. No direct commissural inhibition was observed in any of the cells. PHA-L injection at the stimulation site indicated that commissural hilar axon terminals project to a limited region of the contralateral molecular layer in a lamellar fashion, and have only a sparse distribution in the contralateral hilus. The results indicate that rapidly conducting commissural neurons in the dentate gyrus are themselves inhibited in an indirect manner by commissural fibers.",
