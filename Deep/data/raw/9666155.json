     "AB": "5-HT-moduline is a cerebral tetrapeptide [Leu-Ser-Ala-Leu] that was recently isolated from bovine brain tissue and shown to interact specifically with 5-HT1B receptors, particularly in rodents. The pharmacological properties of 5-HT1B receptors in rodents are different from those in other species. In order to better understand the role of this peptide in non-rodent species, we determined the distribution of 5-HT-moduline binding sites in guinea-pig brain using both the film autoradiography and digital autoradiography with a newly developed high resolution beta-imaging techniques. We found that 5-HT-moduline binding sites were expressed in various brain regions. Quantitative analysis showed that densities of binding sites were similar to those observed previously in rat brain. Regions with the highest labelling included cortex, septum, hippocampus and some regions of basal ganglia. Our results extend previous data and show that 5-HT-moduline interacts with the two forms of 5-HT1B receptors that are distinct pharmacologically. By this interaction, 5-HT-moduline may play an important role in regulating the functional activity of 5-HT1B receptors, thereby contributes to the pathophysiology of serotonergic transmission.",
