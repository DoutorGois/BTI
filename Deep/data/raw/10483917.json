     "AB": "Numerous studies have demonstrated that in the rodent, the septum is a critical site for the generation of hippocampla rhythmical field activity (theta, RSA). The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of the medial septal area in theta generation in the cat. Results indicate that (1) the microinfusion of the local anesthetic procaine into the medial septal region temporarily suppressed spontaneous as well as sensory and electrically induced hippocampal theta; (2) the suppression lasted 15 min and then amplitude and power of the hippocampal theta showed a progressive increase reaching preprocaine levels 60 min from the infusion onset. Theta frequency, in contrast, did not differ from control levels. The results provide evidence for the medial septal mediation of the hippocampal theta in the cat. This region is responsible for controlling theta amplitude but not its frequency. The present data supported the earlier results obtained in the rat and determined that the medial septal region plays a critical role in the generation of the hippocampal theta activity in cat.",
