     "AB": "P77PMC rat is a breed of rat with congenital audiogenic seizure(AS). AS attacks were suppressed by cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 50 micrograms/kg, but not at 25 micrograms/kg. Radioimmunoassay study showed that the CCK-8 immunoreactivity (IR) in the cerebrocortex and hippocampus is much lower in P77PMC rats than that of Wistar rats. The results suggest that a low cerebral content of CCK-8 may account for the high susceptibility of audiogenic seizure in P77PMC rats.",
