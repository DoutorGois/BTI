     "AB": "A survey is given of the synaptic connections of identified neurons in the rat fascia dentata based on our own Golgi/electron microscopic and light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical findings as well as on results obtained from the literature. The report largely deals with the dominating cell type in the region, the dentate granule cell. Of the various types of hilar cells, the GABAergic neurons, particularly the inhibitory basket cells, are taken into account. Differences in fine structure between granule cells and basket cells as well as mutual synaptic connections between these two types of dentate neurons are elaborated. This survey may provide a basis for further neurophysiological and pharmacological studies on these cells.",
