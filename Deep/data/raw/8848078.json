     "AB": "The effects of electrical stimulation of the medial septal area (MS-DB) for the purpose of distinguishing and assessing the cholinergic component of the septohippocampal input were investigated in awake rabbits in chronic experiments. Initial inhibitory effects of a standard duration of 40-140 msec (54%) predominated in the intact rabbits. In animals with chronic basal undercutting of the MS-DB, initial inhibitory reactions predominated absolutely (90%). An increase in the level of endogenous acetylcholine by administration of eserine led to a partial or complete suppression of all effects of stimulation in 78% of the hippocampal neurons of the intact rabbits against the background of intensification of the theta modulation of the activity of hippocampal neurons. Scopolamine removed theta modulation and restored the reactivity of neurons to stimulation of the MS-DB. These influences of cholinergic substances were maintained in the animals with basal undercutting of the MS-DB. It is inferred that the general initial influence of septal input on neurons of the hippocampus is expressed in the suppression of their activity (\"reset\"), which depends on the noncholinergic (GABAergic) component of the septohippocampal connections. The cholinergic component limits the effectiveness of both extraseptal (brainstem) and primary inhibitory septal influences on hippocampal neurons.",
