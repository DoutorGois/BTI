     "AB": "Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) often results in clinical neurodevelopmental disorders. To clarify the influence of uteroplacental insufficiency on central nervous system development, we have created a model of IUGR in rats using maternal administration of synthetic thromboxane A(2). We investigated expression patterns of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and reelin in this model by semiquantitative competitive polymerase chain reactions. On postnatal day 2, NCAM expression was decreased in rat cerebral cortex, and reelin expression was decreased in hippocampus from levels in controls without maternal thromboxane exposure. No significant differences in NCAM expression were seen in hippocampus, nor did reelin expression differ in cerebral cortex between control and IUGR groups. We also examined expression of two neurotrophic factors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). In cerebral cortex the IUGR group showed less BDNF and NT-3 expression than controls. Delay of neuronal migration and histological changes observed in our IUGR rats may be related to altered expression of these molecules.",
