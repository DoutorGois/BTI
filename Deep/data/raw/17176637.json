     "AB": "ST8Sia IV (polysialyltransferase IV gene) encodes a key enzyme that is required for polysialic acid synthesis. Polysialic acid is a component of the neural cell adhesion molecule and is necessary for synaptic plasticity of neural cells. We characterized 5.3 kb of pig ST8Sia IV cDNA and determined its expression profile in different organs. In hippocampus, ST8Sia IV mRNA levels were increased approximately 4.5-fold in piglets with sialic acid as a milk supplement, which suggested that exogenous sialic acid is a conditionally essential nutrient for early brain development. Extensive analyses were also performed among its orthologs from human, mouse, rat, chicken, frog and zebrafish. Our results supported that the piglet is a better animal model than other nonprimate species in the studies of ST8Sia IV related metabolism and nutrition in human infants. This pig cDNA provides a basis for uncovering the roles of ST8Sia IV during piglet development and maturation.",
