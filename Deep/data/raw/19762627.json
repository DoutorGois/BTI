     "AB": "Zhang et al. (Research Articles, 13 March 2009, p. 1448) reported that synaptic vesicles usually release neurotransmitter through a kiss-and-run mechanism occurring within 1 second but that full collapse of the vesicles becomes more prevalent with repeated stimuli. We report that the kinetics of vesicle retrieval do not change during a stimulus train, with endocytosis occurring in 10 to 15 seconds.",
