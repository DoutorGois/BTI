     "AB": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta)25-35 is able to cause memory impairment and neurodegenerative events. Recent evidence has shown that the injection of Abeta25-35 into the temporal cortex (TCx) of rats increases the inflammatory response; however, it is unclear how the inflammatory process could be involved in the progression of Abeta25-35 toxicity. In this study we investigated the role of inflammation in the neuronal damage and spatial memory impairment generated by Abeta25-35 in rat TCx using immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and a behavioral test in the radial maze. Our findings show that Abeta25-35 -injection into the TCx induced a reactive gliosis (GFAP and CD11b-reactivity) and an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-alpha) in the TCx and the hippocampus at 5, 15, and 30 days after injection. Thirty days after Abeta25-35 injection, we observed that the inflammatory reaction probably contributed to increase the immunoreactivity of inducible nitric oxide synthase and nitrite levels, as well as to the loss of neurons in TCx and hippocampus. Behavioral performance showed that the neurodegeneration evoked by Abeta25-35 delayed acquisition of learning and impaired spatial memory, because the Abeta25-35-treated animals showed a greater number of errors during the task than the control group. Previous administration of an interleukin receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) (10 and 20 mug/muL, into TCx), an anti-inflammatory agent, suppressed the Abeta25-35-induced inflammatory response and neurodegeneration, as well as memory dysfunction. This study suggests that the chronic inflammatory reaction could contribute to the progression of Abeta25-35 toxicity and cause cognitive impairment.",
