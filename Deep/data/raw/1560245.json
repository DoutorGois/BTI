     "AB": "An excess release of excitatory amino acids (EAA) is an important factor for postischemic brain damage. In the present communication, we demonstrate that cultured hippocampal cells release EAA after hypoxic-hypoglycemic treatment. The amounts of EAA released from astrocytes were appreciably above those released from neurons. Furthermore, the amount of aspartate released from astrocytes was comparable to that of glutamate, although the endogenous content of aspartate was one-fifth that of glutamate. The endogenous content of aspartate in astrocytes increased even after hypoxic-hypoglycemic treatment. These results suggests that ischemic neuronal death is due, at least in part, to the excitotoxicity of aspartate and glutamate derived from surrounding astrocytes.",
