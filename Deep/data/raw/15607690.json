     "AB": "Based on computational models of the hippocampus, it has been suggested that a possible mechanism for memory retrieval is pattern completion, wherein an autoassociative network recalls previous patterns of activity given noisy or degraded cues. However, there are few behavioral data examining pattern completion per se in the hippocampus. Here, we present a study in which rats were tested on a spatial location retrieval paradigm, each trial of which consisted of a sample and choice phase. During the sample phase, rats were trained to displace an object in one of 15 possible locations to retrieve a food reward and return to the start-box on a cheeseboard maze. The object was then removed and the same location was re-baited for the choice phase. The rats' accuracy in returning to the correct location was recorded. On test trials, visual extramaze cues, vestibular cues, or both were manipulated to assess pattern completion in normal rats. Subjects were then randomly assigned to receive a cortical control, a sham, or a dorsal and ventral hippocampal lesion and were retested on the task. Control and unoperated rats were able to perform the task when visual extramaze or vestibular cues were reliable, but not when they were manipulated. Rats with hippocampal lesions were impaired in the baseline condition, as well as during all manipulations. These results support the hypothesis that the hippocampus supports the retrieval of a spatial location, possibly through a process of pattern completion.",
