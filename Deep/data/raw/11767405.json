     "AB": "The effect of oral administration of Mangifera indica L. extract (QF808) on ischemia-reperfusion-induced neuronal death in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 sector was examined. Oral administration of QF808 for 7 days dose-dependently protected against neuronal cell death following transient ischaemia and reperfusion as assessed by histopathology. In addition, locomotor activity assessment prior to ischaemia and 7 days after correlated well with the histological results. To evaluate redox alterations by reactive oxygen species, total sulfhydryl, non-protein sulfhydryl groups (NPSH), malondialdehyde + 4-hydroxyalkenals and total nitrogen oxide levels were assayed in hippocampus and cortex homogenates. QF808 treatment attenuated NPSH loss, nitrogen oxide levels and lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus. These results suggest that orally administered QF808 is absorbed across the blood-brain barrier and attenuates neuronal death of the hippocampal CA1 area after ischaemia-reperfusion. These protective effects are most likely due to the antioxidant activity of QF808.",
