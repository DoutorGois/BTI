     "AB": "1. We developed a new kind of food search test that can measure murine nocturnal memory without handling hard work for setting up. 2. This apparatus has four food stations, but only one station had accessible food at any time. The one station with accessible food was changed at 4-h intervals. 3. We compared the performance of transient forebrain global Ischemic mice, which are a hippocampal lesion model, with the performance of control C57BL/6J mice. 4. The correct visit ratio, i.e., the ratio of the number of visits to the correct food station to the number of visits to all stations, gradually increased in the control mice, but did not change in the Ischemic mice. 5. This new system was demonstrated to be an additional and useful tool for studying memory-related performance in mice.",
