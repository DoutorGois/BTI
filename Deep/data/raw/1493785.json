     "AB": "Bipolar depth electrodes were implanted stereotaxically in the thalamus, hippocampus and midbrain reticular formation of cats. Cortical screw electrodes were placed over the bilateral sensorimotor cortex. A guide cannula with an inner injection cannula was inserted unilaterally into the posterolateral ventral nuclei (VPL) of the thalamus. Eight days after the procedures, kainic acid (2.0 micrograms) was injected unilaterally into the VPL via the injection cannula in freely moving animals and electro-clinical observations were made. About 1 h after the kainic acid injection, multiple spikes were observed in the VPL (injection site), which propagated to the subcortical structures. These seizures finally propagated bilaterally to the cortex about 2 h after the injection. About 3-4 h after the injection, small spike and wave complexes repeatedly appeared for a short period of time in cortical leads and cats exhibited behavioral arrest with unresponsiveness during the seizures. About 24 h after the injection, generalized small spike and wave complexes were observed intermittently in cortical and subcortical structures. They persisted for 4-5 s and were associated with behavioral arrest and staring. The results demonstrate that a unilateral microinjection of kainic acid into VPL induced petit mal-like seizure, and suggest that VPL plays an important role in the generation or transfer of spike and wave complexes.",
