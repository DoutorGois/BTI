     "AB": "The goal of the present work was to study composition and spatial-temporal distribution of cells containing various proteins of intermediate filaments (nestin, vimentin, GFAP) in various brain parts at the early postnatal period of rat ontogenesis. By using methods of immunochemical determination of proteins of intermediate filaments it has been established that at they early period of ontogenesis, in the course of maturation of the nervous tissue, in cells of cortex, hippocampus, and subventricular area there occurs a change ofimmunochemical profile of intermediate filaments: the nestin+/vimentin+/GFAP- -cells become the nestin-/vimentin-/GFAP- ones.",
