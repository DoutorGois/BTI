     "AB": "The functional consequences of the betaAPP transgene with the Swedish mutation in mice were assessed in tests of exploratory activity and motor coordination. The betaAPP(695)SWE (Tg2576) transgenic mice are characterized by Abeta plaque formation in the neocortex and hippocampus. By comparison to non-transgenic mice controlled for age and gender, 17-month-old betaAPP(695)SWE transgenic mice displayed impaired spontaneous alternation, increased activity levels in the peripheral part of the open-field, and reduced anxiety in the elevated plus-maze. These results are similar to the loss of inhibitory control observed in some patients with Alzheimer's disease. These measures may be added to cognitive dysfunctions as testing ground for Abeta vaccination and other attempts at experimental therapies.",
