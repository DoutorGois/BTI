     "AB": "This study examines the relationship between the concentration of extracellular glutamate released during 30 min of forebrain ischemia, and the subsequent development of ischemic neural necrosis, in the presence of three agents which act at distinct sites on the glutamatergic synapse: a presynaptic inhibitor of glutamate release (5-(2,3,5-trichlorophenyl)-2,4-diamino-pyramidine ethane sulphonate (BW1003C87)); a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist (cis-4-phosphonomethyl-2-piperidine carboxylic acid (CGS19755)); and a competitive AMPA receptor antagonist (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX)). Pretreatment with either BW1003C87 or NBQX markedly attenuated the peak concentration of extracellular glutamate and offered protection from post-ischemic neuronal necrosis in the CA1 hippocampus. In contrast, pretreatment with CGS19755 had no effect on extracellular glutamate release and did not protect CA1 hippocampal neurons from ischemic injury.",
