     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. This disease is a progressive and irreversible brain disorder accompanied with severe learning and memory impairment. This study investigated whether treatment with standardized Lycii Fructus Extract (LFE) would improve the cognitive function and the pathological features of AD in 3xTg-AD mice. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Lycii Fructus is a fruit of Lycium chinense Miller and widely distributed in East Asia and has been used traditionally for anti-aging purposes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cognitive function of 3xTg-AD mice was assessed using the Morris water maze test. The levels of the amyloid beta deposits and NeuN in the hippocampus were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. Brain neurotrophic derived factor (BDNF) and tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) expressions were examined by western blot analysis. RESULTS: LFE treatment significantly ameliorated learning and memory deficits in AD mice, as shown by increased time spent in the target zone during probe tests. In addition, LFE significantly decreased Abeta deposits, increased NeuN-positive cells, and upregulated the expression of BDNF and TrkB in the 3xTg AD mice. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that LFE treatment can be a useful strategy for treating memory impairment induced by several neurodegenerative diseases.",
