     "AB": "Adverse antenatal maternal environments during pregnancy influence fetal development that consequently increases risks of mental health problems including psychiatric disorders in offspring. Therefore, behavioral and brain alterations caused by adverse prenatal environmental conditions are generally considered as deficits. In this article, we propose a novel hypothesis, along with summarizing a body of literatures supporting it, that fetal neurodevelopmental alterations, particularly synaptic network changes occurring in the prefrontal cortex, associated with adverse prenatal environmental conditions may be adaptation to cope with expected severe postnatal environments, and therefore, psychiatric disorders may be able to be understood as adaptive strategies against severe environmental conditions through evolution. It is hoped that the hypothesis presented in this article stimulates and opens a new venue on research toward understanding of biological mechanisms and therapeutic treatments of psychiatric disorders.",
