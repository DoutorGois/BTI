     "AB": "The localization of adenosine A1-receptors in the dentate gyrus was investigated using discrete lesioning techniques and autoradiographic procedures. In rats with unilateral knife-cut lesions to the perforant-path (the major input to the dentate gyrus), A1-receptor binding in the dentate gyrus was greatly reduced on the lesioned side. Unilateral infusion of 0.25 microliter colchicine into the dentate gyrus which partially destroyed granule cells did not affect A1-adenosine binding. These results suggest that adenosine A1-receptors are localized on the terminals of the perforant path.",
