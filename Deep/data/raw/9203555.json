     "AB": "The effects of estradiol and 17alpha-dihydroequilenin on the apical dendrite spine density of pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of rat hippocampus were compared. 17alpha-Dihydroequilenin was as effective as estradiol in increasing spine densities relative to controls. 17alpha-Dihydroequilenin is not uterotrophic like estradiol but does have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, suggesting that it may be an effective single-agent hormone replacement therapy to treat menopausal symptoms and reduce chronic disease risk in menopausal women.",
