     "AB": "A multi-echo imaging sequence suitable for high-resolution and accurate in vivo transverse relaxation time (T2) mapping has been implemented. The sequence was tested on phantoms and was used to measure T2 values in vivo in the rat brain, muscle, and fat at 7 T. Brain T2 maps are shown and regional variations in brain T2 are reported (41.8 ms in cortex, 47.9 ms in hippocampus). Results are compared to literature values obtained at lower field in vivo as well as high-field T2 measurements on excised rat tissues. The reported T2 values are generally smaller compared to lower-field-strength literature values. A discussion of the possible causes of these field effects on T2 is included (dipolar interaction, fast chemical exchange, and diffusion in susceptibility gradients).",
