     "PG": "89-94",
     "AB": "Seizures are relatively common in the first weeks of life and can have lasting effects on brain development due to glutamate excitotoxicity. The excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) is responsible for the majority of glutamate uptake in the brain and mice with this gene deleted die from seizures. Therefore, we reasoned that developmental changes in the expression of EAAT2 might correlate with the period of increased susceptibility to seizures in humans, reflecting a changing vulnerability to excitotoxic insults. Expression levels of eight splice forms of EAAT2 were measured using quantitative RT-PCR from human prefrontal cortex and hippocampus at 1-2 months, 1-2 years, 8 years, 15-16 years, and 18-22 years of age. There was a significant increase in expression of most isoforms between 1-2 months and 1-2 years with isoform-specific patterns after that period. The increase in EAAT2 expression during the first 2 years of life corresponds to a period of maximal synapse formation and other changes in the glutamatergic system such as increased NMDA receptor expression. Moreover, the low expression of EAAT2 in the first months of life corresponds to the period of maximum susceptibility to seizures.",
