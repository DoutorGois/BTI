     "AB": "The formation of spatial memory appears to be dependent upon an intact hippocampus capable of the specific biochemical changes associated with synaptic remodeling. Hippocampal damage results in the disruption of synaptic remodeling and the acquisition of spatial memory tasks. Ethanol also disrupts normal hippocampal functioning and spatial memory. The present investigation established a dose-response relationship between ethanol treatment and impairment of spatial memory as measured using the circular water maze task. Intraperitoneal ethanol doses of 1.5 and 2 g/kg significantly increased the latency and distance swam to find the submerged pedestal as compared with a 1 g/kg dose, and 0.15 M NaCl vehicle control treatments. On days 2, 4, and 6 of acquisition animals were sacrificed and brain tissues were retained from the hippocampus, prefrontal neocortex, and cerebellum for measurement of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The results indicated that ethanol treatment interfered with MMP-9, but not MMP-2, activity in the hippocampus, and to a lesser degree in the prefrontal cortex. No changes in the cerebellum were measured. Elevations in MMP activity appear to be a prerequisite to reconfiguration of extracellular matrix cell adhesion molecules thought to be important in the process of synaptic plasticity, which in turn appears to be necessary for memory consolidation. Thus, ethanol-induced impairment in the acquisition of spatial memory tasks may, in part, be due to disruption of brain MMP activity.",
