     "AB": "Osthole, an effective monomer in Chinese medicinal herbs, can cross the blood-brain barrier and protect against brain injury, with few toxic effects. In this study, a rat model of Alzheimer's disease was established after intracerebroventricular injection of beta-amyloid peptide (25-35). Subsequently, the rats were intraperitoneally treated with osthole (12.5 or 25.0 mg/kg) for 14 successive days. Results showed that osthole treatment significantly improved cognitive impairment and protected hippocampal neurons of Alzheimer's disease rats. Also, osthole treatment alleviated suppressed long-term potentiation in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease rats. In these osthole-treated Alzheimer's disease rats, the level of glutamate decreased, but there was no significant change in gamma-amino-butyric acid. These experimental findings suggest that osthole can improve learning and memory impairment, and increase synaptic plasticity in Alzheimer's disease rats. These effects of osthole may be because of its regulation of central glutamate and gamma-amino-butyric acid levels.",
