     "AB": "It is accepted that amyloid beta-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) have a prominent role in triggering the early cognitive deficits that constitute Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is still no effective treatment for preventing or reversing the progression of the disease. Targeting alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor trafficking and its regulation is a new strategy for AD early treatment. Here we investigate the effect and mechanism of L-Stepholidine (L-SPD), which elicits dopamine D1-type receptor agonistic activity, while acting as D2-type receptor antagonist on cognition and synaptic plasticity in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) double-transgenic (APP/PS1) mice, and hippocampal cultures or slices treated with ADDLs. L-SPD could improve the hippocampus-dependent memory, surface expression of glutamate receptor A (GluA1)-containing AMPA receptors and spine density in hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. L-SPD not only rescued decreased phosphorylation and surface expression of GluA1 in hippocampal cultures but also protected the long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices induced by ADDLs. Protein kinase A (PKA) agonist Sp-cAMPS or D1-type receptor agonist SKF81297 had similar effects, whereas PKA antagonist Rp-cAMPS or D1-type receptor antagonist SCH23390 abolished the effect of L-SPD on GluA1 trafficking. This was mediated mainly by PKA, which could phosphorylate serine residue at 845 of the GluA1. L-SPD may be explored as a potential therapeutic drug for AD through a mechanism that improves AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity via activating D1/PKA signaling pathway.",
