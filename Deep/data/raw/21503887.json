     "AB": "The present study examined the effect of indomethacin (IM), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, on learning and memory functions. IM activated Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. IM (100 microM) significantly increased the rate of spontaneous AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents elicited from CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slices, without affecting the amplitude, and enhanced extracellular high K(+) (20 mM)-induced glutamate release from rat hippocampal slices, indicating that IM stimulates presynaptic glutamate release. Those IM effects were clearly inhibited by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93. IM persistently facilitated synaptic transmission monitored from the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices in a concentration (1-100 microM)-dependent manner that was also abolished by KN-93. In the water maze test, IM (1 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced spatial learning and memory ability for normal rats, and ameliorated scopolamine-induced spatial learning and memory impairment or age-related spatial learning and memory deterioration for senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 mice. In the test to learn 15 numbers consisting of three patterns of five digit number for healthy human subjects, oral intake with IM (25 mg/kg) significantly raised the scores of correct number arrangements that subjects memorized 5 min and 3 days after the test. The results of the present study indicate that IM could enhance learning and memory potential by facilitating hippocampal synaptic transmission as a result from stimulating presynaptic glutamate release under the control of CaMKII.",
