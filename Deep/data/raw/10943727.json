     "AB": "In a rat model of traumatic brain injury cell activation was characterized immunohistochemically from 2 h up to 2 weeks. Reactive astrocytosis became apparent perivascularly and in the grey matter within 4h after trauma. Increased OX42 immunoreactivity indicated microglial activation in cortex and hippocampus as early as 4 h, whereas up-regulation of MHC class II (OX6) was evident in white matter tracts at 24 h. Although macrophage (ED1) numbers increased in the meninges and perivascularly, brain infiltration appeared marginal. Accumulation of lymphocytes and granulocytes was not observed. Our results show that traumatic axonal injury induces a rapid and sustained glial activation in the absence of leukocyte infiltration. Thus, cell activation following diffuse trauma strongly differs from that found after focal brain damage, awaiting further functional characterization.",
