     "AB": "The synthesis of huperzine-E2020 combined compound (3) has been accomplished and the activities of 3 and the intermediates 12 and 13 to inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase have been measured. Conformation analyses and molecular docking studies of E2020 and the eight isomers of 12 were carried out. The results indicated that binding energies of all isomers of 12 with AChE was much lower than E2020 except for isomer RRZ, which might be the reason that the activity of 12 was lower than that of E2020. Interaction pattern of RRZ in AChE was also studied. Both binding energy and interaction pattern shows that the biological activity of RRZ might be higher than that of E2020.",
