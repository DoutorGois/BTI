     "AB": "The facial nerve is the third most frequent location of intracranial schwannomas, with facial paresis the most common sign.(1,2) A 77-year-old woman presented with amnesia; the Mini-Mental State Examination score was 26, with normal cranial nerve function. A giant multicystic VII nerve schwannoma was identified in the left middle fossa, with components of the tumor in the temporal bone facial canal, geniculate ganglion, and internal auditory canal (figure). Compression of the hippocampus may have accounted for the clinical presentation. The middle fossa component of the tumor was resected for mass effect relief, with iatrogenic facial palsy.",
