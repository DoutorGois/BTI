     "AB": "We used monoclonal antibodies to examine the immunohistochemical distribution of the three major Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes (I, II, and III) in ischemic gerbil hippocampus. Groups of four animals were sacrificed at 15 min, 4 h, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, and 7 days after a 10-min episode of global forebrain ischemia. In control animals, PKC-I immunoreactivity was greater in CA1 neurons than in CA3-4. Terminal-like staining was not evident. PKC-II immunoreactivity was observed in all CA fields and in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. PKC-III staining was present in the CA fields, the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the subiculum. Dentate granule cells and mossy fibers were not stained with any of the PKC antibodies. Fifteen minutes and 4 h after ischemia, PCK-I, -II and -III immunoreactivity were all increased in CA1 neurons and PKC-III immunoreactivity alone was visualized in granule cells and mossy fibers. Staining patterns returned to baseline one day after ischemia. PKC-II and -III terminal-like staining were preserved in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare for 3 days and 2 days after ischemia respectively and then disappeared. The altered patterns of PKC staining in the hippocampus may reflect activation and/or down-regulation of PKC isozymes. Ca(2+)-dependent PKC isozymes may, therefore, potentially play a role in the pathogenesis of delayed ischemic neuronal death.",
