     "AB": "It has been suggested that choline and/or phosphatidylcholine may be beneficial in improving the memory deficits associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease. The effects of long-term choline or phosphatidylcholine treatment on cholinergic receptors in the brain have been investigated. Mice were maintained on one of four diets from 50 days of age until sacrificed at 20-24 months. [3H]-QNB binding in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum was specific, saturable and of high affinity. Animals treated with a phosphatidylcholine-enriched diet displayed a down-regulation of muscarinic receptors in the cortex and hippocampus, reflected by a decrease in Bmax. There were no significant differences in the binding affinities among the treatment groups. Choline levels were unaffected by the various diets, however phosphatidylcholine treatment resulted in an increase in phosphatidylcholine in the cortex and somewhat in the hippocampus. This study indicates that choline and phosphatidylcholine have different effects after long-term dietary administration. Phosphatidylcholine treatment results in a down-regulation of muscarinic receptors in certain brain areas which appears to be related to an increase in phosphatidylcholine concentration. Any potentially beneficial effects derived from chronic phosphatidylcholine treatment must overcome the apparent down-regulation of muscarinic receptors which may occur.",
