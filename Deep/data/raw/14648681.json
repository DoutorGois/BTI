     "AB": "We investigated the time and space relationship between growth of hippocampal efferents, particularly those forming the hippocampal commissure, and expression of extracellular matrix components related to radial glial cells. Developing hamster brains from embryonic day (E) 13 to postnatal day (P) 7 had 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) crystals implanted into the hippocampus or were processed for fluorescent immunohistochemistry against chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycans and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The first, pioneer fibers from the hippocampus were seen crossing the midline at E15 and arriving at the contralateral hippocampus 24-48 hours later (P1), followed closely by a thick front of growing fibers. Before E15, CS expression was preceded by septal fusion and was concomitant with formation of the commissural tract. On E15, CS expression formed a U-shaped border below the fimbria. From E15 to P3, CS became expressed between the hippocampal commissure and the third ventricle and at the caudal borders of the fornix columns. As the hippocampal commissure expanded, CS expression became gradually lighter to virtually disappear by P7. On E15 and P1, GFAP-positive radial glial cells were present caudal (but not rostral) to the commissure at the midline, partially overlapping CS expression. Similar cells were present dorsal to the fimbria, extending their processes perpendicularly over the growing axons. The data reveal that CS and radial glial cells form a tunnel surrounding the developing fimbria and a border at the midline caudal to the hippocampal commissure. It is suggested that these cellular and molecular borders play a role in guidance of hippocampal efferents.",
