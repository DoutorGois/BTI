     "AB": "The organophosphorus insecticides, including malathion, are used indiscriminately in large amounts, causing environmental pollution and risk to human health. Classically, this toxicity is attributed mainly to the accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh), due to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and consequently overstimulation of the nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. The present study investigated the effects of acute and chronic malathion administration in immobility time in the forced swimming test (FST), open-field test and AChE activity in neural tissue of rats. Malathion was administered intraperitoneally once a day for one day (acute) or for 28 days (chronic) (in both protocols malathion was administered at 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg). No significant effect was seen in immobility time in the FST after acute malathion treatment. The chronic malathion treatment induced an increase in the time of immobility in the FST. Both treatments do not interfere in locomotor activity evaluated in a novel environment. The inhibition of AChE activity was significant in the hippocampus (25, 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg), cortex (100 and 150 mg/kg) and striatum (150 mg/kg) after chronic treatment, but not significantly after acute treatment. These data suggest a possible interaction between increased immobility time in the FST and activation of cholinergic receptors by accumulated ACh subsequent to AChE inhibition.",
