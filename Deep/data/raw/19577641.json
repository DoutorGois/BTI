     "AB": "Antioxidant enzymes are considered to have beneficial effects against various diseases mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ischemia is characterized by both oxidative stress and changes in the antioxidant defense system. Catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) are major antioxidant enzymes by which cells counteract the deleterious effects of ROS. To investigate the protective effects of CAT, we constructed PEP-1-CAT cell-permeative expression vectors. When PEP-1-CAT fusion proteins were added to the culture medium of neuronal cells, they rapidly entered the cells and protected them against oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PEP-1-CAT prevented neuronal cell death in the hippocampus induced by transient forebrain ischemia. Moreover, we showed that the protective effect of PEP-1-CAT was observed in neuronal cells treated with PEP-1-SOD. Therefore, we suggest that transduced PEP-1-CAT and PEP-1-SOD fusion proteins could be useful as therapeutic agents for various human diseases related to oxidative stress, including stroke.",
