     "AB": "It is important to investigate the effect of anesthesia on blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals in an animal model. Many researchers have investigated the BOLD response to visual, sensory, and chemical stimuli in anesthetized rats. There are no reports, however, comparing the differences in the BOLD signal change between anesthetized and conscious rats when a visceral nutrient signal arises. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the differences in the BOLD signal changes after intragastric administration of l-glutamate (Glu) under three anesthesia conditions: conscious, alpha-chloralose-anesthetized, and isoflurane-anesthetized condition. Under the conscious and alpha-chloralose condition, we observed the significant BOLD signal increase in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), insular cortex (IC), hippocampus, and several hypothalamic regions including the lateral and ventromedial nucleus. In chloralose group, however, gut Glu stimulation induced BOLD signal increase in the prelimbic cortex and orbital cortex, which did not activate in conscious condition. Meanwhile, under isoflurane-anesthetized condition, we did not observe the BOLD signal increase in these areas. BOLD signal intensity in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), to which vagus nerve transmits the visceral information from the gastrointestinal tract, increased in all conditions. Importantly, under conscious condition, we observed increased BOLD signal intensity in several regions related to the metabolic state (i.e. hunger or satiety), such as the mPFC, ventromedial and lateral hypothalamus (LH). Our results suggest that alpha-chloralose and isoflurane anesthesia caused distinct effects on BOLD response to the gut l-Glu stimulation in several brain regions.",
