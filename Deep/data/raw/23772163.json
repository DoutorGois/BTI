     "AB": "Sustained stress can have numerous pathologic effects. There have been several animal models for chronic stress. We tried to identify the changes of pain threshold and hippocampus in a model of chronic stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were kept in a cage filled with 23 degrees C water to a height of 2.2 cm for 7 days. Nociceptive thresholds, expressed in grams, were measured with a Dynamic Plantar Aesthesiometer. Golgi staining was used to identify hippocampal changes. To demonstrate how long allodynia was lasting, behavioral test was repeated daily on another experiment. Compared to control group, chronic stress group showed bilateral mechanical hyper-responsiveness on days 5 (P = 0.047) and 7 (P = 0.032). In general, dendrite atrophic changes within hippocampus of chronic stress model were much more prominent in comparison with control. Compared to control, decreased spine number (P < 0.001) and spine length (P < 0.001) on Golgi staining were seen in the hippocampus of animals with chronic stress. Bilateral mechanical hyperresponsiveness was recovered on day 19 in animals with chronic stress. Chronic stress may bring about central sensitization and hippocampal changes in rats.",
