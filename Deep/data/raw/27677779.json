     "AB": "Since the discovery of place cells and other findings indicating strong involvement of the hippocampus in spatial information processing, there has been continued controversy about the extent to which the hippocampus also processes non-spatial aspects of experience. In recent years, many experiments studying the effects of hippocampal damage and characterizing hippocampal neural activity in animals and humans have revealed a clear and specific role of the hippocampus in the processing of non-spatial information. Here this evidence is reviewed in support of the notion that the hippocampus organizes the contents of memory in space, in time, and in networks of related memories.",
