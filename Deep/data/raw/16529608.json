     "AB": "PURPOSE: To assess the anticonvulsant activity of the novel antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam (LEV) in a model of self-sustaining limbic status epilepticus, and to measure the consequence of LEV treatment on the pattern of mitochondrial dysfunction known to occur after status epilepticus (SE). METHODS: The rat perforant pathway was stimulated for 2 h to induce self-sustaining status epilepticus (SSSE). Stimulated rats were assigned to one of three treatment groups, receiving intraperitoneal injections of saline, 200 mg/kg LEV, or 1,000 mg/kg LEV, 15 min into SSSE and at 3 times over the next 44-h period. All animals received diazepam after 3-h SSSE to terminate seizures. Forty-four hours later, the hippocampi were extracted and prepared for electrochemical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), to measure reduced glutathione levels, and for spectrophotometric assays to measure activities of mitochondrial enzymes (aconitase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, complex I, and complex II/III). These parameters were compared between treatment groups and with sham-operated rats. RESULTS: LEV administration did not terminate seizures or have any significant effect on spike frequency, although rats that received 1,000 mg/kg LEV did exhibit improved behavioral seizure parameters. Significant biochemical changes occurred in saline-treated stimulated rats compared with shams: with reductions in glutathione, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, aconitase, citrate synthase, and complex I activities. Complex II/III activities were unchanged throughout. Rats that received 1,000 mg/kg LEV had significantly improved biochemical parameters, in many instances, comparable to sham control levels. CONCLUSIONS: Despite continuing seizures, administration of LEV (1,000 mg/kg) protects against mitochondrial dysfunction, indicating that in addition to its antiepileptic actions, LEV may have neuroprotective effects.",
