     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between ornithine decarboxylase activity (ODC; a marker for perturbed cell development), the blood alcohol level, and alcohol-induced microencephaly in the developing rat brain after binge treatment with ethanol vapour. By manipulating ethanol flow we were able to adjust vapour concentrations (24-65 mg ethanol/l air) such that an acute exposure of ethanol vapour for 3 h resulted in a range of blood alcohol levels (2.3-5.5 mg/ml). Acute studies showed that ethanol dose-dependently inhibited rat hippocampal and cerebellar ODC activity at PND4-PND10. There was a significant correlation between the blood alcohol level and degree of inhibition at all ages tested. Chronic treatment from PND4 to PND9 caused a significant decrease in both brain to body weight ratio and in hippocampal and cerebellar ODC activities at PND10. These results indicate that ethanol-induced disruption in ODC could play a significant role in ethanol's teratogenic effects during early postnatal development.",
