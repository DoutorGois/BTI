     "AB": "We have cloned and characterized a novel gene from both human and mouse that encodes a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The gene is preferentially expressed in both brain and testis, and hence, termed BT-IgSF (brain- and testis-specific immunoglobulin superfamily). The predicted protein consists of V-type and C2-type immunoglobulin domains as well as a hydrophobic signal sequence, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain. Human BT-IgSF protein (431 amino acids) is 88% identical to the mouse protein (428 amino acids) and both show significant homology to coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) and endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM). We examined the expression of BT-IgSF with various cultured cells and found that the gene was expressed in both neurons and glial cells in vitro. Furthermore, the expression was preferentially detected in pyramidal cell layers of the dentate gyrus and hippocampus and in commissure fibers of the corpus callosum, in brain tissue sections examined. These findings suggest that BT-IgSF plays a role in the development or function of the central nervous system.",
