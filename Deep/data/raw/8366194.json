     "AB": "Sulfated glycoprotein-2 (SGP-2) gene expression seems to be constitutively expressed in a variety of tissues and organs, although levels of expression vary widely from one tissue to the other. SGP-2, also known as clusterin, has been reported to be expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). Some possible roles for brain SGP-2 have been postulated. In order to provide a substrate for a better understanding of the functions of this glycoprotein in the CNS, we investigated the detailed anatomical and cellular distribution of SGP-2 mRNA in the adult rat brain as well as the variation in its cellular expression after excitotoxin lesion. Transcripts for SGP-2 were found to be distributed throughout the rat CNS, although regional differences in their prevalence were readily observed. The ependymal lining of the ventricles showed the highest level of expression followed by various gray matter areas, some of which contained very intensively labeled cells. These cells were mostly found among several hypothalamic and brainstem nuclei, the habenular complex, as well as in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, which displayed striking hybridization signals over motoneurons. Occasional cells expressing high levels of SGP-2 transcripts were found in fiber tracts. Highly SGP-2 mRNA-positive resting glial cells were mainly located near the glial limitans and blood vessels. Two areas of relatively low constitutive SGP-2 mRNA expression are shown to produce strong hybridization signals 10 days after the local administration of the excitotoxin kainic acid. This overexpression of SGP-2 transcripts appears to involve GFAP-positive cells. Taken together, these results indicate that in the intact adult rat CNS, various cell populations, including neurons, constitutively express SGP-2 transcripts, whereas in the injured brain, reactive astrocytes become the major producers.",
