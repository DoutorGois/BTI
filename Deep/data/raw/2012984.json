     "AB": "Global ischemia was produced in adult rats by combining bilateral carotid artery occlusions with systemic hypotension for 5 or 10 minutes. Induction of the 72 kD heat shock protein (HSP72) in the hippocampus was examined immunocytochemically 18-24 hours later. Several patterns of HSP72-like immunoreactivity (HSP72LI) were observed. Five minutes of ischemia induced HSP72 in isolated columns of CA1a pyramidal neurons, or throughout CA1 pyramidal neurons and dentate hilar neurons. Ten minutes of ischemia induced marked HSP72LI in CA3 pyramidal neurons, moderate HSP72LI in dentate granule cells, and minimal HSP72LI in CA1 pyramidal, dentate hilar neurons, and hippocampal glia. Two hippocampi subjected to 10 minutes of ischemia exhibited marked HSP72LI in capillary endothelial cells but no neuronal or glial HSP72LI. It is proposed that (a) the induction of HSP72 in hippocampal sectors correlates with their vulnerability to global ischemia (CA1 greater than hilus greater than CA3 greater than dentate gyrus); (b) the induction of HSP72 in hippocampal cells correlates with their vulnerability to global ischemia in that mild ischemia induced HSP72 only in neurons, moderate ischemia in neurons and glia, and severe ischemia only in capillary endothelial cells; (c) the failure to induce HSP72 in hippocampal neurons in 2 cases of 10 min ischemia may be related to severe injury causing disruption of protein synthesis in these cells.",
