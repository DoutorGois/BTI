     "AB": "Substance P (SP) has memory-promoting, reinforcing and anxiolytic-like effects when applied systemically or centrally. Such effects may be mediated by the neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor, since SP preferentially binds to this receptor. We measured the effects of a selective non-peptide NK-1 receptor antagonist, SR140333 (1, 3 and 9 mg/kg i.p.) on ACh levels in frontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus by microdialysis and HPLC. Levels of ACh in the hippocampus increased dose-dependently immediately after treatment. The same doses of SR140333 given post-trial had minor facilitative effects on inhibitory avoidance learning and open-field habituation, but did not have reinforcing effects in a conditioned place preference (CPP) task. The selective action of NK-1 receptor antagonism on hippocampal ACh may be related to its positive influence on learning.",
