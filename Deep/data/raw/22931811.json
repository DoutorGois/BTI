     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of methionine and choline on the expression levels of CaMKII and CREB mRNA and proteins in hippocampus of rats exposed to lead. METHODS: Male SD rats were divided into five groups. (1) control group, (2) group exposed to lead+2 by drinking water with 0.40 g/L lead acetate, (3) group exposed to methionine and choline (1:1, 400 mg/kg), (4) group exposed to 0.40 g/L lead acetate plus methionine and choline (1:1, 100 mg/kg), (5) group exposed to 0.40 g/L lead acetate plus methionine and choline (1:1, 400 mg/kg). In 8 weeks after exposure, all rats were killed. Then CREB mRNA and CaMK II mRNA expression levels in hippocampus were detected by real-time PCR, CREB and CaMK II protein expression levels in hippocampus were measured by western blot assay. RESULTS: The expression levels (0.743 +/- 0.185 and 0.729 +/- 0.199) of CaMKII mRNA and CREB mRNA in the hippocampus of lead group were significantly lower than those (0.950 +/- 0.238 and 0.901 +/- 0.232) of control group (P < 0.05), also the expression levels (0.271 +/- 0.045 and 0.212 +/- 0.058) of CREB protein and pCREB protein in the hippocampus of lead group were significantly lower than those (0.319 +/- 0.058 and 0.506 +/- 0.125) of control group (P < 0.05). The expression levels (1.014 +/- 0.210 and 1.126 +/- 0.379) of CaMKII mRNA and the expression levels (1.029 +/- 0.335 and 0.932 +/- 0.251) of CREB mRNA in the hippocampus of 2 groups exposed to lead acetate plus methionine and choline were significantly higher than those of lead group (P < 0.05). The expression levels (0.407 +/- 0.951 and 0.563 +/- 0.178) of CREB protein and pCREB protein in the hippocampus of group exposed to lead acetate plus 400 mg/kg methionine and choline were significantly higher than those of lead group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Methionine and choline could decrease the inhibition effects of lead on the expression of CaMKII and CREB mRNA or CREB and pCREB proteins in the hippocampus of rats.",
