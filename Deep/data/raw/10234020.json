     "AB": "DSD-1-PG is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) expressed by glial cells that can promote neurite outgrowth from rat embryonic mesencephalic (E14) and hippocampal (E18) neurons, an activity that is associated with the CS glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Further characterization of DSD-1-PG has included sequencing of peptides from the core protein and the cloning of the corresponding cDNA using polyclonal antisera against DSD-1-PG to screen phage expression libraries. On the basis of these studies we have identified DSD-1-PG as the mouse homolog of phosphacan, a neural rat CSPG. Monoclonal antibodies 3H1 and 3F8 against carbohydrate residues on rat phosphacan recognize these epitopes on DSD-1-PG. The epitopes of the antibodies, L2/HNK-1 and L5/Lewis-X, which have been implicated in functional interactions, are also found on DSD-1-PG. Although DSD-1-PG has previously been shown to promote neurite outgrowth, its upregulation after stab wounding of the CNS and its localization in regions that are considered boundaries to axonal extension suggested that it may also have inhibitory functions. Neonatal dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants grown on a rich supportive substrate (laminin) with and without DSD-1-PG were strikingly inhibited by the proteoglycan. The inhibitory effects of DSD-1-PG on the DRG explants were not relieved by removal of the CS GAGs, indicating that this activity is associated with the core glycoprotein. The neurite outgrowth from embryonic hippocampal neurons on laminin was not affected by the addition of DSD-1-PG. This indicates that DSD-1-PG/mouse phosphacan can have opposing effects on the process of neurite outgrowth dependent on neuronal lineage.",
