     "AB": "The cytochemical localization of nucleoside diphosphatase and thiamine pyrophosphatase occurs within the \"mature face\" of the Golgi apparatus and over the neurilemma in neurons of the cerebellum, the cerebral cortex and the brain stem. The hydrolytic reaction product of the brain enzyme differs from that of the liver in that it is not found in the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear envelope. Hydrolysis of IDP, UDP or GDP is not greater than that of ADP or CDP in brain homogenates, in contrast to that found in the liver. The NDPase activity of brain homogenates is optimal at pH 7.2, stimulated by heavy metals and inhibited by uranyl nitrate. Thick section cytochemistry suggests that the reaction product is restricted to a network of polygonally shaped compartments. NDPase activity on the neurilemma may reflect the role of this enzyme in the synthesis of glycoproteins involved in neuronal surface recognition.",
