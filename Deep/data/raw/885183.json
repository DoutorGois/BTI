     "AB": "A series of experiments was conducted in the urethane anaesthetised rat to determine the organisation of some hippocampal pathways in this species, using stimulating and recording microelectrodes to elicit and record pupulation spikes. It was found that the mossy fibres, alvear fibres and perforant path were clearly arranged in a lamellar fashion. Lamellar organisation could not be demonstrated for the afferents in the stratum radiatum which include the Schaffer collaterals. It was concluded that hippocampal organisation in this species essentially resembles that in the rabbit and cat.",
