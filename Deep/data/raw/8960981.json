     "AB": "Vimentin is expressed initially by nearly all neuronal precursors in vivo, and is replaced by neurofilaments shortly after the immature neurons become post-mitotic. Moreover, both vimentin and neurofilaments can be detected transiently within the same neurite, leaving open the possibility that vimentin may play a role in the early stages of neuritogenesis. In the present study, cultured hippocampal neurons, which transiently express vimentin in culture, were treated with sense- and antisense-oriented deoxyoligonucleotides encoding regions of the vimentin sequence that overlap the translation initiation codon. Antisense oligonucleotide treatment reduced vimentin-immunoreactivity to background levels. Moreover, while 90-100% of cultured hippocampal neurons elaborated neurites within the first 24 hr following plating, only 24-30% did so in the presence of vimentin antisense oligonucleotides. Inhibition of neurite outgrowth was reversible following removal of antisense oligonucleotide. These findings substantiate earlier studies in neuroblastoma cells, indicating a possible role for vimentin in the initiation of neurite outgrowth.",
