     "AB": "APG-2 belongs to the heat shock protein 110 family. Although kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures are known to elicit expression of inducible heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the brain, no investigation has been carried out on the APG-2 level after excitatory amino acid-induced seizures. By means of an immunoblot assay, we determined the levels of HSP70 and APG-2 in discrete brain structures of mice after a single intraperitoneal injection of KA or N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA). APG-2 level was significantly decreased in frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum three days after the administration of KA, while HSP70 level was increased in these regions following the administration. In any of these regions, APG-2 levels were returned to the control levels 10 days after the administration. However, no significant changes were observed in levels of both HSP70 and APG-2 in hypothalamus, midbrain, medulla-pons, and cerebellum of the mice. By contrast, NMDA administration did not significantly affect both levels in any of the regions examined. These findings indicate that the transient decrease in APG-2 expression is one of the intracellular events elicited by signals peculiar to KA, but not by those peculiar to NMDA, in telencephalon of murine brain.",
