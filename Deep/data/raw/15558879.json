     "AB": "In order to clarify the distribution and pathological changes of the amyloid beta protein precursor (betaAPP), 10 Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains and seven normal control brains were examined by immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization histochemistry. All betaAPP isoforms were distributed evenly in neuronal cell bodies and their axons and dendrites. The betaAPP-positive neuronal processes showed mesh-like networks. In AD brains, betaAPP-positive neurons and mesh-like networks were generally decreased in spite of some intensely labeled neurons. All betaAPP isoforms accumulated in neuronal processes, dystrophic neurites and senile plaques. In situ hybridization histochemistry confirmed that all isoforms of betaAPP were expressed in neurons in control brains. In AD brains, the betaAPP mRNA signal was generally decreased besides some intense signal neurons corresponding to immunostaining findings. Few astrocytes expressed betaAPP. Thus, uniform expression and distribution of betaAPP were disturbed in AD brains showing uneven decreases or increases of neuronal betaAPP expression in individual neurons and betaAPP accumulation in neurons, neuronal processes and abnormal structures including dystrophic neurites, senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.",
