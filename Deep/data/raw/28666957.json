     "AB": "Neural circuits in mammalian brains consist of large numbers of different cell types having different functional properties. To better understand the separate roles of individual neuron types in specific aspects of spatial learning and memory, we perturbed the function of principal neurons in vivo during maze performance or in hippocampal slices during recording of evoked excitatory synaptic potentials. Transgenic mice expressing the Drosophila allatostatin receptor (AlstR) in cortical and hippocampal pyramidal cells were tested on an elevated plus maze, in a Y-maze, and in the Morris water maze. Relative to a control cohort, AlstR-positive mice treated with allatostatin exhibited no difference in open arm dwell time on the elevated plus maze or total number of arm entries in a Y-maze, but displayed reduced spontaneous alternation. When animals received massed or spaced training trials in the Morris water maze, and the peptide was delivered prior to an immediate probe, no effects on performance were observed. When the peptide was delivered during a probe trial performed 24h after seven days of spaced training, allatostatin delivery to AlstR positive mice enhanced direct navigation to the escape platform. Combined, these results suggest that cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons are required during spatial decision-making in a novel environment and compete with other neural systems after extended training in a long-term reference memory task. In hippocampal slices collected from AlstR positive animals, allatostatin delivery produced frequency dependent alterations in the Schaffer collateral fiber volley (attenuated accommodation at 100Hz) and excitatory postsynaptic potential (attenuated facilitation at 5Hz). Combined, the neural and behavioral discoveries support the involvement of short-term plasticity of Schaffer collateral axons and synapses during exploration of a novel environment and during initial orientation to a goal in a well-learned setting.",
