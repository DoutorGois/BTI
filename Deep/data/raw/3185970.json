     "AB": "In this report the effects of phencyclidine (PCP) on physiologic variables, local cerebral blood flow (LCBF), and on hippocampal cell damage were measured in a rat model of forebrain ischemia (2-vessel occlusion and hypotension). Ischemia was induced for 10 min. LCBF was determined after 2 min of recirculation, using the [14C]iodoantipyrine technique. Hippocampal cell loss was quantified histologically 7 days postischemia as the percentage of acidic stainable neurons. Intravenous application of PCP (2 mg/kg) at 15 min prior to ischemia left postischemic LCBF unchanged, but neuronal damage was significantly reduced in hippocampal CA1 sector from 46 to 15.7%. PCP is concluded to reduce ischemic damage of neurons mainly via a direct effect on brain tissue.",
