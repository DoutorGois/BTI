     "AB": "1. Since nitric oxide has been proposed as a feedback factor in plasticity in the hippocampus, we tested whether it might also be a feedback factor in sensory-dependent plasticity in the cat visual cortex. 2. The effects of monocular deprivation were compared between eight hemispheres with infusion of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and eight control hemispheres with either infusion of the inactive isomer, or no infusion. Although nitric oxide synthase activity was reduced significantly, the ocular dominance histograms were not substantially different in the two groups of animals. We conclude that the feedback factor for sensory-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex is likely to be some factor other than nitric oxide.",
