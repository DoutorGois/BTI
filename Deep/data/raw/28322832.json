     "AB": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have an inhibitory effect on various ion channels including Ca(2+) channels. We used fluorescent dye-based digital imaging, whole-cell patch clamping and cytotoxicity assays to examine whether dapoxetine, a novel rapid-acting SSRI, affect glutamate-induced calcium signaling, mitochondrial depolarization and neuronal cell death in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Pretreatment with dapoxetine for 10min inhibited glutamate-induced intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) increases in a concentration-dependent manner (Half maximal inhibitory concentration=4.79microM). Dapoxetine (5muM) markedly inhibited glutamate-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases, whereas other SSRIs such as fluoxetine and citalopram only slightly inhibited them. Dapoxetine significantly inhibited the glutamate-induced [Ca(2+)]i responses following depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores by treatment with thapsigargin. Dapoxetine markedly inhibited the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases. Dapoxetine significantly inhibited the glutamate and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-induced [Ca(2+)]i responses in either the presence or absence of nimodipine. Dapoxetine also significantly inhibited AMPA-evoked currents. However, dapoxetine slightly inhibited N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases. Dapoxetine markedly inhibited 50mMK(+)-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases. Dapoxetine significantly inhibited glutamate-induced mitochondrial depolarization. In addition, dapoxetine significantly inhibited glutamate-induced neuronal cell death and its neuroprotective effect was significantly greater than fluoxetine. These data suggest that dapoxetine reduces glutamate-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases by inhibiting multiple pathways mainly through AMPA receptors, voltage-gated L-type Ca(2+) channels and metabotropic glutamate receptors, which are involved in neuroprotection against glutamate-induced cell death through mitochondrial depolarization.",
