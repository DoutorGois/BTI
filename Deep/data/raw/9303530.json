     "AB": "Evidence that ciliary neurotrophic factor promotes axonal sprouting and regeneration in the periphery raises the possibility that this factor is involved in reactive axonal growth in the brain. In situ hybridization was used in the present study to determine whether ciliary neurotrophic factor mRNA expression is increased in association with axonal sprouting in deafferented adult rat hippocampus. In untreated rats, ciliary neurotrophic factor cRNA labeling density was high in the olfactory nerve, pia mater, and aspects of the ventricular ependyma and was relatively low within areas of white matter (fimbria, internal capsule) and select neuronal fields (hippocampal cell layers, habenula). After an entorhinal cortex lesion, hybridization was markedly increased in fields of anterograde degeneration, including most prominently the ipsilateral dentate gyrus outer molecular layer and hippocampal stratum lacunosum moleculare. Labeling in these fields was increased by 3 days postlesion, was maximal at 5 days, and returned to normal levels by 14 days. Double labeling demonstrated that, in both control and experimental tissue, ciliary neurotrophic factor mRNA was colocalized with glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in astroglia, but it was not colocalized with markers for oligodendrocytes or microglia. These results demonstrate that astroglial ciliary neurotrophic factor expression is increased in fields of axonal and terminal degeneration and that increased expression is coincident with 1) increased insulin-like growth factor-1 and basic fibroblast growth factor expression and 2) the onset of reactive axonal growth. The synchronous expression of these glial factors in fields of deafferentation suggests the possibility of additive or synergistic interactions in the coordination of central axonal growth.",
