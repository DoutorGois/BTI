     "AB": "The neurogenic gene brainiac was first isolated in Drosophila melanogaster, where it interacts genetically with members of the Notch signaling cascade. We have isolated a murine homologue of the Drosophila brainiac gene and delineated its highly specific expression pattern during development and adult life. We find particularly strong expression in the developing central nervous system, in the developing retina, and in the adult hippocampus. Targeted deletion of mouse Brainiac 1 expression leads to embryonic lethality prior to implantation. Null embryos can be recovered as blastocysts but do not appear to implant, indicating that mouse Brainiac 1, likely a glycosyltransferase, is crucial for very early development of the mouse embryo.",
