     "AB": "Trimethyltin produces localized neuronal damage in the rat hippocampus, amygdala and pyriform cortex when given systemically. In the present study the behavioural, electroencephalographic and auditory evoked responses of conscious rats were followed over an 11 day period after oral administration of trimethyltin. An early increase in hippocampal and, to a lesser extent, neocortical evoked response was seen, this preceding the behavioural symptoms. Development of symptoms (hyperactivity, tremor and fear) was accompanied by an increase in the incidence of theta rhythm in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Finally a fall in hippocampal evoked response and theta incidence was seen. It is suggested that a phase of neuronal excitability precedes neuronal damage, and that this is more pronounced in the hippocampus than in areas not developing subsequent neuronal loss.",
