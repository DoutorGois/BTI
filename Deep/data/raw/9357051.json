     "AB": "To map the proteolytic enzymes metabolizing dynorphins in brain structures, size-exclusion chromatography linked to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used. Enzymes extracted from rat hippocampus, striatum, and substantia nigra were tested for their capability of converting dynorphin-related peptides. Dynorphin A was the most resistant to proteolytic conversion, whereas Big dynorphin and dynorphin B-29 were slowly converted to dynorphin A and dynorphins A and B, respectively. Dynorphin B and alpha-neoendorphin were the least resistant. Dynorphin B was rapidly converted to Leu-enkephalin in the striatum and hippocampus but to Leu-enkephalin-Arg6 in the substantia nigra. alpha-Neoendorphin was converted to Leu-enkephalin in all tissues investigated.",
