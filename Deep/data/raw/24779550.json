     "AB": "During the oestrus cycle, varying spine synapse density correlates positively with varying local synthesis of oestradiol in the hippocampus. In this context, the roles of the oestrogen receptor (ER) subtypes ERalpha and beta are not fully understood. In the present study, we used neonatal hippocampal slice cultures from female rats because these cultures synthesise oestradiol and express both receptor subtypes, and inhibition of oestradiol synthesis in these cultures results in spine synapse loss. Using electron microscopy, we tested the effects on spine synapse density in response to agonists of both ERalpha and ERbeta. Application of agonists to the cultures had no effect. After inhibition of oestradiol synthesis, however, agonists of ERalpha induced spine synapse formation, whereas ERbeta agonists led to a reduction in spine synapse density in the CA1 region of these cultures. Consistently, up-regulation of ERbeta in the hippocampus of adult female aromatase-deficient mice is paralleled by hippocampus-specific spine synapse loss in this mutant. Finally, we found an increase in spine synapses in the adult female ERbeta knockout mouse, but no effect in the adult female ERalpha knockout mouse. Our data suggest antagonistic roles of ERbeta and ERalpha in spine synapse formation in the female hippocampus, which may contribute to oestrus cyclicity of spine synapse density in the hippocampus.",
