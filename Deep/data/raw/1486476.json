     "AB": "A projection from the medial amygdaloid nucleus to the hippocampus and septum probably uses vasopressin as a transmitter. The nucleus synthesizes vasopressin and activation of the nucleus has a hippocampal effect that is completely blocked by a vasopressin antagonist. The afferent and efferent projections of this peptidergic nucleus suggest a possible role for the system in sexual behavior. Stimulation of the nucleus inhibits the output of the hippocampus in both genders and reorganizes behavior for a period of 15-20 min. In males, the effect of peptidergic activation is to produce a behavior that resembles the post-ejaculatory interval in coitus. This state is characterized by an EEG that resembles slow-wave sleep and by ultrasonic vocalizations at a characteristic frequency of 22 kHz. Castration in either gender causes depletion of the peptide from the target fields and eliminates the peptidergic signal in the hippocampus after about 15 weeks. The effects of castration in males can be reversed by testosterone replacement. The fluctuation of estrogen levels in rat plasma during the estrus cycle happens too quickly to impact the peptidergic system, and thus there is no significant change in the strength of the peptidergic signal among the proestrus, estrus, metestrus and diestrus stages. This fact permits study of the physiology of the system without concern for stage of estrus but does not permit conclusions regarding its function in females.",
