     "AB": "Microcontact printing was used to define an interconnected lattice network of polylysine-conjugated laminin, a protein-polypeptide ligate that is an effective promoter of neuron outgrowth on material surfaces. In the presence of serum proteins, rat hippocampal neurons selectively adhered to features of polylysine-conjugated laminin as narrow as 2.6 microm in width. Adhering neurons extended long axonal processes, which precisely followed and did not deviate from the prescribed patterns, demonstrating that neurons respond to this protein with high selectivity and that these techniques effectively provide long-range guidance of axonal outgrowth. Further examination of neuron response under serum-free cell culture conditions demonstrated that the outgrowth-promoting activity of polylysine-conjugated laminin was attributed to biologically active laminin. Together, these results demonstrate that polylysine-conjugated laminin provides for high-precision guidance of neuron attachment and axon outgrowth on material surfaces in a serum-independent manner. This ability to guide hippocampal neuron response in low-density, serum-free culture with high precision is valuable for the development of advanced, neuron-based devices.",
