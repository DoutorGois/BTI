     "AB": "TAG-1/axonin-1 is a neuronal cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is predominantly expressed during neural development and has been reported to be involved in axonal growth and pathfinding. Here, the expression of TAG-1/axonin-1 was investigated anatomically in the adult mouse brain by in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes. Low levels of TAG-1/axonin-1 could be detected in cerebellar granule cells, in tufted and mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, and in pyramidal cells of area CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus. We suspect that the expression of TAG-1/axonin-1 in these structures of the adult brain may serve neural plasticity.",
