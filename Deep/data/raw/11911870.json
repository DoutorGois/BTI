     "AB": "Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was performed to characterize the distribution and phenotype of GLUT8-positive neurons in rat brain and to compare the cellular distribution of GLUT8 with GLUT3 in the hippocampus. Based upon the absence of co-localization with the non-neuronal markers GFAP (astroglial) and OX42 (microglial), it appears that GLUT8 is expressed exclusively in neurons. At the cellular level, GLUT8 immunofluorescence was localized to neuronal cell bodies and the most proximal dendrites of inhibitory and excitatory neurons while GLUT3 immunofluorescence was localized to the neuropil in the hippocampus. These results demonstrate that GLUT8 is a neuron-specific glucose transporter expressed in the neuronal cell bodies of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the rat hippocampus.",
