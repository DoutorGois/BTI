     "AB": "The reduction of the long-term potentiated response induced by tetanus (depotentiation (DP) of LTP) was investigated by the delivery of a train of low-frequency afferent stimuli (depotentiating stimulation: DPS) after the tetanus (100 Hz, 100 pulses) in CA1 neurons of the guinea pig's hippocampal slice. The parameters of DPS (frequencies of 1, 2, 5 and 10 Hz; number of pulses of 200 and 1000; and the time-lag after tetanus of 20 and 100 min) were altered systematically and their effects on LTP were evaluated through the analysis of the slope of field EPSP (S-EPSP) and amplitude and peak latency of population spike (A- and L-PS). DPS of 1 Hz, 1000 pulses, given 20 min after tetanus, reduced the potentiated component of S-EPSP, A-PS and L-PS by 68.5%, 80.1% and 56.1%, respectively (mean, n = 6), whereas it reduced the control response by 4.3%, 7.1%, and 1.9%, respectively (n = 6). Significantly less effectiveness was observed for DPS at higher frequencies (2-10 Hz), with smaller numbers of pulses, featuring a longer time-lag after tetanus and under APV administration. When DPS was applied before tetanus, significantly less robust LTP was observed. However, these effects were blocked by the administration of APV during DPS.",
