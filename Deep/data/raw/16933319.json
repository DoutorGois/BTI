     "AB": "Iron serves as an essential trace element for all body tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Because iron deficiency as well as iron overload is known to cause damage to the mammalian brain, the maintenance of iron homeostasis is crucial. It has been discovered recently that hepcidin plays an essential role in iron metabolism outside the CNS. A defect in hepcidin expression is responsible for iron accumulation and mice over-expressing hepcidin die postnatally by a severe anemia. We have used RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry to investigate the cellular distribution of hepcidin mRNA and protein in brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia. Our results show a wide-spread distribution of hepcidin in different brain areas, including the olfactory bulb, cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, mesencephalon, cerebellum, pons, spinal cord, as well as in dorsal root ganglia of the peripheral nervous system. Hepcidin immunoreactivity is not restricted to neurons, but can be detected in both neurons and GFAP-positive glia cells. Because hepcidin action in organs outside the CNS is linked to iron homeostasis, we speculate that it is also involved in such processes in the CNS, putatively together with other iron regulating proteins. Cellular mechanisms and functions of hepcidin in the CNS remain to be elucidated.",
