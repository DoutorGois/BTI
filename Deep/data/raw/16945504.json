     "AB": "Lithium-pilocarpine induces status epilepticus (SE), leading to extensive damage and spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). Neuroprotective and antiepileptogenic effects of topiramate (TPM) associated with diazepam (DZP) were investigated in this model. SE was induced by LiCl and pilocarpine. TPM (10, 30 or 60 mg/kg) was injected at the onset of SE and 10h later and DZP (2.5 and 1.25mg/kg) at 2 and 10h after SE. TPM treatment was continued twice daily for 6 days. Other rats received two injections of DZP on the day of SE. Cell counting was performed on thionine-stained sections 14 days after SE and after 2 months of epilepsy. Occurrence and frequency of SRS were video-recorded. The MRI T2-weighted signal was quantified in hippocampus and ventral cortices. DZP-TPM treatment induced partial neuroprotection in CA1 and hilus, and tended to increase the percentage of rats with protected neurons in layer III/IV of the ventral entorhinal cortex. The latency to and frequency of SRS were not modified by DZP-TPM. T2-weighted signal was decreased in hippocampus 3 days after SE at all TPM doses and in ventral hippocampus after epilepsy onset. In conclusion, although DZP-TPM treatment was able to partially protect two areas critical for epileptogenesis, the hippocampus and ventral entorhinal cortex, it was not sufficient to prevent epileptogenesis.",
