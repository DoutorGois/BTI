     "AB": "Effects of anesthetics and doxapram on pontogeniculo-occipital (PGO) waves from the oculomotor nucleus were studied in acute experiments in cats paralyzed by gallamine triethiodide. The anesthetic agents studied in the present experiment (thiopental, ketamine, Innovar, nitrous oxide, and halothane) decreased, while doxapram increased, the total number of PGO waves. As the doses of anesthetics increased, PGO waves were abolished, but they returned to control levels or below control levels when the concentrations of anesthetics were decreased. The results indicate that the anesthetics studied inhibit the activity of the central mechanism associated with the oculomotor system. PGO waves may prove a useful index of the level of anesthesia.",
