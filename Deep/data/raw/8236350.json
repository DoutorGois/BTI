     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral intraventricular infusion of acidic or basic fibroblast growth factor has been shown to attenuate ischemic damage to hippocampal CA1 neurons in the gerbil. The purpose of the present study was to determine if the basic fibroblast growth factor transgenic mouse has an enhanced ability to resist the effects of severe cerebral hypoxemia-oligemia. METHODS: Mice that were transgenic for bovine basic fibroblast growth factor were exposed to right carotid artery ligation, hyperglycemia, and 20 minutes of 1% carbon monoxide. After 5 days' recovery, brains were examined for histological damage. RESULTS: Counts of CA1 neurons in the right hippocampus showed a significantly higher number of neurons per millimeter CA1 in hypoxic-ischemic transgenic mice compared with nontransgenic controls (transgenic, 260 +/- 33; nontransgenic, 151 +/- 37 neurons per millimeter CA1; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that basic fibroblast growth factor transgenic mice, as judged by CA1 hippocampal neuronal survival, have an enhanced ability to resist the effects of a complex hypoxic-ischemic cerebral insult.",
