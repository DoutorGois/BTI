     "AB": "Neuroimaging and microarray studies provide evidence for myelin and oligodendrocyte abnormalities in schizophrenia (SZ). Electron microscopy demonstrated dystrophy, necrosis and apoptosis of oligodendrocytes, the most severely affected cells in SZ. The proportion of myelinated fibres with atrophy of axon and swelling of periaxonal oligodendrocyte processes increased significantly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), caudate nucleus and hippocampus in SZ compared to controls. Morphometry showed a deficit of oligodendrocytes in the PFC and in adjacent white matter, lower number of oligodendroglial satellites of pyramidal neurons and a loss of pericapillar oligodendrocytes in the PFC in SZ compared to normal controls. A lowered number of oligodendrocytes in the PFC was also found in mood disorders. These data provide evidence for altered oligodendrocyte-axon, oligodendrocyte-neuron and oligodendrocyte-capillar interactions in SZ brains suggesting a key role of damage and loss of oligodendrocytes in altered neuronal connectivity and in atrophy of neurons in SZ.",
