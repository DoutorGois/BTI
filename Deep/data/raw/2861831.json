     "AB": "Genotypic variations in the reactivity to an acute ethanol intoxication of dopamine turnover, release and metabolites, as well as serotoninergic neurotransmission have been investigated in the nigrostriatal and the septohippocampal pathways of C57Bl and Balb/c mice strains. In the striatum, decreased dopamine release associated with increased DA turnover, was noted after alcohol treatment, possibly as a retrocontrol reaction. Parallely, enhanced serotonin metabolism occurred. For the septohippocampal pathway, dopamine neurotransmission in the septum reacts to alcohol in a similar way as in the striatum. In the hippocampus, serotonin metabolism is reduced. A strain dependent difference in sensitivity to ethanol is observed for both pathways. The results are discussed (1) in the context of interactions of these transmitters with cholinergic activity; (2) in relation with behavioral disturbances associated to alcohol abuse in man (motor incoordination and memory alterations, in particular).",
