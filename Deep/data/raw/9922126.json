     "AB": "SAMP8/TaJf(P8) mouse strain has an inherited age-related impairment of learning and memory with its onset relatively early in its lifespan. Previously, it was reported that cholinergic and glutamatergic drugs injected into the hippocampus after behavioral training showed considerable shifts in the dose that improved retention in mice at 12 compared to 4 months of age. Cholinergic neurons in the septum supply most of the acetylcholine released in the hippocampus. In the present study, we determined if altered functional status of neurotransmission in the septum might account for the decrease in cholinergic and glutamatergic activity in the hippocampus of older SAMP8 mice. After training on footshock avoidance, P8 mice received a drug injection into the septum. Retention was tested 1 week later. The results indicate that bicuculline, GABA-A, and saclofen, GABA-B, receptor antagonist had to be injected at a higher dose in 12- than in 4-month-old mice to improve retention. The serotonergic antagonists, ketanserin and methiothepin, both showed dose response shifts such that less drug was needed to improve retention in 12- as compared to 4-month-old mice. It required four times more L-glutamate to improve retention in 12- than in 4-month-old mice. Agonists for acetylcholine, dopamine and norepinephrine receptors or an opiate antagonist required little or no change in the dose needed to improve retention in older P8 mice. SAMP8 mice may show an age-related impairment of septohippocampal functioning.",
