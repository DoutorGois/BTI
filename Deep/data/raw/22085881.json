     "AB": "Recent research indicates that longstanding temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is associated with extratemporal, i.e. parietal cortex damage. We investigated egocentric and allocentric memory by use of first-person large-scale virtual reality environments in patients with TLE. We expected that TLE patients with parietal cortex damage were impaired in the egocentric memory task. Twenty-two TLE patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and 22 TLE patients without HS were compared with 42 healthy matched controls on two virtual reality tasks affording to learn a virtual park (allocentric memory) and a virtual maze (egocentric memory). Participants further received a neuropsychological investigation and MRI volumetry at the time of the assessment. When compared with controls, TLE patients with HS had significantly reduced size of the ipsilateral and contralateral somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus). When compared with controls or TLE patients without HS, TLE patients with HS were severely impaired learning the virtual maze. Considering all participants, smaller volumes of the left-sided postcentral gyrus were related to worse performance on the virtual maze. It is concluded that the paradigm of egocentric navigation and learning in first-person large-scale virtual environments may be a suitable tool to indicate significant extratemporal damage in individuals with TLE.",
