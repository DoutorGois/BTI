     "AB": "Lipid peroxidation has been considered one of the most important factors involved in the pathogenesis of neuronal damage following subarachnoid hemorrhage. In the brain, the protective systems most involved against peroxidative and free radicals generated reactions are superoxide-dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-Px). Since these activities are subjected to a significant reduction following experimental SAH induction in rats, we investigated in the present study if the beneficial effect of high-dose methylprednisolone (MP) in inhibiting lipid peroxidative processes in SAH is possibly linked to an influence on anti-oxidant enzymatic activities. In brain cortex, after MP treatment, Cu-Zn SOD activity in the early phase and more dramatically in the late phase after SAH was restored (4.06 +/- 0.06 and 4.07 +/- 0.14 enzymatic units/mg of protein, respectively) if compared to hemorrhagic non-treated controls (3.69 +/- 0.16 and 2.96 +/- 0.06 enzymatic U/mg of protein) while Mn-SOD and GSH-Px activities were improved in treated animals only in the early and late phases after SAH, respectively. In the hippocampus, in treated rats Cu-Zn activity was partially restored only at 6 h, while Mn-SOD activity recovered at 48 h after SAH; no significant changes in GSH-Px activity were found in treated animals at any time. In the brain stem, in treated animals, Cu-Zn SOD activity was restored in the early phase (3.86 +/- 0.12 enzymatic U/mg of protein) up to control values of non-hemorrhagic rats (3.44 +/- 0.30 enzymatic U/mg of protein), while GSH-Px activity recovered in the late phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
