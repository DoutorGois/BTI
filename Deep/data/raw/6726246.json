     "AB": "Levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were measured in rat CSF following occlusion of the four major arteries to the brain for 10, 20, or 30 min. In the CSF of rats submitted to 30 min of total ischemia, an up to nine-fold increase of NSE level occurred within the first few hours and then slowly diminished. Significant levels were seen for as long as 8 days. Histological observations 3 days after ischemia showed neuronal loss as well as neuronal damage in several forebrain regions such as hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. Ischemia was followed by transient decreases in exploration behavior and neurological states that were no longer visible 24 h later. After 10 or 20 min ischemia, NSE levels were increased to a lesser degree and fewer damaged neurons were observed. The positive correlation between duration of ischemia and amount of NSE release in CSF indicates that the measurement of NSE in the CSF is a sensitive and reliable index of neuronal lesions.",
