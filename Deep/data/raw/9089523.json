     "AB": "Olfactory recognition which occurs in the context pregnancy block by male pheromones is acquired with one-trial learning contingent on mating. A memory trace is established in the accessory bulb (AOB) and is represented by a gain in Gaba-ergic feedback inhibition of granule cells on excitatory glutaminergic mitral cells. This occurs in the sub-population of mitral cells that specifically respond to an individual male's pheromones, and is dependent on noradrenaline release at mating. Although relatively simple, the AOB has both structural and functional similarities with other trilaminar neural structures involved in learning, which suggests some evolutionary conservation of mechanisms subserving memory.",
