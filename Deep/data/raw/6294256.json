     "AB": "The binding of 3H-thymidine labeled herpes simplex virus to homogenates of rodent brain regions and liver was examined. The results indicated that binding sites in the brain are distributed in a non-uniform manner, the specific pattern observed depending upon the age of the animal. In addition, binding was found to be reduced by pretreatment of the labeled virus with specific antiserum or trypsin. These results suggest that the distribution of herpes simplex virus receptors is one of the factors determining neurotropism and the localization of infection within the brain.",
