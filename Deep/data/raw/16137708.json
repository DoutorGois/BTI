     "AB": "The present study was undertaken in order to investigate the muscarinic (M(1)), dopaminergic (D(1) and D(2)) and serotonergic (5-HT(2)) receptors densities in hippocampus and striatum of Wistar rats after status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine. The control group was treated with 0.9% saline. An other group of rats received pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, s.c.) and both groups were sacrificed 1 h after treatment. The results have shown that pilocarpine administration and resulting SE produced a downregulation of M(1) receptor in hippocampus (41%) and striatum (51%) and an increase in the dissociation constant (K(d)) values in striatum (42%) alone. In both areas the 5-HT(2) receptor density remained unaltered, but a reduction (50%) and an increase (15%) in the K(d) values were detected in striatum and hippocampus, respectively. D(1) and D(2) receptor densities in hippocampus and striatum remained unaltered meanwhile K(d) values for D(1) receptor declined significantly, 33% in hippocampus and 26% in striatum. Similarly, K(d) values for D(2) decreased 55% in hippocampus and 52% in striatum. From the preceding results, it is clear that there is a possible relation between alterations in muscarinic receptor density and others systems studied as well as they suggest that changes in dissociation constant can be responsible for the establishment of pilocarpine-induced SE by altering the affinity of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonine.",
