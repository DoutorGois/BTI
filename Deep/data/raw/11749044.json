     "AB": "The tauopathies, which include Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementias, are a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by filamentous Tau aggregates. That Tau dysfunction can cause neurodegeneration is indicated by pathogenic tau mutations in frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). To investigate how Tau alterations provoke neurodegeneration we generated transgenic mice expressing human Tau with four tubulin-binding repeats (increased by FTDP-17 splice donor mutations) and three FTDP-17 missense mutations: G272V, P301L, and R406W. Ultrastructural analysis of mutant Tau-positive neurons revealed a pretangle appearance, with filaments of Tau and increased numbers of lysosomes displaying aberrant morphology similar to those found in AD. Lysosomal alterations were confirmed by activity analysis of the marker acid phosphatase, which was increased in both transgenic mice and transfected neuroblastoma cells. Our results show that Tau modifications can provoke lysosomal aberrations and suggest that this may be a cause of neurodegeneration in tauopathies.",
