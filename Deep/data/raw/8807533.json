     "AB": "Glycosaminoglycans, the sugar moieties of proteoglycans, modulate axonal growth in vitro. However, their anatomical distribution in relation to developing axonal tracts in the rat brain has not been studied. Here, we examined the immunohistochemical distribution of chondroitin-6-sulfate and chondroitin-4-sulfate, two related glycosaminoglycan epitopes, which are present in three types of glycosaminoglycans: chondroitin sulfate C, chondroitin sulfate A, and chondroitin sulfate B. Further, we compared their distribution pattern to that of axonal tract development. Both glycosaminoglycan epitopes showed a heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution within the developing rat brain. However, the expression of chondroitin-4-sulfate was more restricted than that of chondroitin-6-sulfate, although both epitopes were detected from embryonic day 13 until the day of birth, overlapping in many regions of the central nervous system including cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and hindbrain. After birth, the levels of expression of both glycosaminoglycan epitopes progressively decreased and were practically undetectable after the first postnatal week. The expression of chondroitin-6-sulfate and, to a lesser extent, that of chondroitin-4-sulfate, was preferentially associated to the extracellular matrix surrounding specific axon bundles. However, the converse association was not true, and several apparently similar types of axon developed on a substrate devoid of both types of glycosaminoglycan epitopes. These results provide an anatomical background for the idea that different types of glycosaminoglycans may contribute to establish the complex set of guidance cues necessary for the specific development of defined axon tracts in the central nervous system.",
