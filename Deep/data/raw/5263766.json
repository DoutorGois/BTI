     "AB": "In agreement with the data of Beach et al. (these Proceedings, 62, 692 (1969)) on the effects of avoidance training on protein synthesis, we report autoradiographic evidence for the increased incorporation of radioactive uridine into limbic system structures of the brains of trained mice. There is also a decreased incorporation into the outer layers of the neocortex. The observed responses in labeling are restricted to the nuclei of neurons. The significance of these changes in brain function is not known but they may be related to those processes of the memory consolidation phenomenon affected by inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis.",
