     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of acupuncture method for benefiting qi, regulating blood, supplementing the root, and cultivating the essence (BQRBSRCE) on the p53 protein expression of mice with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: SAMP8 mice were divided into the control group, the acupuncture group, and the non-acupoint group. The homologous SAMR1 control group was set up. Mice in the acupuncture group used acupuncture method for BQRBSRCE by needling at Tanzhong (RN17), Zhongwan (RN12), Qihai (RN6), and bilateral Xuehai (SP10), and bilateral Zusanli (ST36).Two fixed non-acupoints from bilateral ribs were needled in the non-acupoint group. The p53 protein expression in the cortex and hippocampus of mice was determined using Western blot. The pathological changes of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region, the temporal lobe, and the occipital lobe were observed using HE staining. The expression of cortical p53-positive cells was detected by immunohistochemical assay. RESULTS: The p53 protein was highly expressed in the cortex of SAMP8, which was significantly down-regulated after acupuncture, showing statistical difference when compared with the SAMP8 control group (P < 0.05), but with no statistical difference when compared with the SAMR1 control group (P > 0.05). Needling at non-acupoints had no obvious effect on the p53 protein expression. There was no statistical difference in the p53 protein expression of the hippocampus (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture method for BQRBSRCE could down-regulate the p53 protein expression in the brain of mice, improve the pathological state of brain cells, thus enhancing learning and memory capabilities of AD mice, improving their cognitive functions, with specificity of acupoints.",
