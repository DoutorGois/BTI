     "AB": "This study investigated the distribution of nitric oxide synthase-containing neurons in the cerebral cortex of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, and compared them with age-matched controls. Paraffin-embedded sections of the frontal (area 10), occipital (area 17) and entorhinal cortices (area 28), and hippocampal formation obtained from 13 autopsy cases were used in the study. Neurons expressing nitric oxide synthase messenger RNA and protein were identified, respectively, by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Optical densities of nitric oxide synthase-positive neurons were assessed in 50 randomly selected fields of each of the above regions of the cortices, in each case by microscopic photometry. In the frontal cortex of the Alzheimer group, while a decrease in the number of nitric oxide synthase-positive neurons was evident, the nitric oxide synthase neurons, on the other hand, showed an increased optical density in layers II-IV when compared with those of normal ageing. In the occipital cortices, no significant differences in optical density were recorded between the normal ageing and Alzheimer specimens. In the entorhinal cortex, the optical densities of nitric oxide synthase neurons were again similar between the Alzheimer and age-matched control groups. In the hippocampar formation itself, there was an increase of nitric oxide synthase staining in the Alzheimer patients. These results show that (i) nitric oxide synthase neurons are abundant in the human cortex, (ii) the distribution of nitric oxide synthase neurons differs between different cortical regions, and (iii) there are differences between normal ageing and Alzheimer patients in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus.",
