     "AB": "Since copper ions irreversibly reduce the binding of cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) to rat brain membranes and copper levels are elevated in the brains of seizure-prone mice, the binding of CHA was compared in seizure-prone DBA/2 and control C57 mice. No strain difference was detected in the binding of CHA or the reduction of that binding by copper, although copper was more potent than in rats (IC50 12 microM). In rat hippocampal slices copper did not diminish the inhibitory effects of adenosine or CHA. The results suggest that the seizure sensitivity of DBA/2 mice is not due to an effect of copper on purine receptors and that the copper binding domain of purine receptors is inaccessible to extracellular copper.",
