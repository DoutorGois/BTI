     "AB": "Kainate receptor agonists depress transmitter release at several synapses in the hippocampus. Distinct mechanisms appear to underlie this phenomenon at different synapses. Recently, it has emerged that presynaptic kainate receptors can also potentiate the release of both GABA and glutamate and that axonal kainate receptors can trigger ectopic action potentials in interneurons. Because synaptically released glutamate mimics many of the actions of exogenous agonists, presynaptic kainate receptors potentially play an extensive role in hippocampal signaling.",
