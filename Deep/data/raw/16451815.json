     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in rat brain. METHODS: Rats were given either a single (acute) or a series of eight (chronic) ECS. Brain regions were isolated and levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the brain tissue (cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum) were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: We showed that GFAP expression is reduced in the hippocampus within 48 h and 7 days after acute ECS. GFAP levels are increased in the cerebellum immediately after acute and chronic ECS. No changes were observed in the cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed a differential effect of acute and chronic ECS in the astroglial response in the brain of rats.",
