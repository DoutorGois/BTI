     "AB": "The method of primary hippocampal nerve cell culture was used to study the injury effect of H2O2 and the protective effect of galanin (GAL) and GAL receptor agonists. Result demonstrated that H2O2 has obvious dose relative toxicity to hippocampal cells in vitro. GAL and GAL's nonselective agonist GAL1-11, GalR2's selective agonist GAL2-11 can increase the survival rate of hippocampal cells suffered form H2O2. All the protective effects can be blocked by nonselective antagonist M35. The result indicates that GAL can protect hippocampal cells from oxidative injury in vitro, which is most probably mediated by GalR2.",
