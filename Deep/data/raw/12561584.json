     "AB": "The effects of enriched uranium on growth, behavior and biochemical changes of brain in neonatal Wistar rats was studied. Neonatal rats were irradiated with a single injection of 2 microliters enriched uranium (containing 0, 1, 5 and 10 micrograms of 235U) into left lateral ventricle of brain at the first day (< 24 h) after birth. The growth and neurobehavior development of the rats was delay and abnormal. The microautoradiographic tracing technique showed that the radionuclide was mainly accumulated in the nucleus, also appeared in the cytoplasm of cells and between cells. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the level of endothelin (ET) of cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and diencephalons of brain after exposure to alpha irradiation were examined with radioimmunoassay. The data indicated that SOD and ET was elevated by low dose irradiation and distinctly inhibited by high dose irradiation. It was concluded that alpha irradiation could have damages on the developing brain of neonatal rats characterized by changing the sensibility, fragility and compensation of nerve cells.",
