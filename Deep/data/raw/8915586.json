     "AB": "We analyzed expression of mouse orphan nuclear receptor ROR alpha during postnatal development of rodent brain. Using a riboprobe corresponding to the 3'-end of mROR alpha cDNA a peak of ROR alpha expression was observed at postnatal 16 day (P16) in the Purkinje cells of cerebellum, neurons of the thalamus and the olfactory bulb. The hippocampus was also shown to express ROR alpha with an earlier peak at P7. Expression in cell types other than the Purkinje cells appeared transient. On the other hand, when a probe to the 5'-end of mROR alpha cDNA was used, we observed patterns of ROR alpha expression that are different from those observed with the 3'-probe. No specific transcripts of ROR alpha were detected with the 5'-probe in the Purkinje cells until P16. Additionally, the relative level of the hybridization signals with the 5'-probe and the 3'-probe were different among the various brain regions. Together with the previous findings that ROR alpha comprises at least four isoforms which differ from one another in their N-terminal regions, these observations suggest that the spatiotemporal expression of ROR alpha is under isoform-specific regulation. The timing of its expression suggests that ROR alpha may be involved in regulation of postnatal maturation of specific classes of neurons.",
