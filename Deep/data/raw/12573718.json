     "AB": "The autoradiographic distribution of tachykinin NK(2) binding sites was determined in the adult rat brain using [(125)I]neurokinin A in the presence of either senktide (NK(3) agonist) and [Pro(9)]substance P (NK(1) agonist) or senktide and SR 140333 (NK(1) antagonist). Indeed, this radioligand labels two subtypes of NK(1) binding sites (which present a high affinity not only for SP but also for neurokinin A, neuropeptide K and neuropeptide gamma) as well as NK(3) binding sites. The distribution of NK(2) binding sites was also compared with those of NK(1) and NK(3) binding sites, these sites being labeled with [(125)I]Bolton and Hunter substance P and [(125)I]Bolton and Hunter eledoisin, respectively. In agreement with our results obtained with membranes from various brain structures, NK(2)-sensitive [(125)I]neurokinin A labeling was mainly observed in few structures including the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, the septum, the thalamus and the prefrontal cortex. The density of NK(2) binding sites was weak when compared with those of NK(1) and NK(3) binding sites. Marked differences were observed in the distributions of NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) binding sites. These results are discussed taking into consideration differences or similarities between the distributions of NK(2)-sensitive [(125)I]neurokinin A binding sites and of their endogenous ligands (neurokinin A, neuropeptide K and neuropeptide gamma) but also local NK(2) agonist responses blocked by NK(2) antagonists. Insights on the roles of endogenous tachykinins in several brain functions are also discussed on the basis of the respective distributions of different neurokinin binding sites.",
