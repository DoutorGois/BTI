     "AB": "We have developed a novel sampling technique that allows both introduction and removal of fluid from the extracellular space of living tissue. This method is based on the fluidics of push-pull perfusion but flow is driven by electroosmosis. We have applied this method to organotypic hippocampal cultures. A source capillary is inserted into the tissue and a collection capillary is in contact with the tissue surface through a thin layer of fluid. A voltage is applied across the proximal ends of source and collection capillary. In the applied field, fluid will move from source, into the tissue, and then be collected. In this process, damage to cells may occur. To understand better what sampling conditions influence damage most, we tested various sampling geometries and applied voltages, quantifying damage 16-24 h later using propidium iodide as a cell death marker. We found that damage correlates with both voltage drop and power dissipated in the tissue, but that voltage drop is a better indicator of damage when comparing models in which capillary arrangement and length are different.",
