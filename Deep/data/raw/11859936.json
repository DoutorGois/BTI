     "AB": "Long-term memory formation requires de novo RNA and protein synthesis. To assess gene-expression changes associated with learning and memory processes, we used cDNA microarray to analyze hippocampal gene expression in male Fischer-344 rats following training in a multiunit T-maze. Here, we report the identification of 28 clones (18 known genes and 10 ESTs) for which expression increased after the maze learning. Some of the known genes appear to be involved in Ca2+ signaling, Ras activation, kinase cascades, and extracellular matrix (ECM) function, which may regulate neural transmission, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis. The gene-expression profile presented here provides the groundwork for future, more focused research to elucidate the contribution of these genes in learning and memory processes.",
