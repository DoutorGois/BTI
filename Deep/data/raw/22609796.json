     "AB": "Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Recent studies suggest the role of the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of MDD, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists have shown antidepressant effects in both preclinical and clinical studies. However, little is known about the role of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) specifically in the glutamatergic response to HPA axis activation. Glutamate is an NMDA receptor agonist, and glycine and D-serine act as co-agonists. Here, we measured brain concentrations of these amino acids in rats given repeated administration of ACTH (100 mug/rat/day, sc, for 14 days). Further, we also evaluated behavioral effects of memantine, a non-competitive NMDA antagonist, on immobility time in the forced swimming test and on locomotor activity in ACTH-treated rats. Compared with control rats, glutamine, glycine, L-serine, and D-serine levels were increased in the hippocampus of ACTH-treated rats; glutamate, glutamine, glycine, L-serine, and D-serine were increased in the cerebellum; and glutamine and glycine were increased in the frontal cortex and striatum, all with statistical significance. Remarkably, these increases in agonists and co-agonists might have led to the augmentation of NMDA receptor activity. ACTH treatment increased immobility time in the forced swimming test and decreased locomotor activity in rats. On the contrary, memantine (10 mg/kg, ip) significantly decreased immobility time in the forced swimming test and increased locomotor activity in ACTH-treated rats. Furthermore, imipramine (15 mg/kg, ip) did not alter immobility time in the forced swimming test whereas this drug significantly decreased locomotor activity in ACTH-treated rats. These results suggest that depressive-like behaviors by chronic ACTH treatment could be blocked by memantine.",
