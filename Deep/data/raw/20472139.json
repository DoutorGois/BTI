     "AB": "Neurotrophins are important regulators of neuronal function in the developing and adult brain and thus play a critical role in sustaining normal behavioral function. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been the most widely studied neurotrophin because of its important role as modulator of synaptic plasticity, which is essential to the regulation of experience-dependent behavior. Extensive work implicates BDNF in hippocampus-dependent forms of learning and memory, although it also regulates other cognitive processes. A role for BDNF in anxiety-related disorders and aggressive behavior can also be suspected. More importantly, BDNF signaling has recently emerged as a key player in the development of drug addiction and is well known to be involved in adaptation to stress and stress-related disorders. NGF in the other hand is thought to be involved in aggression and alcohol dependence. Finally, BDNF appears to participate in the therapeutic effects of drugs and interventions capable of reversing or attenuating behavioral disturbances relevant to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Compounds mimicking BDNF signaling, however, are unlikely to be used in a clinical context, given their adverse side effects and pharmacokinetic limitations.",
