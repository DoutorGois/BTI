Decreased levels of total lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, free fatty acids and esterified fatty acids were observed in hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygadaloid nucleus, midline nuclei of thalamus and gyrus cinguli. However, the levels of esterified fatty acids only in the amygdaloid nucleus and that of cholesterol in hypothalamus were significantly increased.",
