     "AB": "A functional hippocampus is required for trace fear conditioning, which involves learning the association of a tone and shock that are separated over time. Young and aged rats received 10 trace conditioning trials. Twenty-four hours later, rats were tested for fear to the tone in a novel chamber by measuring freezing. The results showed significantly lower levels of freezing in aged rats as compared with young rats, which provides evidence of age-related memory impairments. Pseudorandom conditioning groups showed low levels of freezing, indicative of no associative memory. Age-related memory deficits were not found with delay conditioning, which suggests no age-related sensory-motor deficits. These data suggest that aging hinders the ability of the hippocampus to process information separated over time.",
