     "AB": "Rat hippocampal slices showed marked local variations in sensitivity to hypoxia within the CA1 region, judged by electrical criteria. There were also marked differences between slices, judged both by electrical and histological criteria. Local differences were attenuated by 'adapting' slices for 3-4 h in a uniformly oxygenated bath before testing. The local differences may reflect proximity to capillaries.",
