     "AB": "Neuronal consequences of recurrent single epileptic seizures have been discussed controversially for some time. Various cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown a positive correlation between the severity of epilepsy and the extent of hippocampal damage. However, the open question whether recurrent epileptic seizures induce hippocampal structural pathology can be assessed only in longitudinal studies. The few recent follow-up studies have revealed conflicting results. In the current MRI study we have employed volumetry and T2 relaxometry to quantify hippocampal structural changes of patients with chronic partial epilepsies over a period of 3 years. Our main findings demonstrate that these patients who experience continuing epileptic seizures do no show any development of new pathology or any relevant deterioration of pre-existing hippocampal structural lesions. This argues against the assumption that recurrent epileptic seizures cause or increase structural hippocampal damage.",
