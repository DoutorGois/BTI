     "AB": "Amyloid precursor protein generates the secreted amyloid precursor protein alpha, which protects hippocampal neurons from ischemic injury and facilitates neuronal survival and synaptogenesis in the developing nervous system. Here, we examined whether platelet-derived growth factor regulates the generation of secreted amyloid precursor protein alpha during the neuronal differentiation of hippocampal precursor cells, HiB5. We showed that platelet-derived growth factor promoted amyloid precursor protein production and secreted amyloid precursor protein alpha secretion. These effects of platelet-derived growth factor were diminished by the PI3K-specific inhibitor wortmannin and the protein kinase C-specific inhibitor GF109203X, suggesting the involvement of the PI3K and protein kinase C-signaling pathway. Furthermore, the conditioned media enriched with secreted amyloid precursor protein alpha promoted the survival of HiB5 cells during neuronal differentiation. These results suggest that the neurotrophic effect of platelet-derived growth factor is mediated in part via upregulation of the expression and release of secreted amyloid precursor protein alpha.",
