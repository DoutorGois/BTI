     "AB": "Although a series of signaling cascades involved in spatial memory have been identified, their link to spatial memory and strain-dependent expression has not been reported so far. Hippocampal levels of the abovementioned signaling proteins were determined in laboratory inbred strain C57BL/6J, the wild-derived inbred strain PWD/PhJ and the wild caught mouse Apodemus sylvaticus (AS) by immunoblotting. The resulting hippocampal protein levels were correlated with results from MWM. Hippocampal signaling protein (hSP) levels were tested also in yoked controls. Within-strain comparison between trained and yoked controls revealed significant differences between levels of Phospho-CaMKII (alpha), Phospho-CREB, Egr-1, c-Src, Phospho-ERK5, Phospho-MEK5 and NOS1 in all of the three strains tested. In addition, the three strains revealed different involvement of individual hSP levels clearly indicating that individual mouse strains were linked to individual hSPs in spatial memory. Phospho-ERK5 levels were not detectable in hippocampi of yoked controls of each strain. We learn from this study that a series of hSPs are associated with spatial memory and that different hSPs are linked to spatial memory in different strains that show different outcome in the MWM. Even correlational patterns in the individual hSPs differed between mouse strains. This is of importance for the interpretation of previous studies on the abovementioned signaling cascades as well as for the design of future studies on these hippocampal proteins. It is intriguing that individual mouse strains, laboratory or wild caught, may use different signaling pathways for spatial memory in the Morris water maze.",
