     "AB": "Muscarinic (cholinergic) receptor binding sites (MRB) were studied by determining the 3H-QNB binding in four cortical areas and hippocampus of 20 histologically confirmed Alzheimer patients and comparing these with corresponding controls. Alzheimer patients dying at younger age (less than or equal to 80) with profound decrease in choline-acetyltransferase activity (by 61-85%) and without any, possibly MRB modifying, drug treatment showed 30% decrease in MRB in the frontal cortex (p less than 0.05), 28% in the temporal cortex (p less than 0.05) and 37% in the hippocampus (p less than 0.01). These findings further suggest that muscarinic receptors are affected in Alzheimer's disease, at least in advanced state of the disease.",
