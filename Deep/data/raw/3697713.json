This recovery, most likely representing structural restoration of cholinergic terminals lost to lesion-induced degeneration, is amplified by a 'conditioning' lesion. This model of functionally relevant postlesion reconstruction, by and of structures within the CNS, is suitable to search for means to enhance homotypic collateral sprouting.",
