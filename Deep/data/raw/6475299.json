The transfer was carried out by means of artificial impediment of food procuring with the preferred paw. There was no significant difference between intact and callosotomized rats in the rate of initial paw preference determination and in the rate of paw preference transfer. However, the degree of the paw preference transfer preservation was lower in the callosotomized rats as compared with intact ones. The role of interhemispheric inhibition in motor learning is discussed.",
