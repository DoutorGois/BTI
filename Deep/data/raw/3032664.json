     "AB": "MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) causes a Parkinson's disease-like syndrome in man, monkeys, and mice. We studied the effects of MPTP and its metabolite, MPP+, on neuronal properties and synaptic transmission in isolated slices of guinea-pig hippocampus using intra- and extracellular recording methods. Addition of MPTP to the superfusate (50 to 100 microM) produced the following effects: Excitatory postsynaptic potentials and extracellularly recorded population spikes, evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals were increased in amplitude during the application period (30 min). Within 30 min of washing in normal solution, synaptic transmission was blocked, although axonal population action potentials could still be elicited. The block of synaptic transmission was prevented by prior incubation in pargyline, an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. The membrane potential and resistance of single pyramidal neurons were virtually unaffected; action potentials elicited by depolarizing intracellular current pulses were also unchanged. MPP+ (50 microM) blocked synaptic transmission during the application period by a pargyline-in-sensitive mechanism. These results suggest that MPP+ blocks synaptic transmission in the hippocampus at a presynaptic site. This effect may be relevant for the acute action of MPTP and may provide some insight into its chronic action on nigrostriatal neurons.",
