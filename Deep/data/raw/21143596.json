     "AB": "The use of hippocampal dissociated neuronal cultures has enabled the study of molecular changes in endogenous native proteins associated with long-term potentiation. Using immunofluorescence labelling of the active (Thr286-phosphorylated) alpha-Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) we found that CaMKII activity was increased by transient (3 x 1 s) depolarisation in 18- to 21-day-old cultures but not in 9- to 11-day-old cultures. The increase in Thr286 phosphorylation of CaMKII required the activation of NMDA receptors and was greatly attenuated by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-62. We compared the effects of transient depolarisation on the surface expression of GluA1 and GluA2 subunits of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor and found a preferential recruitment of the GluA1 subunit. CaMKII inhibition prevented this NMDA receptor-dependent delivery of GluA1 to the cell surface. CaMKII activation is therefore an important factor in the activity-dependent recruitment of native GluA1 subunit-containing alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptors to the cell surface of hippocampal neurons.",
