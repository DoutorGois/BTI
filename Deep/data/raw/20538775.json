     "AB": "During sleep and anesthesia, a slow (<or=1 Hz) synchronized rhythmic fluctuation of the network activity in the neocortex (nCTX) is prominent. This rhythm, called the slow oscillation (SO), corresponds to sequences of neuronal activity and inactivity (UP and DOWN states) in local and extended networks. Recently, this network pattern has also been described in the hippocampus (HPC) and, interestingly, it shows a dynamic correlation with ongoing SO in the nCTX. However, because of its transient nature during both sleep and urethane anesthesia, studying the SO in the HPC is difficult. Ketamine anesthesia is known to induce a uniform and continuous SO state in the nCTX, but its effects on HPC activity and HPC-nCTX interplay are unknown. Using multisite local field potential recordings, we investigated the effects of ketamine anesthesia on HPC activity and its relation to concurrent nCTX activity. We directly compared the spectral content and spatial distribution of laminar potentials and current source density (CSD) under ketamine to urethane anesthesia. Ketamine evoked stable bouts of SO in the HPC that had a peak frequency of 1.77 +/- 0.08 Hz, slightly higher than that of urethane: 1.17 +/- 0.07 Hz. Laminar voltage and CSD profiles of SO were highly correlated across ketamine and urethane anesthesia, although a higher degree of HPC-nCTX coherence at SO frequencies appeared under ketamine as opposed to urethane. In addition, activity in the gamma bandwidth (30-40 Hz) made up 4.7% of the power spectrum under ketamine, but accounted for only 2.0% of the power spectrum in urethane. Although some differences exist, the SO under ketamine anesthesia appears highly similar to that under urethane.",
