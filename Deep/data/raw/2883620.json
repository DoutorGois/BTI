     "AB": "[3H]Glutamic acid binding to hippocampi was increased after amygdaloid kindling in rats, and diazepam inhibited this increased binding, without any effect on the enhanced binding by CaCl2 or the binding in control rats. By inducing kindling in the same way as that used in the binding experiment, the inhibiting effects of diazepam on kindled seizures, the afterdischarge and the development of kindling were observed.",
