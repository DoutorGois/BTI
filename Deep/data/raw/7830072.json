     "AB": "The effect of pros-methylimidazoleacetic acid (p-MIAA) was measured on the release of glutamate and aspartate from cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of freely moving rats, and on the uptake of 14C by striatal slices incubated in the presence of L-[14C]-glutamate. Twenty-four hours after implantation of a dialysis fiber, striatum, hippocampus, or cerebral cortex spontaneously released both glutamate and aspartate in the micromolar range. p-MIAA (1 microM to 1 mM), added to the dialysis perfusate, elicited a concentration-dependent increase of glutamate release from striatum with a maximal increase of about threefold. This effect did not occur in hippocampus or cortex. In none of these regions did p-MIAA increase aspartate release significantly. The p-MIAA effect was not mimicked by its isomer tele-methyl-imidazoleacetic acid. p-MIAA did not influence the uptake of glutamate by striatal slices. The glutamate-releasing action of p-MIAA may affect striatal function and explain the positive correlation between levels of p-MIAA in CSF and the severity of Parkinson's disease.",
