     "AB": "While the deterioration of insulin-glucose metabolism (IGM), impaired redox homeostasis (IRH), beta-amyloid accumulation was reported in Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (SAD) model, aforementioned factors related to lipoic acid administration and anthropometric indexes (AIs) are not yet studied with integrative approach. beta-amyloid accumulation, redox homeostasis biomarkers and AIs are investigated in SAD model. Streptozotocin-induced inhibition of insulin-signaling cascade but not GLUT-2 and GLUT-3 transporters takes a role in beta-amyloid accumulation. Inhibition types are related to IRH in cortex, hippocampus and systemic circulation. Lipoic acid (LA) shows both antioxidant and prooxidant effect according to the anatomical location. LA administration also leads to improved AIs during GLUT-2 inhibition and cortical redox status in GLUT-3 inhibited group. Optimal LA action could be possible if its redox behavior is balanced to antioxidant effect. Diagnostic usage of systemic IRH parameters as biomarkers and their possible correlations with deteriorated IGM should be investigated. Graphical abstract .",
