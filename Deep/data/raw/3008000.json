     "AB": "Activity-induced changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission between neurones are central to several prominent theories of learning. In both in vivo and in vitro preparations of the hippocampus, a conditioning high-frequency stimulus delivered to afferent fibres results in a long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission at those inputs. Evidence has been provided supporting both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites as loci where critical events occur in the development of potentiation. In this study we report that long-term potentiation is reversibly blocked by intracellular injection of hyperpolarizing current in the postsynaptic cell during the conditioning high-frequency stimulus, suggesting the involvement of a voltage-dependent postsynaptic mechanism.",
