     "AB": "Ovarian hormones modulate both neuronal and glial activation during the estrous cycle. These effects are particularly well characterized in the hypothalamus. Ovarian hormones also affect brain regions not directly related to reproductive function. In this study we used glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunocytochemistry to quantify astroglial cells and process density in both the neocortex and hippocampus during the estrous cycle. Our data show that the density of GFAP immunoreactive processes in the hippocampus peaks on proestrus although cell density does not change. In contrast, both GFAP immunoreactive cell and process densities are elevated on diestrus and proestrus in the supragranular layer of the somatosensory cortex and reach a nadir on estrus and metestrus. This activation pattern is not apparent in the motor or cingulate cortex. Neocortical GFAP immunoreactivity appears to follow the distribution of estrogen receptor-alpha-like immunoreactivity. Our data show that ovarian hormones have regionally specific effects on glial activation within the neocortex. Characterizing glial activation by ovarian hormones is important since astroglia are the source of numerous trophic factors and play an important, although often unrecognized, role in neuronal metabolism and function.",
