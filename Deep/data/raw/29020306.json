     "AB": "Background: The intracerebroventricular injection of ouabain, a specific inhibitor of the Na+/K+-adenosine-triphosphatase (Na+/K+-ATPase) enzyme, induces hyperactivity in rats in a putative animal model of mania. Several evidences have suggested that the protein kinase C signaling pathway is involved in bipolar disorder. In addition, it is known that protein kinase C inhibitors, such as lithium and tamoxifen, are effective in treating acute mania. Methods: In the present study, we investigated the effects of lithium and tamoxifen on the protein kinase C signaling pathway in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats submitted to the animal model of mania induced by ouabain. We showed that ouabain induced hyperlocomotion in the rats. Results: Ouabain increased the protein kinase C activity and the protein kinase C and MARCKS phosphorylation in frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats. Lithium and tamoxifen reversed the behavioral and protein kinase C pathway changes induced by ouabain. These findings indicate that the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition can lead to protein kinase C alteration. Conclusions: The present study showed that lithium and tamoxifen modulate changes in the behavior and protein kinase C signalling pathway alterations induced by ouabain, underlining the need for more studies of protein kinase C as a possible target for treatment of bipolar disorder.",
