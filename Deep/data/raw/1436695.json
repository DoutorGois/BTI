     "AB": "Denervation of dopaminergic neurons by intra nigral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) increased nerve growth factor (NGF) content in the cortex and hippocampus, both of which are innervated by cholinergic neurons. The increase continued during an observation period of 0.5-28 days after the lesion. The time course of changes in NGF content was quite different from that of cholinergic neuron denervation. The decreased dopamine content produced in the striatum by 6-OHDA injection was not recovered during the observation period. These results suggest that dopaminergic neuron damage may affect NGF synthesis.",
