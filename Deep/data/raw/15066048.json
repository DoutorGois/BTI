     "AB": "In the present study, we investigated the effect of melatonin on the outward delayed rectifier potassium currents (IK) in CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slices using patch-clamp technique in whole-cell configuration. In a concentration-dependent manner, melatonin caused a reduction of IK with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 3.75 mm. The inhibitory effect had rapid onset and was readily reversible. Melatonin shifted steady-state inactivation of IK in hyperpolarizing direction but did not alter its steady-state activation. Neither luzindole, an MT1/MT2 receptor antagonist, nor prazosin, an MT3 receptor antagonist, blocked melatonin-induced current reduction. The results indicate that melatonin-induced IK inhibition was not via activation of its own membrane receptors. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), a melatonin precursor and an agonist of serotonin receptors, when it was given in pipette internal solution but not bath solution, produced a similar inhibitory effect to that of melatonin. Moreover, indole, a major component of melatonin, reversibly and dose dependently inhibited IK with an IC50 of 3.44 mm. Present results suggest that melatonin inhibits IK in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons probably through its interaction with the intracellular indole-related domains of potassium channels.",
