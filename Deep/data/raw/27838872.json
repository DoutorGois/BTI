     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and has become an important public health concern. Accumulating evidence indicates that estradiol can both facilitate and impair memory-related processes and, as a result, the precise nature of the role that estradiol plays during AD pathology remains elusive. Therefore, the present study established a mouse model of AD using stereotactic brain injection of Abeta1-42 in which the mice were bilaterally ovariectomized to investigate the effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) treatment during different stages of the AD process (early and late stages). The cognitive deficits associated with this AD model were significantly ameliorated, and there was a significant increase in hippocampal neurogenesis in Abeta1-42 mice that received E2 treatment during the early stage of AD pathology. On the other hand, Abeta1-42 mice that received E2 treatment during the late stage of AD pathology did not exhibit any improvements in cognitive function or hippocampal neurogenesis. To reveal the mechanisms, underlying these effects, levels of oxidative stress, activity in death-associated pathways, gliosis, and synaptic function were assessed in the hippocampus. The Abeta1-42 mice that received E2 treatment during the early stage of AD pathology exhibited significant reductions in the production of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), a marked decrease in the activation of Cytochrome-c/Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3 pathway, a notable decrease in the level of gliosis a significant increase in the number of synapses (ultrastructural investigation), and a marked upregulation in synaptic function-related proteins compared to mice that received E2 treatment during the late stage of AD pathology. Taken together, these findings indicate that E2 treatment during the early stage of AD pathology might be an efficient approach to ameliorate the development of this disease.",
