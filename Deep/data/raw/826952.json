     "AB": "This study was a follow-up to our earlier data which indicated that the hippocampus was one of the brain areas in which ethanol had a preferential action. Rabbits were chronically implanted with electrodes in 9 brain areas associated with the hippocampus. The EEG and multiple-unit activity were recorded simultaneously in each area before and for 15 min after i.p. injection of ethanol at dosages of 0, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg, given in random order. Subjective evaluation of EEG tracings from all brain areas did not disclose any regional differences. The incidence of hippocampal theta rhythm was depressed transiently at the 2 lower doses and was increased in some rabbits at later post-injection times after the largest dose. Quantitative analysis of the unit activity revealed several major effects of ethanol. Individual rabbits varied significantly in their degree of response. The effects of ethanol included phasic decreases and increases, which varied with the brain area and the dose. A predominant depression of MUA occurred in the septum, fimbria/fornix, entorhinal cortex, and CA1 zone of the hippocampus. Large transient increases in MUA were noted in the CA1, hippocampal commissure, and entorhinal cortex. Overall, regional differences in unit activity consisted of a relatively greater effect in the septum, CA1, and the entorhinal cortex. Conspicuously smaller effects were evident in the CA3 and dentate zones of the hippocampus.",
