     "AB": "It is suggested that anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) mediates the delayed protective effects through activation of Jak-Stat3, PI3K-Akt and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. However, our previous experiments have demonstrated that IL-10 is capable to exert the rapid neuroprotective action through modulation of hypoxia-induced intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) response. The first purpose of the present study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of IL-10 using three models of the ischemic insults in rats: permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, ischemia in acute hippocampal slices in vitro and ischemia in cultured hippocampal cells in vitro. The second purpose of the study was to elucidate a role of [Ca(2+)]i changes in the mechanisms underlying IL-10 elicited protection of neurons and astrocytes from ischemia-induced death in cultures of primary hippocampal cells. The data presented here shown that anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is capable to induce a resistance of the brain cells to ischemia-evoked damages in in vivo and in vitro models of the ischemic insults in rats. This protective effect in cultured hippocampal cells is developed rapidly after application of IL-10 and strongly associated with the IL-10 elicited elimination of [Ca(2+)]i response to ischemia. Thus, our results provide the evidence that anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, in addition to an activation of the canonical signaling pathways, is capable to exert the rapid neuroprotective effects through transcription-independent modulation of ischemia-induced intracellular Ca(2+) responses in the brain cells.",
