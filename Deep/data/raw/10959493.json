     "AB": "Application of single transient forebrain ischemia (ISC) in adult Wistar rats, lasting 2 or 10 min, caused inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in cytoplasmic membrane fractions of hippocampus and cerebral cortex immediately after the event. In the 2-min ISC group followed by 60 min of reperfusion, the enzyme inhibition was maintained in the cortex, while there was an increase in hippocampal enzyme activity; both effects were over 1 day after the event. However, in the 10-min ISC group enzyme inhibition had been maintained for 7 days in both cerebral structures. Interestingly, ischemic preconditioning (2-min plus 10-min ISC, with a 24-hour interval in between) prevented the inhibitory effect of ischemia/reperfusion on Na+,K+-ATPase activity observed either after a single insult of 2 min or 10 min ischemia. We suggest that the maintenance of Na+,K+-ATPase activity afforded by preconditioning be related to cellular neuroprotection.",
