     "AB": "PURPOSE: This study investigated the effect of treadmill running on cognitive declines in the early and advanced stages of Alzheimer disease (AD) in 3xTg-AD mice. METHODS: At 4 months of age, 3xTg-AD mice (N = 24) were assigned to control (AD + CON, n = 12) or exercise (AD + EX, n = 12) group. At 24 months of age, 3xTg-AD mice (N = 16) were assigned to AD + CON (n = 8) or AD + EX (n = 8) group. The AD + EX mice were subjected to treadmill running for 12 wk. At each pathological stage, the background strain mice were included as wild-type control (WT + CON, n = 8-12). RESULTS: At the early stage of AD, 3xTg-AD mice had impaired short- and long-term memory based on Morris water maze along with higher cortical Abeta deposition, higher hippocampal and cortical tau pathology, and lower hippocampal and cortical PSD-95 and synaptophysin. A 12-wk treadmill running reversed the impaired cognitive declines and significantly improved the tau pathology along with suppression of the decreased PSD-95 and synaptophysin in the hippocampus and cortex. At the advanced stage of AD, 3xTg-AD mice had impaired short- and long-term memory along with higher levels of Abeta deposition, soluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, tau pathology, and lower levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, PSD-95, and synaptophysin in the hippocampus and cortex. A 12-wk treadmill running reversed the impaired cognitive declines and significantly improved the Abeta and tau pathology along with suppression of the decreased synaptic proteins and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus and cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest that treadmill running provides a nonpharmacological means to combat cognitive declines due to AD pathology.",
