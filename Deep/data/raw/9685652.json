     "AB": "We investigated the effect of chronic ethanol administration and its withdrawal on the polypeptide levels of NMDA receptor subunits such as NR1, NR2A, and NR2B in the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus using Western blot analysis technique. Our results indicate that chronic ethanol treatment upregulates NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B ( approximately 35%). At 48 h of last dose of ethanol administration, the protein content returned to almost control level, thereby demonstrating the reversibility of the changes.",
