     "AB": "The nature and severity of pre-operative memory deficits observed in unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy depend upon a number of variables. Among these variables, age of seizure onset seems to be important. The age at which the lesion is sustained could modify the normal functional organization of the brain. Many studies have examined the effect of age of onset on the severity of memory deficits but have seldom focused on the nature of such deficits (verbal/nonverbal) as a function of epileptic focus laterality. This study investigates the effect of age of onset on the nature and severity of memory impairments. Fifty-six epileptics with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy and 20 normal subjects were administered a neuropsychological evaluation. Four groups of patients were constituted: left or right temporal lobe epilepsy with early (0-5 years) or late (10 years and over) age of seizure onset. The early group showed major verbal and nonverbal memory deficits. The late group presented minor specific deficits: essentially verbal deficits with left temporal lobe seizures and nonverbal deficits with right temporal lobe seizures. These results may be interpreted in the framework of ontogenesis theories of hemispheric specialization.",
