     "AB": "The distribution and subcellular localization of calmodulin in adult and developing cerebellum was studied in rats by immunocytochemistry. Calmodulin immunoreactivity was found both in neurons and in glial cells. Within neurons the staining was particularly intense in the cell nucleus and in dendrites, the cytoplasm of the cell body was more lightly stained than the nucleus, and light immunoreactivity was observed in axons. Electron microscopic analysis confirmed the association of calmodulin with the nuclear chromatin, while the nucleolus remained unstained. The reaction product was also found overlying the membranes of several organelles, in postsynaptic densities and decorating both dendritic and axonal microtubules. In developing Purkinje cells, calmodulin immunoreactivity was found as early as 5 days after birth. During the initial phases of dendritic development (5-10 days post-natal), the reaction product was associated with the organelles of the apical cone, while little or no staining was observed in the elongating dendrites or in the cell nucleus. Later in development, calmodulin was found in primary and secondary dendrites, and by 20 days after birth immunoreactivity appeared in the cell nucleus, and in the postsynaptic densities of immature spines located in dendrites. The presence of calmodulin in the apical cone suggests the possibility that this protein may participate in the regulation of microtubule formation during the initial stages of dendritic development. Its presence in dendrites at later stages (during the period of synaptogenesis) may indicate that it also participates in the formation of synapses between the parallel fibres and dendritic spines.",
