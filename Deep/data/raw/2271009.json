     "AB": "The present work was undertaken to study the influence of intraventricularly applied methylglucamine orotate (MGO) at a memory-facilitating dose of 1 mumole vs. 1 mumole methylglucamine chloride (MGCl) as a control substance on the incorporation of intraventricularly injected [3H]acetylglucosamine into rat hippocampus and striatum plus thalamus. MGO or MGCl were applied 50 min prior to application of labelled aminosugar, the incorporation times being 1, 4 and 24 h. In non-trained animals, MGO produced an increased labelling of hippocampal proteins (20%) after 24 h, whereas labelling of the lipid fraction was virtually not altered. In trained animals (brightness discrimination model), the increase in labelling caused by MGO in hippocampal proteins was more marked (49%), and an even higher increase in labelling was noted for the hippocampal proteins was more marked (49%), and an even higher increase in labelling was noted for the hippocampal lipids (63%). The second brain region under investigation, striatum plus thalamus, showed no MGO-induced alterations in labelling. The findings are discussed in the light of the working hypothesis of the functional role of macromolecular changes occurring mainly in the hippocampus during memory formation.",
