     "AB": "Apomorphine is known to improve the retention performance of a brightness discrimination task after post-training intrahippocampal application to rats. The present study shows that the retention performance of dopamine supersensitive rats was improved by a low dose of apomorphine which was still ineffective in control animals. Dopamine supersensitivity by itself had no effect on acquisition and retention parameters of brightness discrimination. The result further supports the assumption that dopamine receptors in rat hippocampus can modulate the formation of memory.",
