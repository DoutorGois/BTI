     "AB": "Physiological levels of ROS support neurite outgrowth and axonal specification, but the mechanisms by which ROS are able to shape neurons remain unknown. Ca(2+), a broad intracellular second messenger, promotes both Rac1 activation and neurite extension. Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum, mediated by both the IP3R1 and ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels, requires physiological ROS levels that are mainly sustained by the NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex. In this work, we explore the contribution of the link between NOX and RyR-mediated Ca(2+) release toward axonal specification of rat hippocampal neurons. Using genetic approaches, we find that NOX activation promotes both axonal development and Rac1 activation through a RyR-mediated mechanism, which in turn activates NOX through Rac1, one of the NOX subunits. Collectively, these data suggest a feedforward mechanism that integrates both NOX activity and RyR-mediated Ca(2+) release to support cellular mechanisms involved in axon development. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: High levels of ROS are frequently associated with oxidative stress and disease. In contrast, physiological levels of ROS, mainly sustained by the NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex, promote neuronal development and axonal growth. However, the mechanisms by which ROS shape neurons have not been described. Our work suggests that NOX-derived ROS promote axonal growth by regulating Rac1 activity, a molecular determinant of axonal growth, through a ryanodine receptor (RyR)-mediated Ca(2+) release mechanism. In addition, Rac1, one of the NOX subunits, was activated after RyR-mediated Ca(2+) release, suggesting a feedforward mechanism between NOX and RyR. Collectively, our data suggest a novel mechanism that is instrumental in sustaining physiological levels of ROS required for axonal growth of hippocampal neurons.",
