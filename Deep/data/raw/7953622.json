     "AB": "The relative postmortem stability of the mRNA's for glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptor in rodent brain was determined using semi-quantitative in situ hybridization (ISH). Rats were killed by CO2 asphyxiation and their brains removed immediately (0 h) or following 12 h or 24 h delays. Specific hybridization of GR and MR anti-sense [35S]RNA-probe to tissue mRNA encoding these receptors was detected using film and emulsion autoradiography. The most intense labeling for GR mRNA was in the dentate gyrus followed by the CA1 hippocampal region. Lower, but still detectable signal, was apparent over CA3-CA4 pyramidal cell regions. MR mRNA was detected throughout the CA1-4 pyramidal cell fields of the hippocampus and the granular cells of the dentate gyrus. Film images demonstrated that even in the 24 h postmortem delay group intense specific signal was present in sections hybridized with both anti-sense GR and MR probes, although there was some diminution in signal intensity in cortical areas at this later postmortem delay. These initial experiments with rat brain demonstrate that the mRNA's for both GR and MR, as detected with ISH, are stable for up to 24 h following death.",
