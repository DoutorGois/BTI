     "AB": "In recent years organotypic slice cultures of hippocampal tissue of rats have been widely used to study factors involved in neuronal death. Here we used 2D electrophoresis to study the phosphoprotein profile in such cultures and the effect of oxygen/glucose deprivation on this profile. Cultures were prepared from 7-day-old rats. After 14 days in culture the phosphorylation profile in the cultures, as shown by phospho-protein markers undergoing developmental change, closely resembled the profile of fresh tissue from 23-day-old rats. The results suggest that this model could be a good method to observe the development of the tissue and its response to an ischaemic lesion",
