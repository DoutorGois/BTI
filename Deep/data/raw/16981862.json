     "AB": "PURPOSE: High-frequency activity has been recorded with intracerebral microelectrodes in epileptic patients and related to seizure genesis. Our goal was to analyze high-frequency activity recorded with electroencephalograph (EEG) macroelectrodes during the slow wave immediately following interictal spikes, given the potential importance of this presumed hyperpolarization in transforming spikes into seizures. METHODS: Depth electrode EEG recordings from 10 patients with intractable focal epilepsy were low-pass filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2,000 Hz. Spikes were categorized according to localization and morphology. Segments of 256 ms were selected immediately following (postspike), and 2 s before each spike (baseline). Power was estimated in subgamma (0-40 Hz), gamma (40-100 Hz), high frequency (100-200 Hz), and very high frequency (250-500 Hz) bands. RESULTS: Changes in power above 100 Hz were seen in 22 of 29 spike categories, consisting primarily of a widespread decrease in frequencies above 100 Hz. This decrease became spatially more restricted as frequencies increased, and coincided with the localization of largest spikes for the highest frequencies. High-frequency power decreases were prominent in the hippocampus but less common in amygdala and neocortex. High-frequency power increases were observed in the amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: Thus high-frequency EEG activity can be recorded with macroelectrodes in humans and may provide insights on neuronal mechanisms related to human epilepsy. This activity undergoes consistent modifications after EEG spikes. We propose that the reduction in high frequencies reflects a postspike depression in neuronal activity that is more pronounced in the region of spike generation. This depression is almost always seen in hippocampus but less in amygdala.",
