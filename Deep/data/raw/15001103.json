     "AB": "In the developing hippocampus, functional excitatory synaptic connections seem to be recruited from a preformed, initially silent synaptic network. This functional synapse induction requires presynaptic action potentials paired with postsynaptic depolarization, thus obeying Hebb's rule of association. During early postnatal development the hippocampus exhibits an endogenous form of patterned neuronal activity that is driven by GABAergic depolarization. We propose that this recurrent activity promotes the input-specific induction of functional synapses in the CA1 region. Thus, activity-dependent synaptic reorganization in the developing hippocampus appears to be dominated by an active recruitment of new synapses rather than an active elimination of redundant connections.",
