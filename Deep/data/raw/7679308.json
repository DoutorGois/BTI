     "AB": "The expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos is increased in neuronal cells by a number of stimuli and the usefulness of this gene as a marker of neuronal activity has been demonstrated. The temporal and spatial expression of c-fos mRNA following the induction of a unilateral cortical lesion have been investigated in the rat brain by Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization histochemistry. It was observed that the lesion evoked a rapid increase (20-fold) in the content of c-fos mRNA in the ipsilateral cortex, whereas in the contralateral cortex c-fos mRNA expression was more modest (7-fold). In the whole hippocampus a large and very rapid increase (17-fold) of c-fos mRNA expression was detected. The effect of a cortical lesion on Ca2+ uptake and membrane potential was also investigated. Using synaptosomes as a model system, we have provided evidence that Ca2+ entry via membrane depolarization increases in coordination with c-fos gene expression in neuronal cells. The principal conclusions from this study are that cortical lesions induce transient expression of the c-fos gene in specific neuronal cells of the rat brain.",
