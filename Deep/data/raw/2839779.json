     "AB": "The effects of the GABAA agonist, muscimol, and of the enantiomers of the GABAB agonist, baclofen, on the release of endogenous GABA from slices of the rat cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus were measured by means of a HPLC method with electrochemical detection. Moreover, the effect of the GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, and of the frequency of stimulation were studied in cortical slices. The amount of endogenous GABA released per impulse from cortical slices decreased by about 50% when the frequency was increased from 0.25 Hz to 1 Hz. This might indicate that GABA inhibited its own release (-)-Baclofen at 1 and 10 microM, but not its (+)-enantiomer, markedly inhibited the release of endogenous GABA, to a similar extent in all 3 areas investigated. The effect of (-)-baclofen was dependent on the frequency of stimulation: at lower frequencies (0.25 and 0.5 Hz) it was more marked than at a higher one (4 Hz). This would be expected from the results showing that the release of endogenous GABA decreases with increasing frequency, which suggests that this amino acid inhibits its own release. Muscimol at 10 microM, on the other hand, was ineffective in all 3 areas at a stimulation frequency of 0.5 Hz. Bicuculline (10 microM) at 4 Hz, at which autosuppression of GABA release is maximal did not enhance the release of endogenous GABA from cortical slices. With cerebellar or nigral slices, no adequate stimulation-induced release of endogenous GABA could be obtained under comparable conditions. These data are compatible with, but do not prove the existence of GABAB-type presynaptic autoreceptors modulating the release of this amino acid. More definite conclusions may possibly be drawn when a GABAB antagonist becomes available, which is expected to enhance GABA release under appropriate conditions.",
