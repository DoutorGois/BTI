     "AB": "Several recent studies have suggested a critical role for nitric oxide (NO) production in hippocampal LTP and LTD. In this study we show that normal LTP and LTD can be induced in rat hippocampal slices incubated in the NO synthase inhibitor L-NG-nitroarginine (NOArg) (100 microM). A test of NMDA-stimulated cGMP production demonstrated that incubation of slices in 100 microM NOArg effectively inhibited NO synthase. Our results suggest that NO synthase activity may not be required for the generation of LTP or LTD in CA1 of rat hippocampus.",
