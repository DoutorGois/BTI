     "AB": "The effect of propofol on the toxicity induced by glutamate (GLU), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kainate (KA), and amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) was investigated on cultured fetal rat hippocampal neurons. The degree of neuronal injury was quantified by measuring the release of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) into the culture media. The toxicity induced by brief exposure to GLU (10(-4) M) or to NMDA (10(-4) M) was significantly reduced by propofol, whereas that elicited by KA, AMPA (10(-4) M), or long GLU exposure was unaffected. In conclusion, high concentrations of propofol significantly attenuate NMDA receptor-mediated glutamate neurotoxicity in vitro. Further studies are needed to confirm this beneficial effect in vivo and to evaluate propofol as a neuroprotective anesthetic agent in pathologies involving glutamate release and NMDA-mediated toxicity.",
