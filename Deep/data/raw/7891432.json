     "AB": "The behavioral effects of ceroid-lipofuscin accumulation, induced by intraperitoneal administration of acetyl-ethyl-tetramethyl-tetralin (AETT) in Wistar rats for 3 months, were examined in the present studies. A significant increase in neuronal ceroidlipofuscin was demonstrated neuropathologically as well as morphometrically. Although the AETT-intoxicated rats showed neither alteration of locomotor activity nor shock sensitivity, a significant impairment of learning ability, especially an acquisition trial in passive avoidance tests, was observed. Results of the present studies indicate the possibility that a diffuse lipofuscin accumulation causes a learning impairment in rats. The results also imply the possibility of a significant role of age-related lipofuscin accumulation in the dementing processes of human especially in the elderly.",
