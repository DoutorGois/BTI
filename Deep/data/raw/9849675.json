     "AB": "There is considerable controversy surrounding the mechanism of expression of long-term potentiation of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, a process thought to be important for learning and memory in the mammalian CNS. We have re-examined the expression mechanism of this form of synaptic plasticity using whole-cell dendritic recordings, minimal stimulation to activate one or a few synapses, and failures analysis. Dendritic recordings provide improved resolution of small synaptic events, as compared to previous studies using somatic recordings, because there is less dendritic filtering of signals. We find that long-term potentiation (LTP) is associated with changes in the size of synaptic responses when they occur (potency) in all cells and this is accompanied by significant decreases in failure rate in approximately 60% of the experiments. This suggests that in some cells an increase in quantal amplitude is the sole expression mechanism for LTP and, in the cells where failure rate decreased, there is an additional mechanism causing a change in quantal content.",
