     "AB": "NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline), a selective antagonist of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptors, at an anticonvulsant dose of 40 mg/kg (i.p.), was shown in vivo to have no effects on either the field potentials in the piriform cortex or those in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The same dose of NBQX also exerted no significant effects on long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. These results suggest that the mechanism underlying the anticonvulsant action of NBQX in vivo does not involve a suppressive action on physiological synaptic transmission. The possible clinical usefulness of AMPA receptor antagonists as antiepileptic drugs is suggested.",
