     "AB": "Recently emerging evidence suggests important roles for inositol polyphosphates and inositol phospholipids in neuronal Ca2+ signalling, membrane vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal rearrangement. A prerequisite for a detailed physiological characterization of the signalling of both potential second messengers inositol-(1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate (InsP4) and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdInsP3) in the nervous system is the precise cellular localization of their receptors. Based on the cDNA sequence of a recently cloned brain-specific receptor with high affinity for both InsP4 and PtdInsP3 (InsP4-PtdInsP3R), p42IP4/centaurin-alpha, we localized the mRNA and the protein in rat brain. In situ hybridization revealed a widespread expression of the InsP4-PtdInsP3R with prominent labelling in cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex and thalamus, which moreover is developmentally regulated. Using peptide-specific antibodies, the immunoreactivity was localized in the adult brain in the vast majority of neuronal cell types and probably also in some glial cells. Prominent immunoreactivity was found in axonal processes and in cell types characterized by extensive neurites. In the hypothalamus a subpopulation of parvocellular neurons in the peri- and paraventricular nuclei was most heavily labelled. This was confined by strong immunoreactivity in the lamina externa of the median eminence in close proximity to portal plexus blood vessels. Electron microscopy revealed that the InsP4-PtdInsP3R was frequently associated with presynaptic vesicular structures. Further studies should identify the role of the InsP4-PtdInsP3R in cellular neural processes.",
