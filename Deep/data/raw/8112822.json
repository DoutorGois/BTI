     "AB": "Schwann cells cultured from neonatal rat peripheral nerve were injected into the fimbria and hippocampus of syngeneic adult rats by a microtransplantation technique which causes minimal disturbance to the host brain structure at the site of implantation, and thus allows the grafted cells to come into immediate contact with intact host tissue. Numerous Schwann cells could be identified for up to 6 weeks (and with decreasing frequency for up to 3 months) by intense immunoreactivity for low affinity nerve growth factor receptor. The transplanted cells adopted a distinctive elongated form, with a central, ovoid nucleus flanked by processes which were up to 300 microns long, and which ranged from swollen segments with a diameter as large as 12 microns down to thread-like fibres of 1 micron or less. This morphology is different from that of any of the host cells. The transplanted Schwann cells migrated freely into the host tissue along blood vessels and according to the position of the grafts, they either entered the hippocampal neuropil, or migrated (for distances of up to 2 mm) along the longitudinal axis of the fimbria, where they were interspersed in parallel with the interfascicular glial rows and axons. The host astrocytes did not appear to impede the migration of the donor Schwann cells. Although the host astrocytic processes became hypertrophic, with increased glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin expression, the predominant longitudinal orientation of the astrocytic tract processes was maintained. The transplanted Schwann cells did not form peripheral myelin (as detected by P0 immunoreactivity), and it is not clear whether they survive beyond the period at which we detect them.",
