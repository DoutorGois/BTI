     "AB": "We used a double-labeling protocol that combined the silver amplification of endogenous zinc with routine immunocytochemistry to determine if telencephalic neurons that exhibit GABA-, calbindin- or parvalbumin-like immunoreactivity give rise to zinc-containing boutons. We did not observe telencephalic neurons double-labeled for zinc and GABA or parvalbumin. Zinc and strong calbindin immunoreactivity were colocalized in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells. Other strongly calbindin-immunoreactive neurons of the telencephalon were never double-labeled. We conclude that GABAergic cells do not contain histochemically reactive zinc and, therefore, are unlikely to use this pool of zinc as a neuromodulator. This observation does not support an in vivo significance of the modulation of GABA receptors by zinc such as has been observed in vitro. In CA1 of the hippocampus, we observed the histochemical label for zinc in all visibly calbindin-immunoreactive pyramidal cells and vice versa. Thus, two markers define a subpopulation of hippocampal pyramidal cells.",
