     "AB": "Kai Xin San is a Chinese herbal formula composed of Radix Ginseng, Poria, Radix Polygalae and Acorus Tatarinowii Rhizome. It has been used in China for many years for treating amnesia. Kai Xin San ameliorates amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced cognitive dysfunction and is neuroprotective in vivo, but its precise mechanism remains unclear. Expression of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which degrades Abeta, is strongly correlated with cognitive function. Here, we injected rats with exogenous Abeta42 (200 muM, 5 muL) into the hippocampus and subsequently administered Kai Xin San (0.54 or 1.08 g/kg/d) intragastrically for 21 consecutive days. Hematoxylin-eosin and Nissl staining revealed that Kai Xin San protected neurons against Abeta-induced damage. Furthermore, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blot and polymerase chain reaction results showed that Kai Xin San decreased Abeta42 protein levels and increased expression of IDE protein, but not mRNA, in the hippocampus. Our findings reveal that Kai Xin San facilitates hippocampal Abeta degradation and increases IDE expression, which leads, at least in part, to the alleviation of hippocampal neuron injury in rats.",
