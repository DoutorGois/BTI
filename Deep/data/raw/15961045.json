     "AB": "Neural regions modulating prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response, an operational measure of sensorimotor gating, are well established from animal studies using surgical and pharmacological procedures. The limbic and cortico-pallido-striato-thalamic circuitry is thought to be responsible for modulation of PPI in the rat. The involvement of this circuitry in human PPI is suggested by observations of deficient PPI in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by abnormalities at some level in this circuitry and recent functional neuroimaging studies in humans. The current study sought to investigate structural neural correlates of PPI in a sample of twenty-four right-handed, healthy subjects (10 men, 14 women). Subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 T and were assessed (off-line) on acoustic PPI using electromyographic recordings of the orbicularis oculi muscle beneath the right eye. Optimized volumetric voxel-based morphometry (VBM) implemented in SPM99 was used to investigate the relationship of PPI (prepulse onset-to-pulse onset interval 120 ms) to regional grey matter volumes, covarying for sex. Significant positive correlations were obtained between PPI and grey matter volume in the hippocampus extending to parahippocampal gyrus, basal ganglia including parts of putamen, globus pallidus, and nucleus accumbens, superior temporal gyrus, thalamus, and inferior frontal gyrus. These findings identify the relationship between PPI and grey matter availability on a highly spatially localized scale in brain regions shown to be activated in recent functional neuroimaging studies in association with PPI in healthy humans and demonstrate the validity of structural neuroimaging methods in delineating the neural mechanisms underlying human PPI.",
