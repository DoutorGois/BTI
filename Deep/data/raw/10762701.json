     "AB": "Seizures trigger a variety of biochemical processes including an influx of extracellular Ca(2+), activation of membrane phospholipases, liberation of free fatty acids, diacylglycerols, eicosanoids, lipid peroxides and free radicals. These lipid metabolites along with abnormal ion homeostasis may be involved in cell injury and cell death. The aim of this study was to determine brain antioxidant enzyme activities in rats with electroconvulsive shock (ECS)-induced seizures. ECS, single or repeated, induced a decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities in various brain regions. The most prominent changes of enzymatic activities were observed in rats that received five ECSs with 24-h recovery period between them. Decreased SOD activity was observed in the frontal cortex of all treated animals except those sacrificed 24 h after single ECS, in the cerebellum of the animals that received repeated ECSs, in the hippocampus of animals that were decapitated 2 h after a single ECS and in the pons-medulla region of rats that received five daily ECSs. Decreased GPX activity was found in all examined brain regions of the rats that received five ECSs, the cortex and hippocampus of rats that were decapitated 2 h after single ECS and the cortex of those that received 10 ECSs with 48 h between them. The results show that neither 24-h nor 48-h recovery period was sufficient for the normalisation of antioxidative enzyme activities after repeated ECS treatment.",
