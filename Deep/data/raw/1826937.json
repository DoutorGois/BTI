     "AB": "Recent electrophysiological studies, measurements of 5-HT synthesis and in vivo voltammetry recordings of 5-HT metabolism have suggested that serotoninergic neurones in the median raphe (MR) are less sensitive to 5-HT1A autoreceptor stimulation relative to those in the dorsal raphe (DR). To further study the putative differences in regulation between ascending 5-HT projections from the raphe nuclei we have used microdialysis to measure the release of 5-HT in ventral hippocampus, globus pallidus, dorsal hippocampus, frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and medial septum, following systemic administration of the specific 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT. The results show that the baseline output of 5-HT was similar in each of the areas studied. While 8-OH-DPAT decreased dialysate levels of 5-HT in all areas, the inhibition of 5-HT release seen in globus pallidus was significantly less marked compared to that observed in the other five regions. The results indicate that 5-HT1A autoreceptor-mediated control of 5-HT release is functional in all of the brain areas studied, including those receiving a preferential 5-HT innervation from the DR and MR. We find little evidence in support of the idea that brain 5-HT neuronal projections are heterogenous with respect to 5-HT1A autoreceptor regulation of 5-HT release; the globus pallidus, however representing a possible exception to this.",
