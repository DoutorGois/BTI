     "AB": "Possible target preferences of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons were studied in organotypic slice cultures. Cholinergic neurons in slices of medial septum or substantia innominata send axons into both hippocampus and neocortex when co-cultured together. However, septal cholinergic axons course through adjacent slices of neocortex to reach and branch densely in slices of hippocampus, but septal axons seldom grow beyond adjacent hippocampal tissue to reach neocortex. In contrast, cholinergic axons from substantia innominata commonly grow through hippocampus to reach neocortex, and also grow through neocortex to reach hippocampus, with similar branching densities in each target. The greater density of septal axonal branches in hippocampus than in neocortex suggests a preference of septal axons for the hippocampal target.",
