     "AB": "The nitric oxide donor hydroxylamine (NH2OH) induced a transient depression of the evoked synaptic potential recorded in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. This depression was abolished with an adenosine A1 antagonist, 8-cyclopentyltheophylline. In addition, hydroxylamine reversed adenosine A1 receptor-mediated inhibition of the evoked population spike, the fEPSP and the intracellularly recorded EPSP. The inhibitory modulation of adenosine A1 receptor activation by hydroxylamine suggests the presence of a potent endogenous regulatory site.",
