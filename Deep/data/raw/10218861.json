     "AB": "Excessive release of glutamate during ischemia leads to sustained neuronal damage. In this study we investigated the influence of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation on neuronal recovery from a hypoxic/hypoglycemic event in hippocampal slices from rats. The slices were transiently exposed to an oxygen- and glucose-free environment in an interface chamber and the synaptically evoked population spike in the CA1 region was taken as a measure of neuronal viability. Under control conditions the population spike amplitude recovered to 41.4% of baseline value within 1 h after hypoxia/hypoglycemia. The specific mGluR group I agonist 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG, 10 microM) increased the recovery rate to 88.3% of baseline value when applied from 20 min before until 10 min after the event. Similar recovery rates were obtained when DHPG was present only 10 or 20 min before hypoxia/hypoglycemia (89.3% and 79.3% of baseline value, respectively). However, when applied later, DHPG had no protective effect. Co-application of the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors staurosporine (100 nM) or chelerythrine (30 microM) prevented the protective effect of DHPG. Our data suggest that group I mGluR agonists are only protective when present prior to the onset of the hypoxic/hypoglycemic event and that the activation of PKC is a critical step of the protective mechanism.",
