     "AB": "It has been reported that some atypical antipsychotics promote neurogenesis in the hippocampus and possibly in the frontal cortex. Atypical antipsychotics are a heterogeneous group of drugs. Hence the question arises as to whether neurogenesis is a class effect which relates to them all. We here present a literature search which we have carried out to establish this.",
