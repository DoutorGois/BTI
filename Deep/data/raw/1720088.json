     "AB": "The intracellular localization of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was studied in male rat brain, pituitary, liver, and thymus. Two new polyclonal anti-GR antibodies, GR 57 and GR 59, raised against two synthetic peptides (346-357 and 245-259) that correspond to unique regions of the amino-terminus of human GR were used. Vibratome sections (30-50 microns) of perfused brain and frozen sections (6-8 microns) of pituitary, liver, and thymus fixed in paraformaldehyde were incubated in preimmune serum, immunoserum, epitope-purified immunoserum, or peptide-absorbed immunoserum of either GR 57 or GR 59 and immunostained by the avidin-biotin peroxidase method. GR immunoreactivity (GR-ir) was primarily nuclear in brain, pituitary, liver, and thymus sections from intact rats. Adrenalectomy caused nuclear GR-ir to decrease and cytoplasmic GR-ir to increase. When adrenalectomized rats were treated with corticosterone (100 micrograms and 1 mg) or dexamethasone (1 microgram, 100 micrograms, and 1 mg), GR-ir was again predominantly nuclear. One microgram of corticosterone failed to cause nuclear GR-ir when administered to adrenalectomized rats. Immunoreactive neurons and glial cells were extensively distributed, with varied intensity, throughout the rat forebrain. The areas include cortex, septum, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, and hypothalamus. Cells with the strongest GR-ir were located in the caudate putamen, paraventricular, arcuate, and central amygdala nuclei, areas CA1-CA2 of the hippocampus, and laminae 4 and 5 of the cortex. In the pituitary, cells of the anterior and posterior lobes were GR immunoreactive, while those in the intermediate lobe were not. Hepatocytes of the liver and thymocytes and reticuloepithelial cells of the thymus were GR immunoreactive. The results show that GR can be localized immunocytochemically in numerous rat tissues using antipeptide polyclonal antibodies and correlated with the results of biochemical and ligand receptor studies.",
