     "AB": "Kainic acid is an analog of glutamate. The CA3-4 field of the hippocampus is extremely sensitive to its toxic properties. Intracerebroventricular injection of of nontoxic doses of kainic acid in rats produces behaviors similar to morphine withdrawal. Lesion of CA3-4 abolishes this response to kainic acid. Destruction of CA3-4 blocks the ability of Met-enkephalin, ketocyclazocine, and 5-hydroxytryptophan, but not sodium valproate or ice water to induce withdrawal-like behaviors. The actions of kainic acid, endorphins, and ketocyclazocine are blocked by naloxone and enhanced by opiate agonists. Sodium valproate, ice water, and withdrawal itself are released by naloxone and blocked by opiate agonists. Similar discriminations by CA3-4 lesions and challenge by naloxone and morphine may indicate that two neural circuits exist through which withdrawal-like behaviors are evoked. The hippocampal circuit is not directly involved in dependence, but may modulate withdrawal. Withdrawal-like behaviors are observed in rats in situations where behavior is blocked. These withdrawal-like behaviors are reminiscent of verbal reports of anxiety. In particular, wet-dog shakes in these situations may be analogous to shuddering. In humans, monosodium glutamate intolerance is associated with shuddering.",
