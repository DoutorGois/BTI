     "AB": "Most neurons co-express two catalytic isoforms of Na,K-ATPase, the ubiquitous alpha1, and the more selectively expressed alpha3. Although neurological syndromes are associated with alpha3 mutations, the specific role of this isoform is not completely understood. Here, we used electrophysiological and Na(+) imaging techniques to study the role of alpha3 in central nervous system neurons expressing both isoforms. Under basal conditions, selective inhibition of alpha3 using a low concentration of the cardiac glycoside, ouabain, resulted in a modest increase in intracellular Na(+) concentration ([Na(+)](i)) accompanied by membrane potential depolarization. When neurons were challenged with a large rapid increase in [Na(+)](i), similar to what could be expected following suprathreshold neuronal activity, selective inhibition of alpha3 almost completely abolished the capacity to restore [Na(+)](i) in soma and dendrite. Recordings of Na,K-ATPase specific current supported the notion that when [Na(+)](i) is elevated in the neuron, alpha3 is the predominant isoform responsible for rapid extrusion of Na(+). Low concentrations of ouabain were also found to disrupt cortical network oscillations, providing further support for the importance of alpha3 function in the central nervous system. The alpha isoforms express a well conserved protein kinase A consensus site, which is structurally associated with an Na(+) binding site. Following activation of protein kinase A, both the alpha3-dependent current and restoration of dendritic [Na(+)](i) were significantly attenuated, indicating that alpha3 is a target for phosphorylation and may participate in short term regulation of neuronal function.",
