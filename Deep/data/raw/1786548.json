After 3 h, APP695 rapidly accumulated in dystrophic neurites near the damaged site. After 3 days, APP with Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain was expressed in reactive astrocytes in the lesion and ipsilateral hippocampus. APP rapidly accumulated in dystrophic neurites, and different types of APP were expressed in different cell types in the damaged brain.",
