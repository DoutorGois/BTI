     "AB": "Various types of learning, including operant conditioning, induce an increase in cellular activation concomitant with an increase in local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU). This increase is mediated by increased cerebral blood flow or changes in brain capillary density and diameter. Because glucose transporters are ultimately responsible for glucose uptake, we examined their plastic expression in response to cellular activation. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that cerebral glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression consistently parallels changes in LCGU. The present study is the first to investigate the effect of memory processing on glucose transporters expression. Changes in GLUT expression produced by training in an operant conditioning task were measured in the brain of CD1 mice. Using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry, Western blot and real time RT-PCR the cerebral GLUT1 and GLUT3 expression was quantified immediately, 220 min and 24 h following training. Relative to sham-trained and naive controls, operant conditioning training induced an immediate increase in GLUT1 immunoreactivity level in the hippocampus CA1 pyramidal cells as well as in the sensorimotor cortex. At longer post-learning delays, GLUT1 immunoreactivity decreased in the sensorimotor cortex and putamen. Parallel to the changes in protein levels, hippocampus GLUT1 mRNA level also increased immediately following learning. No effect of learning was found on hippocampal GLUT3 protein or mRNA expression. Measures of changes in glucose transporters expression present a link between cellular activation and glucose metabolism. The learning-induced localized increases in GLUT1 protein as well as mRNA levels observed in the present study confirm the previous findings that GLUT1 expression is plastic and respond to changes in cellular metabolic demands.",
