     "AB": "Young and aged rats were treated chronically with ethanol or scopolamine. Muscarinic receptors were measured in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Following scopolamine treatment muscarinic receptor density in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum of young rats increased by 34, 57 and 27%, respectively; in brains of aged rats the increase was 41% in cerebral cortex, 43% in hippocampus and nil in striatum. Affinity of muscarinic receptors was not changed by scopolamine treatment. Following chronic ethanol administration there was a 48% increase in cortical muscarinic receptor density in young, but not aged rats. The density of muscarinic receptors in hippocampus and striatum of both young and aged rats was not affected by ethanol treatment. Affinity of receptors in hippocampus of aged, ethanol-treated rats was increased compared to age-matched controls. Adaptative responses of the muscarinic receptor/transducer system to neurotransmitter availability are present in both young and aged rats, both the ethanol-induced response is present only in young animals. This suggests differences in the mechanism of action of ethanol and receptor agonists and antagonists in modulating receptor plasticity.",
