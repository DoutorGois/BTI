     "AB": "The alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA) type of ionotropic glutamate receptor is the major mediator of fast neurotransmission in the brain and spinal cord. Most AMPA receptors are impermeable to calcium because they contain the GluR2 subunit. However, some AMPA receptors lack GluR2 and pass calcium which can mediate synaptic plasticity and, in excess, neurotoxicity. Previously, we showed a decrease in the density of synaptic AMPA receptors in the hippocampus of mice lacking GluR2. In this study, using these GluR2-lacking mice, we examined other areas of the brain that differ in the amount of GluR2 normally present. Like hippocampal spines, cerebellar Purkinje spines normally express AMPA receptors with high GluR2 and showed a decrease in synaptic AMPA receptors in mutant mice. In contrast, neurons that normally express AMPA receptors with little or no GluR2, such as in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus, showed no decrease in AMPA receptors and even showed an increase in one AMPA receptor subunit. These two different patterns may relate to preadaptations to prevent calcium neurotoxicity; such mechanisms might be absent in Purkinje and hippocampal spines so that these neurons must decrease their total expression of synaptic AMPA receptors (calcium permeable in mutant mice) to prevent calcium neurotoxicity. In addition, we found that another glutamate receptor, GluRdelta2, which is abundant only in parallel fibre synapses on Purkinje cells and in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, is up-regulated at these synapses in mutant mice; this probably reflects some change in GluRdelta2 targeting to these synapses.",
