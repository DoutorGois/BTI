     "AB": "The generation, propagation and pharmacological properties of low-Mg2+ -induced epileptiform activity were examined in the intact corticohippocampal formation (CHF) of the newborn (P0-4) mouse in vitro. Multi-site field potential recordings in dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, CA1, entorhinal cortex (EC) and temporal cortex (TC) revealed in 0.2 mM Mg2+ -containing ACSF a stable pattern of spontaneous epileptiform activity consisting of recurrent ictal-like events (ILEs) and interictal events (IEs). Although this activity could be consistently observed as early as P0, ILEs were smaller in amplitude, less frequent and showed a slower onset in P0-2 as compared to P3-4 animals. In all age groups, epileptiform events were largest in CA3 and smallest in EC and TC. A specific pacemaker region could not be identified since ILEs appeared simultaneously at all recording sites. Reducing the extracellular Mg2+ concentration to 0.1 mM or nominally zero caused an increase in ILE frequency. Pharmacological studies in the P3-4 age group with 0.2 mM Mg2+ revealed a complete blockade of the ILEs by an NMDA receptor antagonist and a pronounced suppression of epileptiform activity by an AMPA/kainate antagonist. Application of a GABA-A receptor antagonist induced repetitive bursts of interictal discharges, which persisted for at least 1.5 h after washout of the antagonist. Our data demonstrate that the intact CHF in vitro preparation of the newborn mouse offers a most valuable model to study epileptiform activity in the immature limbic system.",
