     "AB": "An antiserum specific for cholinergic terminals was used to identify an antigen conserved between Elasmobranchs and mammals. Immunohistochemistry and a cytotoxicity test were used to assay the binding of antibody to mammalian terminals. Torpedo electric organ gangliosides totally abolished antibody binding. The highest inhibitory activity was associated with a single polysialoganglioside band on TLC plates. Neuraminidase altered the migration of the inhibitory activity on TLC plates. Antibody binding was inhibited by ganglioside fractions derived from chicken and mammalian brains. A summary of those tissues in which the antigen has been detected is presented. The possible function of the antigen is discussed.",
