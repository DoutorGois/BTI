     "AB": "Adult male, but not female, rats demonstrate a suppression in hippocampal cell proliferation in response to an acute predator odour stress. The present study examined the effect of activational levels of androgens on stress-induced changes in hippocampal cell proliferation and defensive and non-defensive behaviours in adult male rats. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were castrated and exposed to trimethylthiazoline (TMT, the main component of fox feces). Androgen status did not significantly affect TMT-induced suppression in hippocampal cell proliferation or expression of defensive burying. However, castrated males did not show an increase in duration of stretch attends (a risk assessment behaviour) in response to TMT. The results of this study suggest that activational levels of androgens in the male rat do not directly regulate the sex difference in stress-induced suppression of hippocampal cell proliferation but do regulate risk assessment behaviour.",
