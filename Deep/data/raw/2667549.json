Series of experiments in mice, using a 8-arm radial maze with or without cholinergic drugs or chronic alcohol consumption supply arguments for multiple memory stores and for cholinergic influence greatest for short-term system. Studies of differential cholinergic activation following training militate for dissociation in time of hippocampal and cortical cholinergic pathways. Age-related memory involvement seems to be associated with an attenuation of central cholinergic activation. Several problems inherent to sensitivity and selectivity of the tasks remain in discussion.",
