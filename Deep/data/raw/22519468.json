     "AB": "Accurate protein identification and quantitation are critical when interpreting the biological relevance of large-scale shotgun proteomics data sets. Although significant technical advances in peptide and protein identification have been made, accurate quantitation of high-throughput data sets remains a key challenge in mass spectrometry data analysis and is a labor intensive process for many proteomics laboratories. Here, we report a new SILAC-based proteomics quantitation software tool, named IsoQuant, which is used to process high mass accuracy mass spectrometry data. IsoQuant offers a convenient quantitation framework to calculate peptide/protein relative abundance ratios. At the same time, it also includes a visualization platform that permits users to validate the quality of SILAC peptide and protein ratios. The program is written in the C# programming language under the Microsoft .NET framework version 4.0 and has been tested to be compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows 7. It is freely available to noncommercial users at http://www.proteomeumb.org/MZw.html .",
