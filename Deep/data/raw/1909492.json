     "AB": "Antibodies directed against three regions of tau have been used in a histologic study of granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Granulovascular degeneration complexes, consisting of a dense granule in a less-dense vacuole, were found in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in all patients studied. Anti-tau antibodies directed against the N-and C-termini, and the repeat region of tau, were found to immunolabel the granule of the GVD complex. Intracellular neurofibrillary tangles also were labeled by these antibodies. In particular, MAb6.423, which recognizes tau protein sequestered in paired helical filaments (PHF) in AD, but not the normal tau proteins so far described in human brain, labeled GVD granules. Contrarily, a generic tau marker (MAb7.51), which immunolabels all known isoforms of isolated and expressed tau protein, including PHF-tau, did not label the GVD granule. These findings demonstrate that the entire tau molecule is sequestered within the GVD granule, and that the tau protein found in GVD complexes is antigenically related to that found in PHFs. There is, however, a difference in the way in which the repeat region of tau is incorporated into the two structures, making the MAb7.51 epitope unavailable in the GVD complex. These findings suggest that the formation of GVD complexes in hippocampal pyramidal neurons vulnerable to neurofibrillary degeneration may represent an alternative pathway for dealing with an aberrant molecular complex, which contributes to the formation of GVD granules and neurofibrillary tangles in AD.",
