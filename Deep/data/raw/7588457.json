We report 3 patients who had hippocampal electrographic seizures documented with intracranial EEG recording with no accompanying scalp EEG change immediately preceding psychogenic unresponsiveness. Each patient also had complex partial seizures (CPS) originating in the hippocampus. Some individuals can have complex interactions of epileptic and nonepileptic seizures.",
