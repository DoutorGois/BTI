     "AB": "The anesthetic potencies of n-alcohols increase progressively with lengthening of the carbon chain and then disappear at a cut-off point of a longer-chain n-alcohol. In order to assess the mechanisms for cut-off in mammalian central nervous system, the effects of a series of n-alcohols (C(2)-C(11)) were examined on the evoked synaptic potentials of the rat hippocampal preparation in vitro. The n-alcohols (C(2)-C(10)) reduced the slope of the excitatory post-synaptic potential in a concentration-dependent manner, and the inhibitory potencies enhanced as a function of carbon chain length. The effect disappeared at n-undecanol (C(11)). The Hill coefficients of the concentration-response curves of the n-alcohols negatively correlated with the number of carbon atoms. The decrease in the Hill coefficient could account for the cut-off phenomenon, indicating that the results can support the anesthetic pocket hypothesis.",
