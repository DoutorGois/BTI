     "AB": "Monosynaptic evoked field potentials (EPs) in response to paired-pulse stimulation (20 ms interval) were recorded in area CA1 and fascia dentata of the same animal in the course of development of a kindled focus in the CA1 region. A significant reduction of paired pulse depression in response to medium and high stimulation intensity was found in CA1. A similar change was found in the fascia dentata in response to medium intensity stimulation of the angular bundle. In contrast, at high intensity, paired pulse depression was enhanced in the fascia dentata in the course of kindling. These results indicate that kindling epileptogenesis is accompanied by regionally different changes in recurrent inhibition: a reduction in CA1 and intensity dependent changes in fascia dentata.",
