Combined 5-HT1D/1E sites were the predominant 5-HT1 subtype (66-95% of total 5-HT1 sites in all regions except hippocampus (38% of total 5-HT1 sites). Globus pallidus contained the highest density and the highest proportion of 5HT1D sites (74% of total 5-HT1 sites). 5HT1D sites in the other brain areas accounted for 19-27% of the total 5-HT1 sites. The highest densities and the highest proportions of 5-HT1E sites were in caudate (72%) and putamen (64%) and the lowest density and lowest proportion in hippocampus (16%).",
