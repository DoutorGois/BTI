It has been established that in the mechanism of brain epileptization, of paramount importance is the formation of new immature contacts, hypertrophy of functionally active synapses followed by their splitting and complication of the synaptic arrangement by the convergent and divergent type in the presence of derangement and death of a part of synapses. This is characteristic to a greater measure of the cortex from the area marked by regular epileptic activity and to a less measure of the hippocampus and amygdaloid complex.",
