     "AB": "The orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) receives inputs from the CA1/subicular (CA1/S) region of the ventral hippocampus and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA). Despite many studies about these projections, little is known as to how CA1/S and BLA inputs converge and interact within the OMPFC. Extracellular recordings of single-unit activity in the OMPFC were performed in sodium pentobarbitone-anesthetized rats. OMPFC neurons driven by CA1/S or BLA stimulation were more frequently encountered in the ventral portion of the prelimbic (v-PrL) and infralimbic cortex (IL). OMPFC neurons showing excitatory convergence of both inputs from the CA1/S and BLA were also located predominantly in the v-PrL and IL. The excitatory latencies of these neurons from both the CA1/S and BLA revealed almost identical values. Excitatory responses of OMPFC neurons to CA1/S (or BLA) stimulation were markedly augmented by simultaneous BLA (or CA1/S) stimulation, whereas the inhibitory influence of the BLA (or CA1/S) on CA1/S-induced (or BLA-induced) excitation was apparent when BLA (or CA1/S) stimulation was given 20-40 msec before CA1/S (or BLA) stimulation. Similar results were also observed when reciprocal connections between the CA1/S and BLA were severed to exclude the influences of these connections on one another. From these studies, we concluded that excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the hippocampus and amygdala converge and interact in the v-PrL and IL. Furthermore, the results indicate that simultaneous activation of hippocampal and amygdalar neurons may be important for amplification of OMPFC neuronal activity.",
