     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: A rapid, reliable and simple method detecting monoamine neurotransmitters in rat serum and brain tissue by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detector was developed. METHODS: An ODS column was selected as separation column at room temperature,and the mobile phase (pH4.50) consisted of 0.02 mol/L trisodium citrate and 0.05 mol/L disodium phosphate, containing 15% methanol (volume ratio)in distilled water. The mobile phase was pumped at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and the oxidation potential was set at +0.065 mV. Dihydroxybenzylamine was used as the internal standard for quantification. Four compounds, epinephrine (E), dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT) in the brain tissue ((whole cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, midbrain, cerebellum) and serum were simultaneously separated and determined under the above conditions. RESULTS: RSD of the retention times and peak areas of standard sample was in the range 0.29%-0.67% and 0.09%-0.36%. The recoveries of all analytes were over 85%. The detection limits of 0.083 ng/ml for NE, 0.51 ng/ml for E, 0.046 ng/ml for DA and 0.078ng/ml for 5-HT were achieved with standard solutions. The linearity is over the range 1.0-100 ng/ml for NE, 5.0-80 ng/ml for E,1.0-80 ng/ ml for DA and 1.0-60 ng/ml for 5-HT. CONCLUSION: The assay had been applied successfully to measure simultaneously cortex and serum concentrations of these four monoamines in rats.",
