     "PG": "338-48",
     "AB": "It is suggested that the hippocampus functions as a comparator by making a comparison between the internal representation and actual sensory information from the environment (for instance, comparing a previously learned location of a food reward with an actual novel location of a food reward in a Y-maze). However, it remains unclear to what extent the various hippocampal regions contribute to this comparator function. One of the proteins known to be crucially involved in the formation of hippocampus-dependent long-term memory is the adenosine 3',5' cyclic monophosphate dependent protein kinase (PKA). Here, we examined region-specific changes in immunoreactivity (ir) of the regulatory IIalpha,beta subunits of PKA (PKA RIIalpha,beta-ir) in the hippocampus during various stages of spatial learning in a Y-maze reference task. Thereafter, we compared changes in hippocampal PKA RIIalpha,beta-ir induced by training and reversal training in which the food reward was relocated to the previously unrewarded arm. We show that: (1) There was a clear correlation between behavioral performance and elevated PKA RIIalpha,beta-ir during the acquisition phase of both training and reversal training in area CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG), (2) PKA RIIalpha,beta-ir was similarly enhanced in area CA1 during the acquisition phase of reversal training, but did not correlate with behavioral performance, (3) PKA RIIalpha,beta-ir did not change during training or reversal training in the subiculum (SUB), (4) No changes in PKA RIIalpha,beta protein levels were found using Western blotting, and (5) AMPA receptor phosphorylation at serine 845 (S845p; the PKA site on the glutamate receptor 1 subunit (GluR1)), was enhanced selectively during the acquisition phase of reversal training. These findings reveal that training and reversal training induce region-specific changes in hippocampal PKA RIIalpha,beta-ir and suggest a differential involvement of hippocampal subregions in match-mismatch detection in case of Y-maze reference learning. Alterations in AMPA receptor regulation at the S845 site seems specifically related to the novelty detector function of the hippocampus important for match-mismatch detection.",
