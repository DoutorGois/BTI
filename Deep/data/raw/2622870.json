     "AB": "Changes in monoamines were studied in discrete areas of brain with varying dose of isopropanol. Acute administration of isopropanol (0.463 g/kg, 0.925 g/kg and 1.85 g/kg) decreased dopamine level in hypothalamus, pons medulla and cerebral cortex and whereas it was increased in striatum and cerebellum. Noradrenaline level was reduced in all the brain areas studied. Adrenaline level was increased in hypothalamus, striatum, midbrain and pons medulla, and decreased in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Serotonin level was increased in hypothalamus, midbrain, pons-medulla and cerebral cortex, and decreased in striatum and hippocampus. These changes were dose-dependent. It is concluded that isopropanol causes changes in brain monoamine content that this effect is not the same in all the regions of the brain.",
