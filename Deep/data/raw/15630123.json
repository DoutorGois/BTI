     "AB": "BACKGROUND: We have previously reported that the temporomesial area, including the amygdala, is activated in women when processing unpleasant words concerning body image. AIMS: To detect gender differences in brain activation during processing of these words. METHOD: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate 13 men and 13 women during an emotional decision task consisting of unpleasant words concerning body image and neutral words. RESULTS: The left medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were activated only among men, and the left amygdala was activated only among women during the task; activation in the apical prefrontal region was significantly greater in men than in women. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the prefrontal region is responsible for the gender differences in the processing of words concerning body image, and may also be responsible for gender differences in susceptibility to eating disorders.",
