     "AB": "Septal infusions of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) agonist muscimol impair memory, and the effect likely involves the hippocampus. GABA(A) receptors are present on the perikarya of cholinergic and GABAergic septo-hippocampal (SH) projections. The current experiments determined whether GABAergic SH projections are involved in the memory-impairing effects of septal GABA(A) receptor activation. Experiment 1 tested whether combining septal co-infusions of subeffective doses of muscimol with scopolamine, a drug that selectively influences GABA SH projections, would produce memory deficits. Experiment 2 tested whether hippocampal infusions of a GABA(A) receptor antagonist would block the effects of septal muscimol infusions. Fifteen minutes prior to assessing spontaneous alternation (SA) or training in a multiple trial inhibitory avoidance (CMIA) task, male Sprague-Dawley rats were given septal infusions of vehicle, muscimol, scopolamine, or co-infusions of muscimol with scopolamine, or septal infusions of vehicle or muscimol combined with hippocampal infusions of vehicle or bicuculline. Septal co-infusions of muscimol with scopolamine significantly impaired SA and CMIA. Hippocampal bicuculline infusions blocked deficits produced by septal muscimol infusions in SA and attenuated deficits produced in CMIA. Combined, these findings suggest that GABAergic SH projections are involved in the memory-impairing effects of septal GABA receptor activation.",
