     "AB": "The performance of rats with neurotoxic lesions of the dorsal ascending noradrenergic bundle (DB) was compared with that of sham-operated control animals under two behavioural conditions. Animals with DB lesions were slower than controls to acquire a classically-conditioned emotional response (conditioned suppression) with a trace interval interposed between the clicker conditioned stimulus (CS) and the shock reinforcer. However, if the latter half of the trace interval was filled by a second stimulus, a light, the DB-lesioned animals acquired conditioned suppression to the clicker faster than did controls under the same conditions. These results are discussed in terms of the attentional theory of DB function.",
