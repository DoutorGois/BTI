     "AB": "Local stereological techniques can be used for particle volume estimation based on information collected on a section plane through a reference point of the particle. We present methods for variability estimation of the local stereological volume estimators. This variability arises during the stereological estimation procedure and in the particle population. Both of these components can be estimated separately from planar sections. Our aim is to give a preliminary analysis of the possibility to include the particle structure interaction into the estimation procedure. For this reason, not only the section profiles, but also their locations, have to be recorded. The methods are applied for the sectional data obtained from neurons in the hippocampal brain region subiculum of four 3-month-old male Wistar rats. The proposed procedure enables one to obtain information about particle volume distribution.",
