     "AB": "The neuroprotective action of a cholecystokinin octapeptide analogue, ceruletide, was evaluated in models of cerebral ischemia using Mongolian gerbils. Ceruletide significantly suppressed the hyperactivity and amnesia induced by ischemia when injected s.c. 30 min before 5-min occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries at room temperature or immediately after their reperfusion. Ceruletide also reduced behavioral changes in ischemic gerbils whose body temperature was maintained at 37 degrees C during the 3-min occlusion. In these groups, delayed neuronal cell death in the hippocampal CA1 area following ischemia was markedly attenuated by s.c. administration of ceruletide. On the other hand, ceruletide could not inhibit the behavioral changes or the neurodegeneration induced in the hippocampal CA1 area by 5-min occlusion at 37 degrees C. These findings indicate that peripheral injection of ceruletide produces a neuroprotective action against moderate cerebral ischemia, which is the first evidence suggesting the efficacy of ceruletide in neurodegenerative diseases.",
