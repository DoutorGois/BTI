It has been speculated that this protein, or the lack of it, may be involved in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We describe the measurement of beta-NGF content in 4 regions of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus in AD brain compared with brain tissue from age-matched normal subjects using a sensitive sandwich immunoassay (ELISA). There was no difference in beta-NGF content in any region examined in AD compared with normal values despite the marked loss of cortical cholinergic function.",
