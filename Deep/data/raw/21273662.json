     "AB": "Extensive research into glutamate receptors in the central nervous system has shown important role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) as potential targets for neuroprotective drugs. The aim of the present study was to investigate neuroprotective potential of the highly selective mGlu5 antagonist 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]-pyridine (MTEP) against kainate (KA)-induced excitotoxicity in vivo. Our attention was focused mainly on the effectiveness of delayed treatment. In order to evoke neuronal injury, rats were unilaterally injected with kainic acid (KA; 2.5 nmol/1 mul) into the CA1 region of the hippocampus. MTEP (1, 5 or 10 nmol/1 mul) was administered into CA1 30 min, 1, 3 and 6 h after KA. Additionally, other rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with MTEP in a dose of 1 mg/kg, once daily for 7 days. The first injection of MTEP was 1 h after KA. Seven days after treatment, the brains were taken out and analyzed histologically to estimate the total number of neurons in CA region of dorsal hippocampus using stereological methods. The study was also aimed at determining a possible influence of MTEP on neuronal glutamate release induced by KA in the hippocampus, using microdialysis method. The obtained results showed that MTEP had neuroprotective effect after both intrahippocampal and intraperitoneal injection. It was found that MTEP could prevent excitotoxic neuronal damage even when it was applied 1-6 h after the toxin. Moreover, it was observed that MTEP significantly reduced the KA-induced glutamate release in the hippocampus. It seems to play a role in mediating neuroprotective effects of MTEP.",
