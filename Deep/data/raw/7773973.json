     "AB": "Three pediatric cases of temporal lobe seizure due to calcified glioma of amygdalo-hippocampal region are described. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed dense calcification with no postcontrast enhancement in the amygdalo-hippocampal region. Positron emission tomography showed low oxygen metabolism, low glucose metabolism, hypermetabolism of amino acids, and low regional cerebral blood flow in the tumors. Single photon emission computed tomography showed a high accumulation of 201Tl chloride and 123I-isopropyl iodoamphetamine in one tumor, but otherwise low radioisotope uptake. These studies indicated low-grade malignancies. The patients were treated by partial tumor removal and radiotherapy. Histological examination of the tumor specimens showed astrocytoma with interstitial calcification. One patient died due to tumor recurrence, while the others are doing well with minimal seizure. We recommended temporal lobectomy in similar cases to achieve complete remission.",
