     "AB": "The anti-convulsive effects of neuropeptide Y have been suggested in several animal models of epilepsy. We have found the sustained increase of neuropeptide Y contents and the seizure-induced elevation of hippocampal messenger RNA in a novel spontaneous epileptic mutant rat: Noda epileptic rat. In the present study, we investigated the change of neuropeptide Y Y1 and Y2 receptor messenger RNA expressions and binding sites in the hippocampus following a spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizure of Noda epileptic rat. Furthermore, the binding sites of a more recently isolated receptor subtype, neuropeptide Y Y5 receptors, were also evaluated by receptor autoradiography. A marked elevation of neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity in the mossy fiber, and Y2-receptor up-regulation in the dentate gyrus were observed in the hippocampus of Noda epileptic rat, which coincided with the previous results of the other epileptic models. In contrast, Y1-receptor down-regulation was not found after a spontaneous seizure of Noda epileptic rat while this occurs in kindling and after kainic acid-induced seizures. [125I][Leu31, Pro34]peptide YY/BIBP 3226-insensitive (Y5 receptor) binding sites in CA1 stratum radiatum were significantly decreased following a spontaneous seizure of Noda epileptic rat. The present results suggest that a spontaneous seizure of Noda epileptic rat induces significant changes in neuropeptide Y-mediated transmission in the hippocampus via Y2 and Y5 receptors, but not Y1 receptors. Therefore, specific subset of neuropeptide Y receptor subtypes might be involved in the epileptogenesis of Noda epileptic rat.",
