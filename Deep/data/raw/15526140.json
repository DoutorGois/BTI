     "AB": "Although sigma (sigma) receptors have been identified as an independent receptor family distinct from opioid and phencyclidine receptors, the physiological roles of these receptors are largely unknown. It is controversial whether there exist metabotropic sigma receptors that are coupled with heterotrimeric G proteins. In the present study, the stimulatory effects of sigma ligands on high-affinity GTPase activity and [35S]GTPgammaS binding were determined in the membranes prepared from rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. In either G protein activation assay, none of the sigma ligands examined had stimulatory effect in any brain regions, except for unambiguous concentration-dependent increase in [35S]GTPgammaS binding by (+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl) piperidine [(+)-3-PPP] in striatal membranes. However, the competition study clearly showed this response was mediated through dopamine D2-like receptors, but not sigma receptors. It is concluded that sigma receptors are not coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins, at least those of Gi/o type.",
