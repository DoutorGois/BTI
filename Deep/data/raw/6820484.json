     "AB": "Unilateral blockade of the dorsal ascending noradrenergic bundle was produced by injections of procaine or of 6-hydroxydopamine. The threshold current of septal stimulation required to drive the hippocampal theta rhythm was then investigated at frequencies between 5.9 and 10.0 Hz. With both types of blockade the threshold-frequency function showed a normal 7.7 Hz minimum ipsilaterally and an abolition of the minimum contralaterally. Ventral noradrenergic bundle lesions had no effect. Septal elicitation of hippocampal theta rhythm may, therefore, be dependent on a noradrenergic mechanism controlling aspects of the theta rhythm, e.g. interhemispheric balance, which would not be obvious in ordinary spontaneous records.",
