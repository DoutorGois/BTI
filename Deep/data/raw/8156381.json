     "AB": "Protein kinase C (PKC) (alpha) and (beta) immunoreactivities were determined in the cytosolic and particulate fractions of the hippocampus and striatum after single and repetitive, intraperitoneal administration of reserpine. Significant decrease of PKC(alpha) immunoreactivities was observed in the particulate fractions of both striatum and hippocampus. Compared with the alteration of PKC(alpha), the decreased immunoreactivity of PKC(beta) was only observed in the particulate fraction of the hippocampus, associated with the increase in the cytosolic fraction. These findings suggest a novel mechanism regulating the distribution of PKC. The topographical selectivity in the present study may indicate the importance of the alteration of PKC(beta) in the pathophysiological mechanism in Alzheimer's disease.",
