     "AB": "Over-expression of blood-brain barrier P-glycoprotein is considered as a major hurdle in the treatment of various CNS disorders. A down-regulation strategy is considered as one means to counteract disease- or therapy-associated induction of P-glycoprotein. Here, we evaluated whether a targeting of P-glycoprotein can be achieved in mouse brain capillary endothelial cells using siRNA. A 4-day treatment paradigm with once daily hydrodynamic intravenous injections of siRNA resulted in a significant reduction of the P-glycoprotein-labeled area in the hippocampal hilus and parietal cortex. P-glycoprotein expression proved to be down-regulated in these brain regions by 31 and 16%, respectively. An impact of siRNA administration on density of brain capillaries was excluded by quantification of the endothelial cell marker GLUT-1. In conclusion, the study provides first preliminary evidence that a down-regulation of P-glycoprotein can be achieved in brain capillary endothelial cells by administration of siRNA in vivo.",
