     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of genistein and exercise on the spatial memory and expression of microRNA-132, BDNF, and IGF-1 in the hippocampus of ovariectomized rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty animals were divided into six groups of control, sham, ovariectomy (OVX), ovariectomized with 8 weeks of genistein administration (OVX.G), with 8 weeks of swimming training (OVX.E), and with 8 weeks of both of them (OVX.G.E). The effect of genistein and/or exercise was evaluated by measuring microRNA-132, BDNF, and IGF-1 expression levels in the hippocampus tissue. Grafts were analyzed using Real-time polymerase chain reaction for microRNA-132, BDNF, IGF-1, and spatial memory via a Morris water maze (MWM). RESULTS: Our findings showed that ovariectomy decreased the expression of microRNA-132, BDNF, and IGF-1 in the hippocampus (P<0.05) in comparison with the sham group as well as performance in the water maze (P<0.05). Also according to results ovariectomized groups that were treated with genistein/exercise or both of them showed significant difference in expression of microRNA-132, BDNF, and IGF-1 in the hippocampus (P<0.05) and decreased latency in MWM (P<0.05) compared with the OVX group but combination treatment was more effective in the OVX.G.E group in comparison with OVX.E and OVX.G groups. CONCLUSION: Overall our results emphasized that combination treatment with genistein and exercise could improve microRNA-132, BDNF, and IGF-1 expression in the hippocampus as well as the spatial memory of ovariectomized rats. These effects may have beneficial impacts on the menopausal period.",
