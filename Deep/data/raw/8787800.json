     "AB": "Alzheimer's beta-amyloid protein (A beta) is the main component of senile plaques, which are characteristic hallmarks of the Alzheimer's disease brain. Recently, there have been several reports that A beta has toxic effects on both cultured neurons and in the brain. We confirmed the neurotoxicity of A beta in vitro and found a new compound, called AZ36041 (4-chloro-N-(5-nitro-2-tiazoyl)benzenesulfone amide), which dramatically reduced A beta neurotoxicity. This compound was also found to have a neuroprotective effect against toxicity of glutamate and enhanced neuronal survival in the absence of neurotoxic compounds. AZ36041 may be a useful tool for investigating the mechanism of A beta neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo.",
