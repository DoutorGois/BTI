     "AB": "Although trophic factors and neuronal activity have been implicated in regulating functional synaptic circuits, the relationship of trophic interaction to impulse activity in synaptogenesis remains unclear. Using cultured hippocampus as a model system, we provide direct evidence that depolarization and impulse activity specifically increase nerve growth factor gene expression in neurons. Depolarizing stimuli, such as a high K+ concentration or the Na+ channel agonist veratridine, elicited a 3-fold increase of nerve growth factor mRNA levels in both explant and dissociated cultures. Blockade of depolarization by tetrodotoxin prevented the increase of neuronal nerve growth factor mRNA. Further, nerve growth factor gene expression was stimulated by picrotoxin, a gamma-aminobutyric acid antagonist frequently used to enhance hippocampal neuronal activity. Impulse regulation of trophic gene function may be relevant to developmental synaptogenesis and synaptic strengthening in learning and memory.",
