     "AB": "Although several advances have occurred over the past 20 years concerning the use and administration of electroconvulsive therapy to minimize side effects of this treatment, little progress has been made in understanding its mechanism of action. Creatine kinase is a crucial enzyme for brain energy homeostasis, and a decrease of its activity has been associated with neuronal death. This work was performed in order to evaluate creatine kinase activity from rat brain after acute and chronic electroconvulsive shock. Results showed an inhibition of creatine kinase activity in hippocampus, striatum and cortex, after acute and chronic electroconvulsive shock. Our findings demonstrated that creatine kinase activity is altered by electroconvulsive shock.",
