     "AB": "Changes in the number of alpha 2 adrenoreceptors in the hippocampus, as measured by the specific binding of 3H-clonidine, were compared to changes in presynaptic alpha 2 adrenoreceptor function in electrically stimulated hippocampal slices. In dependent rats the specific binding of 3H-clonidine was reduced significantly. At 32 h after withdrawal binding began to return toward normal values, and at 72 h after withdrawal was significantly greater than that seen in saline-treated rats. In hippocampal slice experiments sensitivity to clonidine was significantly decreased in morphine-dependent animals and returned toward normal values after withdrawal. At 72 h after withdrawal, the sensitivity to clonidine of the presynaptic alpha 2 adrenoreceptor remained depressed although receptor density as measured in the binding studies was increased. This study suggests that the changes in the function of presynaptic alpha 2 adrenoreceptors might be important in the development of dependence upon morphine.",
