     "AB": "The mRNA expression of serotonin receptors 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A was investigated by the quantitative method RT-PCR in rats adapted to cold (5 weeks at +4 -(+6) degrees C) and in control (5 weeks at +20-22 degrees C). Four brain regions were examined: frontal cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and midbrain. The influence of cold adaptation on the mRNA expression of 5-HT15 receptor was not found to be absent. The mRNA expression of 5-HT2A receptor changed under long-term cold exposure. These changes in different brain regions were various: in hypothalamus, there was an increase of the 5-HT2A receptor mRNA expression; in the cortex, a decrease; in the hippocampus and midbrain, significant changes of the mRNA expression were absent. The findings appear bo te adaptive and, according to their localization in the central nervous system, regulatory. They also suggest involvement of brain serotoninergic system in mechanism of adaptive reorganization of temperature regulation.",
