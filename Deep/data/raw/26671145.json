     "AB": "Atomoxetine (ATX) is a non-stimulant selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is widely used for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we firstly examined neuroprotective effects of pre- or post-treatment with 15 and 30 mg/kg ATX against ischemic damage in the gerbil hippocampal cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) region subjected to 5 min of transient cerebral ischemia using cresyl violet staining, neuronal nuclei immunohistochemistry and Fluoro-J B histofluorescence staining. We found that only pre-treatment with 30 mg/kg ATX protected CA1 pyramidal neurons from ischemic insult. In addition, pre-treatment with 30 mg/kg ATX, which had neuroprotective effect against ischemic damage, distinctly attenuated the activation of astrocytes and microglia in the ischemic CA1 region compared with the vehicle-treated ischemia group by glial fibrillary acidic protein (for astrocytes) and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (for microglia) immunohistochemistry. In brief, our present results indicate that ATX has neuroprotective effect against transient cerebral ischemic insult and that the neuroprotective effect of ATX may be closely associated with attenuated glial activation.",
