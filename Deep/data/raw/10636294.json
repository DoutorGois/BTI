     "AB": "Rhesus monkeys with neonatal aspiration lesions of the hippocampal formation or the amygdaloid complex were tested on concurrent discrimination learning (24-hr intertrial interval [ITI]) at 3 months, on object recognition memory (delayed nonmatching-to-sample [DNMS]) at 10 months, and retested on both tasks at 6-7 years of age. Neonatal amygdaloid damage mildly impaired acquisition at the 24-hr ITI and the performance test of DNMS at both ages. In contrast, early hippocampal lesions impaired performance only on the longest lists of 10 items in DNMS in adult monkeys. Thus, early amygdala lesions appeared to have resulted in a greater object memory loss than early hippocampal lesions. However, in light of recent findings from lesion studies in adult monkeys, the object memory impairment after early amygdaloid lesions is better accounted for by damage to the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex than by damage to the amygdaloid nuclei.",
