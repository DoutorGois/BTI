     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Previous work in our laboratory has shown that exposure to ethanol during the brain growth spurt impairs spatial short-term memory in rats on the delayed matching-to-place (DMP) version of the Morris water maze. The objectives of this study were to ascertain whether this impairment could: 1) be prevented by increasing the length of encoding time and 2) be related to hippocampal c-Fos expression. METHODS: Using an artificial rearing model, male Long-Evans rats were fed 6.5 g/Kg/day of ethanol from postnatal days 6-9, with controls fed an isocaloric amount of maltose dextrin. As adults, rats in each treatment condition were trained and subsequently tested on either the DMP version of the Morris water maze, or on a random platform version (RAN) that incorporated the same performance requirements, but disallowed spatial learning. Brains were processed for c-Fos expression. RESULTS: Ethanol-exposed rats showed longer search trials during training and took longer to learn the DMP task. When the delay between search and recall trials was increased from 60 sec to 120 min, the performance of ethanol-exposed rats was impaired compared with that of controls after a 10 sec, but not after a 45 sec, encoding time. Brain c-Fos expression was increased in hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and visual cortex in rats trained on the DMP compared to the RAN task. Furthermore, in the DMP-trained rats, hippocampal c-Fos expression was lower in ethanol-exposed rats. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the short-term memory impairment of ethanol-exposed rats 1) can be improved slightly by an increase in encoding time and 2) is related to a decrease in c-Fos expression in the hippocampus.",
