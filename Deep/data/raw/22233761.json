     "AB": "The state between aging with no cognitive impairment and dementia has become a major focus for intervention. The neuropathological and neurobiological correlates of this intermediate state are therefore of considerable interest, particularly from population representative samples. Here we investigate the neuropathological profile associated with different cognitive ability levels measured using strata defined by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. One hundred and fifty one individuals were stratified into three cognitive groups including: non-, mildly, and moderately impaired at death. Alzheimer's disease, atrophy, and vascular pathologies were investigated. Mild impairment was associated with an increased risk of vascular pathologies including small vessel disease and lacunes. In contrast, the moderately impaired group showed a more extensive pattern of pathology, including tangles and neuritic plaques (entorhinal/hippocampus), atrophy (cortical and hippocampal), and vascular disease (small vessel disease, lacunes, and infarcts). In a population-based sample of older people, MMSE score defined strata are associated with multiple pathologies. The profile of AD and vascular changes becomes more complex with increased cognitive impairment and these changes are likely to constitute a major substrate for age associated cognitive impairment. The results highlight the need for rigorous investigation of both neurodegenerative and vascular risks factors in old age.",
