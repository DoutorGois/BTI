     "AB": "Numerous imaging studies have reported smaller hippocampal volumes in patients with PTSD. To investigate whether decreased hippocampal volume is associated with PTSD chronicity, independent of age, we used hierarchical linear regression to examine the relationship between PTSD duration (estimated from the amount of time that had elapsed since the traumatic event; mean=17 years; range=6-36 years) and hippocampal volume, adjusting for age and other factors. Freesurfer version 4.5 was used to quantify the volumes of the hippocampus and the caudate nucleus, which served as a \"control\" region, from the 1.5T Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of 55 combat veterans (mean age 45+/-9 years) with chronic and current PTSD. PTSD duration was significantly associated with right hippocampal volume (beta=-0.34, t=-2.40, P=0.02) after accounting for intracranial volume, age, gender (entered in the first step) and comorbidities (e.g., early life trauma, current major depression, history of substance abuse/dependence, psychotropic medication use, entered in the second step). This finding provides support for the potential neurotoxic effects of PTSD on hippocampal volume.",
