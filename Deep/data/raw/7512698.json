     "AB": "The effects of 1-week drug treatment on the brain contents of neuropeptides were investigated. The cholecystokinin (CCK) concentrations in the hypothalamus were significantly decreased by tryptophan treatment but not by imipramine and cyproheptadine, which changed the serotonergic function. Proglumide, the CCK antagonist, induced in the hypothalamic and hippocampal-striatal areas an increase in CCK concentration, which was not reversed in the presence of tryptophan. Dynorphin and substance P(SP) concentrations were also modified by proglumide treatment.",
