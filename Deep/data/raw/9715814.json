     "PG": "121-30",
     "AB": "Six female rats had a loading dose of 180 mg of diazepam (DZ) contained in two Silastic capsules implanted in their backs. Thereafter, a single 90-mg capsule was implanted weekly for 4 weeks prior to weekly microinjections of 1 microl of flumazenil (6.25, 12.5, or 25 microg) and PK 11195 (3.125, 6.25, or 12.5 microg) or vehicle into the CA1. Three control rats had empty capsules implanted but received only the high dose of flumazenil after 5 weeks. The time of DZ exposure spanned 8 weeks. Mean steady-state plasma levels of DZ were 1.06 +/- 0.11, and the mean total (DZ + metabolites) was 2.46 microg/ml +/- 0.37. Flumazenil elicited a dose-related precipitated withdrawal score (PAS) in DZ-treated rats (but not in controls) characterized by dose-related increases in convulsive (twitches and jerks), motor and autonomic signs, dose-related increases in the percent of total power in the low frequency (1-4 Hz), and decreases in the high-frequency (18-26 Hz) bands of the EEG recorded from the dentate and the amygdala. PK 11195 produced a dose-related increase in the 4-12 Hz band of the EEG recorded from the CA1, whereas the PAS was mild and not dose-related. However, the 6.25 and 12.5-microg doses elicited a significant PAS that tended to increase with dose. These data indicate that chronic DZ produces dependence, and that in the CA1 it involves the participation of central and possibly peripheral benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors located within this structure.",
