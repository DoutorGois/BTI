     "AB": "The Wnt signaling pathway has been implicated in several different aspects of neural development and function, including dendrite morphogenesis, axonal growth and guidance, synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Here, we studied several Frizzled Wnt receptors and determined their differential expression during hippocampal development. In cultured hippocampal neurons, the cellular distributions of Frizzleds vary greatly, some of them being localized at neurites, growth cones or synaptic sites. These findings suggest that the Wnt signaling pathway might be temporally and spatially fine tuned during the development of neuronal circuits through specific Frizzled receptors.",
