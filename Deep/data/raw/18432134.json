     "AB": "Depressive disorder is still a rising and important problem in the modem world, it affects about 15% of the population. Present forms of treatment are effective in about 70% and require monthly therapy which sometimes causes side effects. Last decade studies paid attention to theories different to monoaminergic and to neurodegenerative changes mainly in the limbic system of hippocampus. In this article authors show a relationship between calcium ions, glutaminergic transduction and disfunction of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. They also take into account the activity of calcium dependent ATPase and its influence on overproduction of reactive oxygen species in the central neuron system (CNS). The first part of this article proves that disregulation of HPA increases the glutaminergic conduction in neurons and causes a cytoskeletal damage in the CNS.",
