     "AB": "Early brain injury (EBI) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This study investigated the role of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) in EBI after SAH. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=108) weighing 260+/-40 g were divided into control, sham-operated, and operated groups. Blood was injected into the prechiasmatic cistern of rats in the operated group. Neurological scores, ultrastructures of neurons, apoptosis, and GRP78 expression in the hippocampus were examined using Garcia scoring system, transmission electron microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling, and Western blotting at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after SAH, respectively. The results showed that neurological scores were significantly decreased in the operated group as compared with those in control and sham-operated groups at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. Metachromatin, chromatin pyknosis at the edge, endoplasmic reticulum swelling, and invagination of nuclear membrane were observed at 24 h in the operated group, indicating the early morphological changes of apoptosis. The number of apoptotic cells was significantly increased in the operated group as compared with that in control and sham-operated groups at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. The GRP78 protein expression levels in the operated group were significantly elevated at all time points and reached the peak at 12 h. GRP78 expression was positively associated with apoptosis cells and negatively with neurological scores. In conclusion, EBI was demonstrated to occur after SAH and GRP78 was involved in the development of EBI after SAH.",
