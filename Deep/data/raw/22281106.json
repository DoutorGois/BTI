     "AB": "The term alpha-synucleinopathies refers to a group of age-related neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) that display an abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn). In contrast to the neuronal alpha-syn accumulation observed in PD and DLB, MSA is characterized by a widespread oligodendrocytic alpha-syn accumulation. Transgenic mice expressing human alpha-syn under the oligodendrocyte-specific myelin basic protein promoter (MBP1-halphasyn tg mice) model many of the behavioral and neuropathological alterations observed in MSA. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has been shown to be protective in toxin-induced models of PD, however its effects in an in vivo transgenic model of alpha-synucleinopathy remain unclear. In this context, this study examined the effect of fluoxetine in the MBP1-halphasyn tg mice, a model of MSA. Fluoxetine administration ameliorated motor deficits in the MBP1-halphasyn tg mice, with a concomitant decrease in neurodegenerative pathology in the basal ganglia, neocortex and hippocampus. Fluoxetine administration also increased levels of the neurotrophic factors, GDNF (glial-derived neurotrophic factor) and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in the MBP1-halphasyn tg mice compared to vehicle-treated tg mice. This fluoxetine-induced increase in GDNF and BDNF protein levels was accompanied by activation of the ERK signaling pathway. The effects of fluoxetine administration on myelin and serotonin markers were also examined. Collectively these results indicate that fluoxetine may represent a novel therapeutic intervention for MSA and other neurodegenerative disorders.",
