     "AB": "Disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) induced by NMDA receptor antagonists, such as MK801, has been used as an animal model of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Previous studies suggested that atypical, but not typical, neuroleptics can selectively restore MK801-induced PPI disruption and that such selectivity may depend on strain differences. The present study re-examined PPI disruption by systemic MK801 in Wistar (WS) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) strains, and addressed the issue whether clozapine (atypical), compared to haloperidol (typical), effectively antagonizes MK801-induced PPI disruption. In addition, we tested the effects of bilateral microinfusion of MK801 into the ventral hippocampus in WS. Systemic MK801 disrupted PPI in both strains. Neither clozapine nor haloperidol antagonized MK801-induced PPI in either strain. Our clozapine data do not agree with previous reports of clozapine's ability to antagonize MK801-induced PPI disruption. Similar to previous results with SD, MK801 infusion into the ventral hippocampus failed to affect PPI in WS. In our view, the selective ability of atypical neuroleptics to restore PPI disruption by NMDA antagonists, and to serve as a tool for identifying possible atypical neuroleptics, requires further examination. PPI disruption with systemic MK801 may be due to the blockade of NMDA receptors in multiple brain sites.",
