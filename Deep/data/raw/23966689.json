     "AB": "The transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression as well as in the efficacy of antidepressant treatment. However, altering CREB levels appears to have differing effects on anxiety- and depression-related behaviors, depending on which brain region is examined. Furthermore, many manipulations of CREB lead to corresponding changes in other CREB family proteins, and the impact of these changes has been largely ignored. To further investigate the region-specific importance of CREB in depression-related behavior and antidepressant response, we used Creb(loxP/loxP) mice to localize CREB deletion to the hippocampus. In an assay sensitive to chronic antidepressant response, the novelty-induced hypophagia procedure, hippocampal CREB deletion, did not alter the response to chronic antidepressant treatment. In contrast, mice with hippocampal CREB deletion responded to acute antidepressant treatment in this task, and this accelerated response was accompanied by an increase in hippocampal neurogenesis. Upregulation of the CREB-family protein cAMP response-element modulator (CREM) was observed after CREB deletion. Viral overexpression of the activator isoform of CREM, CREMtau, in the hippocampus also resulted in an accelerated response to antidepressants as well as increased hippocampal neurogenesis. This is the first demonstration of CREMtau within the brain playing a role in behavior and specifically in behavioral outcomes following antidepressant treatment. The current results suggest that activation of CREMtau may provide a means to accelerate the therapeutic efficacy of current antidepressant treatment.",
