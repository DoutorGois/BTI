     "AB": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta)-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanism (s) of Abeta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is still not fully understood. There is evidence that nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is involved in Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and is present in mitochondria. Using HT22 murine hippocampal neuronal cells and isolated mitochondria, the present study investigated whether intramitochondrial inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB)/NF-kappaB signaling pathway was involved in mitochondrial dysfunction induced by Abeta. It was found that Abeta impaired mitochondrial function through a NF-kappaB-dependent signaling pathway. Intramitochondrial IkappaBalpha/NF-kappaB pathway, induced by Abeta, decreased the expression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit (COXIII) and inhibited COX activity. These results provide new insights into the mechanism underlying the neurotoxic effect of Abeta and open up new therapeutic perspectives for AD.",
