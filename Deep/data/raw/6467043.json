     "AB": "A microcomputer based system is described for the analysis of various aspects of hippocampal field potential response recorded in vitro, either in the dendritic or somatic region. A comparison is made between the average amplitude and the time integral of synaptically evoked population spike at the cell body layer, following various intensities of stimuli delivered to the stratum radiatum. There was a good correlation between the two measures at low and intermediate intensities of stimulation. With stimulus intensities beyond those eliciting the population spike of maximal integral, the amplitude of the population spike further increased while its duration decreased. It is concluded that the integral provides a more accurate estimate of the extent of neuronal firing than the amplitude.",
