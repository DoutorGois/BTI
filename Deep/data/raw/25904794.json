     "AB": "Protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1) has received considerable attention, because it interacts with a broad range of neurotransmitter receptors, transporters, and enzymes and thereby influences their localization and function in the CNS. Although it is suggested that putative partners of PICK1 are involved in neurological diseases such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, chronic pain, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the functions of PICK1 in neurological disorders are not clear. Here, we show that oxidative stress, which is tightly associated with neurological diseases, occurs in PICK1(-/-) mice. The oxidation in PICK1(-/-) mice was found selectively in neurons and was age dependent, leading to microglial activation and the release of inflammatory factors. Neurons in the cortex and hippocampus from PICK1(-/-) mice showed increased vulnerability to oxidants and reduced capacity to metabolize reactive oxygen species (ROS); this was caused by reduced glutathione content and impaired cysteine transport. The dysregulated expression of glutathione was attributed to a decrease of the surface glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1). Overexpression of PICK1 could rescue the surface expression of EAAC1 and ameliorate the glutathione deficit in PICK1(-/-) neurons. Finally, reduced surface EAAC1 was associated with defective Rab11 activity. Transfection with dominant-negative Rab11 effectively suppressed surface EAAC1 and increased ROS production. Together, these results indicate that PICK1 is a crucial regulator in glutathione homeostasis and may play important roles in oxidative stress and its associated neurodegenerative diseases.",
