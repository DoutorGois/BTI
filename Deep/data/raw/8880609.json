     "AB": "Rats subjected to a mild to moderate fluid percussion injury exhibit memory deficits that are similar to rats that have received lesions of the septohippocampal system. Because the cholinergic system plays a major role in septohippocampal function, we studied the kinetics of the synthetic enzyme for acetylcholine, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), at 1 h, 24 h, or 5 days after a fluid percussion injury. Decreases in ChAT activity were found in the dorsal hippocampus (25%), frontal (32%), and temporal (23%) cortices 1 h after injury. In the parietal cortex, a greater than 50% increase in ChAT activity was observed at all time intervals assessed. At 5 days after TBI, there was an 18% increase in ChAT activity in the medial septal area. These data provide evidence that a mild to moderate fluid percussion injury produces changes in the cholinergic system in brain areas related to memory.",
