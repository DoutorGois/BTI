     "AB": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is one of three structurally homologous natriuretic peptides present in heart and brain, which is thought to be involved in the regulation of water and salt intake, blood pressure, and hormone secretion. In the present study, the distribution of preproatrial natriuretic peptide (ppANP) mRNA in the central nervous system of the rat was examined by in situ hybridisation histochemistry by using [35S]-labelled oligonucleotides. Cells expressing ppANP mRNA were apparent in several major neuronal systems, being present in hypothalamic, limbic, pontine and forebrain olfactory regions. Relatively high densities of ppANP mRNA-positive neurones were found in the anterior medial preoptic hypothalamic nucleus, medial habenular nucleus, and in Barrington's nucleus in the pons. Moderate numbers of ppANP mRNA-positive cells were present in a number of amygdaloid nuclei, including the posterolateral and anterior cortical nuclei, in the zona incerta, and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. Other areas, including the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, displayed only low densities of ppANP mRNA-positive neurones. A number of structures in which ppANP mRNA (or ANP-like immunoreactivity) has not previously been reported were found to contain moderate to high numbers of ppANP mRNA-positive neurones including several nuclei associated with the olfactory system, such as the anterior olfactory nucleus and neurones of the tenia tecta and ventrolateral orbital cortex. Although ppANP mRNA in CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus has been described, we also detected labelling in CA2 and ventral CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Conversely, nuclei such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the nucleus of the solitary tract, which are reported to possess ANP-like immunoreactivity, were found not to contain ppANP mRNA. Overall, these results demonstrate the presence of ANP gene expression in discrete neuronal populations of the rat central nervous system and provide additional evidence to support a putative role for this peptide in regulating and integrating hypothalamic, olfactory, limbic, and neuroendocrine systems.",
