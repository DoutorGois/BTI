     "AB": "This experiment determined if the loss of endogenous melatonin via pinealectomy affected rat CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neuron numbers over a 20-month span. Since pinealectomy eliminates many neurohormones, some rats received daily melatonin supplementation to determine if this would reverse its effects. CA1 pyramidal cells were significantly reduced between 2 and 4 months after pinealectomy. CA3 loss was evident at 2 months post-pinealectomy. Melatonin replacement in the drinking water prevented these effects and seemingly promoted the genesis of CA1 cells. Analyses of hippocampal thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels at 3 and 20 months post-surgery, revealed no significant group differences in lipid peroxidation. However, hippocampal TBARS were higher at 20 than at 3 months in all groups. Pinealectomized rats exhibited a significantly higher ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione at 3 months but not 20 months, when compared to the sham and melatonin-supplemented rats. This suggests that pinealectomy caused oxidative stress and a subsequent compensatory change in the glutathione system. These results indicate that endogenous melatonin is neuroprotective.",
