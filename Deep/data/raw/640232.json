     "AB": "Two-day-old rats were given unilateral lesions of the caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, or hippocampus and their postural orientation was observed for 30 min immediately after surgery. All groups with damage to the caudate-putamen and/or globus pallidus showed a significant postural deviation toward the side ipsilateral to the lesion. At this age, neurogenesis in the basal ganglia is complete but synapses, neurotransmitters, and enzymes for neurotransmitter synthesis are far below adult levels. These results indicate that the basal ganglia have a role in motor function prior to their full maturation as measured by neuroanatomical and biochemical techniques.",
