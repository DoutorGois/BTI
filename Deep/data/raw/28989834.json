     "AB": "The study aimed to determine whether and how the activation of the acetylcholine receptor affects epileptiform discharges in the CA3 region in a rat hippocampus. Picrotoxin (100 muM), a GABAA receptor antagonist, was applied to a hippocampal slice to induce epileptiform discharges. The effects of the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, on the discharges were examined at the several concentrations (1-30 muM). Carbachol had different impacts on epileptiform discharges at the different concentrations. Relatively low concentrations of carbachol (<10 muM) increased the frequency but decreased the amplitude of the discharges. At 10 muM, carbachol induced the discharges, including bursts of theta frequency oscillations. At 30 muM, carbachol could induce bursts of beta frequency oscillations instead of epileptiform discharges. The amplitudes of the oscillations were smaller than those of the discharges. Carbachol suppressed the evoked population EPSPs (pEPSPs) in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were blocked by the muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist atropine sulfate. The high level of muscarinic receptor activation can replace epileptiform discharges with theta or beta oscillation. These results suggest that the dose-dependent alternation of the acetylcholine receptor activation may provide the three different stages the epileptiform discharges, the bursts of theta oscillation, and the bursts of the beta oscillation.",
