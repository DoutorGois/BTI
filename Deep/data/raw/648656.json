     "AB": "The method of main components aided to study the changes of EPs led from different brain structures during action of drugs on synaptic organizations of the brain. Two factors were singled out: the unspecific one comprised late components of EPs led from such structures as caudate nucleus, black substance; the specific factor united the components of EPs associated with the visual projection system and the initial component of EP in CA-1 field of the hippocampus. The weight coefficients of these two groups of components of EPs changed in different ways under the effect of drugs: the drugs different by their synaptic action exerted opposite effects upon distribution of the weight coefficients over the EP components under study.",
