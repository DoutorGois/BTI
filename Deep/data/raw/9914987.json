     "AB": "Hippocampal slices treated with cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin for three min during the sectioning (45 min) or aspirin (0.5 min) in long term (up to 5 days) preservation in periodic nocturnal hypothermia were studied morphofunctionally using light microscopy and electrophysiological registration of induced population responses of area CAI to stimulation of Schaffers collaterals. Structural disorders were revealed in control slices as early as the third hour of incubation and they were destroyed following the first hypothermal challenge (24 hrs following preparation). The structure in slices treated with blockers remained more stable as compared to control ones and the activity was registered until d 3 (aspirin) and 5 (indomethacin). Morphological changes were not immediately, followed by electric activity decline. On the whole it may be suggested that essential viability increase occurred due to destructive processes inhibition mediated by short living cyclooxygenase metabolites.",
