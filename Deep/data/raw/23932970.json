     "AB": "Several glycoproteins in mammalian brains contain alpha2,8-linked disialic acid residues. We previously showed a constant expression of disialic acid (DiSia) in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb and cortex, and a gradual decrease of expression in the cerebellum from neonatal to senile mice. Previous publications indicate that neurite extension of neuroblastoma-derived Neuro2A cells is inhibited in the presence of DiSia antibody. Based on this, we treated Neuro2A cell cultures with RNA interference for ST8SiaIII mRNA, the enzyme responsible for DiSia formation. We observed that neurite extension was inhibited by this treatment. Taking this evidence into consideration and the relationship of the cerebellum with learning and memory, we studied the role of DiSia expression in a learning task. Through delivery of pST8SiaIII into the brains of C57BL/6 neonatal mice, we inhibited the expression of ST8SiaIII. ST8SiaIII mRNA and protein expressions were analyzed by real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. In this work, we showed that pST8SiaIII-treated mice presented a significantly reduced level of ST8SiaIII mRNA in the cerebellum (p<0.01) in comparison to control mice at 8 days after treatment. It is also noted that these levels returned to baseline values in the adulthood. Then, we evaluated behavioural performance in the T-Maze, a learning task that estimates procedural memory. At all ages, pST8SiaIII-treated mice showed a lower performance in the test session, being most evident at older ages (p<0.001). Taken all together, we conclude that gene expression of ST8SiaIII is necessary for some cognitive tasks at early postnatal ages, since reduced levels impaired procedural memory in adult mice.",
