     "AB": "Electrophysiological techniques have been used to study the pharmacological characteristics of GABA receptors in two in vitro preparations likely to provide the ionic basis for GABAergic inhibition of excitation-secretion coupling. The shortening of Ca2+ spikes duration by GABAB receptors was shown to occur in slow conducting dorsal root ganglion cells, independently of marked depression of inward calcium currents. Ion-selective electrodes (K+ or Ca2+) were used to show the presence of both GABAA and GABAB receptors on the neurosecretory terminals and gland cells from hypophyseal neuro-intermediate lobe (NIL). In this latter preparation, potentiation of hormone release was observed under GABAA receptor activation, whilst inhibition was seen with GABAB agonists.",
