     "AB": "In 6 patients 13 to 47 years old, who suffered traumatic brain injury 2 to 7 years ago, central nervous system (CNS) functioning, including motor, vegetative and higher mental functions, could partly be restored by applying coordination dynamic therapy for 3 months. The repair was quantified by the improvement of walking, jumping and hand function and the direct measurement of the coordination dynamics of coordinated arm, leg and trunk movements. The CNS organization (the coordination dynamics) improved by 69% from 29 to 5.9 s-1 within 3 months of therapy. The mean coordination dynamics achieved (5.9) were slightly higher than those in a population of untrained healthy physiotherapists (coordination dynamics = 5.1 +/- 1.2). The author's value of coordination dynamics is mostly between 3 and 4 (best value 2.5). It is discussed that longer therapy times are needed in neurorehabilitation, since there is indication that during longer therapy times also new nerve cells are built outside the hippocampus, for example in the spinal cord.",
