     "AB": "Distribution of heat shock protein (HSP) 90 alpha mRNA induction after 10 min of transient global ischemia was investigated in gerbil hippocampus by in situ hybridization. A small amount of HSP90 alpha mRNA was normally present in hippocampal cells and the mRNA was further induced with a peak at 8 h after ischemia. In hippocampal CA1 cells that are vulnerable to ischemia, HSP90 alpha mRNA was continuously induced by 1 day and finally diminished at 2 days. The temporal profile of HSP90 alpha mRNA induction in hippocampal CA1 cells was similar to that of HSP70 mRNA reported previously, suggesting a cooperative role of HSP90 alpha with other HSPs after ischemia.",
