     "AB": "Female Long-Evans rats sustained electrolytic lesions of the fimbria and the dorsal fornix causing a partial lesion of the septohippocampal pathway. Two weeks later, the rats received intra-hippocampal grafts of fetal septal cell suspensions. Nine to twelve months later, the release of acetylcholine (ACh) in the hippocampus of sham-operated, lesion-only and grafted rats was measured by microdialysis. The extent of cholinergic (re)innervation was determined by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining and densitometry. In both lesion-only and grafted rats, the ratio of ACh release to AChE staining intensity was increased as compared to sham-operated rats, indicating a loss of endogenous inhibitory mechanisms. Scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), a muscarinic antagonist, increased ACh release in all treatment groups. 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg/kg s.c.), an agonist at serotonergic 5HT1A-receptors, induced an increase of hippocampal ACh release in sham-operated rats. This effect was lost in lesion-only rats, but was fully restored by neuronal grafting. As 8-OH-DPAT influences hippocampal ACh release by a postsynaptic action, this finding indicates that the host brain exerts a serotonergic influence on the grafted cholinergic neurons.",
