     "AB": "Cultured neurons from bdnf-/- mice display reduced densities of synaptic terminals, although in vivo these deficits are small or absent. Here we aimed at clarifying the local responses to postsynaptic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). To this end, solitary enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled hippocampal neurons from bdnf-/- mice were compared with bdnf-/- neurons after transfection with BDNF, bdnf-/- neurons after transient exposure to exogenous BDNF, and bdnf+/+ neurons in wild-type cultures. Synapse development was evaluated on the basis of presynaptic immunofluorescence and whole-cell patch-clamp recording of miniature postsynaptic currents. It was found that neurons expressing BDNF::EGFP for at least 16 h attracted a larger number of synaptic terminals than BDNF-deficient control neurons. Transfected BDNF formed clusters in the vicinity of glutamatergic terminals and produced a stronger upregulation of synaptic terminal numbers than high levels of ambient BDNF. Glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses reacted differently to postsynaptic BDNF: glutamatergic input increased, whereas GABAergic input decreased. BDNF::EGFP-expressing neurons also differed from BDNF-deficient neurons in their dendrite morphology: they exhibited weaker dendrite elongation and stronger dendrite initiation. The upregulation of glutamatergic synaptic input and the BDNF-induced downregulation of GABAergic synaptic terminal numbers by postsynaptic BDNF depended on tyrosine receptor kinase B activity, as deduced from the blocking effects of K252a. The suppression of dendrite elongation was also prevented by block of tyrosine receptor kinase B but required, in addition, glutamate receptor activity. Dendritic length decreased with the number of glutamatergic contacts. These results illuminate the role of BDNF as a retrograde synaptic regulator of synapse development and the dependence of dendrite elongation on glutamatergic input.",
