     "AB": "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a neurotrophic factor that influences the survival and function of several neuronal populations in the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems. The actions of GDNF are mediated by a multicomponent receptor complex composed of the tyrosine kinase product of c-ret and the ligand-binding protein GDNF receptor alpha (GDNFR-alpha). In the present study, we used in situ hybridization to localize cells expressing the mRNA for these GDNF receptor subunits in rat CNS. As reported previously, GDNFR-alpha and c-ret mRNA are present in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, regions containing GDNF-responsive dopamine neurons. However, both mRNA were found in motor neurons of spinal cord and brainstem nuclei that innervate skeletal muscle. These areas include alpha motor neurons in the ventral horn of spinal cord and neurons in hypoglossal, facial, trigeminal, and abducens nuclei. In areas rostral to the substantia nigra, c-ret mRNA is not detected, whereas GDNFR-alpha is found in numerous brain structures, including the hippocampus, cortex, medial geniculate, and the medial habenula, the latter area expressing the highest levels of GDNFR-alpha mRNA in brain. These results provide evidence that c-ret and GDNFR-alpha mRNA are expressed in neuronal populations involved in motor function and provides further support for GDNF as a target-derived neurotrophic for these motor neurons. The observation that GDNFR-alpha mRNA is localized in several brain structures that do not contain detectable levels of c-ret mRNA indicates that either GDNFR-alpha utilizes signal transduction molecules other than c-ret in these areas or that other GDNF-like ligands that utilize GDNFR-alpha as a receptor may be present.",
