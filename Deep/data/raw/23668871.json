     "AB": "Flumazenil is a specific, reversibly bound antagonist at benzodiazepine binding sites of gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors; these sites can be imaged using positron emission tomography with 11C-flumazenil. We reported an exponential decline of flumazenil volume of distribution (proportional to receptor binding) of gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors in children 2 to 17 years. Six newborns (33.3-46.7 weeks' postconception) were studied. All had experienced epileptic seizures and undergone 60-minute dynamic 11C-flumazenil-positron emission tomography imaging after injection of 0.4 mCi/kg of 11C-flumazenil. All newborns were scanned during their natural sleep. Binding potential (indicating flumazenil receptor binding) was calculated using Logan-plot analysis. Visual and quantitative analyses showed highest receptor binding in the amygdala-hippocampus region, sensory-motor cortex, thalamus, brainstem and basal ganglia, in that order. Cerebellum and most of the cerebral cortex showed relatively low binding. This is the first demonstration of gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor binding in human neonates and is strikingly different from that in older children/adults, showing a programmed pattern of expression. The ontogeny data of flumazenil receptor binding from children may contribute to understanding regional differences in synaptic plasticity and improve rational therapeutic use of drugs acting at the gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor in the pediatric population.",
