     "AB": "Transient global amnesia(TGA) had been recognized as a disease without abnormal findings on neuroimaging before magnetic resonance(MRI) imaging was practicable. Recently, abnormal findings on MRI reported in cases of TGA. We here reported a case of TGA showing a transient abnormal intensity in left hippocampus on MRI diffusion-weighted image. A 52-year-old man suddenly became to unable to keep his recent memory without histories of trauma or epilepsy. He showed no abnormal neurologic findings excepting for the recent memory. MRI performed within an hour after onset demonstrated no abnormality on T1- and T2-weighted images. Diffusion-weighted image (b = 1,000) showed hyperintensity in the left medial temporal lobe, and the apparent diffusion coefficient(ADC) in this region was lower(72.8 cm2/s) than that in the contralateral region(94.4 cm2/s). TGA was completely resolved 17 hours after onset.",
