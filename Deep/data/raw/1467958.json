     "AB": "8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a potent 5-HT1A receptor agonist, was infused in the dorsal hippocampus of rats and its effect on acquisition and performance of a 2-platform spatial discrimination task was studied using a water maze. The infusion (0.5 microliter/min) of 2 but not 0.4 microgram 8-OH-DPAT in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus impaired rats' accuracy with no effect on latency (except day 3). At 5 micrograms 8-OH-DPAT impaired rats' accuracy and significantly increased choice latencies from day 2 to day 5 of the training period. The dose of 2 micrograms significantly increased the errors of omissions on the first day of training and animals which had received 5 micrograms 8-OH-DPAT made significantly more errors of omission on the first and second days of training. Intrahippocampal administration of 1 microgram spiroxatrine, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, antagonized the effect of 5 micrograms 8-OH-DPAT on accuracy and choice latency with no significant effect on the errors of omission on days 1 and 2 of training. Infusion of 2 and 5 micrograms 8-OH-DPAT in the dorsal hippocampus also impaired accuracy in well-trained rats. The results suggest that stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus causes an impairment of spatial discrimination in rats.",
