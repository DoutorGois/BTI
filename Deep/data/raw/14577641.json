The maximum GRP94 gene expression level was detected at the occipital lobe 10 min after the induction of ischemia. In the hippocampus, GRP94 gene expression reached a maximum 15 min after inducing ischemia. Following reperfusion, the maximum expression level was shown at 12 h and continuing thereafter.",
