     "AB": "Laddered DNA indicative of apoptosis was observed in the CA1 layer of hippocampus and in dorsolateral striatum following a global cerebral ischemic insult produced by transient two vessel occlusion in rats. The extent of this DNA damage was proportional to the duration of the ischemic episode. Breaks in DNA were demonstrated in situ in sections from post-ischemic brain in neurons of the hippocampal CA1 which undergo selective neuronal death but not in other cell types. It is concluded that there is an apoptotic component to selective neuronal death following global ischemia in rat brain.",
