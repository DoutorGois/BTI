     "AB": "The excitatory amino acids as neurotransmitters in the neocortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, amygdala, nucleus basalis of Meynert and cerebellum from rats aged 4 months, 12 months and 24 months have been examined by measuring sodium-dependent high affinity uptake of D-[3H]-aspartate into preparations containing synaptosomes. Calcium-dependent K(+)-stimulated release of endogenous glutamate from the nucleus basalis was also measured. The hippocampus and cerebellum failed to show significant age-related changes in uptake of D-[3H]-aspartate. D-[3H]-aspartate uptake decreased significantly in the neocortex (29%), striatum (29%), nucleus basalis (26%), amygdala (19%) and thalamus (16%) in the middle-aged rats as compared to the young rats, but the changes were not progressive with age. The release of glutamate from the nucleus basalis was unaltered during the aging process.",
