     "AB": "The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules. The RAGE-ligand interaction has a putative role in a range of chronic disorders and is also known to contribute to both inflammatory/degenerative processes as well as regeneration in peripheral nerve injury. We have investigated the expression of RAGE in the moderate hypoxic-ischemic (HI) rat brain injury model in order to determine if this receptor is involved in the cellular perturbation mediated by ischemic stress. RAGE mRNA levels were detected by in situ hybridization using a DIG-labelled 48 mer oligonucleotide probe. Results showed a high level of expression of RAGE mRNA in the CA1/2 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus on the lesioned side of the brain 72 h after a moderate hypoxic-ischemic insult. RAGE was not expressed on the control side of the hippocampus. The RAGE-positive cells had a unique morphology, being angular in shape and atrophied with a condensed cell nucleus. They were NeuN-positive and were identified as dying cells by staining with thionin/acid fuchsin. A subset of cells was positive for cleaved Caspase-3, a marker for apoptosis. Together these data show that RAGE is expressed in dying neurons and suggest that RAGE may have a role in neuronal cell death mediated by ischemic stress. Identification of the ligand for RAGE in the ischemic brain may lead to a better understanding of RAGE-mediated cellular dysfunction in the CNS.",
