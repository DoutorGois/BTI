     "AB": "Schizophrenia patients exhibit a wide range of impairments in cognitive functions. Clinically, atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPs) such as olanzapine (OLZ) have a therapeutic effect on memory function among schizophrenia patients rather than typical antipsychotics, e.g., haloperidol. To date, however, little is known about the neuroplasticity mechanism underlying the effect of AAPs on the impairment of cognitive functions. Here, we treated schizophrenia rat models with a systematic injection of MK-801 (0.1mg/kg) and chose the drug OLZ as a tool to investigate the mechanisms of AAPs when used to alter cognitive function. The results showed that the systematic administration of MK-801 results in the impairment of spatial learning and memory as well as spatial working memory in a Morris water maze task. OLZ but not HAL improved these MK-801-induced cognitive dysfunctions. After MK-801 application, the hippocampal LTP was profoundly impaired. In conjunction with the results of the behavioral test, the administration of OLZ but not of HAL resulted in a significant reversal effect on the impaired LTP induced via MK-801 application. Furthermore, we found that OLZ but not HAL can upregulate the phosphorylation of GluR1 Ser845. These data suggest that the therapeutic effect of OLZ on cognitive dysfunctions may be due to its contribution to synaptic plasticity via the ability to upregulate the state of GluR1 Ser845 phosphorylation. We therefore suggest that the upregulated state of GluR1 Ser845 phosphorylation may be a promising target for developing novel therapeutics for treating schizophrenia.",
