     "AB": "The positive effect of postlearning sleep on memory consolidation as well as the relationship between sleep-related memory processes and the hippocampal formation are increasingly clarified topics in neurobiology. However, the possibility of a stable relationship between waking mnemonic performance and sleep-dependent hippocampal electric activity is unexplored. Here we report a correlative analysis between sleep-dependent parahippocampal-hippocampal (pHip-Hip) electric activity recorded by foramen ovale (FO) electrodes and different types of memory performances in epileptic patients. Psychological testing was performed days or weeks before electrophysiological recordings. The relative spectral power of the slow activity (below 1.25 Hz) during deep non-REM (NREM) sleep at the right pHip-Hip region correlated positively with the visual memory performance according to Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCFT). Along the posterior-anterior direction of the hippocampal formation a linear increasing of correlations was observed. The relative power of the activity below 1.25 Hz at the left pHip-Hip during phasic REM sleep correlated positively with verbal learning performance and mnemonic retention values according to ROCFT. It is concluded that the pHip-Hip structures' capacity of producing high amplitude and synchronized slow (< 1 Hz) oscillation during deep NREM sleep is related to the functional power of these structures. We hypothesize that the asymmetric (side-specific) propagation of ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) activity to the pHip-Hip region is related to the memory correlates of phasic REM sleep.",
