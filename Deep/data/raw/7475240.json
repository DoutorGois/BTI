     "AB": "There are 3 known forms of synaptic plasticity at CNS synapses: long-term potentiation (LTP) mediated by NMDA receptor activation, LTP mediated by voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) activation, and long-term depression (LTD) mediated by the NMDA receptor. All 3 forms of synaptic plasticity can be observed in hippocampal CAl cells, all are induced by afferent activation, all involve Ca2+ influx, and all activate Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms. We consider the functional consequences of the presence of 3, sometime opposing, forms of synaptic plasticity at the same synapse. We suggest that the 2 forms of LTP have different consequences for the synapse. We postulate that the co-existence of potentiating and depressing capabilities influences the network processing capabilities of neural networks.",
