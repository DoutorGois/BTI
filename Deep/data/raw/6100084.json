     "AB": "Repeated electrical stimulations of the olfactory bulb led to the progressive development of a generalized epilepsy (kindling effect). One week after the last stimulation eliciting a stage 5 seizure, diazepam-(3H) binding was studied in olfactory bulb-kindled rats. Numbers of benzodiazepine receptors were increased in kindled olfactory bulb and amygdala. No significant change was observed in hippocampus. This modification could be considered as a response of the inhibitory mechanisms to repeated seizures which is insufficient to counteract the installation of the kindling effect.",
