     "AB": "HPC-1/syntaxin-1A is a neuronal protein of which the mRNA has an immediate early gene-like structure in its 3'-untranslated region. Whereas HPC-1/syntaxin-1A protein plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release, little is known about HPC-1 gene expression. We demonstrate here that HPC-1 mRNA expression in rat hippocampal neurons in vivo decreased 8 h after kainic acid (KA) administration, but was restored thereafter. The transient decrease of HPC-1 mRNA upon KA administration suggests that the HPC-1 mRNA expression in neurons could be altered by excitation by trans-synaptic stimulation.",
