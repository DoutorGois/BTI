     "AB": "The mechanism of the potentiating action of phorbol diacetate on synaptic transmission in the hippocampus was studied by the quantal analysis technique. Thin transverse sections were prepared from guinea pig hippocampus and intracellular potentials were recorded from CA3 neurons. Unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were induced in the impaled neurons by brief glutamate pulses administered to granule cells. The amplitude of the unitary EPSPs fluctuated according to Poisson distribution. From the mean and variance of the amplitude of the unitary EPSPs, the mean quantal content (m) and the mean quantal amplitude (q) were calculated. Before phorbol diacetate administration, the values of m and q were 9.7 +/- 1.4 and 1.1 +/- 0.28 mV (mean +/- S.D.), respectively. Potentiation of synaptic transmission by phorbol diacetate was accompanied by increases in the value of m. The value of q remained unchanged in most neurons and decreased in some. These results indicate that the phorbol ester causes an increase in release of neurotransmitter and thereby potentiates synaptic transmission.",
