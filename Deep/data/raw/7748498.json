     "AB": "Large, but non-pathological, individual differences in neuroanatomy of the brain exist in rodents, which have been shown to covary with behavioral traits. In the present review, we explore the relationship between variations in the extent of the intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fiber projection of the hippocampus and spatial and non-spatial learning capacities in mice and rats. Preliminary data concerning anatomical variation in the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system and its consequences for individual behavior are also presented. We conclude that the hippocampal intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fiber projection is intimately involved in the regulation of spatial, but not of non-spatial learning capabilities. Although lesion studies have shown that a well-functioning cholinergic system is a prerequisite for performance in spatial learning tasks, our preliminary data suggest that individual differences in the cholinergic system do not explain individual differences in learning.",
