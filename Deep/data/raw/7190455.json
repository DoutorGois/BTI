     "AB": "Phencyclidine (PCP) elicited dose-related rotation in naive rats. The effect of PCP was consistent in direction and magnitude from one week to the next but was dissimilar to the rotatory effects of dopaminergic (D-amphetamine, apomorphine) or anticholinergic (scopolamine) drugs. Study of the effects of PCP on regional brain uptake of labeled 2-deoxy-D-glucose suggested that PCP-induced rotation is at least in part mediated by an action in the hippocampus. PCP elicited ipsilateral rotation following unilateral hippocampal lesions whereas such lesions did not alter the direction of either nocturnal or D-amphetamine-induced rotation. PCP appears to activate a hippocampal mechanism that normally only modulates the intensity of rotation.",
