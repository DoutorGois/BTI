     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most devastating neurodegenerative disorders. Intracellular beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) is an early event in AD. It induces the formation of amyloid plaques and neuron damage. The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) has been suggested to play an important role in Abeta caused cognition. It has high affinity with Abeta and could mediate Abeta internalization in vitro. However, whether in mouse brain the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of the alpha7nAChR mediated Abeta internalization and their role in mitochondria remains little known. Therefore, in this study, we revealed that Abeta is internalized by cholinergic and GABAergic neurons. The internalized Abeta were found deposits in lysosomes/endosomes and mitochondria. Abeta could form Abeta-alpha7nAChR complex with alpha7nAChR, activates the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). And the increasing of alpha7nAChR could in return mediate Abeta internalization in the cortex and hippocampus. In addition, by using the alpha7nAChR agonist PNU282987, the p38 phosphorylation level decreases, rescues the biochemical changes which are tightly associated with Abeta-induced apoptosis, such as Bcl2/Bax level, cytochrome c (Cyt c) release. Collectively, the p38 MAPK signaling pathway could regulate the alpha7nAChR-mediated internalization of Abeta. The activation of alpha7nAChR or the inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling pathway may be a beneficial therapy to AD.",
