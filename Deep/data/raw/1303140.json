     "AB": "Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to uncontrollable shock can be separated by a subsequent shock escape test into two groups: a \"helpless\" (LH) group which demonstrates a deficit in escape behavior, and a \"nonlearned helpless\" (NLH) group which shows no escape deficit and acquires the escape response as readily as naive control rats (NC) do. The present studies were designed to examine the correlations between the behavioral differences and the changes of in vitro neurotransmitter release seen in these three groups of rats. The major finding concerned a significant increase in endogenous and K(+)-stimulated serotonin (5-HT) release in the hippocampal slices of LH rats. There were no apparent differences in acetylcholine, dopamine and noradrenaline release in the hippocampus of LH rats as compared to NLH and NC rats. These results add further support to previous studies in our laboratory which implicate presynaptic 5-HT mechanisms in the behavioral deficit caused by uncontrollable shock.",
