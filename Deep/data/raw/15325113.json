     "AB": "Implanted radiotelemetry has been used for the measurement of cortical electroencephalogram (EEG), locomotor activity, body temperature and cardiovascular parameters. This technique allows high quality data acquisition from freely moving animals with no complications of externalised apparatus. This paper focuses on the methodology for short and long-term monitoring of epileptiform activity by simultaneous cortical EEG, hippocampal (HC) EEG and electromyogram (EMG) in rats. The circadian rhythm of temperature (CRT) was monitored after surgery to estimate the need for post surgical recovery of animals. Different placements of EMG electrodes were assessed in order to minimise artefacts and increase sensitivity. The occurrence of epileptiform ictal and interictal activity following an acute injection of either 40 mg/kg pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) or 13.8 mg/kg kainic acid (KA) was investigated. The occurrence of spontaneous seizures was also monitored 5-8 weeks after administration of KA. The present study demonstrated a sensitive method for monitoring cortical EEG, hippocampal EEG and EMG short and long-term by implantable radiotelemetry in freely moving rats.",
