     "AB": "We previously reported a novel peptide, Hippocampal Cholinergic Neurostimulating Peptide (HCNP), which induces acetylcholine synthesis by increasing the amount of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in medial septal nuclei. The HCNP precursor protein (HCNP-pp), composed of 186 amino acids, is an inhibitory factor of the c-Raf/MEK cascade and may be involved in fetal rat brain development via the inhibition of phosphorylation of Erk. To clarify the involvement of HCNP in hippocampal cholinergic circuitry, we previously generated HCNP-pp transgenic (HCNP-pp Tg) mice using the promoter of the alpha subunit of Ca(2+) calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKIIalpha). These mice showed increased levels of ChAT in medial septal nuclei at 12 weeks of age, and the phenotype of depressive mood at 30 weeks of age. Here, through proteomic analysis we investigated the alteration of protein expression in the hippocampus of HCNP-pp Tg mice compared with wild-type littermate mice. We demonstrate that the activation of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) is increased in the transgenic mice at 12 weeks of age when compared with wild-type littermate mice.",
