     "AB": "Microvessels in the rat hippocampal slice can be used as an in vitro model for the study of cerebral vasospasm. Serum from coagulated blood causes prompt and long-lasting microvascular constriction that is neurogenic in nature. Here we show that a candidate spasmogen, thromboxane B2, has excitatory action on neural elements in the slice. However, spasmogenic serum lacks this excitatory effect. Instead, it is inhibitory for a major population of slice neurons. Thus, neurogenic microvascular spasm is produced by a subpopulation of slice neurons or projection fibers, not all neurons acting in concert. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is contained in fibers that project to the hippocampus, and hippocampal microvessels contain pressor (V1) receptors for the peptide. AVP causes vasoconstriction in the slice, and a specific V1 antagonist for the peptide blocks the microvascular spasm induced by blood serum. The results are interpreted to mean that neurogenic microvascular spasm is mediated by locally released AVP.",
