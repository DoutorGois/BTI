     "AB": "We demonstrate for the first time that neurogenesis in the adult Monodelphis opossum has a typical mammalian pattern and occurs only in the dentate gyrus (DG) and subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles. In these two brain regions neurogenesis is present throughout the lifespan, although its rate is reduced by half in the old age. Treatment with buspirone, a partial 5-HT1A receptor agonist which is used in human clinic as an anxiolytic agent, boosts proliferation in the SVZ and DG in both adult and aged opossums. The neuronal phenotype dominates among newly generated cells in both non-treated and buspirone-treated opossums. We suggest that if functional importance of adult neurogenesis is in improving olfactory discrimination and generation of hippocampus-dependent memory, both spatial and emotional, then administration of drugs increasing the rate of neurogenesis via activation of 5-HT1A receptors may be a valuable aid in combating problems of the advanced age.",
