     "AB": "The activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and muscarinic receptors was studied in control rats and in rats growth-retarded in utero because of reduction of the blood supply 5 days before birth. The different markers of the cholinergic system were estimated at P (postnatal day) 6, 9, 12, 15, 22 and 60 in cerebellum, hypothalamus, septum, striatum and CA1, CA3 and fascia dentata of the hippocampus. In control rats, there was a transient increase in ChAT activity in the septum during the second week of postnatal development. In the intrauterine growth retarded rats there was a marked delay in this developmental rise in CA1, CA3 at P6 and P9 and in the fascia dentata at P14 respectively. This delayed rise enzyme activity was associated with a significant reduction of muscarinic binding sites [( 3H]QNB) in the hippocampus. AChE staining showed a similar development in both groups. Therefore, the undernutrition produced by a reduction of the blood supply 5 days before birth is associated with a delayed maturation of cholinergic functions.",
