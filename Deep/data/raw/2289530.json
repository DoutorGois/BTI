     "AB": "Rats were treated with 10 mg/kg tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) twice daily for 14 days. THA (10 mg/kg) induced a significant decrease in the number of muscarinic receptors (both M1 and M2) in the cortex and striatum, whereas the number of nicotinic receptors in the cortex and hippocampus increased. Rats treated with physostigmine (0.9 mg/kg) showed a reduced number of muscarinic receptors, but no change in nicotinic receptors. The results indicate that treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors can induce opposite changes in brain muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in vivo.",
