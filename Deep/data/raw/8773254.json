     "AB": "Recordings were made from single neurons in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus while macaques were moved on a platform mounted on a free-moving robot or on wheels in a cue-controlled 2 m x 2 m x 2 m environment, in order to investigate the representation of space and of spatial memory in the primate hippocampus. The test conditions allowed factors that might account for spatial firing of the cells, including the spatial location where the monkey looked, the place were the monkey was, and the head direction of the monkey, to be identified. The responses of some (\"view\") neurons depended on where the monkey was looking in the environment, but not on the place of the monkey in the environment. The responses of one other neuron depended on a combination of where the monkey was facing and his place in the test chamber. The response of view-dependent neurons was affected by occlusion of the visual field. It was possible to show for one neuron that its \"view\" response rotated with rotation of the test chamber. Some neurons responded to a combination of whole-body motion and view or place, and one neuron responded in relation to whole-body movement to a particular place. One neuron responded depending on the place where the monkey was in the environment and relatively independently of view. The representations of space provided by hippocampal view-responsive neurons may be useful in forming memories of spatial environments (for example, of where an object has been seen and of where the monkey is as defined by seen views) and, together with whole-body motion cells, in remembering trajectories through environments, which is of use, for example, in short range spatial navigation.",
