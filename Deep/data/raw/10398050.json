     "AB": "Activation of median raphe serotonergic neurons results in the desynchronization of hippocampal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. This could be a direct effect, because serotonin (5-HT) fibers terminate on a specific population of hippocampal interneurons. On the other hand, it could be an indirect action through the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) pacemaker cells, because, in addition to previously described inhibitory effects, excitatory actions of 5-HT have been demonstrated on MSDB gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing neurons through 5-HT2A receptors. Electron microscopic double immunostaining for Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) injected into the median raphe (MR) and parvalbumin, choline acetyltransferase, or calretinin as well as double immunostaining for 5-HT and parvalbumin, and colocalization for parvalbumin and 5-HT2A receptors were done in rats. The results demonstrated that: 1) MR axons form perisomatic and peridendritic baskets and asymmetric synaptic contacts on MSDB parvalbumin neurons; 2) these fibers do not terminate on septal cholinergic and calretinin neurons; 3) 5-HT fibers form synapses identical to those formed by PHA-L-immunolabeled axons with parvalbumin neurons; and 4) MSDB parvalbumin cells contain 5-HT2A receptors. These observations indicate that 5-HT has a dual action on the activity of hippocampal principal cells: 1) an inhibition of the input sector by activation of hippocampal GABA neurons that terminate exclusively on apical dendrites of pyramidal cells, and 2) a disinhibition of the output sector of principal neurons. MSDB parvalbumin-containing GABAergic neurons specifically innervate hippocampal basket and chandelier cells. Thus, 5-HT-elicited activation of MSDB GABAergic neurons will result in a powerful inhibition of these GABA neurons.",
