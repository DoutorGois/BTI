     "AB": "The present study investigated the effects of Vaccinium uliginosum L. (bilberry) on the learning and memory impairments induced by amyloid-beta protein (AbetaP) 1-42. ICR Swiss mice were divided into 4 groups: the control (Abeta40-1A), control with 5% bilberry group (Abeta40-1B), amyloid beta protein 1-42 treated group (Abeta1-42A), and Abeta1-42 with 5% bilberry group (Abeta1-42B). The control was treated with amyloid beta-protein 40-1 for placebo effect, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) group was treated with amyloid beta-protein 1-42. Amyloid beta-protein 1-42 was intracerebroventricular (ICV) micro injected into the hippocampus in 35% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Although bilberry added groups tended to decrease the finding time of hidden platform, no statistical significance was found. On the other hand, escape latencies of AbetaP injected mice were extended compared to that of Abeta40-1. In the Probe test, bilberry added Abeta1-42B group showed a significant (P<0.05) increase of probe crossing frequency compared to Abeta1-42A. Administration of amyloid protein (Abeta1-42) decreased working memory compared to Abeta40-1 control group. In passive avoidance test, bilberry significantly (P<0.05) increased the time of staying in the lighted area compared to AD control. The results suggest that bilberry may help to improve memory and learning capability in chemically induced Alzheimer's disease in experimental animal models.",
