     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM) are abnormal in individuals with schizophrenia and individuals with bipolar disorder. Functional imaging methods have revealed greater hippocampal activity and less frontotemporal, visual, and posterior cerebellar activity in individuals with schizophrenia when performing a SPEM task. The underlying neurobiology of SPEM deficits in bipolar disorder is unknown. METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3T was performed on fourteen subjects with bipolar disorder and 14 subjects without psychiatric illness during a block design SPEM task. Clinical measures were assessed on the day of testing and related to imaging measures. RESULTS: Subjects with bipolar disorder had greater hemodynamic response than control subjects in cerebellar vermis. Responses were associated with levels of depressive symptoms on the day of study. DISCUSSION: Increased cerebellar vermis activity during the smooth pursuit eye movement task in individuals with bipolar disorder further implicates cerebellar involvement in bipolar disorder. Increased hemodynamic response within the hippocampus was not seen in these individuals and may be a finding specific to schizophrenia.",
