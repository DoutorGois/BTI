     "AB": "The effect of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and lactation on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in different rat brain regions of 3-week-old pups was investigated. There was a significant decrease in the thalamus, pons, cerebellum and hippocampus, no change in posterior colliculus, occipital cortex, temporal cortex, hypothalamus, septum or striatum and a significant increase in frontal cortex, olfactory bulbs, anterior colliculus and amygdala. These modifications could be a consequence of alterations in membrane permeability and may be related to the behavioural disorders associated with the fetal-alcohol syndrome.",
