     "AB": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a 41 amino acid peptide exhibits its actions through two pharmacologically distinct CRF receptor subtypes CRF(1) and CRF(2). Regulation of the relative contribution of the two CRF receptors to central CRF activity may be essential in coordinating physiological responses to stress. To facilitate the analysis of their differential involvement, we recently developed a CRF(1)-selective agonist cortagine by synthesis of chimeric peptides derived from human/rat CRF, ovine CRF, and sauvagine. Cortagine was analyzed in behavioral experiments using male wild type and CRF(2)-deficient C57BL/6J mice for its action on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. In contrast to the current hypothesis that increased CRF(1) activity facilitates the expression of anxiety- and depression-like behavior, cortagine combines anxiogenic properties with antidepressant effects. In this article, we show that antidepressant effects are partially mediated by CRF(1) of the dorsal hippocampus. Possible pathways responsible for the paradoxical antidepressant effects observed after CRF(1) activation are discussed.",
