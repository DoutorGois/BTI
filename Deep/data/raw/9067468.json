     "AB": "We determined the influence of aluminum on dendritic transport, using an in vitro system of dissociated mouse hippocampal neurons. Newly synthesized RNA from dissociated mouse hippocampal neurons was more slowly transported into dendrites in the presence of aluminum chloride when compared to those without the addition of aluminum chloride to the culture medium. Suppression of dendritic transport of newly synthesized RNA may be responsible for the dendritic degeneration observed in aluminum neurotoxicity, eventually leading to neuronal degeneration.",
