     "AB": "Preconditioning with sublethal ischemia attenuates the detrimental effects of subsequent prolonged ischemic insults. This research elucidates potential in vivo cross-tolerance between different neuronal death-generating treatments such as kainate administration, which induces seizures and global ischemia. This study also investigates the effects of a mild epileptic insult on neuronal death in rat hippocampus after a subsequent, lethal epileptic stress using kainic acid (KA) as a model of epilepsy. Three preconditioning groups were as follows: group 1 was injected with 5 mg/kg KA before a 6-minute global ischemia; group 2 received a 3-minute global ischemia before 7.5 mg/kg KA; and group 3 was injected with a 5-mg/kg dose of KA before a 7.5-mg/kg KA injection. The interval between treatments was 3 days. Neuronal degeneration, revealed by the silver impregnation method and analysis of cresyl violet staining, was markedly reduced in rats preconditioned with a sublethal ischemia or a 5-mg/kg KA treatment. Labeling with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2'-deoxyuridine 5'triphosphate-biotin nick-end labeling and DNA laddering confirmed the component of DNA fragmentation in the death of ischemic and epileptic neurons and its reduction in all preconditioned animals. The current study supports the existence of bidirectional cross-tolerance between KA excitotoxicity and global ischemia and suggests the involvement of adenosine A1 receptors and sulfonylurea- and ATP-sensitive K+ channels in this protective phenomenon.",
