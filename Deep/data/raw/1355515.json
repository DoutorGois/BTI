     "AB": "Pregnant CD1 mice were exposed on various gestational or postnatal days to 1 Gy of 250 kV X-rays. Ten adult, male offspring from each exposure condition were tested in a radial arm maze. Compared to sham-exposed control mice, acquisition of spatial information was unimpaired in animals exposed on gestational days 13 or 15, or on postnatal day 10, but animals exposed on gestational day 18 or postnatal day 1 showed sustained deficits in acquisition. These results appear consistent with the known time-course for the proliferation and migration of the dentate granule cells of the hippocampus in the mouse, and are discussed in relation to the dependence on hippocampal integrity of the acquisition and use of spatial information. The results suggest that comparable deficits in mental function might be expected in humans similarly exposed to ionizing radiation during periods of proliferation and migration of the dentate granule cells.",
