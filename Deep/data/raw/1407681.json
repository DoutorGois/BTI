     "AB": "Involvement of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the pathogenesis of delayed neuronal death (DND) of CA1 neurons in the hippocampus has been suggested. We measured regional changes in the content of tissue NGF of the hippocampus in the Mongolian gerbil after 5 min forebrain ischemia. The NGF content was found to decrease significantly in the CA3 and dentate regions by 32% two days after ischemia. By contrast in the CA1 region, the level of NGF became significantly elevated by 50% two weeks after ischemia or later. The early reduction of NGF content in the afferent area projecting to the CA1 sector might be primarily linked to the pathogenesis of DND, whereas the delayed increase within the CA1 sector might be a secondary local response mainly of reactive astroglia.",
