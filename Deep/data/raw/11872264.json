     "AB": "Calbindin D(28K) (CB) expression was analyzed in the rat hippocampus following 10-min-cardiac arrest-induced ischemia within a year after reperfusion. In rats examined 3 days after ischemia, CB immunoreactivity disappeared completely from CA1 pyramidal neurons and from most CA2 pyramids. In the stratum granulosum of the dentate gyrus, mossy fibers, and hippocampal interneurons, CB immunoreactivity was preserved, although staining was somewhat paler than that in control rats. A similar pattern of CB immunoreactivity was found in rats sacrificed 14 days and 1 month after cardiac arrest. From the 14th postischemic day, neuronal loss in the stratum pyramidale of CA1 but not in that of CA2 became apparent. The reappearance of CB immunoreactivity in CA1 and CA2 pyramidal neurons was noticed 6 months after ischemia, and the pattern was identical to that observed in animals sacrificed 12 months after the ictus. The prolonged loss and delayed reappearance of CB immunoreactivity in the hippocampus demonstrate that ischemia may induce long-term disturbances of protein expression, which may in turn result in impairment of hippocampal functioning.",
