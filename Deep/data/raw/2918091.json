     "AB": "The in situ detection of macromolecules by means of immunoelectron microscopy provides information about their ultrastructural localization in cellular compartments. With this technique, we have demonstrated that the contractile proteins actin and myosin are both localized in dendritic spines at densities exceeding those of other neuronal compartments. Myosin was associated with actin filaments, with spine plasma membrane, and with membranes of the spine apparatus. Given the dynamic properties of actin and myosin, these data suggest that these proteins may be involved in the mechanism of synaptic plasticity in general and in morphometric change resulting from intense synaptic activation in particular.",
