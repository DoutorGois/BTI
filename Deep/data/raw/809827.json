     "AB": "60 subjects with restricted cortical lesions, 7 with diffuse cortical disease, 7 with bilateral lesions of the hippocampo-mamillo-thalamic circuit and 36 normal subjects underwent immediate reproduction tests and training tests in the following three categories: audio-verbal, visuo-spatial, gestural. Subjects with lesions of the H.M.T. circuit had normal results in the three immediate reproduction tests and failed in the three training tests. Subjects with diffuse cortical lesions showed pathological results in all the tests. Subjects with restricted cortical lesions showed selective deficiencies in certain tests; there was no systematic connection between failure in the immediate reproduction test and failure in the corresponding training test. The results were analysed having regard to the location of the lesion but also to the symptoms.",
