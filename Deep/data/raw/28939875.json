     "AB": "A high-fat (HF) diet alters gut microbiota and promotes obesity related inflammation and cognitive impairment. Teasaponin is the major active component of tea, and has been associated with anti-inflammatory effects and improved microbiota composition. However, the potential protective effects of teasaponin, against HF diet-induced obesity and its associated alteration of gut microbiota, inflammation and cognitive decline have not been studied. In this study, obesity was induced in C57BL/6 J male mice by feeding a HF diet for 8 weeks, followed by treatment with oral teasaponin (0.5%) mixed in HF diet for a further 6 weeks. Teasaponin treatment prevented the HF diet-induced recognition memory impairment and improved neuroinflammation, gliosis and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) deficits in the hippocampus. Furthermore, teasaponin attenuated the HF diet-induced endotoxemia, pro-inflammatory macrophage accumulation in the colon and gut microbiota alterations. Teasaponin also improved glucose tolerance and reduced body weight gain in HF diet-induced obese mice. The behavioral and neurochemical improvements suggest that teasaponin could limit unfavorable gut microbiota alterations and cognitive decline in HF diet-induced obesity.",
