     "AB": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) produces a tissue-specific decrease in protein levels of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), an important cross-linking component of the neuronal cytoskeleton. Because moderate brain hypothermia (30 degrees C) reduces certain neurobehavioral deficits produced by TBI, we examined the efficacy of moderate hypothermia (30 degrees C) in reversing the TBI-induced loss of MAP2 protein. Naive, sham-injured, and moderate (2.1 atm) fluid percussion-injured rats were assessed for MAP2 protein content 3 h post injury using quantitative immunoreactivity measurements. Parallel groups of sham-injured and fluid percussion-injured animals were maintained in moderate hypothermia (30 degrees C), as measured by temporalis muscle temperature, for MAP2 quantitation 3 h post injury. No difference in MAP2 levels was observed between naive and sham-injured normothermic animals. Hypothermia alone had no effect on soluble MAP2 levels in sham-injured animals compared with normothermic sham-injured controls (88.0 +/- 7.3%; p > 0.10). Fluid percussion injury dramatically reduced MAP2 levels in the normothermic group (44.3 +/- 5.9%; p < 0.0005) compared with normothermic sham-injured controls. No significant reduction of MAP2 was seen in the hypothermic injured group (95.2 +/- 4.6%; compared with hypothermic sham-injured controls, p > 0.20). Although it is premature to infer any causal link, the data suggest that the attenuation of injury-induced MAP2 loss by hypothermia may contribute to its overall neuroprotective action.",
