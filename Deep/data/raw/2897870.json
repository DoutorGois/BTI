     "AB": "Using a combination of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, the development of somatostatin (SS)-containing neurons and fibers was examined in the rat dorsal hippocampus and dentate gyrus. The major development of this hippocampal peptidergic system occurs postnatally. At postnatal day 1 (P1), neurons containing SS mRNA are evident primarily in the stratum oriens, but also in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Similar neurons are also immunoreactive for SS28 and SS28(1-12), suggesting a minimal lag in the transcription of SS mRNA and its translation into specific SS peptides. The number of SS neurons increases postnatally to P10, followed by a decrease in number in the adult. This transient change in the number of SS neurons coincides with dramatic changes in SS28(1-12)-immunoreactive fibers, which are initially present in the stratum lacunosum moleculare, with no significant immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus. By P15, the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus is densely innervated, while similar immunoreactivity in the stratum lacunosum moleculare is greatly reduced. These data are consistent with a transient projection from the stratum oriens to the stratum lacunosum moleculare, which is replaced by a projection from the hilus to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus as this structure matures.",
