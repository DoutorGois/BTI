     "AB": "The present study investigated the effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor, sodium butyrate (SB), on locomotor behavior and on mitochondrial respiratory-chain complexes activity in the brain of rats subjected to an animal model of mania induced by d-amphetamine (d-AMPH). In the reversal treatment, Wistar rats were first treated with d-AMPH or saline (Sal) for 14 days. Thereafter, between days 8 and 14, rats were administered SB or Sal. In the prevention treatment, rats were treated with SB or Sal for 14 days and received d-AMPH or Sal between days 8 and 14. The d-AMPH treatment increased locomotor behavior in Sal-treated rats under reversion and prevention treatment, and SB reversed and prevented d-AMPH-related hyperactivity. Moreover, d-AMPH decreased the activity of mitochondrial respiratory-chain complexes in Sal-treated rats in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and amygdala in both experiments, and SB was able to reverse and prevent this impairment. The present study suggests that the mechanism of action of SB involves induction of mitochondrial function in parallel with behavioral changes, reinforcing the need for more studies on histone deacetylase inhibitors as a possible target for new medications for bipolar disorder treatment.",
