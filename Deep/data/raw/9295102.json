     "AB": "The role of activin in the mammalian brain is of increasing interest as evidence accumulates to suggest a number of different neural functions. Here, we report that activin betaA mRNA is transiently induced in dentate gyrus neurons after unilateral mechanical brain injury by saline injection. Expression is dependent on NMDA receptor activation since pretreatment with MK801 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) largely attenuates the signal. Induction also requires de novo protein synthesis, as cycloheximide (10 mg/kg, i.p.) pretreatment abolishes the expression of activin betaA mRNA 1 h after injury. These results show that activin betaA mRNA expression is regulated by excitatory activity induced by focal brain injury and suggests a possible neuroplastic role in the recovery from such injury.",
