     "AB": "Corpus callosum (CC) size is a complex trait, characterized by a gradation of values within a normal range, as well as abnormalities that include a small or totally absent CC. Among inbred mouse strains with defects of the CC, BTBR T(+)tf/J (BTBR) mice have the most extreme phenotype; all animals show total absence of the CC and severe reduction of the hippocampal commissure (HC). In contrast, the BALB/cByJ (BALB) strain has a low frequency of small CC and consistently normal HC. Reciprocal F(1) crosses between BTBR and BALB suggest the presence of X-linked quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting CC size. Through linkage analysis of backcross male progeny, we have localized two regions on the X chromosome, having peaks at 68.5 Mb (approximately 29.5 cM) and at 134.5 Mb (approximately 60.5 cM) that are largely responsible for the reciprocal differences, with the BTBR allele showing X-linked dominant inheritance associated with CC defects.",
