     "AB": "We have studied synaptic function in a transgenic mouse strain relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD), overexpressing the 695 amino acid isoform of human amyloid precursor protein with K670N and M671L mutations (APP(695)SWE mice), which is associated with early-onset familial AD. Aged-transgenic mice had substantially elevated levels of Abeta (up to 22 micromol/gm) and displayed characteristic Abeta plaques. Hippocampal slices from 12-month-old APP(695)SWE transgenic animals displayed reduced levels of synaptic transmission in the CA1 region when compared with wild-type littermate controls. Inclusion of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate during preparation of brain slices abolished this deficit. At 18 months of age, a selective deficit in basal synaptic transmission was observed in the CA1 region despite treatment with kynurenate. Paired-pulse facilitation and long-term potentiation (LTP) were normal in APP(695)SWE transgenic mice at both 12 and 18 months of age. Thus, although aged APP(695)SWE transgenic mice have greatly elevated levels of Abeta protein, increased numbers of plaques, and reduced basal synaptic transmission, LTP can still be induced and expressed normally. We conclude that increased susceptibility to excitotoxicity rather than a specific effect on LTP is the primary cause of cognitive deficits in APP(695)SWE mice.",
