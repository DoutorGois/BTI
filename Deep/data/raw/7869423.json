     "AB": "Dissociated septal and hippocampal neurons from E18 fetal rats were cultured with varying concentrations of ethanol (0.6-2.4 g/dl) and in cultures containing ethanol plus nerve growth factor (NGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). These substances have been shown to provide neurotrophic support for these populations and to afford neuroprotection against certain toxic substances or conditions applied to some neuronal populations. Both the septal and hippocampal neurons responded to ethanol in a dose-dependent manner. Survival of septal neurons was generally unaffected by initial ethanol concentrations of 0.6 and 1.2 g/dl but was considerably impaired by higher concentrations (1.8 and 2.4 g/dl), while neurite outgrowth was compromised by all ethanol concentrations except the lowest one applied. The hippocampal neurons survived ethanol concentrations up to 2.4 g/dl, although process extension was decreased in concentrations of 1.2 g/dl and higher. NGF or bFGF in the culture medium (in cultures without ethanol) did not affect neuronal survival or process outgrowth in either population, probably owing to the relatively high plating densities of the cultures. NGF did tend to have a moderate ameliorative effect on the ethanol neurotoxicity in the septal cultures, however, and was slightly effective in this regard in hippocampal cultures at intermediate ethanol concentrations (1.8 g/dl). High concentrations of ethanol (2.4 g/dl) reduced the proportion of cholinergic cells in the septal preparations by approximately 50%. This neuronal loss could be reversed by inclusion of high concentrations of NGF in the culture medium (100 ng/ml) but not by a lower concentration (20 ng/ml). bFGF provided some protection against ethanol cytotoxicity with respect to both populations. The implications of these results for studies of fetal alcohol effects are discussed, as well as their relation to prior reports of trophic factor neuroprotection.",
