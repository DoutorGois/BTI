Therefore, a priori only a small proportion of all patients with epilepsy can meet the criteria for selective surgical interventions. From the evidence in patients meeting the criteria for AHE, we conclude that this technique is to be preferred to the \"standard\" anterior temporal lobectomy and represents a more selective but still effective surgical treatment of epilepsy.",
