     "AB": "Wogonin is a flavonoid isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis root, and has multiple pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-cancer effects. It is also neuroprotective in the brain under many stress conditions, but wogonin does not elevate neuronal cell survival. Thus, the mechanisms controlling the neuroprotective effect of wogonin are not clear. Neural precursor cells (NPCs), present in the hippocampus and subventricular zone of adult brains, replace damaged cells. In this study we investigated the biological functions underlying the neuroprotective effect of wogonin on NPCs. We initially examined survival of NPCs but found it was slightly reduced at concentrations higher than 2mug/ml. When we explored differentiation of NPCs into neuronal cells, the number of differentiated cells expressing neurofilaments was increased remarkably (fourfold) in the hippocampal NPCs treated with wogonin. Wogonin maximally elevated the expressions of presynaptic protein, synapsin I and postsynaptic protein (PSD95) at a concentration of 0.7mug/ml. Differentiated cells containing longer neurites were significantly increased in cortical NPCs, primarily cultured from rat E14 embryonic brain. Wogonin also promoted differentiation of NPCs into mature neurons in vivo. When transplanted into the adult rat hippocampus, NPCs differentiated into cells expressing NeuN, the mature neuron marker, by 4weeks after transplantation. These data indicate that wogonin induces differentiation of NPCs both in culture and in vivo, and suggest that facilitation of NPC differentiation is a biological activity by which wogonin protects neurons in damaged brain.",
