     "AB": "During spatial navigation, women typically navigate an environment using a landmark strategy, whereas men typically use an orientation strategy. To examine the as yet unknown effects of sexual orientation on these normative sex differences, this study required 80 healthy heterosexual and homosexual adult men and women to provide directions from experimental maps for 4 routes. The frequency and type of strategy used by each participant were computed. Expected sex differences were demonstrated, and a robust cross-sex shift was shown by homosexual men in using landmarks. This remained after controlling for differences in mental rotation, directional sense, and general intelligence. The findings may limit the number of putative neurodevelopmental pathways responsible for sex differences in navigation strategy utility.",
