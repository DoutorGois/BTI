     "AB": "The aim of the present study was to visualize postischemic hippocampal neuronal death in the living monkey brain, using a high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET) and novel radioligands. In preceding papers, we reported on postischemic hippocampal neuronal death in a model of Japanese monkeys (Macaca fuscata) undergoing a 20-min complete whole-brain ischemia. Using the same model here, we investigated the in vivo bindings of two radiotracers, [11C]Ro15-4513 (a type II benzodiazepine receptor ligand) and [11C](+)3-MPB (a muscarinic cholinergic receptor ligand), in the hippocampus on day 7 after ischemia, as compared to the normal hippocampus. A significant decrease in the in vivo binding of [11C]Ro154513 and [11C(+)3-MPB was observed in the postischemic monkey hippocampus on day 7 after ischemia compared to controls. Light and electron microscopic analyses of postischemic CA1 neurons showed typical features of coagulation necrosis, as associated with a marked reduction of postsynaptic densities and presynaptic vesicles. These results suggest that semiquantification of hippocampal neuronal death is possible in the living primate brain using PET, and that the same procedures can be applied for evaluating neuronal cell loss in patients with ischemic injuries and/or dementia.",
