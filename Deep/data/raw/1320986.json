     "AB": "Cytochrome oxidase (COX) activity and COX II mRNA expression were localized in the hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex of the rhesus monkey brain by means of enzyme histochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively. Within the hippocampal formation, the terminal field of the perforant pathway showed the highest levels of COX activity, whereas COX II mRNA was localized mainly in neuronal cell bodies. In the entorhinal cortex. COX II mRNA was detected in neuronal cell bodies of layers II and IV. These results indicate that the pattern of localization of COX and its mRNA in entorhinal cortex correlates with the input and output pathways of the hippocampus.",
