     "AB": "The interaction between brain ischemia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been intensively investigated recently. Nevertheless, we have not yet understood the nature and mechanisms of the ischemic episodes triggering the onset of AD and how they influence its slow progression. The assumed connection between brain ischemia and the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide awaits to be clearly explained. In our research, we employed a rat cardiac arrest model to study the changes in gene expression of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and its cleaving enzymes, beta- and gamma-secretases (including presenilins) in hippocampal CA1 sector, following transient 10-min global brain ischemia. The quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR assay demonstrated that the expression of all above genes that contribute to Abeta peptide generation was dysregulated during 30 days in postischemic hippocampal CA1 area. It suggests that studied Abeta peptide generation-related genes can be involved in AbetaPP metabolism, following global brain ischemia and will be useful to identify the molecular mechanisms underpinning that cerebral ischemia might be an etiological cause of AD via dysregulation of AbetaPP and its cleaving enzymes, beta- and gamma-secretases genes, and subsequently, it may increase Abeta peptide production and promote the gradual and slow development of AD neuropathology. Our data demonstrate that brain ischemia activates delayed neuronal death in hippocampus in an AbetaPP-dependent manner, thus defining a new and important mode of ischemic cell death.",
