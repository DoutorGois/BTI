     "AB": "In rat hippocampal slices exposed to short duration anoxia, recovery of synaptic transmission was dependent upon the magnitude of the K+o undershoot (K+o drop below resting level) seen following return to normoxic conditions. Because the K+o undershoot is likely to be related to ion pump activity, our results imply that recovery of brain from stroke depends upon how well ion transport and energy production recover.",
