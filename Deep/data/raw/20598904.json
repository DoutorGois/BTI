     "AB": "Members of the 14-3-3 protein family have been implicated in neuronal migration, synaptic plasticity and learning. Using affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry analysis, we show here that the cytoskeletal protein alphaII spectrin is a novel ligand of 14-3-3beta. We found that 14-3-3beta interacts with alphaII spectrin via the mode 2 14-3-3 binding motif RLIQS(1302)HP. Binding required phosphorylation of Ser(1302) by casein kinase II and was enhanced in the presence of calmodulin. Co-immunoprecipitation of alphaII spectrin and 14-3-3beta with the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM suggested that the 14-3-3-spectrin-interaction affects NCAM function. Indeed, disruption of the 14-3-3beta/alphaII spectrin interaction by mutating Ser(1302) to Ala enhanced NCAM-dependent neurite outgrowth. Our results indicate that the phosphorylation-dependent interaction between 14-3-3beta and alphaII spectrin acts as a switch between positive and negative regulation of neurite outgrowth stimulated by NCAM, representing a novel and acute mechanism preventing uncontrolled elongation of neuronal processes.",
