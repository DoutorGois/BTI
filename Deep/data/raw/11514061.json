     "AB": "The brain serotonin (5-HT) system interacts closely with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. We examined the effects of stress on hippocampal 5-HT7 receptor and corticosteroid receptor (mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR)) mRNA expression measured by in situ hybridisation histochemistry. Acute restraint stress increased 5-HT7 receptor mRNA in CA2 and CA3 hippocampal subregions (32% increase) and had a small effect on GR but not MR mRNA (19% fall in GR in CA1). In contrast, chronic stress (1 week of variable stressors) had little effect on hippocampal 5-HT7 receptor mRNA (9% rise in CA3) but decreased MR mRNA (e.g. 34% decrease in CA2) and GR mRNA expression selectively in the dentate gyrus (26% decrease). The rise in 5-HT7 receptor mRNA expression following restraint stress parallels our previously reported increase in expression after inhibiting the synthesis of adrenal steroids. These data suggest that acute but not chronic stress regulates 5-HT7 receptor mRNA expression in a manner that is likely to be independent of its glucocorticoid actions.",
