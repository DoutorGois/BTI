     "AB": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of estrogen receptors in the activation of phospholipase C (PLC)-phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the hippocampus from rats in estrous and proestrous phases. 17beta-Estradiol (E2) and ESR1-selective agonist PPT, but not ESR2-selective agonist DPN, induced a rapid increase on total [(3)H]-inositol phosphate accumulation in the hippocampus from both rats. These effects are mediated by PLC activation, since the inhibition of this protein decreased the total [(3)H]-inositol phosphate accumulation. The pretreatment with ESR1 and ESR2 antagonist ICI 182,780, but not with GPER antagonist G-15, blocked the total [(3)H]-inositol phosphate accumulation induced by E2 and PPT, confirming that ESR1 is upstream component regulating this rapid effect. SRC family of protein tyrosine kinases inhibitor PP2 blocked the total [(3)H]-inositol phosphate accumulation induced by E2 and PPT in hippocampus, suggesting that ESR1 undergoes translocation from the nuclei to the plasma membrane region via SRC to activate rapid signaling pathways. Furthermore, the magnitude of the response to E2 and PPT was higher in hippocampus from rats in proestrous than in estrous. On the other hand, the expression of the ESR1 is higher in hippocampus from rats in estrous than in proestrous, indicating that the regulation of this receptor by estrous cycle does not play a role in the magnitude of the response to E2 and PPT in hippocampus. In conclusion, our results indicate that E2 activates SRC-mediated translocation of ESR1 to the plasma membrane, which results in the activation of PLC-inositol phosphate signaling pathway in rat hippocampus. Thus, these rapid estrogen actions in hippocampus might be a key step mediating cellular events important for learning and memory.",
