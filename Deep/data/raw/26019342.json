     "AB": "GABA(A) receptors form Cl(-) permeable channels that mediate the majority of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain. The K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter KCC2 is the main mechanism by which neurons establish low intracellular Cl(-) levels, which is thought to enable GABAergic inhibitory control of neuronal activity. However, the widely used KCC2 inhibitor furosemide is nonselective with antiseizure efficacy in slices and in vivo, leading to a conflicting scheme of how KCC2 influences GABAergic control of neuronal synchronization. Here we used the selective KCC2 inhibitor VU0463271 [N-cyclopropyl-N-(4-methyl-2-thiazolyl)-2-[(6-phenyl-3-pyridazinyl)thio]acetamide ] to investigate the influence of KCC2 function. Application of VU0463271 caused a reversible depolarizing shift in E(GABA) values and increased spiking of cultured hippocampal neurons. Application of VU0463271 to mouse hippocampal slices under low-Mg(2+) conditions induced unremitting recurrent epileptiform discharges. Finally, microinfusion of VU0463271 alone directly into the mouse dorsal hippocampus rapidly caused epileptiform discharges. Our findings indicated that KCC2 function was a critical inhibitory factor ex vivo and in vivo.",
