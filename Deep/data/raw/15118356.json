     "AB": "Serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT4 binding parameters and their second messengers 1,4,5-inositol triphosphate (IP3) and cyclic adenosyl monophosphate (cAMP) were studied in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus and amygdala of 19 control subjects and 19 antidepressant-free, violent suicide victims. A significantly higher number of 5-HT4 receptors and higher second messenger cAMP concentrations were found in the frontal cortex and caudate nucleus of the depressed suicide victims as compared with the control group. Furthermore, significantly increased 5-HT2A binding sites and IP3 concentrations were noted in the caudate nucleus of the suicide victims, together with a significantly reduced number of 5-HT2A binding sites, higher binding affinity and increased IP3 concentrations in the hippocampus. No significant alterations in 5-HT4 and cAMP or in 5-HT2A and IP3 concentrations were observed in the amygdala. The caudate nucleus of depressed suicide victims seems to be the brain region with the highest alteration of the serotonergic system, and hence with the most diagnostic sensitivity. Further studies on suicidality and depression should focus on the functionality of the caudate nucleus.",
