     "AB": "Aging is associated with an increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders which has been linked to chronic inflammation. This process generates oxygen-reactive species, ultimately responsible for a process known as oxidative stress, leading to changes in nitric oxide (NO), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) signaling pathway. In previous studies, we showed that human aging was associated with an increase in NO Synthase (NOS) activity, a decrease in basal cyclic GMP levels in human platelets, and an increase in thiobarbituric acid-reactant substances (TBARS) in erythrocytes. The aim of the present work was to evaluate NOS activity, TBARS and cyclic GMP levels in hippocampus and frontal cortex and its correlation to platelets and erythrocytes of 4-, 12-, and 24-month-old rats. The result showed an age-related decrease in cyclic GMP levels which was linked to an increase in NOS activity and TBARS in both central areas as well as in platelets and erythrocytes of rats. The present data confirmed our previous studies performed in human platelets and erythrocytes and validate NOS activity and cyclic GMP in human platelet as well as TBARS in erythrocytes as biomarkers to study age-related disorders and new anti-aging therapies.",
