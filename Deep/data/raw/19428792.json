     "AB": "The metabolic changes in hippocampus, temporal cortex and prefrontal cortex in SD rats along with aging were explored using a metabonomic approach, which based on high resolution \"magic angle spinning\"(1)H NMR spectroscopy. The metabolite profiles were analyzed by partial least squares-discriminant analysis, and the results showed that the metabolites of the above three brain regions in old rats were dramatically different from that in the adult and young rats. The old rats showed increased myo-inositol and lactate in all of the three brain regions, and decreased N-acetylaspartate in temporal and frontal cortex, Glutamate-GABA level became imbalance in temporal cortex of old rats. In addition, compared with the adult female rats, male rats had higher levels of N-acetylaspartate, taurine, and creatine in temporal or frontal cortex. The age-related metabolic changes may indicate the early functional alterations of neural cells in these brain regions, especially the temporal cortex. The gender-related metabolic changes suggest the significance of the hormonal regulation in brain metabolism. Our work highlights the potential of metabolic profiling to enhance our understanding of biological mechanisms of brain aging.",
