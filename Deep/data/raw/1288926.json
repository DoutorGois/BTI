     "AB": "Adjuvant arthritis (AA) rats were used as the chronic pain model. The cortical and hippocampal (HPC) EEG were recorded. The behaviour and local inflammatory reaction were observed. The results showed an arousal response of desynchronization of the ECoG and HPC EEG in the AA rats, the delta waves were decreased and beta waves increased significantly. However, the inhibited effect to the desynchronization were showed could be inhibited by the electro-acupuncture (EA) on bilateral Zusanli points and morphine in the AA rats. The results suggested that the cortex and hippocampus participate in the modulating action of chronic pain, and the EA has an analgesic action.",
