     "AB": "The in vitro and ex vivo monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory effects of (+/-)4-dimethylamino-alpha-methyl-phenethylamine (4-DMAA) and (+/-)4-methylamino-alpha-methyl-phenethylamine (4-MAA) were reassessed, in comparison with the previously unstudied achiral parent compound, 4-dimethyl-aminophenethylamine (4-DMAPEA) and with a salt of 4-DMAA enriched in the levo isomer, (\"-\")-4-DMAA, using amiflamine [S-(+)-4-dimethylamino-alpha,2-dimethylphenethylamine] as positive control. The in vitro studies confirmed that 4-amino-alpha-methylphenethylamine derivatives are highly selective and reversible MAO-A inhibitors. Furthermore, (\"-\")-4DMAA was less active than the racemic mixture. The side chain-unsubstituted compound, 4-DMAPEA, proved to be a nonselective and reversible MAO inhibitor. The ex vivo results, in which catecholamines, serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites were measured in two brain regions after i.p. administration, confirmed the results obtained in vitro. These results are consistent with the suggestion that the 4-amino group contributes to MAO inhibitory effects of alpha-methyl-phenethylamines, and show that the presence and orientation of an alpha-methyl side chain substituent may be important when determining the potency and selectivity of these compounds. All compounds tested could be quantified by HPLC with electrochemical detection.",
