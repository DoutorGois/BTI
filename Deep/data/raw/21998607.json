     "AB": "Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is believed to be a multifunctional neural modulator that affects synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. In the present study, we investigated the differential effects of treadmill exercise on COX-2 immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus in early and chronic diabetic stages in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and lean control (ZLC) rats. To this end, ZLC and ZDF rats at 6 or 23 weeks of age were put on a treadmill with or without running for 1 h/day for 5 consecutive days at 16-22 m/min for 5 weeks or 12-16 m/min for 7 weeks, respectively. Treadmill exercise in prediabetic and chronic diabetic rats significantly reduced blood glucose levels. In particular, exercise in the prediabetic rat blocked the onset of diabetes. COX-2 immunoreactivity was mainly detected in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and stratum pyramidale of the CA3 region in all groups. COX-2 immunoreactivity was significantly increased in these regions of ZLC and ZDF rats after treadmill exercise in the early diabetic stage. However, COX-2 immunoreactivity was not changed in these regions in ZDF rats after treadmill exercise in the chronic stage. These results suggest that treadmill exercise in diabetic animals in the chronic stage has limited ability to cause plasticity in the dentate gyrus.",
