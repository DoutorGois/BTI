     "AB": "The increased prevalence of schizophrenia in the population with mildly intellectual disability (ID) remains unexplained. The present study explores several possibilities by examining historical/clinical findings in relation to structural neuroimaging findings in three groups: (1) comorbid mild ID and schizophrenia; (2) schizophrenia alone; and (3) mild ID alone. Information about clinical and historical variables was obtained from 101 subjects (39 with comorbidity, 34 with schizophrenia and 28 with mild ID), out of whom 68 (23, 25 and 20, respectively) had had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Although a number of significant correlations exist between clinical variables and structural MRI abnormalities in all three groups, no clearly predictive inter- or between-group differences emerged. More striking was the finding that showed small amygdalo-hippocampal size to be associated with a history of central nervous system injury, especially meningitis. These findings provide support for the view that cognitive impairment and comorbid psychosis can result from a common cause, such as meningitis or obstetric complications, possibly interacting with other factors, such as family history.",
