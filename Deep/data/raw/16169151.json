     "AB": "APP(695)SWE/co+PS1/DeltaE9 mice with Abeta plaques in neocortex and hippocampus were evaluated in tests of exploratory activity and spatial learning. On the initial testing day, 12-month-old APP(695)SWE/co+PS1/DeltaE9 mice spent more time than non-transgenic controls in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze. The bigenic group also travelled farther in the central region of the open-field without spending more time there. Only the bigenic group alternated above chance in the T-maze. In the Morris water maze, APP(695)SWE/co+PS1/DeltaE9 mice were impaired during acquisition of the hidden platform sub-task and the probe trial but not in the visible platform test. These results indicate a selective spatial deficit and disinhibitory tendencies in a mouse model with amyloid pathology.",
