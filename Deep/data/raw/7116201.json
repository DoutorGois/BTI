The hippocampal VEP is less complex in appearance than the VEP recorded from the visual cortex. It consists of several distinct, reliably reproducible peaks and one distinct afterpotential (AP). The ease of recording and the reliability of the elicited electrophysiological responses recommended this primitive placental insectivore for use in comparative electrophysiological and psychophysiological studies.",
