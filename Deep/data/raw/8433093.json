     "AB": "The effect of pentoxifylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was investigated on the development of cerebral malaria in Plasmodium berghei K 173 infected C57/B16 mice. No significant differences occurred in the course of parasitemia and survival time after infection between control mice and pentoxifylline treated mice. Moreover, no differences were observed between the groups with respect to the occurrence of cerebral malaria. The only striking difference was that pentoxifylline treatment selectively prevented neuronal cell damage in the sector CA1 of the hippocampus. These findings are in contrast to previous studies, where pentoxifylline prevented cerebral malaria in P. berghei ANKA infected CBA/Ca mice, another widely used model of cerebral malaria. Obvious differences exist between these models.",
