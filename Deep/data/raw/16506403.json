In addition, digital image analysis allows semi-quantification of cell labeling because it is capable of measuring simultaneously the staining intensity, location, size, and shape of labeled profiles. In the present work, the morphological changes in the CB1 hippocampal area and corpus striatum induced by chronic treatment with the synthetic CB1-receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 were analyzed as an example of digital image analysis application. Twice-daily treatment for 14 d with the CB1-receptor agonist demonstrated significant changes in the expression of neuronal cytoskeletal proteins and in neuronal morphology, as evidenced by immunocytochemical and digital analysis studies. However, changes in the expression of astroglial cytoskeletal proteins were not found.",
