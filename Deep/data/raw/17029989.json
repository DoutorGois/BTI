     "AB": "The requirement for de novo protein synthesis during multiple forms of learning, memory and behavior is well-established; however, we are only beginning to uncover the regulatory mechanisms that govern this process. In order to determine how translation initiation is regulated during neuroplasticity we engineered mutant C57Bl/6J mice that lack the translation repressor eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2) and have previously demonstrated that 4E-BP2 plays a critical role in hippocampus-dependent synaptic plasticity and memory. Herein, we examined the 4E-BP2 knockout mice in a battery of paradigms to address motor activity and motor skill learning, anxiety and social dominance behaviors, working memory and conditioned taste aversion. We found that the 4E-BP2 knockout mice demonstrated altered activity in the rotating rod test, light/dark exploration test, spontaneous alternation T-maze and conditioned taste aversion test. The information gained from these studies builds a solid foundation for future studies on the specific role of 4E-BP2 in various types of behavior, and for a broader, more detailed examination of the mechanisms of translational control in the brain.",
