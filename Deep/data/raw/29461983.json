     "AB": "Cognitive challenges are often accompanied by a discharge of stress hormones, which in turn modulate multiple brain areas. Among these, the medial temporal lobe and the prefrontal cortex are critically involved in high-order cognitive functions such as learning, memory, and decision-making. Previous studies assessing the effects of corticosterone on spatial memory found an increase or a decrease in performance depending on the timing of stress hormone discharge relative to the behavioral task. Most of these studies, however, made use of aversively motivated behaviors, whereas less is known about corticosteroid effects on flexible learning during reward-driven spatial navigation. To study how corticosterone modulates flexible spatial learning, we tested rats on a place-reward association task where hormone treatment was administered immediately after a session presenting a change in reward locations. The corticosterone-treated group showed delayed learning during the initial sessions and suboptimal memory consolidation throughout testing. Repeated training on the novel reward positions improved performance and eliminated differences from the control group. We conclude that a marked increase in plasma corticosterone levels immediately after training impairs the flexible formation of new place-reward associations.",
