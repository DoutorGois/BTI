     "AB": "AIM: To investigate the relationship between cerebroprotection of pinocembrin and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and their regulating enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). METHODS: Rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to mimic permanent focal ischemia, and pinocembrin was administrated via tail vein injection at 10 min, 4 h, 8 h and 23 h after MCAO. After 24 MCAO, rats were re-anesthetized, and the blood and brain were harvested and analyzed. RESULTS: Pinocembrin displayed significant protective effects on MCAO rats indicated by reduced neurological deficits and infarct volume. Importantly, co-administration of 0.2 mg.kg(-1) 14, 15-EEZE, a putative selective EET antagonist, weakened the beneficial effects of pinocembrin. 14, 15-EET levels in the blood and brain of rats after 24 h MCAO were elevated in the presence of pinocembrin. In an assay for hydrolase activity, pinocembrin significantly lowered brain sEH activity of MCAO rats and inhibited recombinant human sEH activity in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50, 2.58 mumol.L(-1)). In addition, Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis showed that pinocembrin at doses of 10 mg.kg(-1) and 30 mg.kg(-1) significantly down-regulated sEH protein in rat brain, especially the hippocampus CA1 region of MCAO rats. CONCLUSION: Inhibiting sEH and then increasing the potency of EETs may be one of the mechanisms through which pinocembrin provides cerebral protection.",
