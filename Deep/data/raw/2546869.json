     "AB": "The action of a reactive oxygen intermediate, that is, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on modulation of synaptic transmission was examined in the hippocampal brain slice preparation. Microinjection of H2O2 into the apical dendritic region of the CA1 pyramidal cells produced no change in either the pattern or amplitude of paired pulse facilitation compared to saline injection (control). Long term potentiation (LTP), induced by high frequency stimulation of homosynaptic inputs, however, was blocked by microinjection of H2O2 into the dendritic tree. LTP was seen in only 2 out of 10 slices investigated when treated with H2O2 while LTP was seen in 4 out of 5 slices when saline injected. The results suggest that a reactive oxygen intermediate can selectively modify synaptic mechanisms in the hippocampus.",
