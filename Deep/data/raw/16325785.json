     "AB": "Cystatin C, a cysteine protease inhibitor, is implicated in pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. Our recent study showed that cystatin C injection into rat hippocampus induced neuronal cell death in granule cell layer of dentate gyrus in vivo. We further confirmed that cystatin C neurotoxicity was inhibited by simultaneous coapplication of cathepsin B, a cysteine protease. In vitro cytotoxicity was also studied in cultures of human CNS neurons, mixed cultures with astrocytes and A1 human hybrid neurons. Cystatin C induced neuronal cell death in a dose-dependent manner, which accompanied increased number of TUNEL (+) cells, up-regulation of active caspase-3 and DNA ladder. The results of the present study indicate that cystatin C participates in the process of apoptotic neuronal cell death in experimental conditions by means of inhibitory activity of cysteine proteases, and that cystatin C might be involved in the pathogenesis in human neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease.",
