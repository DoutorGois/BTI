     "AB": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins play an important role in early cortical development, specifically in the formation of neural connections and in controlling the cyto-architecture of the central nervous system. F-spondin and Mindin are a family of matrix-attached adhesion molecules that share structural similarities and overlapping domains of expression. Genes for both proteins contain a thrombospondin type I repeat(s) at the C terminus and an FS1-FS2 (spondin) domain. Both the vertebrate F-spondin and the zebrafish mindins are expressed on the embryonic floor plate. In the current study we have cloned the rat homologue of mindin and studied its expression and activity together with F-spondin in the developing rodent brain. The two genes are abundantly expressed in the developing hippocampus. In vitro studies indicate that both F-spondin and Mindin promote adhesion and outgrowth of hippocampal embryonic neurons. We have also demonstrated that the two proteins bind to a putative receptor(s) expressed on both hippocampal and sensory neurons.",
