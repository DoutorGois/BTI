     "AB": "In animals with hippocampal damage, the signaled administration of reward is sufficient to induce the sort of behavioral sterotypy and locomotion that heretofore has been observed only after drug administration. Haloperidol returns these behaviors to normal. The interaction of the hippocampus with reward helps to explain many well-known characteristics of animals with lesions in the hippocampus and may have relevance for catecholamine-based clinical disorders.",
