     "AB": "In the present investigation, regional ATP, glucose, and lactate contents were examined in the cortical and subcortical structures after cold lesion in rats. Bioluminescence imaging of ATP, glucose, and lactate was performed in serial tissue sections at 4 h (n = 4), 12 h (n = 4) and 24 h (n = 4) after cold injury or sham surgery. Bioluminescence images were analyzed by computer-assisted densitometry, at the lesion site, in cortical areas, in the hippocampus, and in the thalamus. ATP and glucose content were significantly decreased at the lesion site as well as on the contralateral side after 4, 12, and 24 h postinjury Lactate content increased significantly in the hippocampal area on the ipsilateral side at 12 h. Cortical lactate was bilaterally unchanged. The cold lesion injury led to a characteristic ischemic profile in the hippocampus signaled by low ATP and glucose content paralleled by high lactate levels. The otherwise global depletion of glucose and ATP suggests that other factors besides cerebral blood flow may contribute to the impairment of energy metabolism.",
