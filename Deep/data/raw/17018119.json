     "AB": "The effects of pH(i) on GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were studied in mechanically dissociated CA3 pyramidal neurons, by use of ammonium prepulse and whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, under the voltage-clamp condition. NH(4)Cl itself, which is expected to alkalinize pH(i), increased GABAergic mIPSC frequency in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, NH(4)Cl decreased mIPSC frequency, either in the presence of 200 microm Cd(2+) or in Ca(2+)-free external solution, suggesting that intraterminal alkalosis decreased GABAergic mIPSC frequency while [NH4(+)] itself may activate Ca(2+) channels by depolarizing the terminal. On the other hand, GABAergic mIPSC frequency was greatly increased immediately after NH(4)Cl removal, a condition expected to acidify pH(i), and recovered to the control level within 2 min after NH(4)Cl removal. This explosive increase in mIPSC frequency observed after NH(4)Cl removal was completely eliminated after depletion of Ca(2+) stores with 1 microm thapsigargin in the Ca(2+)-free external solution, suggesting that acidification increases in intraterminal Ca(2+) concentration via both extracellular Ca(2+) influx and Ca(2+) release from the stores. However, the acidification-induced increase in mIPSC frequency had not recovered by 10 min after NH(4)Cl removal either in the Na(+)-free external solution or in the presence of 10 microm 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA), a specific Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE) blocker. The present results suggest that NHEs are major intraterminal pH regulators on GABAergic presynaptic nerve terminals, and that the NHE-mediated regulation of pH(i) under normal physiological or pathological conditions might play an important role in the neuronal excitability by increasing inhibitory tones.",
