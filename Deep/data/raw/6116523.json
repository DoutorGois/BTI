     "AB": "The activity of choline acetyltransferase is over twice as high in the hippocampus of Wistar Kyoto (WKY) than in Brown Norway (BN) rats, and this is paralleled by a comparable difference in acetylcholinesterase staining intensity within the hippocampal formation. However, the size of the whole hippocampus is smaller in WKY than in BN rats. There are no strain differences in the activities of the neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes: tyrosine hydroxylase in the septum and glutamic acid decarboxylase in the hippocampus. The findings indicate the existence of strain-dependent inverse relationship between the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system and the size of the hippocampus.",
