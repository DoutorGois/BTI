     "AB": "We investigated the possibility to produce hippocampal or amygdala kindling syndrome in rabbits which had been electrically stimulated at a fixed interval between stimuli at 5 min. Animals were prepared with chronically implanted electrodes (neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus caudatus). The initial stimuli produced only localized effect, but repeated applications of the stimuli progressively increased the seizure activity resulting in generalized kindled convulsions after 2-4 h period. At the first stage generalized seizures were followed by long lasting refractory period, but at the end of the procedure almost all stimuli evoke major motor seizures and recurrent widely spread electrographic epileptic changes. The most noteworthy findings emerging from this study is the inhibition of postictal seizure inhibition period. This effect was independent of whether stimulated the electrode was positioned in the hippocampus or amygdala, but the hippocampal formation occupied the central position for the once and propagation of the seizure activity in all cases. When established this syndrome persisted without any attenuation for some weeks. It was concluded that this model of rapid development of kindling syndrome is useful for investigation of the nature of epilepsy and postictal seizure inhibition.",
