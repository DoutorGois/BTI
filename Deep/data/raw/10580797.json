     "AB": "Infection of rats with LCMV is known to cause a bi-phasic neurodegeneration characterized by acute T lymphocyte-mediated cerebellar damage, followed by gradual hippocampal neuron loss that occurs by an undefined mechanism. We found infiltration of CD8 + T-cells (but not CD4 + or NK cells) in the hippocampus which correlated with the acute phase, but not the chronic hippocampal degenerative phase. While immunosuppression of T lymphocytes protected the cerebellum and revealed the infection of corticohippocampal glia, the degeneration in the hippocampus was unabated. These data suggest that T lymphocytes control glial infection and mediate degeneration in the cerebellum but not the hippocampus.",
