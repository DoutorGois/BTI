     "AB": "Cerebral blood flow and glucose utilization were measured in rat neocortex, hippocampus and striatum following methylenedioxymethamphetamine injection (5 mg/kg, i.v.), using the tracers [14C]iodoantipyrine and [14C]2-deoxyglucose, respectively. In control rats, blood flow was coupled to glucose metabolism, but in methylenedioxymethamphetamine-treated rats, marked hyperperfusion was measured in frontal and parietal cortex with no change in glucose use. This suggests that methylenedioxymethamphetamine has the potential to disrupt cerebrovascular control.",
