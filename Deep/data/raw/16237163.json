     "AB": "Long-lasting synaptic plasticity and memory requires mRNA translation, yet little is known as to how this process is regulated. To explore the role that the translation repressor 4E-BP2 plays in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and learning and memory, we examined 4E-BP2 knock-out mice. Interestingly, genetic elimination of 4E-BP2 converted early-phase LTP to late-phase LTP (L-LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway, likely as a result of increased eIF4F complex formation and translation initiation. A critical limit for activity-induced translation was revealed in the 4E-BP2 knock-out mice because L-LTP elicited by traditional stimulation paradigms was obstructed. Moreover, the 4E-BP2 knock-out mice also exhibited impaired spatial learning and memory and conditioned fear-associative memory deficits. These results suggest a crucial role for proper regulation of the eIF4F complex by 4E-BP2 during LTP and learning and memory in the mouse hippocampus.",
