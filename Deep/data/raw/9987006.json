     "AB": "To clarify the effects of adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2 and A3) on hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) release and 5-HT reuptake activity, hippocampal extracellular 5-HT levels were determined in vivo by microdialysis in freely moving rats. Selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine and DU24565 increased extracellular 5-HT levels. Adenosine and A1 receptor agonist, 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyl-adenosine (CCPA), decreased extracellular 5-HT levels, whereas non-selective antagonist, caffeine, and A1 antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (CPT) increased them. When 5-HT reuptake activity was inhibited by DU24565 and fluoxetine, the effects of CPT and CCPA on 5-HT level were enhanced. A2A receptor agonist, CGS21680, A2 receptor agonist, PD125944, A2 receptor antagonist, 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (DMPX), and A3 receptor agonist, N6-2-(4-aminophenyl)ethyladenosine (APNEA) did not affect 5-HT levels; however, when A1 receptor was blocked by CPT, 5-HT levels were increased by adenosine, CGS21680 and PD125944, and decreased by DMPX and APNEA. Under conditions of A1 receptor blockade, pretreatment with DU24565 or fluoxetine, enhanced the stimulatory effects of CGS21680 and PD125944 as well as inhibitory effects of DMPX on 5-HT level, whereas the inhibitory effect of APNEA was abolished. These results indicate that the stimulatory effects of A2 receptor and inhibitory effects of A3 receptor on hippocampal extracellular 5-HT levels are masked or abolished by the inhibitory effects of A1 receptor. In addition, hippocampal serotonergic transmission might be modulated by hippocampal presynaptic adenosine receptor subtypes, and hippocampal 5-HT reuptake activity might be modulated by hippocampal A3 receptor.",
