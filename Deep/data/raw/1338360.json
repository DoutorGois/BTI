     "AB": "Antidepressants exert mixed actions on serotonergic and catecholaminergic systems. However, it is unknown whether a catecholaminergic blockade impinge on the actions of a tricyclic with serotonergic agonist properties (clomipramine) in limbic structures. The aim of the present study is to explore the effects of a catecholaminergic lesion in the basolateral amygdala on the firing rate of lateral septal, and hippocampal neurons in rats treated with clomipramine. An amygdaline lesion with 6-OHDA resembled the actions of clomipramine on the firing rate in lateral septal neurons, i.e. an increased rate of firing. However, the lesion blocked further effects of clomipramine on septal firing. Clomipramine decreased the firing rate in hippocampal neurons; however, neither the 6-OHDA lesion nor the added treatment with clomipramine modified the firing rate. It is concluded that an intact catecholaminergic amygdaloid input to lateral septal nuclei is necessary for clomipramine actions; however, the initial action of the tricyclic may involve a catecholaminergic blockade.",
