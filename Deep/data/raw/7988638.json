     "AB": "The effects of acute and repeated treatment with the 5-HT1A receptor ligand gepirone on hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission were investigated. Recordings of the electrically evoked field population excitatory postsynaptic potentials (e.p.s.p.s) were made in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus of alert male Wistar rats. Acute injection of gepirone reduced the e.p.s.p. amplitude in a transient dose-dependent (0.5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) manner. This effect was blocked by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist MDL 73005EF (8-[2-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-2-yl methylaminoethys]-8- azaspiro[4,5]decane-7,9-dione methyl sulphonate, 2 mg/kg, i.p.). Gepirone (1 mg/kg per day, i.p.) administered for 7 days produced a gradual reduction in the daily pre-injection baseline e.p.s.p. amplitude coupled with a concomitant reduction of the acute response to the drug. The chronic baseline reduction was transiently reversed by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist spiroxatrine and complete recovery to pretreatment levels was observed 48 h after the last gepirone dose. The data indicate that with repeated administration, a prolongation and enhancement of the 5-HT1A receptor-mediated reduction in the e.p.s.p. by gepirone occurs. This delayed effect may contribute to the slow onset of therapeutic action of gepirone.",
