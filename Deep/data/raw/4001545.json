     "AB": "The enzymatic activities of two \"key\" enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, pyruvate kinase and lactic dehydrogenase, were studied in seven areas of the brain in male adult rats in states of pharmacologically induced hyper and hypothyroidism. The brain areas were: anterior cortex, adenohypophysis, hypothalamus, amygdaline nucleus, septum, hippocampus and cerebellum. In T3 treated animals, pyruvate kinase activity showed significant increase in all the areas studied while lactic dehydrogenase activity decreased. In propyl-thiouracil treated animals these enzyme activities showed no significant variations from those in animals of the control group.",
