     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: Orexin has been shown to be involved in a number of physiological and behavioral processes including, feeding and metabolism, reward, nociception, and anxiety. Furthermore, orexin can cause increased neuronal excitability that gives rise to epileptic activity. The distribution of orexin receptor expression in the hippocampus, suggests a possible importance of orexin in the control of seizures in the temporal lobe epilepsy. Therefore, in this study, the effect of hippocampal orexin 1 and 2 receptors on seizure and glutamate and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) contents was explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) antagonist (SB) and OX2R antagonist (TCS) were administrated bilaterally through separate cannulae into both hippocampi. Behavioral convulsions were provoked by intravenous pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) application model. The amount of total hippocampal glutamate and GABA contents was then measured by a biochemical method. RESULTS: SB (50 nmol) infusion reduced seizure stage, duration and decreased glutamate while GABA content was increased. SB (200 nmol) also reduced seizure stage, duration and glutamate content, without change of GABA content. TCS (20 nmol) infusion reduced seizure stage and duration without concomitant change in glutamate and GABA contents. Further, TCS (40 nmol) did neither affect the seizure nor the GABA, while decreased glutamate content. Co-administration of SB (50 nmol) with TCS (40 nmol) and also SB (200 nmol) with TCS (40 nmol) reduced seizure stage, duration and glutamate, but increased GABA content. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that OX1R and OX2R antagonists reduce convulsive intensity, partially through alterations of hippocampal glutamate and GABA contents.",
