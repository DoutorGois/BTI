     "AB": "The effects of adenosine, carbachol, and baclofen on synaptic transmission between neurons in cultured rat hippocampal explants were studied using the tight-seal whole cell clamp technique. In the culture, stimulations of neurites cause postsynaptic currents (PSCs) in nearby neurons under voltage-clamp condition. In the presence of 20 microM bicuculline, most PSCs were considered as glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), because they were blocked by glutamate antagonist, kynurenate at 1 mM. In the presence of 1 mM kynurenate, PSCs seemed to be inhibitory postsynaptic currents mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), because they were blocked by GABA antagonist, bicuculline at 20 microM. Adenosine at 100 microM and carbachol at 10 microM suppressed these EPSCs to about 35% of control. However, adenosine and carbachol at the same concentration did not suppress the IPSCs. Baclofen at 10 microM suppressed both EPSCs and IPSCs significantly (EPSCs: to about 40% of control, IPSCs: to about 30% of control). In contrast, membrane currents elicited by ionophoretically applied glutamate and GABA were not suppressed by 100 microM adenosine, 10 microM carbachol, and 10 microM baclofen. From these results, it is suggested that the pharmacological sensitivities of transmitter release from presynaptic terminals are different between glutamatergic excitatory synapses and GABAergic inhibitory synapses in hippocampal cultures.",
