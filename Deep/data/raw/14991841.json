     "AB": "The RNA-binding protein Sam68 has been implicated in the signal-dependent processing of pre-mRNA and in the utilization of intron-containing retroviral mRNAs. Sam68 is predominantly nuclear but exhibits remarkable binding affinity for signalling proteins located at the membrane. We have investigated the subcellular distribution of Sam68 in adult rat cortex and hippocampus. Subcellular fractionation showed that the protein was most abundant in nuclei but also was present at a significant level in the cytosol and membrane fractions, including light and synaptic membranes derived from crude synaptosomes. Sam68 extracted from the synaptosomal fraction cosedimented with polysomes on sucrose gradients. In agreement with these findings, immunohistochemical staining indicated that Sam68 was concentrated in neuronal nuclei but was also detectable in the soma and dendrites. Sam68 immunoreactivity examined at the ultrastructural level was found to associate with dendritic microtubules, endoplasmic reticulum, and free polyribosomes, sometimes close to synapses. A combination of immunoprecipitation and RT-PCR directly confirmed that Sam68 was bound to polyadenylated mRNA in cortical lysates. The alphaCaMKII mRNA was identified as one of the coprecipitated transcripts; in contrast, the gephyrin and NR1-1 mRNAs were not coprecipitated, indicating a certain degree of sequence specificity in the association. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, recombinant GST-Sam68 as well as brain-derived Sam68 bound with high affinity to the alphaCaMKII 3' untranslated region. These results suggest that Sam68 may accompany and, conceivably, regulate mature mRNAs during nuclear export, somatodendritic transport, and translation.",
