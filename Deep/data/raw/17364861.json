     "AB": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) induced disparate alterations on enzymatic activities of the defensive mechanism and/or modifications of the reactive oxygen species levels in specific neonate rat brain regions. The midbrain, striatum, and prefrontal cortex were the areas where the alterations were more remarkable and with similar tendency. The hippocampus did not suffer many alterations, and the hypothalamus was the area where no changes were observed. The current results suggest that the developing brain areas have different susceptibilities to the adverse effect of the herbicide, especially those areas related to the dopaminergic system, and that oxidative stress is one 2,4-D mechanism of toxicity.",
