     "AB": "The influence of perspective anti-migraine drug tropoxin on the content of monoamines and related metabolites in Wistar rat brain structures, including frontal cortex (FC), hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens (NA), striatum, and hippocampus, has been studied using HPLC/ED technique. Tropoxin (10 mg/kg) induced a 30% decrease (p < 0.05) in dopamine (DA) level in FC as well as norepinephrine content in NA, while the concentrations of DA metabolites DOPAC and HVA in the hypothalamus were found to increase. The injection of tropoxin in a dose of 20 mg/kg led to an increase in HVA level in hypothalamus as well as seroto- nin metabolite 5-HIAA content in NA. The obtained data provide evidence that tropoxin predominantly influenced the activity of dopaminergic system while the drug effects on the parameters of serotoninergic link seem to be rather mild.",
