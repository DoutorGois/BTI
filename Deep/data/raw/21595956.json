     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL)-6 is produced in the brain during peripheral infection and plays an important but poorly understood role in sickness behavior. Therefore, this study investigated the capacity of soluble gp130 (sgp130), a natural inhibitor of the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway to regulate IL-6 production in microglia and neurons in vitro and its effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sickness behavior in vivo. METHODS: A murine microglia (BV.2) and neuronal cell line (Neuro.2A) were used to study the effects of stimulating and inhibiting the IL-6 signaling pathway in vitro. In vivo, adult (3-6 mo) BALB/c mice received an intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of sgp130 followed by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of LPS, and sickness behavior and markers of neuroinflammation were measured. RESULTS: Soluble gp130 attenuated IL-6- and LPS-stimulated IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) activation along with IL-6 protein release in both microglial (BV.2) and neuronal (Neuro.2A) cell types in vitro. Moreover, in vivo experiments showed that sgp130 facilitated recovery from LPS-induced sickness, and this sgp130-associated recovery was paralleled by reduced IL-6 receptor signaling, mRNA, and protein levels of IL-6 in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results show that sgp130 may exert an anti-inflammatory effect on microglia and neurons by inhibiting IL-6 binding. These data indicate that sgp130 inhibits the LPS-induced IL-6 trans-signal and show IL-6 and its receptor are involved in maintaining sickness behavior.",
