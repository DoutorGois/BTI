     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Qingkailing (QKL) on glutamate induced damage of brain, in order to seek for effective drugs for antagonizing neurotoxicity of glutamate. METHODS: Number and morphology metrology of neuron in cerebral cortex and hippocampus were detected by using MIAS-300 image analysing instrument, electron microscope and immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: QKL could allevate the glutamate induced accumulation of water and sodium in the brain tissue, relief the damage of cerebral cells and reduce the percentage of c-fos positive cell in brain. CONCLUSION: QKL could protect brain damage induced by glutamate, which might be related to inhibition of QKL on glutamate caused enhancement of c-fos gene expression.",
