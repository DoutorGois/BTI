     "AB": "The consequences of central nervous system injury are far-reaching and debilitating and, while an endogenous repair response to neural injury has been observed in recent years, the mechanisms behind this response remain unclear. Neural progenitor/stem cell (NPSC) migration to the site of injury from the neural stem cell niches (e.g. subventricular zone and hippocampus) has been observed to be vasophilic in nature. While the chemotactic stimuli directing NPSC homing to injury is not well established, it is thought to be due in part to an increasing gradient of chemotactic cytokines, such as stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha). Based on these recent findings, we hypothesize that critical crosstalk between SDF-1alpha and the extracellular matrix (ECM) drives injury-induced NPSC behavior. In this study, we investigated the effect of SDF-1alpha and ECM substrates (Matrigel, laminin, and vitronectin) on the migration, differentiation, and proliferation of NPSCs in vitro using standard assays. The results demonstrated that SDF-1alpha and laminin-based ECM (Matrigel and laminin) significantly and synergistically enhanced NPSC migration and acute neuronal differentiation. These effects were significantly attenuated with the addition of AMD3100 (an antagonist against the SDF-1alpha receptor, CXCR4). SDF-1alpha alone significantly increased NPSC proliferation regardless of ECM substrate, however no synergy was observed between SDF-1alpha and the ECM. These results serve to elucidate the relationship between adhesive and soluble signaling factors of interest and their effect on NPSC behavior following neural injury. Furthermore, these results better inform the next generation of biomaterials aimed at stimulating endogenous neural regeneration for neural injury and neurodegenerative diseases.",
