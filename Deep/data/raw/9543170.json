     "AB": "A decrease in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis sensitivity to glucocorticoid feedback suppression seems to occur with aging. To investigate possible abnormalities in the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on ACTH secretion in the elderly, we evaluated the endogenous ACTH response to hydrocortisone (25 mg as an i.v. bolus) in 15 healthy aged (65-88 yr) and 15 healthy young (18-26 yr) men. Blood samples for ACTH and cortisol determinations were collected at -15, 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min. Hydrocortisone injection produced a rapid increase in plasma cortisol levels within the first 2 min in both groups. In old men, in concomitance with the cortisol increase, ACTH levels showed only a slight and nonsignificant decrease within the first 15 min, followed by a pronounced and significant decline thereafter. In young subjects, in concomitance with the plasma cortisol increase, a marked decrease in ACTH levels was observed within the first 15 min, followed by a less pronounced decline thereafter. The response curve of ACTH inhibition could be arbitrarily divided in two parts. The first part (from 0-60 min) showed a significant difference between old and young men, whereas the remaining part of the curve (from 60-180 min) showed no differences between the two groups. The slower response in glucocorticoid feedback inhibition of ACTH in old men supports the concept of some alteration in the central regulation by steroids in aging. Age-related vascular factors affecting cortisol penetration through the blood-brain barrier more than hippocampus-hypothalamus receptor abnormalities could be involved in the fast component of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis feedback regulation.",
