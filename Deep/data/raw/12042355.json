     "AB": "Presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane activities during experimental metabolic inhibition were analysed in mechanically dissociated rat hippocampal neurons using nystatin-perforated and conventional whole-cell patch clamp recordings. NaCN, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP synthesis, induced an outward current across the postsynaptic soma membrane. This current was blocked by tolbutamide, a sulfonylurea, which blocks ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. The presynaptic effect of metabolic inhibitors such as NaCN, NaN3, or glucose-free solution was to increase the frequency of GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). Tolbutamide had no effect on this increase in mIPSC frequency induced by metabolic inhibition. Diazoxide, a KATP channel opener, evoked a similar somatic outward current in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, diazoxide decreased the frequency of mIPSCs in a dose-dependent fashion. Both these pre- and postsynaptic effects of diazoxide were reversed by tolbutamide, suggesting the existence of KATP channels on both pre- and postsynaptic membranes. These results confirm the presence of KATP channels on both the pre- and postsynaptic membranes but indicate that the channels have significantly different sensitivities to metabolic inhibition.",
