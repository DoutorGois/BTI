     "AB": "Memories that last a lifetime are thought to be stored, at least in part, as persistent enhancement of the strength of particular synapses. The synaptic mechanism of these persistent changes, late long-term potentiation (L-LTP), depends on the state and number of specific synaptic proteins. Synaptic proteins, however, have limited dwell times due to molecular turnover and diffusion, leading to a fundamental question: how can this transient molecular machinery store memories lasting a lifetime? Because the persistent changes in efficacy are synapse-specific, the underlying molecular mechanisms must to a degree reside locally in synapses. Extensive experimental evidence points to atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoforms as key components involved in memory maintenance. Furthermore, it is evident that establishing long-term memory requires new protein synthesis. However, a comprehensive model has not been developed describing how these components work to preserve synaptic efficacies over time. We propose a molecular model that can account for key empirical properties of L-LTP, including its protein synthesis dependence, dependence on aPKCs, and synapse-specificity. Simulations and empirical data suggest that either of the two aPKC subtypes in hippocampal neurons, PKMzeta and PKCiota/lambda, can maintain L-LTP, making the system more robust. Given genetic compensation at the level of synthesis of these PKC subtypes as in knockout mice, this system is able to maintain L-LTP and memory when one of the pathways is eliminated.",
