     "AB": "Optical fluorescence imaging is increasingly being used to monitor biological functions of specific targets (1-3). However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when fluorophores that absorb visible light (350-700 nm) are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (~700-1,000 nm) detection avoids the natural background fluorescence interference of biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues in small animals. NIR fluorophores have a wider dynamic range and minimal background fluorescence as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. NIR fluorophores also have high sensitivity, attributable to low background fluorescence, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence imaging is a non-invasive complement to radionuclide imaging in small animals. Opioids such as morphine are analgesics that are commonly used in clinical practice. Three opioid receptors (mu, micro; delta, delta; and kappa, kappa) that mediate opioid effects have been identified by molecular cloning: delta (enkephalin-preferring), kappa (dynorphin-preferring), and micro (morphine- and ss-endorphin-preferring) (4). Each type of opioid receptor consists of subtypes of receptors as suggested by pharmacological studies (5, 6). These receptors exhibit apparent specificity to both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and their presence is ubiquitous in these systems. The opioid receptors (G-protein-coupled, resulting in decreased adenylyl cyclase activity) play an important role in the regulation of analgesia, shock, appetite, thermoregulation, and cardiovascular, mental, and endocrine function (5-8). Although micro opioid receptors are the major receptors to mediate the analgesic effects of opioids, delta and kappa receptors are also important in antinociception. Opioids have been found to protect cells from ischemic injury in the heart and brain via the delta receptors. On the other hand, kappa antagonists prevent neurodegeneration. The micro opioid receptors are localized predominately in the hypothalamus and thalamus, and the delta opioid receptors are localized predominately in the striatum, limbic system, and cerebral cortex (9, 10). The kappa opioid receptors (kappa1 and kappa2) are the most abundant brain opioid receptors and are widely distributed in deeper layers of the neocortex (particularly temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices), striatum, amygdala, and thalamus, with lower levels in the hippocampus, occipital cortex, and cerebellum (11-13). The kappa opioid receptors have been implicated in several clinical brain disorders, including drug abuse (14), epilepsy (15), Tourette's syndrome (16), and Alzheimer's disease (17). Tyr-d-Thr-Gly-Phe-Leu-Ser-(O-beta-d-Glucose)CONH2 (g7) is a glycosylated derivative of the Leu-enkephalin analog Tyr-d-Thr-Gly-Phe-Leu-Ser-CONH2 (18). The g7 peptide exhibits an agonistic activity to rat and human micro/delta opioid receptors and an ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Tosi et al.
