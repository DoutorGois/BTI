     "AB": "The senescence-accelerated P8 mouse (SAMP8) is a well-characterized model for the age-related decline in acquisition and retention. Calcium-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAM K) have been implicated in these processes in the hippocampus. Therefore, the expression of hippocampal PKC and CAM K was determined in SAMP8 mice aged 4, 8, and 12 months. As measured by Western blotting, total hippocampal PKC-gamma protein declined linearly with age. In addition, the distribution of the PKC-gamma also changed with age. The amount of PKC in the particulate fraction declined linearly with age relative to the soluble PKC. The decline in total PKC and particulate PKC correlated with the previously reported decline in retention but not with the decline in acquisition. Western blotting revealed no consistent change in CAM KII protein levels. In addition to protein levels, Ca-dependent protein kinase activity may also be affected by changes in intracellular Ca concentration. Therefore, the levels of calbindin and the plasma membrane Ca pump, two proteins involved in maintaining low levels of intracellular Ca, were measured in the hippocampus. Calbindin protein declined progressively with age, but there was no significant change in total plasma membrane Ca pump expression. These studies demonstrate a decrease in the amount and distribution of hippocampal PKC-gamma in the SAMP8 between 4 and 12 months that is associated with decreased retention.",
