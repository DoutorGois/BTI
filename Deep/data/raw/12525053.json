     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To provide pharmacological evidence for the protective effects of Tianmacuzhi Granules (TMC) in mouse brain in a ischemia--reperfusion model. METHOD: Receptor binding test of NMDA receptor and M receptor in brain, GPx activity determination in brain and liver effected by different dose of TMC were performed. RESULT: TMC could reduce the NMDA receptor activity, increase the M receptor activity and GPx activity of cerebral cortex and hippocampus tissues significantly. CONCLUSION: TMC might antagonize ischemia-reperfusion injury of brain by reducing the glutamate neurotoxicity and increasing the function of cholinergic nerve and effects of anti-peroxidization in brain.",
