Unlike previously reported patients who had undergone anterior fornix sections and whose memories were not severely disturbed, this patient's posteriorly located lesion may have cut off hippocampal input into the mamillary bodies and the dorsomesial nucleus, thereby producing a severe amnestic state.",
