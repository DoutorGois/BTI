     "AB": "The posttranslational modification of calmodulin has been studied in six brain regions and the anterior pituitary. Carboxylmethylation, calmodulin converting enzyme, and calmodulin (lysine) N-methyltransferase activities were determined. Incubation of calmodulin with cytosolic extracts of these tissues in the presence of the methyl donor [methyl-3H]-S-adenosyl-L-methionine and identification of labeled proteins by gel electrophoresis and fluorography indicated that calmodulin is a substrate for protein carboxylmethyltransferase in all tissues tested. In hippocampus, caudate nucleus, cerebral cortex, and anterior pituitary, but not in cerebellum, superior colliculus, brainstem, or diencephalon, a second methylated protein was found when calmodulin was added to incubation mixtures. This protein was shown to be identical to the previously described product of calmodulin converting enzyme. Converted calmodulin was isolated by fast protein liquid chromatography and shown to be des(Lys)calmodulin, lacking the carboxy terminal lysine residue of calmodulin. The anterior pituitary had by far the highest levels of calmodulin converting enzyme; this enzyme, in turn, was identified as a cobalt-stimulated carboxylpeptidase B. In contrast to the regional differences in these parameters, the levels of calmodulin (lysine) N-methyltransferase did not differ greatly among brain regions, although regional differences in the activity of this enzyme were statistically significant.",
