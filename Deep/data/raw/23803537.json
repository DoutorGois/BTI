     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of enriched environment and impoverished environment on the learning and memory ability of manganese-exposed mice and the mechanism. METHODS: Forty female Kunming mice were randomly and equally divided into 4 group: control group (CG), standard environment and manganese exposure group (SEG), enriched environment and manganese exposure group (EEG), and impoverished environment and manganese exposure group (IEG). The mouse model of manganese poisoning was established by intraperitoneal injection of manganese chloride. The learning and memory ability was tested by Morris water maze. The expression of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in area CA1 of the hippocampus was measured by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In place navigation test, the SEG had a significantly longer escape latency than the CG (P < 0.05), and the EEG had a significantly shorter escape latency than the SEG (P < 0.05); there was no significant difference in escape latency between IEG and SEG (P > 0.05). In spatial probe test, the EEG had a significantly greater number of platform crossings than the SEG (P < 0.05), and the IEG had a significantly smaller number of platform crossings than the SEG (P < 0.05). The expression of CREB in area CA1 of the hippocampus was significantly lower in IEG and SEG than in CG (P < 0.05), and it was significantly higher in EEG than in SEG (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In the enriched environment, the learning and memory ability of manganese-exposed mice can be improved, which may be due to the increased expression of CREB in the hippocampus.",
