     "AB": "Mice bearing mutations of copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase recapitulate spinal cord motor neuron degeneration and disease progression occurring in human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We have investigated the relationship between disease progression and altered gene expression by comparing the transcriptional profiles in lumbar spinal cord, fronto-parietal cortex and hippocampus of mutant G93A-SOD1, wild-type SOD1 transgenic and non-transgenic mice. Gene expression was evaluated at 55 and 110 days of age, representing pre-symptomatic and advanced disease stages of G93A mice, respectively. Whereas no significant variations were detectable in cortical and hippocampal areas, several mutation-related changes were detected in the lumbar spinal cord at the symptomatic stage, consistent with a condition of neuronal distress. Also, at both ages, we found a number of transgene-related changes, i.e. variations occurring in both transgenic groups independently of the G93A mutation, with wild-type SOD1- and G93A-SOD1-overexpressing mice displaying global transcriptional similarity at 110 days of age. Some of the changes in common between the two transgenic groups involve genes implicated in oxidative stress, inflammation, spinocerebellar degeneration and other neurodegenerative disorders. The finding that gene expressional alterations potentially associated to cellular distress are shared by wild-type and mutant human SOD1-overexpressing mice raises the possibility that mutated (in familial ALS) or otherwise dysregulated (in sporadic ALS) SOD1 expression is a common pathogenetic substrate of the disease.",
