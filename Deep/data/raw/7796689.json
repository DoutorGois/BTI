     "AB": "In vitro studies showed deltamethrin (1 x 10(-7)-1 x 10(-4) mol/L) could inhibit 3H-DL-glutamate uptake in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus synaptosome by 7.2%-21.5% and 10.4%-25.1%, respectively, with a dose-response pattern. But only in high-dose permethrin (1 x 10(-4) mol/L) can significantly reduce 3H-DL-glutamate uptake in rat hippocampus synaptosome. In addition, deltamethrin also can reduce 3H-DL-glutamate uptake in cerebellum and striatum of rats by 16.5% and 31.8%, respectively. It is suggested that both deltamethrin and permethrin, especially the former, can disturb the function of brain tissue in high-affinity-glutamate uptake with their alpha-cyano-group. So pyrethroids could play an important role in cerebral stimulation in mammals.",
