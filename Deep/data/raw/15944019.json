     "AB": "17Beta-estradiol induced an increase in tissue concentrations of galanin in the hippocampal formation of ovariectomized rats. This increase was dose- and time dependent, and occurred already 60 min after steroid administration and was not blocked by Tamoxifen). There was also an increase in galanin in the pro-estrous phase in regularly cycling rats. The estrogen-induced rapid increase may at least in part be due to decreased release of galanin as demonstrated by in vivo microdialysis studies. Thus, sex steroid hormones may influence signalling molecules in brain areas of importance for cognitive functions.",
