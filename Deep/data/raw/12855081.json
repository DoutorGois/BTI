     "AB": "We are developing a VR system of integrated software and hardware for scientific research and clinical application. The system is sufficiently flexible and broad-based in appeal that neurobehavioral researchers from a variety of disciplines might be interested in using it for basic research and clinical studies. The system runs on a standard Windows-based personal computer with a high-performance graphics card. Options allow a head-mounted display, dataglove, simultaneous physiological monitoring or use within neuroimaging machines such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. Currently, the software consists of a virtual world of nearly a dozen interconnected environments that the subject can freely navigate. Additional environments can be built and easily added to the application. A startup interface provides menus for selecting characters and objects that a researcher might want to put at specific locations within the simulation. Interactivity is provided for many typical objects such as doors, chairs and money. There are more than 50 characters in the world, most of them animated or interactive. All movements and actions of the subject within the world are tracked and recorded to an Excel spreadsheet for data analysis. Overlay maps are available as navigational aids. Concurrent physiological data can be acquired on up to 16 channels. The system provides synchronization of the VR simulation with physiological recordings and functional MR images. A spatial navigation memory task was performed with the integrated VR/fMRI system, and some pilot data is presented that shows robust activation in multiple cortical areas appropriate to the task.",
