     "AB": "A variety of genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers promote downstream errors in Tau action, in turn inducing neuronal dysfunction and cell death in Alzheimer and related dementias. To better understand molecular mechanisms involved in Abeta-mediated neuronal cell death, we have treated primary rat hippocampal cultures with Abeta oligomers and examined the resulting cellular changes occurring before and during the induction of cell death with a focus on altered Tau biochemistry. The most rapid neuronal responses upon Abeta administration are activation of caspase 3/7 and calpain proteases. Abeta also appears to reduce Akt and Erk1/2 kinase activities while increasing GSK3beta and Cdk5 activities. Shortly thereafter, substantial Tau degradation begins, generating relatively stable Tau fragments. Only a very small fraction of full-length Tau remains intact after 4 h of Abeta treatment. In conflict with expectations based on suggested increases of GSK3beta and Cdk5 activities, Abeta does not cause any major increases in phosphorylation of full-length Tau as assayed by immunoblotting one-dimensional gels with 11 independent site- and phospho-specific anti-Tau antibodies as well as by immunoblotting two-dimensional gels probed with a pan-Tau antibody. There are, however, subtle and transient increases in Tau phosphorylation at 3-4 specific sites before its degradation. Taken together, these data are consistent with the notion that Abeta-mediated neuronal cell death involves the loss of full-length Tau and/or the generation of toxic fragments but does not involve or require hyperphosphorylation of full-length Tau.",
