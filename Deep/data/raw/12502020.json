     "AB": "The influence of 20 min global cerebral ischemia on the free arachidonic acid (FAA) level and Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the rat hippocampus at different time points after ischemia was examined. In addition, the effect of MK-801 on mentioned parameters was studied. Animals were exposed to 20 min global cerebral ischemia and were sacrificed immediately, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h after ischemic procedure. The level of the FAA and the Na+,K+-ATPase activity was measured during all reperfusion periods examined. Various doses of MK-801 (0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mg/kg) had been injected 30 min before ischemic procedure started. It was found that 20 min global cerebral ischemia induces a statistically significant increase of the FAA level immediately after ischemia and during the first 0.5 h of reperfusion. After a transient decrease, the level of FAA level increased again after 24 and 168 h of recirculation. Treatment with 3.0 mg/kg of MK-801 significantly prevented the FAA accumulation immediately and 0.5 h after ischemic insult while application of 5.0 mg/kg of MK-801 exerted a protective effect during the first 24 h. Global cerebral ischemia induces the significant decline in the Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the hippocampus starting from 1 to 168 h of reperfusion. Maximal inhibition was obtained 24 h after the ischemic damage. Application of 3.0 mg/kg of MK-801 exerted statistically significant protection during the first 24 h while the treatment with 5.0 mg/kg of MK-801 prevented fall in enzymatic activity during all reperfusion periods examined. Our results suggest that, in spite of different and complex pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the increase of FAA level and the decrease of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity, blockade of NMDA receptor subtype provides a very important strategy for the treatment of the postischemic excitotoxicity.",
