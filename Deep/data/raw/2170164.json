     "AB": "Nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophic factor acting on cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, has been proposed as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Experimental support for its pharmacological use is derived from short-term studies showing that intraventricular administration of NGF during 2-4 weeks protects cholinergic cell bodies from lesion-induced degeneration, stimulates synthesis of choline acetyltransferase, and improves various behavioral impairments. To investigate the consequences of long-term NGF administration, we tested whether cholinergic cell bodies are protected from lesion-induced degeneration and whether cholinergic axons are stimulated to regrow into the denervated hippocampus following fimbrial transections. We found that intraventricular injections of NGF twice a week for 5 months to adult rats resulted in extended protection of cholinergic cell bodies from lesion-induced degeneration and did not produce obvious detrimental effects on the animals. NGF treatment mildly stimulated growth of cholinergic neurites within the 2-mm area directly adjacent to the fimbrial lesion but it failed to induce significant homotypic growth of cholinergic neurites into the deafferented hippocampus.",
