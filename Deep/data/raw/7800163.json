     "AB": "The effects of repeated treatment with electroconvulsive shock (ECS) and imipramine on [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding to serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptors in the rat brain were studied by quantitative autoradiographic analysis. A large number of binding sites for [3H]8-OH-DPAT were observed in the hippocampus, especially the dentate gyrus, CA1+CA2 field, dorsal raphe nucleus and septum. Repeated treatment with ECS, but not repeated imipramine treatment, significantly increased [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding sites in the dentate gyrus. These results suggest that the increase in [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding sites in the dentate gyrus may be important in ECS therapy for depressive illness.",
