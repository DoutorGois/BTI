     "AB": "We quantified by microdensitometry the immunoreactivity (IR) to monoclonal antibodies (SP6, SP12, SP15 and SP18) against various synaptic proteins in the molecular layers of the dentate gyrus, CA4, CA3, CA1, subiculum and entorhinal cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body variant of AD (LBV) and diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD). A significant decrease in SP6 IR was observed in almost all regions in AD (28.4-70.1%, mean 41.3%), LBV (19.0-42.5%, mean 26.8%) and DLBD (19.9-31.7%, mean 27.1%) compared to controls. In addition, SP6 IR in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus was strongly correlated with tangle count in the entorhinal cortex (r = -0.70, P < 0.002), suggesting loss of perforant pathway projection. Although the decrease in SP12 and SP15 IR was less pronounced, the mean values were decreased in dementia. Furthermore, SP12 and SP15 labeled a large number of neuritic plaques, and SP15 occasionally stained cortical LBs. The present findings indicate (i) that in the hippocampal-entorhinal formation, the decrease of synapse protein IR in AD is more severe than that in LBV and DLBD, (ii) that synaptic markers detect a subset of dystrophic neurites in the plaques and (iii) that synapse proteins are involved in the formation of cortical LBs.",
