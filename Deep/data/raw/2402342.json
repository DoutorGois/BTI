     "AB": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) messenger RNA was measured by hybridization of mRNA from the cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and striatum of rat brains. Adrenalectomized rats showed lowered level of NPY message in the striatum. A similar decline was found in the hypothalamus, while the cortex and hippocampus were unchanged. Levels of NPY message per unit total RNA were about the same for hypothalamus, cortex and striatum and about 50% less for hippocampus. Adrenalectomized rats that received replacement corticosterone had levels of NPY message that had returned to the levels found in rats receiving sham operation. Response elements consistent with our findings are reported in the NPY genomic sequence.",
