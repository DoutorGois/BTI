     "AB": "Monosynaptic perforant path responses evoked by subicular stimulation were recorded from CA3 pyramidal cells of rat hippocampal slices. These monosynaptic responses were isolated by using low intensities of stimulation and by placing a cut through the mossy fibers. Perforant path-evoked responses consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory components. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were mediated by both alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acidreceptors (AMPAR) and N-methyl--aspartate receptors (NMDAR). Inhibitory postsynaptic currents consisted of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA-) and -B (GABAB)-receptor-mediated components. At membrane potentials more positive than -60 mV and at physiological [Ca2+]/[Mg2+] ratios, >30% of perforant path evoked EPSC was mediated by NMDARs. This value varied as a function of the membrane voltage and external [Mg2+]. Two types of responses were observed after low-intensity stimulation of the perforant path. The first type of response showed paired-pulse facilitation and was reduced by 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (AP4). The second type of response showed paired-pulse depression and was reduced by baclofen. Electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics of these two types of responses are similar to the properties of lateral and medial perforant path-evoked EPSPs in the dentate gyrus.",
