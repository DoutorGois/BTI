     "AB": "The hippocampal and telencephalon volumes of the nocturnal Leach's storm-petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa, n = 15) were compared with published data for food-storing and non-storing Passerines. The hippocampus to telencephalon ratio of Leach's storm-petrels is intermediate between food-storing and non-storing birds. Leach's storm-petrels taken from nesting burrows in wooded habitat had a larger relative hippocampal volume than those taken from burrows in an open meadow. Relative olfactory volume did not differ between woods and open-nesting storm-petrels. The larger relative hippocampal volume of storm-petrels may be associated with increased spatial demands of returning to their nests at night in the darker, more navigationally complex woods. It is not known whether the larger hippocampus in storm-petrels from the woods is due to selection on different subpopulations or whether experience in a more complex environment results in greater hippocampal volume. Hippocampal volume from the brain of one diurnal Procellariiforme, the northern fulmar (Fulmaris glacialis), fell within the range of non-storing species, which supports the view that hippocampal enlargement in the storm-petrel is related to the spatial demand of returning to the nest at night.",
