     "AB": "Glutamate excitotoxicity is implicated in chronic neurological disorders and acute CNS insults and causes neuronal degeneration including axons. The molecular mechanism underlying excitotoxicity-induced axon degeneration is poorly understood. Recently, we found that components of the dynein-dynactin complex that governs microtubule-dependent retrograde transport play important roles in modulating the process of excitotoxicity-induced neurodegeneration. Here we used hippocampal cultures and searched for pathways that function in concert with the components of the dynein-dynactin complex and identified microtubule stabilization as a cooperative pathway to suppress axon degeneration. We find that overexpression of p150Glued, a major component of the dynactin complex, and microtubule stabilization cooperatively suppress axon degeneration. The protective effect of p150Glued is dependent on the C-terminal region as excitotoxicity-induced C-terminal truncated form of p150Glued was unable to interact with APP cargo and altered the localization of APP in neurites when overexpressed. C-terminal truncation of p150Glued is not rescued by microtubule stabilization suggesting that the downstream effects of p150Glued and microtubule stabilization to protect axon degeneration are mutually exclusive.",
