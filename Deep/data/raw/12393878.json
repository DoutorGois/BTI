     "AB": "The cellular adhesion molecule tenascin-R is a multifunctional extracellular matrix component expressed exclusively in the central nervous system. The expression of tenascin-R by oligodendrocytes and small interneurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum is highly regulated during development of these regions. This complex glycoprotein displays both adhesive and anti-adhesive properties that contribute to the formation and maintenance of synapses. We have determined that tenascin-R associated with Purkinje cell bodies and their dendrites in the molecular layer of the cerebellum bears N-linked oligosaccharides terminating with beta1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO(4), whereas tenascin-R in other regions of the cerebellum does not bear this modification. Expression of this unique sulfated carbohydrate structure is also temporally regulated, increasing throughout cerebellar development. The most dramatic increase in GalNAc-4-SO(4) occurs between postnatal days 14 and 21, corresponding to a period of Purkinje cell dendrite extension and synaptogenesis. The spatially and temporally regulated addition of this unique sulfated carbohydrate to tenascin-R may serve to modulate its adhesive/anti-adhesive or other biological properties in vivo.",
