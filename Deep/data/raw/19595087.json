     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of ketamine anesthesia and surgery on cognition and synaptic structure in hippocampus of senile rats. METHODS: Fifty-six rats aged 18 months were randomly divided into 3 groups: Groups C (control group), A (ketamine 40 mg/kg, i.p.) and O (ketamine anesthesia & splenectomy). Morris water maze test was used to observe cognition at Days 1, 3 & 7 after ketamine anesthesia or operation respectively. Accordingly Groups A and O were divided into 3 subgroup, i.e. A1, A3, A7 and O1, O3, O7. The time of Morris water maze test was recorded and the synaptic structure was measured in the polymorphic layer of the rat hippocampal field CA3. RESULTS: Compared to Group C, the latency period and swimming distance significantly increased in Groups A1, O1 and O3 (P < 0.05), and the numbers passing the original platform decreased significantly in Groups O1 and O3 (P < 0.01). The latency period was significantly longer in Group O1 than that in Group A1 (P < 0.05) while the swimming distance was unchanged. Compared to Group C, the width of synaptic cleft (P < 0.01) increased, the length and area of postsynaptic densities (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) as well as synaptic curvature (P < 0.01) decreased in Groups O1 and O3. The percentage of perforated synapses also decreased in Groups O1 and O3. CONCLUSION: Surgical injury can impair cognition of senile rats and the synaptic plasticity might be involved in postoperative cognitive dysfunction.",
