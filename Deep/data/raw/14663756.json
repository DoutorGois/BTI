     "AB": "The relationship of the amygdaloid body to the hippocampal formation and lateral ventricle was studied on MRI slabs of brains of 25 volunteers. Considering the presence of the hippocampal formation and/or uncal sulcus on a cross-section three segments of the amygdaloid body were distinguished in rostro-caudal order: prehippocampal, suprahippocampal anterior (preuncal) and suprahippocampal posterior (uncal), each one presenting characteristic features. The lengths of the amygdaloid body and of its segments were calculated. In each segment the great variability of the topographical relations was found. Especially in the suprahippocampal anterior segment the relation of the lateral ventricle to both, the amygdaloid body and hippocampus shows great differences, even between the right and left side.",
