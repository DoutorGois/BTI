     "AB": "Removal of discrete parts of the forebrain of the anaesthetized lactating rabbit by suction caused repeated milk-ejection responses. These were associated with transection or removal of the subiculum, which represents the major efferent pathway from the hippocampal formation to the diencephalon. It is suggested that the hippocampus may exert a tonic, inhibitory influence over oxytocin release, that this inhibition may represent a cascade of events which originates in the brainstem and culminates in the subiculum and that removal of this inhibition may lead to release of oxytocin.",
