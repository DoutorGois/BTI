     "AB": "Chronic neuroendocrine stress usually leads to the elevation of the stress hormones and increased metabolic rate, which is frequently accompanied by oxidative damage to the CNS. In the present study we hypothesized that chronic psychosocial isolation (CPSI) of male Wistar rats, characterized by decreased serum corticosterone (CORT), unaltered catecholamines (CTs), and low blood glucose (GLU), may also promote oxidative imbalance in the CNS, by targeting antioxidant defense system. To test it, we have examined the relation between these input signals and protein expression/activity of antioxidant enzymes (AOEs): superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GLR) in the hippocampus (HIPPO) of CPSI animals. We found that CPSI did not affect SODs or CAT, but decreased activity of GPx and compromised GLR, an enzyme highly dependent on blood GLU for its substrate precursor. Further, we have tested whether the CPSI experience altered AOEs response to a novelty stress, and found that it attenuated peroxide-metabolizing enzymes, CAT and GPx, and decreased GLR activity, even though blood GLU was restored. The altered ratios of hippocampal AOEs in CPSI animals, which were worsened under the combined stress conditions, may lead to the accumulation of peroxide products and oxidative imbalance. The mechanism by which CPSI generate oxidative imbalance in the HIPPO is most likely based on poor systemic energy conditions set by this stress. Such conditions may cause functional decline of CNS structures, such as HIPPO, and are likely to promote state linked to onset of many mood disorders.",
