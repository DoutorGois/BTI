     "AB": "Previous studies have shown the successive expression of c-fos and hsp70 genes, especially in the hippocampal formation, during soman-induced seizures. In order to detect a possible link between the induction of these two genes, antisense strategies have been used. First, the ability of unilateral intrahippocampal infusion of c-fos antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit ipsilateral, seizure-related, c-FOS-like immunoreactivity, was verified. Second, induction of hsp70 mRNA was investigated using in situ hybridization. Unilateral inhibition of c-fos induction clearly reduced levels of hsp70 mRNA in the c-fos antisense-infused hippocampus relative to the non-infused contralateral side. Infusion of c-fos sense probe or vehicle did not affect bsp70 mRNA induction. This study suggests a role of c-FOS in regulating bsp70 mRNA induction.",
