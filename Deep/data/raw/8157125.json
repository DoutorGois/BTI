     "AB": "In a previous study we found that Schwann cells microtransplanted into the central nervous system rapidly dispersed from the transplantation site and became intimately associated with host grey and white matter. We have now investigated whether this migratory behavior of the donor Schwann cells is compatible with the production of stable, continuous anatomical cell tracks and whether such tracks can induce directional host axon growth. During the gradual withdrawal of a micropipette, highly purified suspensions of cultured adult peripheral nerve Schwann cells were continuously extruded to form a vertical column of cells extending for up to 4 mm through the thalamus and across the choroid fissure into the hippocampus of adult rat hosts. The donor Schwann cells were identified by immunohistochemistry for low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor, vimentin, and Rat 401. Although donor Schwann cells migrated into the host tissues, a large number remained along the axis of the injection track to form a column which was maintained for up to 3 weeks. From 4 days, increasing numbers of parallel, unbranching host RT97-positive axons entered the Schwann cell column in alignment with the long axis of the Schwann cells in the vertical tracks. The axons did not fasciculate directly with each other, but mingled diffusely with the Schwann cells. The Schwann cell tracks were able to convey host axons out of the dorsal thalamus, across the extracellular space of the choroid fissure, and into the ventral hippocampus. Thus, Schwann cells, transplanted in the form of elongated tracks, can establish bridges across boundary membranes in the brain and carry substantial numbers of nerve fibers from one area to another.",
