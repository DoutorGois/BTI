     "AB": "To study the penetration of magnesium ions from blood into brain tissue, magnesium content in serum and hippocampus of normal and of excitotoxically affected rats was estimated after a single subcutaneous injection of magnesium sulphate (600 mg kg-1). In normal rats Mg2+ levels in serum rose from 1 to 6 mM, while that of the hippocampus remained constant, provided the brains were perfused before magnesium measurement. Following unilateral intracerebroventricular injection of the excitotoxic glutamate analogues, quinolinate or kainate acid, Mg2+ levels increased up to 38% on the (unaffected) contralateral side. Since magnesium is known to prevent glutamate-mediated neurodegeneration, our findings on the accessibility of exogenously applied magnesium may justify further investigations on the utility of magnesium for a therapeutic approach to limiting excitotoxic brain injury in human patients.",
