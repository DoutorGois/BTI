     "AB": "Rats were trained on an inhibitory avoidance task to study the effects of post-training administration of tetrodotoxin (TTX, which temporarily inactivates neural activity) on memory consolidation. During training, independent groups of rats received either a mild foot shock (0.8 mA) or a stronger (1.0 mA) foot shock. TTX was administered bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus immediately after training, and memory of the task was measured 48 h later. We corroborated the typical amnesic effect of intrahippocampal infusions of TTX in those rats trained with the mild-intensity foot shock. More importantly, with the stronger foot shock, the same treatment was ineffective in producing amnesia. These results suggest that, after an enhanced learning experience, other brain regions are also activated, which may compensate for the amnesic effect of TTX infusions into the hippocampus.",
