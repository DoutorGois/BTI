     "AB": "Ceramide, a hydrolyzed product of sphingomyelin, is reported to play an important role in apoptosis. In this study, we measured the sphingomyelin and ceramide levels in the hippocampus of the gerbil after transient forebrain ischemia for 5 min (lethal) or 2 min (sublethal). The aim was to examine alterations in the sphingomyelin cycle during delayed neuronal death, which we considered could be due to apoptosis. Sphingolipids were separated on high-performance thin-layer chromatography plates and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. At 30 min and 24 h after lethal ischemia, sphingomyelin levels were decreased and ceramide levels were increased compared with control levels. No significant changes were observed after sublethal ischemia. These results suggest that the sphingomyelin cycle may have a role in neuronal death.",
