     "AB": "Rats were trained to asymptotic performance in an 8-arm radial maze. They then received chronic intraventricular infusion of either artificial CSF or the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5- phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5), at a concentration (30 mM) that has been shown previously to prevent the induction of long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in vivo. Subsequently the rats received another 9 trials in the maze in a quasi-random order, 3 uninterrupted trials, and another 6 trials each with mid-trial delays of 5, 20 or 60 min during which the animals were placed in their home cage. The mean number of errors for the AP5 rats did not differ significantly from that of the controls in the uninterrupted trials throughout the experiment, nor did it differ from that of the controls in any of the 3 delayed trials when these were first introduced. However, the control animals performed better at the longer delays when these were introduced for the second time, whilst there was no such improvement (but rather a deterioration) for the AP5 animals. The impairment of performance in the AP5 rats during the second block of delayed trials was significant, and independent of the length of the delay. These results show that NMDA receptor blockade does not impair working memory in the radial maze per se, but that it does prevent an improvement of working memory persistence with further training.",
