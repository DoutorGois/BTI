     "AB": "The D5 domain of TrkC receptors is a docking site for Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), but other domains may be relevant for function or harmonizing signals with p75(NTR) coreceptors. We report a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2B7 targeting the juxtamembrane domain of TrkC. mAb 2B7 binds to murine and human TrkC receptors and is a functional agonist that affords activation of TrkC, AKT, and MAPK. These signals result in cell survival but not in cellular differentiation. Monomeric 2B7 Fabs also affords cell survival. Binding of 2B7 mAb and 2B7 Fabs to TrkC are blocked by NT-3 in a dose-dependent manner but not by pro-NT-3. Expression of p75(NTR) coreceptors on the cell surface block the binding and function of mAb 2B7, whereas NT-3 binding and function are enhanced. mAb 2B7 defines a previously unknown neurotrophin receptor functional hot spot; that exclusively generates survival signals; that can be activated by non-dimeric ligands; and potentially unmasks a site for p75-TrkC interactions.",
