     "AB": "An outline of how the brain may compute is proposed. In the cerebral cortex memories are stored through long-term potentiation at synapses from layer 1 cortical inputs (representing contexts) on layer 2/3 pyramidal cells linked with the thalamus in a cortico-thalamic (CT) unit. The signals which are memorized are the layer 3 inputs from the thalamus or other cortical areas. Signals are memorized (and later recalled) at the gamma frequency. A conscious thought comprises the outputs of layer 5 cells in CT units in different cortical regions firing in synchrony through the contribution of oscillatory thalamic and cortical inputs. This cortical output influences sub-cortical areas to cause or participate in a movement. Cerebral cortical outputs may be stored in the cerebellum and generated later in a particular context by the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Thus the brain may either generate 'conscious' outputs using the cerebral cortex or 'automatic' outputs using the basal ganglia and cerebellum. When contexts are recognized by the basal ganglia it permits outputs stored in the cerebellum to commence and in this way the basal ganglia can control complex sequences of outputs or movements. Working memory involves the prefrontal cortex using similarly the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The hippocampus has a role in the storage and recall of cortical outputs by providing unique layer 1 contexts to all the CT loops in different cortical areas in a conscious thought. With further recall of the thought new layer 1 contexts may become associated with the CT loops enabling recall without the hippocampal input.",
