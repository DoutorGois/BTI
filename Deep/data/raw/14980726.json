     "AB": "Using hippocampal primary cell cultures at 14 days in vitro (div), we have investigated actions of 17-beta estradiol (E; 10 nM) on the phosphorylation of CREB and on signaling pathways that regulate CREB phosphorylation. After demonstrating that 14 div is optimal for these studies, we examined the time course of E induction of CREB phosphorylation (pCREB) at serine residue 133. The induction of pCREB occurs as early as 1 h following E treatment, presumably via a mechanism involving an E-stimulated signal transduction system, which is sustained for at least 24 h but inhibited by 48 h. The early activity may represent an initial signal required for events leading to phosphorylation of CREB while the sustained signal may lead to CREB-mediated gene expression for cell survival and synapse formation. Furthermore, we examined the pathways for E action preceding pCREB induction by blocking three major kinases (protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase, MAPK; and calcium-calmodulin kinase II, CaMKII) upstream of pCREB. We found that E stimulates each pathway at 24 h and that phosphorylation of CREB is dependent on both MAPK and CaMK activities, but less dependent on the Akt pathway. Because CREB has been linked to E induction of excitatory spine synapses, we used a spine marker, spinophilin, to establish E effects on spine formation. Spinophilin expression was up-regulated in response to E and this effect was blocked by an inhibitor of (CaMKII). These studies demonstrate the central role played by CaMKII pathway in the actions of E on both transcriptional regulation and structural reorganization in neurons.",
