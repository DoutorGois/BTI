     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic efficacy was examined in interneurons and giant cells in the stratum radiatum region of the hippocampal CA1 subfield. Cells were visually selected using differential interference contrast (DIC) optics and filled with biocytin while being recorded using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. Electrophysiological criteria, including spike height, width, and degree of spike adaptation shown to sustained depolarization, proved inadequate for differentiating interneurons from giant cells. We found that cells in the stratum radiatum, however, could be reliably differentiated using DIC optics or following intracellular staining. The response of the two cell types to tetanic stimulation further dissociated them. Long-term potentiation, dependent on the activation of NMDAr (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors), could reliably be induced in interneurons with stimuli administered at 200 Hz, but not 100 Hz. Giant cells, in contrast, exhibited NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in response to 100-Hz stimuli, but not the 200-Hz stimuli. LTP induction in interneurons also appeared temperature-dependent, being much more robust at 34 degrees C than at room temperature. The LTP in both cell types required postsynaptic calcium influx, and was not due to the passive propagation of LTP induction in neighboring pyramidal cells. These results suggest that different cell types within the hippocampal formation may preferentially alter synaptic connectivity in a frequency-specific manner.",
