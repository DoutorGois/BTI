     "AB": "Rats were chronically implanted with recording electrodes in the dorsomedial subiculum and stimulating electrodes in the septal area. Low-frequency septal stimulation (regular inter-pulse interval = 130 msec) was used over a period of 10 days to drive the hippocampal theta rhythm at 7.7 Hz (a regime shown previously to proactively facilitate acquisition of barpressing and retard its extinction), and high frequency (77 Hz) stimulation was used to block theta rhythm (a regime shown previously to proactively retard acquisition of barpressing and facilitate its extinction). The activity of soluble tyrosine hydroxylase from hippocampus increased in animals killed 15-33 days after the end of the period of 7.7 Hz septal stimulation but not after high-frequency stimulation. Irregular low-frequency stimulation with a mean inter-pulse of 130 msec produced the same effect on tyrosine hydroxylase activity as regular 7.7 Hz theta-driving. The possible relations between the effects of low-frequency septal stimulation on hippocampal tyrosine hydroxylase and on behavior are discussed.",
