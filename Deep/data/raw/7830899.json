     "AB": "Rab3A is a protein associated with the membrane of synaptic vesicles and is involved in the control of the targeting or docking of these vesicles at the presynaptic membrane for the release of neurotransmitters. Here, we have examined the expression and localization of this protein during the development of the rat brain. Relative to total protein, the concentration of rab3A greatly increased during brain development. Both the intracellular localization of the protein and its cerebral distribution showed an age-dependent shift. In contrast to other synaptic vesicle proteins, rab3A was heavily concentrated in cell bodies when immature neurons were migrating and during early differentiation. Later, the protein disappeared from perikarya and had a diffuse distribution in the neuropil, indicating a redistribution to nerve terminals, its exclusive localization in the adult. In the developing somatosensory cortex, rab3A delimited the modular organization of the barrels well after the afferents have arrived but just around the time that mature synaptic activity has been observed. In the hippocampus, rab3A defined a novel \"blob-like\" organization of the mossy fibre terminals and its appearance in terminal fields closely preceded the known onset of long-term potentiation. The appearance of rab3A in specific terminal fields during the period of increased physiological activity suggests that this small GTP-binding protein may be an important late element in the establishment of the mature characteristics of the presynaptic terminal.",
