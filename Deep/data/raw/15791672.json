     "AB": "Local dendritic protein synthesis provides a mechanism by which the effects of gene expression can be spatially restricted within synaptodendritic compartments of neurons. In the present study, we show that long-term potentiation (LTP), induced by two strong tetanic trains, can be produced in isolated CA1 apical dendrites and that new protein synthesis is critical for this dendritic LTP. LTP in isolated dendrites is also blocked by rapamycin, an inhibitor of growth-related protein synthesis, similar to that observed for LTP in the intact hippocampal slice. These results show that increased dendritic translation of proteins is a critical molecular mechanism for hippocampal LTP.",
