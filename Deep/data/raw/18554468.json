     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of androgen on the expression of phosphacan and NG2 proteoglycan (NG2) and neurite regeneration in neonatal rats with hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) and the potential mechanism underlying the protective effect of androgen against HIBD. METHODS: One hundred and twenty neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham-operated, HIBD and androgen treatment. HIBD was induced by the ligation of left common carotid artery and hypoxia exposure. The androgen treatment group rats were injected with testosterone propionate (25 mg/kg) immediately after HIBD. Phosphacan and NG2 expression in the cortex and the hippocampus was detected with the immunohistochemical method 24 and 72 hrs and 7 and 10 days after hypoxia-ischemia (HI). The ultrastructure and neurite regeneration of neurons in the cortex and the hippocampus were observed under a transmission electron microscope. RESULTS: The neurite regeneration was obvious in the sham-operated group, but seldom in the HIBD group. The androgen treatment group showed increased neurite regeneration compared with the HIBD group. There were fewer phosphacan and NG2 positive cells in the cortex and the hippocampus in the sham-operated group. Phosphacan and NG2 expression in the cortex and the hippocampus was observed at 24 hrs, increased at 72 hrs, and peaked at 7 days after HI in the HIBD group and remained at a higher expression 10 days after HI than in the sham-operated group. The levels of phosphacan and NG2 expression in the cortex and the hippocampus in the androgen treatment group were significantly reduced compared with those in the HIBD group 24 and 72 hrs and 7 and 10 days after HI (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Phosphacan and NG2 may be important inhibitory factors for neurite regeneration following HIBD in neonatal rats. The neuroprotection of androgen against neonatal HIBD is produced possibly through an inhibition of phosphacan and NG2 expression.",
