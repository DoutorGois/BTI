     "AB": "Human global ischaemia was simulated in adult rats by inducing 20 min brain ischaemia and 60 min post-ischaemic recirculation. Immunohistochemical expression of MMP-9, TIMP-3, Bax and Bcl-2, and DNA fragmentation (with the TUNEL reaction) were investigated. The morphological data showed different neuronal responses in the hippocampus compared with the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. MMP-9 immunoreactivity was different in the hippocampus, particularly in dentate gyrus and the CA1 region, compared with these cortices. Negative TIMP-3 staining in ischaemic hippocampal neurons may indicate a loss of its inhibitory activity on MMP-9 that could enhance cell death. Bcl-2 down regulation, Bax positivity and TUNEL+ type II cells in the dentate gyrus granular layer could be responsible for induction of apoptotic death in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells via loss of fibre input. Results suggest differential behaviours of neural cells after 60 min reperfusion.",
