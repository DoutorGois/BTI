     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether norepinephrine (NE) mediated the reduction in the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) in the hippocampus and other serotonergic changes, induced by a single or multiple administrations of methamphetamine. The NE in the hippocampus was depleted by injecting rats with DSP4 intraperitoneally, 10 days prior to administration of methamphetamine. A single administration of methamphetamine (15 mg/kg) reduced the activity of TPH to 40% of control after 3 hr. A 90 to 98% reduction in the concentration of NE in the hippocampus, failed to alter this methamphetamine-induced response. The reduction in serotonin (5-HT) in the hippocampus induced by methamphetamine, was not altered by the treatment with DSP4. These observations were confirmed by a lack of effect on methamphetamine-induced changes in 5-HT and TPH after inhibition of the synthesis of NE with U-14,624. The pretreatment with DSP4 also failed to block the decline in activity of TPH in the hippocampus or concentrations of 5-HT measured 18 hr after the last of 4 doses of methamphetamine (15 mg/kg, s.c.). The results presented in this study indicate that NE is not involved in the response of the serotonergic system to methamphetamine.",
