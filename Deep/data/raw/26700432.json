     "AB": "Accumulating data suggest that sodium-hydrogen exchangers (NHEs) play a key role in modulating seizure activity by regulating neuronal pH in the brain. Amiloride, an inhibitor of NHEs, has been demonstrated to be effective in many seizure models, although its efficacy for prolonged febrile seizures (FS) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether amiloride could produce neuroprotective effects in a prolonged FS model in which FS were induced in rat pups at postnatal day 10 using a heated air approach. Amiloride was administered by intraperitoneal injection at three different doses (0.65, 1.3 and 2.6 mg/kg). Pretreatment with amiloride significantly delayed the onset of the first episode of limbic seizures, whereas posttreatment with amiloride decreased escape latency in the Morris water maze test compared to post-FS treatment with saline. Amiloride also inhibited seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the antiseizure activity of amiloride. In particular, posttreatment with amiloride resulted in cognitive improvement; this finding provides crucial evidence of the neuroprotective function of amiloride and of the therapeutic potential of amiloride in FS.",
