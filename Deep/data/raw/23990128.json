     "AB": "Hippocampal theta activity is the result of the concerted activity of a group of nuclei located in the brain stem and the caudal diencephalic area, which are together referred to as the synchronizing ascending system. Serotonin is recognized as the only neurotransmitter able to desynchronize the hippocampal electroencephalographic. A theory has been developed in which serotonin, acting on medial septal neurons, modulates cholinergic/GABAergic inputs to the hippocampus and, thus, the cognitive processing mediated by this area. However, few studies have addressed the relationship between serotonin modulation of theta activity and cognition. In this review, we present a summary and analysis of the data relating serotonin and its theta activity modulation with cognition, and we also discuss the few works relating serotonin, theta activity and cognition as well as the theories regarding the serotonin regulation of memory processes organized by the hippocampus. We propose that serotonin depletion induces impairment of the relays coding the frequency of hippocampal theta activity, whereas depletion of the relays in which frequency is not coded induces improvements in spatial learning that are related to increased expression of high-frequency theta activity.",
