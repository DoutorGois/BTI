     "AB": "In the guinea-pig isolated ileum, (RS)-(+/-)-baclofen induced a depression of cholinergic twitch contractions, reversibly and competitively antagonised by (S)-2-hydroxysaclofen (pA2 = 5.2 +/- 0.2), but not by (R)-2-hyroxysaclofen. The depression of excitatory field potentials by baclofen ( 5 mu M) in rat CA1 hippocampal slices was antagonised by (S)-2-hydroxysaclofen (100 mu m) (pA2 = 4.3), whilst in rat neocortex, (S)-2-hyroxysaclofen (50-500 mu M) antagonised the baclofen (10 mu M)-induced suppression of spontaneous discharges, the (R)-enantiomer being inactive. These results show that (S)-2-hydroxysaclofen is the active antagonist at central and peripheral GABAB receptors.",
