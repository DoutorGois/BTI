     "AB": "Stroke is a major cause of epilepsy, but the molecular mechanisms underlying post-stroke epileptogenesis are unknown. The expression of cystatin C, a cysteine protease inhibitor, is increased in the hippocampus during status epilepticus (SE)-induced epileptogenesis, and regulates both cell death and birth. To test the hypothesis that increased cystatin C expression represents a common molecular alteration induced by epileptogenic brain insults, we investigated the time course, cellular localization, and association of cystatin C expression with neuronal damage during post-stroke epileptogenesis. Stroke was induced with photothrombosis, which leads to epilepsy in approximately 20-30% of rats. Cystatin C expression was increased in the CA1 area of the hippocampus 4 days after photothrombosis, when the diameter of the lesion was the largest. Double-labeling and confocal analysis indicated that cystatin C was expressed in astrocytes and microglia. Unlike after SE, cystatin C expression did not change in the dentate gyrus. Also, increased cystatin C expression was not associated with neurodegeneration, which was demonstrated as an absence of Fluoro Jade B-positive cells in adjacent sections. The present study provides evidence that cystatin C may be involved in cellular alterations that occur after an epileptogenic insult, not only after SE but also after photothrombotic stroke.",
