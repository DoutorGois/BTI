     "AB": "Rats with contusion injury to the right cortex exhibited significant formation of edema 6 and 24 hours after injury which resolved by 8 days and was replaced by cavitation necrosis. The contusions produced hyperglycolysis and ischemia in the impacted cortical tissue and underlying hippocampus immediately through 30 minutes post-injury. Glucose utilization was depressed throughout the contused cortex and in ipsilateral subcortical regions, as was blood flow, at chronic (1 and 10 days) periods after injury.",
