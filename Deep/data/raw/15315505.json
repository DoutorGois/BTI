     "AB": "In this paper we develop statistical tools for shape modelling of spatial particles from central sections through the particles. The particles are assumed to be star-shaped with respect to a reference point inside the particles and are modelled as stochastic deformations of spheres centred at the reference points. The resulting particles are rotation invariant with respect to the reference point. As an illustration, the model is applied to study shape differences between neurons in the Granular and CA1 layer in the human hippocampus.",
