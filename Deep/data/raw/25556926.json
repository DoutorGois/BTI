     "AB": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: COX-2 has been considered as a potent molecular target for prevention and therapy of depression. However, a recent study showed that COX-2 inhibitor does not improve depressive symptoms in persons aged 70 and over. Therefore, whether treatments targeting COX-2 have a clinical efficacy in depression, especially elderly individuals, remains unclear. Cinnamic aldehyde is a major constituent of Cinnamomum cassia, which has exhibited excellent anti-inflammatory activities as a COX-2 inhibitor. To investigate the potential antidepressant effect of cinnamic aldehyde in mid-aged rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The depressive-like behaviors were measured after the rats exposed to chronic unexpected mild stress (CUMS). Cinnamic aldehyde was administrated by oral gavage to stressed rats (22.5, 45, 90 mg/kg, respectively) for 21 days. The mRNA, protein expression and activity of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels were measured in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of stressed animals. RESULTS: We found that CUMS procedure not only decreased the sucrose preference, but also elevated the COX-2 activity, mRNA and protein levels, and increased PGE2 concentration in rat brain regions. Treatment with high doses of cinnamic aldehyde (45, 90 mg/kg) reversed the behavioral abnormalities, and decreased the COX-2 protein and activity (but not COX-2 mRNA expression) and PGE2 concentration in frontal cortex and hippocampus of stressed rats. CONCLUSION: Cinnamic aldehyde exerted antidepressant-like effects in stressed mid-aged rats, and its mechanism of action appears to decrease COX-2 protein and activity. The current findings suggest that targeting COX-2 system might be benefit to the depression, especially elderly individuals and cinnamic aldehyde might be a promising medicine to treat the subjects in the depression.",
