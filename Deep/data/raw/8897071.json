     "AB": "The cellular localization of microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 2 kinase mRNA in rat brain was examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe. MAP 2 kinase was expressed in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Areas of high density of mRNA label by the MAP 2 kinase probe appeared to be associated with high cellular packing density. Thus, MAP 2 kinase expression was particularly high in regions such as the locus coeruleus, the piriform cortex, the dentate gyrus granule cell layer, pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, and the large motor neurons of the V and VII nerves. This apparent ubiquitous distribution suggests an important role of MAP 2 kinase in the cellular functions in most cells of the adult brain.",
