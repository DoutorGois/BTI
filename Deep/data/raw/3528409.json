     "AB": "The effects of dopamine on the axonal terminals of hippocampal-nucleus accumbens (HIPP-ACC) neurons were investigated in urethane-anesthetized rats using extracellular single-unit recording techniques. Antidromic responses recorded in the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus were evoked by stimulation of the medial accumbens. Baseline terminal excitability of these neurons, established by threshold stimulation of the accumbens, was markedly enhanced by conditioning stimulation (10 Hz) of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the origin of the mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons. Iontophoretic application of sulpiride, a selective D2 antagonist, onto the HIPP-ACC terminals attenuated the increased terminal excitability of these neurons produced by conditioning VTA stimulation, while intraperitoneal injection of SCH23390, a selective D1 antagonist, failed to attenuate this effect. Iontophoretic application of dopamine or its selective D2 agonist, LY171555, onto the terminals of the HIPP-ACC neurons mimicked the prolonged enhancement of the terminal excitability produced by VTA stimulation, whereas SKF38393, a D1 agonist, had no effect. The effects of VTA stimulation, dopamine and LY171555 application were similar after the accumbens had been pretreated with ibotenic acid, suggesting a direct action of dopamine on the axonal terminals of HIPP-ACC neurons, and that changes in terminal excitability were not mediated via interneurons or feedback pathways from the accumbens to the hippocampus. Since iontophoretic application of potassium, a depolarizing agent, also enhanced the terminal excitability of the HIPP-ACC neurons, it appears that dopamine depolarized, via D2 receptors, the axonal terminals of HIPP-ACC neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
