     "AB": "The hippocampus is thought to play an important role in learning and memory processing, and impairments in memory, attention, and decision making are found commonly in schizophrenia. Although many studies have reported decreases in hippocampal volume in the left hemisphere in schizophrenia, regionally specific hippocampal volume loss has not been revealed consistently using volume analysis. Recently, many studies have analyzed shape asymmetry using 3-D models; however, inconsistent results have been reported, mainly due to methodologic differences. We therefore used an active, flexible, deformable shape model for surface parameterization, and compared shape asymmetry based on principal component analysis (PCA) in the hippocampi of schizophrenic patients with those of the normal controls. Although the overall pattern of the statistical results did not change according to the number of principal components, the reconstructed results based on six major components were much more distinguishable. Although the left hemispheric hippocampal volume was larger than the right hemispheric was in this study, the difference was not significant. In shape asymmetry analysis, the right hemisphere hippocampus was bilaterally larger than the left hemisphere hippocampus was in the head of the superior CA1 and smaller in the tail and head of the inferior CA1. The asymmetry in the schizophrenia group was statistically smaller than that in the control group through reduction of the left hemisphere hippocampus volume.",
