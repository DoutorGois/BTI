(2) Halothane similarly inhibited non-NMDA and NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents in both cell types at low concentrations but preferentially blocked responses to exogenously applied AMPA at higher concentrations. (3) Synaptically but not directly evoked action potentials in interneurons were inhibited by halothane.",
