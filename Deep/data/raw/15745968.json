     "AB": "Injecting tetrodotoxin (TTX) into one hippocampus impaired avoidance of a place defined by distal cues while rats were on a slowly rotating arena. The impairment could be explained by a deficit in memory, navigation, or behavioral inhibition. Here, we show that the TTX injection abolished the ability of rats to organize place-avoidance behavior specifically when distal room and local arena cues were continuously dissociated. The results provide evidence that injecting TTX into one hippocampus specifically impaired the coordination of representations that support organized behavior because of the following: (1) rats normally coordinate separate room and arena avoidance memories; (2) the TTX injection spared spatial, relational, and representational memory, navigation, and behavioral inhibition; and (3) the TTX-induced impairment of place avoidance depended on the need to coordinate representations of local and distal stimuli.",
