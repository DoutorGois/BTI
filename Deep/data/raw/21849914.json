     "AB": "This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) against oxidative stress induced by kainic acid (KA) in organotypic hippocampal slice culture of rats. Cultured slices were injured by exposure to 5 microM of KA for 18 h and then treated with different concentrations of CoQ10. Neuronal cell death measured as propidium iodide uptake was reduced at 24 h after treatment with 1 microM of CoQ10. We also observed an increased number of surviving CA3 neurons in 0.1 and 1 microM concentrations of CoQ10-treated groups using cresyl violet staining. CoQ10 (0.01, 0.1, and 1 microM) treatment significantly decreased the 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence and the expression of NQO1 in the CoQ10-treated groups was significantly lower than that in the KA-only group. These results suggest that CoQ10 may protect hippocampal neurons against oxidative stress.",
