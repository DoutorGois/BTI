     "AB": "In human brain, nonartherosclerotic calcification is associated with normal aging and several pathological conditions without any clear significance. In all situations, calcification appears predominantly in the basal ganglia, but is also frequent in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. alpha-Amino-(3-hydroxi-5-methyl-4-isoxazol-4-il)-propionic acid-induced lesion of the globus pallidus is associated in rats with the formation of calcium deposits similar to those observed in the human brain. To determine whether direct neuronal activation may induce calcification, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) was microinjected in rat hippocampus, globus pallidus, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Two months later, neuronal death was associated with calcium deposits that were characterized in terms of distribution and size. A unique population of deposits was present in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, whereas in the globus pallidus two main groups could be differentiated. Calcification was always associated with a significant microglial reaction as shown by the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor autoradiography. Monoamine oxidase B autoradiography, reflecting the astroglial reaction, was also significantly increased. Our results provide evidence that acute NMDA neuronal activation leads with time to calcification associated with a glial reaction and indicate that nonartherosclerotic calcification in the human brain may develop from an acute NMDA receptor activation. A key role of the metabotropic mGluR1 receptor is also suggested.",
