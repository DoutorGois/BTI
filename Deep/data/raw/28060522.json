     "AB": "There is evidence for a relationship between inflammation and seizures because epilepsy can be caused by or result in inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of aspirin and (or) omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on seizure activity and neurodegeneration in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-kindled rats focusing on their effect on corticohippocampal production of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and expression of formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1) receptors. Male rats were injected with PTZ (35 mg/kg, i.p.) 3 times per week for a total of 15 doses. Rats were treated daily with aspirin (20 mg/kg, i.p.), omega-3 PUFAs (85 mg/kg, p.o.), or a combination of them for 35 days. Both LXA4 level and expression of FPRL1 receptor in the cortices and hippocampi of rats' brains were greater in PTZ-kindled rats compared to a saline control group. Cotreatment with aspirin and (or) omega-3 PUFAs reduced convulsive behaviour; reduced levels of LXA4, interleukin-1beta, and nuclear factor-kappaB; and showed a lower percentage of corticohippocampal degenerative cells compared to PTZ-kindled rats. The combination of the 2 therapeutic agents did not provide significant improvement in comparison with the monotherapies. These findings suggest the use of aspirin or omega-3 PUFAs may delay the development of seizures and provide neuroprotection in a clinical setting.",
