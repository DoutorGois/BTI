     "AB": "The effect of RSM on ultrastructural alterations of the cortical, hippocampal and caudate neucleus areas brought about by forebrain ischemia in rats were studied. In both RSM-treated and saline-treated groups the ischemic damage was detected in nearly all animals three hours after bilateral common carotid artery ligation, while it was much more mild in RSM-treated animals. The ultrastructural changes consisted of swollen mitochondria, partial loss of cristae, dilatation of rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi's complex. In addition, some dark neurons were present, capillary endothelial cells and processes of astrocytes were swollen and active pinocytosis appeared in the endothelial cells. Their presence was most severe in the hippocampus region and the least in the caudate nuclear area. No ultrastructural changes exhibited in the sham-operated animals. The findings of the present experiment demonstrate that RSM can reduce ultrastructural abnormalities of cerebral ischemia and are also direct evidence of the protective effect of RSM on cerebral ischemia.",
