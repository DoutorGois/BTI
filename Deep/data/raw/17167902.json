After a brief discussion of signaling in the hippocampus, we will explore the topics of human mental retardation syndromes that involve disruption of these processes, including Angelman syndrome (AS), Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)-associated learning disorders, Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS), Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS), and Rett syndrome (RTT).",
