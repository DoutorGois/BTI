     "AB": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation in the brain plays a central and initiatory role in pathogenesis and/or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibiting Abeta aggregation is a potential strategy in the prevention of AD. A scavenger peptide, V24P(10-40), designed to decrease Abeta accumulation in the brain, was conjugated to polyethylenimine (PEI) and tested as a preventive/therapeutic strategy for AD in this study. This PEI-conjugated V24P(10-40) peptide was delivered intranasally, as nasal drops, to four-month-old APP/PS1 double transgenic mice for four or eight months. Compared with control values, peptide treatment for four months significantly reduced the amount of GdnHCl-extracted Abeta40 and Abeta42 in the mice's hippocampus and cortex. After treatment for eight months, amyloid load, as quantified by Pittsburgh compound B microPET imaging, was significantly decreased in the mice's hippocampus, cortex, amygdala, and olfactory bulb. Our data suggest that this intranasally delivered scavenger peptide is effective in decreasing Abeta accumulation in the brain of AD transgenic mice. Nasal application of peptide drops is easy to use and could be further developed to prevent and treat AD.",
