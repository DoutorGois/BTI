     "AB": "Monkeys with bilateral transections of the fornix were severely but selectively impaired at learning visuospatial conditional tasks presented in a Wisconsin General Test Apparatus. Bilateral transplantation of cholinergic-rich embryonic basal forebrain tissue into the hippocampus led to complete recovery from this specific learning impairment across a range of task difficulties. Administration of the direct cholinergic agonist pilocarpine to ungrafted animals immediately before testing also reduced this impairment, suggesting that the graft-associated recovery was mediated by acetylcholine release. Transection of the fornix produced a marked loss of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining confined to hippocampus and entorhinal cortex relative to controls. In all transplanted animals densely AChE-staining cellular masses were seen bilaterally in temporal lobe structures, with fibre outgrowth into surrounding host tissue.",
