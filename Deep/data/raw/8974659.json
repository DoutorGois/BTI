     "AB": "In this study the effect of LY 231617, an antioxidant, on spatial learning deficit and on neuronal damage following transient cerebral ischemia was evaluated. Global ischemia was induced by four-vessel-occlusion (4VO) for 20 min in rats. LY 231617 (20 mg/kg i.p.) was administered after onset of reperfusion. One week after surgery spatial learning was tested in the Morris water maze. LY 231617 reduced the increase in escape latency and in swim distance induced by 4VO. Neuronal damage in the CAI sector of the hippocampus produced by 4VO was significantly attenuated by LY 231617. The present data demonstrate that posttreatment with LY 231617 exerts a protective effect on hippocampal neuronal damage and deficits in spatial learning induced by 4VO.",
