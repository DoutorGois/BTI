     "AB": "The nuclear envelope is a part of the endoplasmic reticulum which surrounds the genetic apparatus of the cell. Using the patch-clamp technique we have investigated ion channels in the membranes of nuclei isolated from the neurons of the dentate gyrus. Our research has shown that there is anionic (329 pS) on the outer and anionic (157 pS) and cationic (179 pS) channels on the inner nuclear membrane. Ion channels in the nuclear envelope of the neurons of the dentate gyrus differ much from ones of the neurons of the cerebellum and CA region of the hippocampus. This fact proves that different types of neurons express different sets of ion channels in the nuclear membranes. The physiological role of the ion nuclear channels in the granule cells is not clear but they may be important for the ion balance between the cytoplasm and the lumen of the nuclear envelope as well as endoplasmic reticulum of the cell if the latter represents an adequate model of granule of the some parts of ER.",
