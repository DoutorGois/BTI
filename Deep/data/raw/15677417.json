     "AB": "Recently discovered sexual dimorphism within developing brain structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus suggests that biological factors may account for many of the sex differences in stress reactivity. In this study, we have relied on studies of naturally occurring anomalous processes, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY), to observe the effects of hormones and sex chromosomes on brain structures thought to influence an individual's vulnerability to stress. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained both from 16 boys with classic CAH and 34 age- and sex-matched controls and from 20 XXY children and 40 age-matched controls. Smaller amygdala volumes were observed in boys with CAH than in matched controls, and in XXY patients than in matched controls. XXY patients were also found to have smaller hippocampus volumes when compared with matched controls. Acknowledging that hormone and sex chromosome effects upon the developing human brain are widespread and complex, it is difficult to conclude, with any certainty, the etiology of the differences found in this study. Future studies that examine longitudinal data and/or other diagnostic groups, however, may help to better elucidate specific hormone and sex chromosome effects upon stress-related structures in the brain.",
