     "AB": "We studied the mRNA expression of cGMP-hydrolysing phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in selected brain areas of normal elderly people and patients with Alzheimer's disease. Using radioactive in-situ hybridization histochemistry we found a widespread distribution of the mRNA for PDE2 and PDE9, whereas no specific hybridization signal was observed for PDE5. We observed PDE2 and PDE9 mRNA in all cortical areas studied (insular cortex, entorhinal cortex and visual cortex), although to a different extent. PDE2 mRNA was high in the claustrum, whereas PDE9 mRNA was moderate. PDE2 and PDE9 mRNAs was present in the putamen. No cGMP-hydrolysing PDE expression was observed in the globus pallidus. PDE2 and PDE9 mRNA was observed in all subareas of the hippocampus; however, there were significant differences in the amount of expression. In the Purkinje and cerebellar granule cells only PDE9 expression was observed. PDE2 and PDE9 mRNA expression was not significantly different in Alzheimer's disease brains.",
