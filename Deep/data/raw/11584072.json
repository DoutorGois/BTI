     "AB": "Early life experience affects behavior and brain mechanisms. Handling rats during the first three weeks in life can slow age-related cognitive decline (as measured by a hippocampal-dependent spatial learning task) and reduce age-related hippocampal neuron loss. It is not clear, however, whether this early environmental influence on learning is selective for old age or is more general, affecting cognitive development during infancy and young adulthood as well. We briefly exposed neonatal rats to a novel non-home environment for 3 min daily during the first three weeks of life (as a component of the handling method). We found that this brief early environmental manipulation resulted in enhanced hippocampal-dependent learning immediately after weaning and that this learning enhancement persisted into adulthood. These results suggest that subtle early life events can affect cognitive development in all developmental stages and that changes in neural mechanisms other than neuron number are likely to mediate the learning enhancement at multiple developmental stages.",
