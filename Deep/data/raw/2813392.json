     "AB": "Protease nexin-1 (PN-1) is a cell-secreted protein that inhibits certain proteases, particularly thrombin, by forming SDS-stable complexes with the catalytic site serine of the protease. PN-1 was recently shown to be identical to a glial-derived neurite-promoting factor/glial-derived nexin present in rat brain. Its neurite outgrowth activity depends on inhibition of thrombin, presumably because thrombin brings about neurite retraction. Here we show that human brain contains PN-1 and that PN-1 activity in brains of individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) was only 14% of control values (total of 14 AD patients and 7 control individuals). PN-1 activity in the hippocampus, a region with marked neuropathology in AD, was 15% of control values (10 AD patients and 4 control individuals). Western blot analysis indicated a large decrease in free PN-1 protein and an increase in PN-1-containing complexes that comigrated with PN-1-thrombin complexes. Northern blot analysis indicated that PN-1 mRNA levels were about equal in brains from AD patients and control individuals. Thus these results suggest that the decreases in PN-1 activity and free PN-1 protein are due to formation of PN-1-protease complexes.",
