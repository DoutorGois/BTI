     "AB": "We have analysed the postnatal development of the nuclear sizes of the granular cells of the dentate gyrus in 5- to 190-day-old male mice. The study was performed in three topographic levels: rostral, intermediate and caudal. Three subdivisions were analysed in each level: suprapyramidal blade, infrapyramidal blade and the transition between them, the angular zone. Additionally, each of these subdivisions was measured in its external and internal layer, separately. Three gradients of postnatal karyometric development can be described: external-to-internal, suprapyramidal-to-infrapyramidal, and caudal-to-rostral, indicating that the external, suprapyramidal and caudal cells show higher karyometric sizes than the other subdivisions. These gradients are related to the ontogenetic gradients of these neurons.",
