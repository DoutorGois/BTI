     "AB": "Intraperitoneal injection of phencyclidine before intravenous injection of [3H] Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB, 1.6 micrograms/kg) significantly increased the amount of radioactivity found in the brains of female C57BL/6J mice one hour after the 3H-QNB administration. This effect was found in hypothalamus, cortex, hippocampus and striatum and was decreased by pretreatment of the animal with atropine. The magnitude of the enhancement varied as a function of dose but did not change across the time span studied. These data are in contrast to our findings and those of others of inhibition of the specific binding of 3H-QNB to muscarinic cholinergic receptors by PCP in vitro. When atropine or PCP was administered in vivo and the tissue later analyzed in vitro, no effects of the drugs were observed on 3H-QNB binding. The reasons for the differences remain a matter of speculation.",
