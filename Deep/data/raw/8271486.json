     "AB": "Using an upright microscope and an interface type slice chamber for epifluorometric imaging of fura-2 injected neurons in brain slice is particularly convenient to obtain good spatial resolution. Using this approach we found that muscarinic activation uncouples K-channel activation from intradendritic Ca and that postsynaptic spines represent independent compartments for Ca-activated processes when activated synaptically.",
