     "AB": "Recently the nuclear proto-oncogene c-fos has been shown to be rapidly and transiently expressed following seizures in many types of epilepsies. Until now, immunohistochemical as well as in situ hybridization studies have reported that the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and most of the cortical areas were invariably heavily labeled. In order to see whether this distribution was reproduced or not in a model of epilepsy which has been proved to not involve these structures, a study was performed on genetically epilepsy-prone DBA/2 mice. Here we show that following audiogenic seizures, c-fos oncoprotein is not expressed in cortical and limbic structures but rather mapped the subcortical auditory nuclei.",
