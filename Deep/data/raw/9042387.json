     "AB": "We have shown in patients taking the antipsychotic drug haloperidol (HP) that two pyridinium metabolites (HPP+ and RHPP+) are present in blood and urine in nM concentrations. These metabolites are structurally analogous to MPP+, the neurotoxic metabolite of the well-known parkinsonian-producing protoxin, MPTP. In this study we measured the concentrations of HPP+ and RHPP+ in seven regions of the brain (putamen, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, caudate, hippocampus, cerebellum and occipital cortex) obtained at post-mortem from three patients who were taking HP before death. Blood, urine, and bile from one patient were analysed as well. HPP+ was present in all regions (except for substantia nigra in one patient and globus pallidus in another); the amount/g ranged from 1.6-8.3 pMol but there was no preferential sequestration of the metabolite in dopaminergic regions. Similarly, RHPP+ was present relatively uniformly in all regions; the amount/g ranged from 1.1-7.6 pMol. The concentrations of HPP+ and RHPP+ in one patient were 24 and 13 nM in blood, 660 and 230 nM in urine, and 13.0 and 1.4 microM in bile, respectively. The presence of these pyridinums in brain adds another important piece of information to the case that, at least for HP, metabolite-induced neurotoxicity could contribute to the extrapyramidal side-effects in patients receiving long-term therapy.",
