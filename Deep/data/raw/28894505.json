     "AB": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with mutations in the MECP2 gene. Mostly girls are affected, and an apparently normal development is followed by cognitive impairment, motor dysfunction, epilepsy, and irregular breathing. Various indications suggest mitochondrial dysfunction. In Rett mice, brain ATP levels are reduced, mitochondria are leaking protons, and respiratory complexes are dysregulated. Furthermore, we found in MeCP2-deficient mouse (Mecp2(-/y) ) hippocampus an intensified mitochondrial metabolism and ROS generation. We now used emission ratiometric 2-photon imaging to assess mitochondrial morphology, mass, and membrane potential (DeltaPsim) in Mecp2(-/y) hippocampal astrocytes. Cultured astrocytes were labeled with the DeltaPsim marker JC-1, and semiautomated analyses yielded the number of mitochondria per cell, their morphology, and DeltaPsim. Mecp2(-/y) astrocytes contained more mitochondria than wild-type (WT) cells and were more oxidized. Mitochondrial size, DeltaPsim, and vulnerability to pharmacological challenge did not differ. The antioxidant Trolox opposed the oxidative burden and decreased the mitochondrial mass, thereby dampening the differences among WT and Mecp2(-/y) astrocytes; mitochondrial size and DeltaPsim were not markedly affected. In conclusion, mitochondrial alterations and redox imbalance in RTT also involve astrocytes. Mitochondria are more numerous in Mecp2(-/y) than in WT astrocytes. As this genotypic difference is abolished by Trolox, it seems linked to the oxidative stress in RTT.",
