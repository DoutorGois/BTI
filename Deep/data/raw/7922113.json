     "AB": "By means of the radioimmunological method changes of concentration of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) in rat brain cortex and hippocampus have been evaluated during 5-min clinical death and up to 2 h after resuscitation. Wet weight/dry weight methodology was utilized to evaluate brain water content. Ischemia did not produce significant changes of LTC4 concentration in the brain. In the postresuscitation period concentration of LTC4 in both brain regions significantly increased reaching in 5 and 15 min respectively a 4- and 5-fold control values. Later the concentration of LTC4 in the brain decreased reaching in 30 min a 3-fold control level, and in 60 and 120 min after resuscitation control values. Water content after resuscitation did not show significant changes in both brain regions. LTC4 does not seem to play an important role in the development of cerebral edema.",
