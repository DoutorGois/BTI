     "AB": "Numerous studies have demonstrated that learning and memory abilities in the course of normal aging cognitive abilities tend to decline and Nrf2 expression appears to decline with aging. So, Nrf2 pathway has been identified as a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases. The organosulfur compounds, allicin can activate Nrf2, because it has an electrophilic center, which can serve as an attack site for nucleophiles, such as specific protein sulfhydryl groups present on Keap1. However, the influence of allicin on aging-induced cognitive deficits has not been examined. In this study, we assess the effects of allicin on endogenous antioxidant defenses in hippocampus of cognitively impaired aged mouse. Our results indicate that treatment of allicin significantly ameliorated ageing-induced cognitive dysfunction through enhancing of Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathways. Therefore, allicin could be recommended as a possible candidate for the prevention and therapy of cognitive deficits in aging and Alzheimer's disease.",
