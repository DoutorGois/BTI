     "AB": "Corticosteroid receptors are key mediators of the neuroendocrine response to stress. Previously, we have determined the effects of restraint stress on the regulation of corticosteroid receptor genes in the brain and pituitary of male and female rats. Significant gender- and regional-specific regulation of receptor mRNAs was observed. To further investigate the stressor specificity in the same context, we have determined glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) mRNAs following exposure to swimming stress paradigms applied alone, or in combination with restraint stress. Our data revealed stressor-specific alterations in GR or MR mRNA levels, which were more pronounced in males, the gender most affected by swimming stress. No alterations in GR or MR mRNA levels were detected in the female hippocampus and hypothalamus upon exposure to swimming paradigms, while in males the same stressors down-regulated GR mRNA in the hippocampus (chronic exposure) and up-regulated both genes in the hypothalamus (acute exposure). In the frontal cortex, acute swimming stress caused a reciprocal change in GR mRNA levels in the two sexes. The above difference is not due to circulating ovarian steroids, since ovariectomy did not change the female pattern of GR gene expression following acute stress. Our results further showed a hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis facilitation to a novel superimposed stressor expressed at the level of limbic corticosteroid receptors: When chronically restrained rats of both sexes were exposed to acute swimming stress, a reduced GR/MR mRNA ratio, implying reduced feedback axis sensitivity, was detected in both the hippocampus and the hypothalamus. In conclusion, our work provides additional evidence on stressor, gender and region specificity in the regulation of brain corticosteroid receptors.",
