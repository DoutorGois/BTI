     "AB": "The beta-endorphin, met5-enkephalin-arg6-phe7 (MEAP) and met5-enkephalin (ME) changes related to age and diurnal rhythms were studied in various regions of rat brain and in the pituitary by specific radioimmunoassays. The contents of MEAP, met5-enkephalin and beta-endorphin were higher in the pituitary of old rats (18 months old) than that of young rats (23 days old) while the content of these opioid peptides was higher in the hypothalamus of young rats than in that of old rats. Beta-endorphin was also higher in the striatum of 23 days old rats, but no age-associated changes were observed in the hippocampus, brain stem or cortex. In the diurnal rhythm study, it was found that in the hypothalamus and striatum of the adult rat (2-3 months old), both MEAP and ME contents were higher at mid-dark than at mid-light and that in the intermediate posterior lobe of the pituitary, the ME content was also higher at mid-dark.",
