     "AB": "Acetylcholine (ACh) and ATP are rapidly acting neurotransmitters with a putative role in epileptic seizures. In the present study we investigated extracellular concentrations of both neurotransmitters in parallel by microdialysis in rat hippocampus. We found that infusion of neostigmine increases, while calcium-free perfusion and infusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX) decreases, ACh levels. Calcium-free perfusion also decreased ATP levels which were, however, not affected by neostigmine or TTX. During status epilepticus, ACh levels were increased threefold but returned to baseline after the termination of seizures by diazepam. ATP levels were unchanged during status epilepticus but a several-fold increase was seen when AOPCP, an inhibitor of 5'-endonucleotidase, was infused. The results demonstrate an increase of ATP levels during epileptic seizures which, however, was not of neuronal origin.",
