     "AB": "We investigated the dose-response and time-course of c-fos antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASO) treatment against excitatory amino acid (EAA)-induced neurotoxicity in rat hippocampal neurons. Glutamate (in vitro) or NMDA (in vivo) produced significant neuronal degeneration. Neuroprotection produced by 30 min or 4 h pretreatment with c-fos ASO in cultured hippocampal neurons was dose-dependent. In vivo, bilateral intrahippocampal injections of c-fos ASO (0.025 nmol/site) was neuroprotective when administered 30 min before or after NMDA treatment. However, 4 h pretreatment was ineffective. A higher dose (0.125 nmol) of c-fos ASO was neurotoxic and failed to afford neuroprotection regardless of the treatment schedule. Collectively, these results demonstrate a neuroprotective effect of c-fos ASO against EAA-induced neuronal injury supporting a causative role of c-fos expression in EAA neurotoxicity.",
