     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of using MRI measurements as a surrogate endpoint for disease progression in a therapeutic trial for AD. METHODS: A total of 362 patients with probable AD from 38 different centers participated in the MRI portion of a 52-week randomized placebo-controlled trial of milameline, a muscarinic receptor agonist. The therapeutic trial itself was not completed due to projected lack of efficacy on interim analysis; however, the MRI arm of the study was continued. Of the 362 subjects who underwent a baseline MRI study, 192 subjects underwent a second MRI 1 year later. Hippocampal volume and temporal horn volume were measured from the MRI scans. RESULTS: The annualized percent changes in hippocampal volume (-4.9%) and temporal horn volume (16.1%) in the study patients were consistent with data from prior single-site studies. Correlations between the rate of MRI volumetric change and change in behavioral/cognitive measures were greater for the temporal horn than for the hippocampus. Decline over time was more consistently seen with imaging measures, 99% of the time for the hippocampus, than behavioral/cognitive measures (p < 0.001). Greater consistency in MRI than behavioral/clinical measures resulted in markedly lower estimated sample size requirements for clinical trials. The estimated number of subjects per arm required to detect a 50% reduction in the rate of decline over 1 year are: AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 320; Mini-Mental Status Examination 241; hippocampal volume 21; temporal horn volume 54. CONCLUSION: The consistency of MRI measurements obtained across sites, and the consistency between the multisite milameline data and that obtained in prior single-site studies, demonstrate the technical feasibility of using structural MRI measures as a surrogate endpoint of disease progression in therapeutic trials. However, validation of imaging as a biomarker of therapeutic efficacy in AD awaits a positive trial.",
