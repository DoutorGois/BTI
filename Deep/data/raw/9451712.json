     "AB": "In vivo microdialysis was used to determine the effects of chronic electroconvulsive shock (ECS), given daily for 10 days, on basal 5-HT levels in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus and on the effect of systemic administration of the 5-HT-la receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (0.2 mg/kg), to reduce 5-HT levels in these areas by activation of somatodendritic autoreceptors. Neither basal 5-HT levels nor the effects of 8-OH-DPAT on 5-HT levels were altered after chronic ECS. The effect of systemic administration of the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B antagonist, (+/-)-pindolol (10 mg/kg), to increase 5-HT levels in hippocampus, was also not affected by chronic ECS.",
