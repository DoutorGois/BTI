     "AB": "For further characterization of the olfactory bulb's role in the medication of chronobiological phenomena, we examined basal cyclic- 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and lateral hippocampus (LHIP) following bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) to assess the effects of olfactory bulb removal on the biological clock. Two groups of adult Long-Evans rats underwent OBX or sham control surgery (SHAM). Eight weeks postoperative, the animals were decapitated at the time of maximal cAMP accumulation (circadian time 9-11 h), brains were removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and sectioned on a cryostat. Individual brain nuclei (SCN and LHIP) were microdissected using the Palkovits punch technique and analyzed by scintillation proximity assay for cAMP. We report a 83.6% increase in basal cAMP levels in the SCN following OBX (OBX = 63.7 pmol cAMP/mg protein, SHAM = 34.7 pmol cAMP/mg protein, p less than 0.01). No significant differences in LHIP cAMP levels were found. This specific increase in SCN cAMP, at the time of maximum cAMP accumulation, may give insight into the biochemical basis for altered activity levels following OBX.",
