     "AB": "AIM: To establish a rat model of anxiety-like gastric hypersensitivity (GHS) of functional dyspepsia (FD) induced by novel sequential stress. METHODS: Animal pups were divided into two groups from postnatal day 2: controls and the sequential-stress-treated. The sequential-stress-treated group received maternal separation and acute gastric irritation early in life and restraint stress in adulthood; controls were reared undisturbed with their mothers. Rats in both groups were followed to adulthood (8 wk) at which point the anxiety-like behaviors and visceromotor responses to gastric distention (20-100 mmHg) and gastric emptying were tested. Meanwhile, alterations in several anxiety-related brain-stomach modulators including 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nesfatin-1 in the rat hippocampus, plasma and gastric fundus and the 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR) in the hippocampal CA1 subfield and the mucosa of the gastric fundus were examined. RESULTS: Sequential-stress-treated rats simultaneously demonstrated anxiety-like behaviors and GHS in dose-dependent manner compared with the control group. Although rats in both groups consumed similar amount of solid food, the rate of gastric emptying was lower in the sequential-stress-treated rats than in the control group. Sequential stress significantly decreased the levels of 5-HT (51.91 +/- 1.88 vs 104.21 +/- 2.88, P < 0.01), GABA (2.38 +/- 0.16 vs 5.01 +/- 0.13, P < 0.01) and BDNF (304.40 +/- 10.16 vs 698.17 +/- 27.91, P < 0.01) in the hippocampus but increased the content of nesfatin-1 (1961.38 +/- 56.89 vs 1007.50 +/- 33.05, P < 0.01) in the same site; significantly decreased the levels of 5-HT (47.82 +/- 2.29 vs 89.45 +/- 2.61, P < 0.01) and BDNF (257.05 +/- 12.89 vs 536.71 +/- 20.73, P < 0.01) in the plasma but increased the content of nesfatin-1 in it (1391.75 +/- 42.77 vs 737.88 +/- 33.15, P < 0.01); significantly decreased the levels of 5-HT (41.15 +/- 1.81 vs 89.17 +/- 2.31, P < 0.01) and BDNF (226.49 +/- 12.10 vs 551.36 +/- 16.47, P < 0.01) in the gastric fundus but increased the content of nesfatin-1 in the same site (1534.75 +/- 38.52 vs 819.63 +/- 38.04, P < 0.01). The expressions of 5-HT1AR in the hippocampal CA1 subfield and the mucosa of the gastric fundus were down-regulated measured by IHC (Optical Density value: Hippocampus 15253.50 +/- 760.35 vs 21149.75 +/- 834.13; gastric fundus 15865.25 +/- 521.24 vs 23865.75 +/- 1868.60; P < 0.05, respectively) and WB (0.38 +/- 0.01 vs 0.57 +/- 0.03, P < 0.01) (n = 8 in each group). CONCLUSION: Sequential stress could induce a potential rat model of anxiety-like GHS of FD, which could be used to research the mechanisms of this intractable disease.",
