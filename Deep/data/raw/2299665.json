     "AB": "A novel human brain complementary DNA sequence encodes n-chimaerin, a 34,000 Mr protein. A single cysteine-rich sequence CX2CX13CX2CX7CX7C in the N-terminal half of n-chimaerin shares almost 50% identity with corresponding sequences in the C1 regulatory domain of protein kinase C. The C-terminal half of n-chimaerin has 42% identity with the C-terminal region (amino acid residues 1050 to 1225) of BCR, the product of the breakpoint cluster region gene involved in Philadelphia (Ph') chromosome translocation. n-Chimaerin mRNA (2.2 x 10(3) base-pairs) is specifically expressed in the brain, with the highest amounts being in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The mRNA has a neuronal distribution and is expressed in neuroblastoma cells, but not in C6 glioma or primary astrocyte cultures. The similarity of two separate regions of n-chimaerin to domains of protein kinase C and BCR has intriguing implications with respect to its evolutionary origins, its function in the brain and potential phorbol-ester-binding properties.",
