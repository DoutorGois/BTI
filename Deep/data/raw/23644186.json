     "AB": "De novo gene transcription is a prerequisite for long-term information storage in the brain. Learning-facilitated synaptic plasticity describes the ability of hippocampal synapses to respond with long-lasting synaptic plasticity to the coupling of afferent stimulation with a spatial learning experience. Strikingly, long-term depression (LTD) is facilitated by context-dependent spatial learning experiences suggesting it may play a role in information storage to enable spatial memory. Here, we investigated if learning-facilitated LTD requires the transcription factor, c-Fos and is transcription-dependent. Novel spatial learning about object-place configurations coupled with weak low frequency afferent stimulation induced robust LTD in control animals that persisted for >24h and was associated with elevations in hippocampal expression of c-Fos. Intracerebral application of a c-fos antisense oligonucleotide prevented the facilitation of LTD by novel spatial learning, inhibited elevations of c-Fos triggered by LTD and impaired spatial learning. The expression of the transcription factor zif268 was unaffected by the c-fos antisense oligonucleotide. Learning-facilitated LTD was prevented by a transcription inhibitor. These data support that learning-facilitated LTD requires elevations in c-Fos and is transcription dependent. The observation that LTD shares key regulatory mechanisms with learning and memory processes argues strongly for a role for this form of synaptic plasticity in long-term information storage in the hippocampus.",
