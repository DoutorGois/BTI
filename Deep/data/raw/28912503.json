     "AB": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common chronic neurological disease in humans. A number of studies have demonstrated differential expression of miRNAs in the hippocampus of humans with TLE and in animal models of experimental epilepsy. However, the dissimilarities in experimental design have led to largely discordant results across these studies. Thus, a comprehensive comparison is required in order to better characterize miRNA profiles obtained in various post-status epilepticus (SE) models. We therefore created a database and performed a meta-analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs across 3 post-SE models of epileptogenesis (electrical stimulation, pilocarpine and kainic acid) and human TLE with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS). The database includes data from 11 animal post-SE studies and 3 human TLE-HS studies. A total of 378 differentially expressed miRNAs were collected (274 up-regulated and 198 down-regulated) and analyzed with respect to the post-SE model, time point and animal species. We applied the novel robust rank aggregation method to identify consistently differentially expressed miRNAs across the profiles. It highlighted common and unique miRNAs at different stages of epileptogenesis. The pathway analysis revealed involvement of these miRNAs in key pathogenic pathways underlying epileptogenesis, including inflammation, gliosis and deregulation of the extracellular matrix.",
