     "AB": "In the present study, we examined the effect of cycloheximide on various pharmacological responses induced by kainic acid (KA) administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) in mice. In a passive avoidance test, a 20-min cycloheximide (200mg/kg, i.p.) pretreatment prevented the memory impairment induced by KA. The morphological damage induced by KA (0.1microg) in the hippocampus was markedly concentrated in the CA3 pyramidal neurons and cycloheximide effectively prevented the KA-induced pyramidal cell death in CA3 hippocampal region. In immunohistochemical study, KA dramatically increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (p-ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (p-JNK1), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (p-CaMK II). Cycloheximide attenuated the increased p-ERK, p-JNK1, and p-CaMK II levels induced by KA. Furthermore, cycloheximide inhibited the increased c-Fos and c-Jun protein expression levels induced by KA in the hippocampus. The activation of microglia was detected in KA-induced CA3 cell death region by immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody against the OX-42. Cycloheximide inhibited KA-induced increase of OX-42 immunoreactivity. Our results suggest that the increased expression of the c-Fos, c-Jun, and phosphorylation of ERK, JNK1, and CaMK II proteins may play important roles in the memory impairment and the cell death in CA3 region of the hippocampus induced by i.c.v. KA administration in mice. Furthermore, the activated microglia may be related to phagocytosis of degenerated neuronal elements induced by KA.",
