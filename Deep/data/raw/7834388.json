     "AB": "To study the mechanisms underlying cholinotoxic brain damage, we examined ethylcholine aziridinium (AF64A) effects on cholinesterase genes. In vitro, AF64A hardly affected cholinesterase activities yet inhibited transcription of the G,C-rich AChE DNA encoding acetylcholinesterase (AChE) more than the A,T-rich butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) DNA. In vivo, intracerebroventricular injection of 2 nmol of AF64A decreased AChE mRNA in striatum and septum by 3- and 25-fold by day 7, with no change in BChE mRNA or AChE activity. In contrast, hippocampal AChE mRNA increased 10-fold by day 7 and BChE mRNA and AChE activity decreased 2-fold. By day 60 post-treatment, both AChE mRNA and AChE levels returned to normal in all regions except hippocampus, where AChE activity and BChE mRNA were decreased by 2-fold. Moreover, differential PCR displays revealed persistent induction, specific to the hippocampus of treated rats, of several unidentified G,C-rich transcripts, suggesting particular responsiveness of hippocampal G,C-rich genes to cholinotoxicity.",
