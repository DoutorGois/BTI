     "AB": "4 to 5 days after injection of [3H] proline into the medial entorhinal cortex of adult male rats, a sufficient labelling of the contralateral FD appeared. The radioactive labelling was spread over the mid-third of FD molecular layer as well the ventral as dorsal leaves. A proximo-distal gradient of grain density has not been observed. The topographic projection of these crossing afferences to the contralateral FD were considerably restricted when related to the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, than the afferences to the ipsilateral FD. The present findings support the results of other workers and yield further evidence in this field.",
