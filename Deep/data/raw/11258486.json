     "AB": "To dissect the effects of corticosteroids mediated by the mineralocorticoid (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the central nervous system, we compared MR-/- mice, whose salt loss syndrome was corrected by exogenous NaCI administration, with GR-/- mice having a brain-specific disruption of the GR gene generated by the Cre/loxP-recombination system. Neuropathological analyses revealed a decreased density of granule cells in the hippocampus of adult MR-/- mice but not in mice with disruption of GR. Furthermore, adult MR-/- mice exhibited a significant reduction of granule cell neurogenesis to 65% of control levels, possibly mediated by GR due to elevated corticosterone plasma levels. Neurogenesis was unaltered in adult mice with disruption of GR. Thus, we could attribute long-term trophic effects of adrenal steroids on dentate granule cells to MR. These MR-related alterations may participate in the pathogenesis of hippocampal changes observed in ageing, chronic stress and affective disorders.",
