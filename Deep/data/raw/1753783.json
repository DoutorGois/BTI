     "AB": "In the cobalt focus experimental epilepsy model, severe hippocampal neuron damage occurs with marked EEG changes. The effects of TJ-960, a herbal medicine formulation, were studied on neuron damage in the CA1 area of rat hippocampus. Continuous oral administration of TJ-960 from one month prior to the cobalt application showed almost complete protection against hippocampal neuron damage induced by cobalt application to the cerebral cortex. TJ-960 also completely inhibited the EEG changes as well as the brain edema induced by cobalt application.",
