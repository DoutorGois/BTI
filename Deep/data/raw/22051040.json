     "AB": "Changes in the expression of estrogen-related substances in monkeys' brains at the menopausal transition, when estrogen deficit starts to occur, have not yet been examined thoroughly. In the present study, we immunohistochemically investigated the expression levels of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) and aromatase (local estrogen synthesizing enzyme) in the hippocampal formation of premenopausal, menopausal, and ovariectomized premenopausal monkeys. In all monkeys tested, ERbeta immunoreactivity was observed in interneurons located in the subiculum and the Ammon's horn, and most of these ERbeta-immunoreactive neurons coexpressed a GABAergic neuron marker, parvalbumin. In the menopausal monkeys who exhibited a decline in estrogen concentration, hippocampal ERbeta was highly upregulated, while aromatase expression was not markedly changed. By contrast, aromatase in the ovariectomized monkeys was significantly upregulated, while ERbeta expression was not changed. In the brains of ovariectomized and menopausal monkeys, depletion of ovary-derived estrogen brought about different reactions which may be attributed to the senescence of brain aging.",
