     "AB": "Substantial evidence has accumulated for the existence in brain of steroid synthetic mechanisms similar to, but independent from those present in peripheral tissues. Recent findings suggest that many of the enzymes necessary for steroidogenesis occur in brain neurons and glia, and now a broader distribution of that enzymatic machinery has been identified, providing evidence for local, paracrine actions of brain-derived steroids in the neuroendocrine hypothalamus.",
