     "AB": "We have previously demonstrated that hippocampal integrin-associated protein (IAP) gene expression is associated with memory formation in a one-way inhibitory avoidance learning in rats. In the present study, we further investigated the role and mechanism of IAP involved in memory consolidation in rats. Because of the minute amount of IAP present in the brain, we have adopted the quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Our results revealed that hippocampal IAP mRNA expression is approximately fourfold higher in rats showing good memory retention (GM, retention score of 600 s) at 3 h, but not at other time points, after training when compared with the poor memory rats (retention score < 80 s). On the other hand, integrin alphav mRNA level was markedly increased ( approximately twofold), while integrin beta3 mRNA level was decreased ( approximately 50%) at 1 h post-training. Further, separate sets of RT-PCR analysis revealed that IAP5 and IAP6 mRNA expressions, but not that of IAP7, were markedly increased in GM rats 3 h post-training. Moreover, regional distribution studies revealed that different isoforms of the IAP gene are similarly distributed in different brain areas, while IAP7 has been the predominant form present in astrocyte cells. These results together suggest that IAP mRNA expression is indeed induced upon training, rather than that the GM rats have constitutively higher levels of IAP. The unparallel change of IAP and integrin mRNA expressions as far as time-course is concerned suggests that they are possibly involved in different forms and stages of memory processing. Further, IAP5 and IAP6 are more closely associated with memory consolidation, while IAP7 may constitute the major isotype for signal transduction in astrocyte cells.",
