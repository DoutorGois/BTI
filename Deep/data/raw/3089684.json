     "AB": "Classification and recall of pictures of familiar objects were studied in 21 normal control subjects and 75 patients with unilateral cerebral excisions. The patients with frontal-lobe excisions were impaired at categorizing the pictures and at recalling the objects depicted. Left and right temporal-lobe groups performed the sorting task normally, but the left temporal-lobe groups were impaired at recalling picture names. The right temporal-lobe groups were unimpaired. A negative correlation between the number of items uncategorized and the number recalled was found in the right frontal-lobe group but not in the left, who were impaired also at recalling the items that they had classified correctly. It is concluded that impaired categorization played a major role in determining the recall deficits in the right frontal-lobe group but not in the left, whose impaired recall may also be due to defective retrieval. The poor recall of the left temporal-lobe groups is thought instead to depend on abnormally rapid forgetting.",
