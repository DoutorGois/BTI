     "AB": "It is increasingly evident that neurotransmitter receptors, including ionotropic GABA A receptors (GABAAR), exhibit highly dynamic trafficking and cell surface mobility(1-7). To study receptor cell surface localization and endocytosis, the technique described here combines the use of fluorescent alpha-bungarotoxin with cells expressing constructs containing an alpha-bungarotoxin (Bgt) binding site (BBS). The BBS (WRYYESSLEPYPD) is based on the alpha subunit of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which binds Bgt with high affinity(8,9). Incorporation of the BBS site allows surface localization and measurements of receptor insertion or removal with application of exogenous fluorescent Bgt, as previously described in the tracking of GABAA and metabotropic GABAB receptors(2,10). In addition to the BBS site, we inserted a pH-sensitive GFP (pHGFP(11)) between amino acids 4 and 5 of the mature GABAAR subunit by standard molecular biology and PCR cloning strategies (see Figure 1)(12). The BBS is 3' of the pH-sensitive GFP reporter, separated by a 13-amino acid alanine/proline linker. For trafficking studies described in this publication that are based on fixed samples, the pHGFP serves as a reporter of total tagged GABAAR subunit protein levels, allowing normalization of the Bgt labeled receptor population to total receptor population. This minimizes cell to cell Bgt staining signal variability resulting from higher or lower baseline expression of the tagged GABAAR subunits. Furthermore the pHGFP tag enables easy identification of construct expressing cells for live or fixed imaging experiments.",
