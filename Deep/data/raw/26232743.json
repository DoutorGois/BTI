     "AB": "Recently, the amnesic case D.A. was shown to circumvent his relational memory impairments, as observed in the transverse patterning (TP) task, using a self-generated unitization strategy, and such performance benefits were maintained over extended delays (Ryan et al., 2013). \"Unitization\" encourages fusing of distinct items, through an action, into a single unit from which the relations among the items may then be derived. Here, we provide the first documentation of the developmental amnesic case, N.C., who presents with relatively circumscribed lesions to the extended hippocampal system, and with impaired episodic memory. Despite impairments on standard versions of TP, N.C. benefited from unitization, showed evidence of transfer to novel stimuli, and maintained his performance over extended delays. These findings suggest that self-generation is not a requirement for the successful implementation of unitization, and further provides the first evidence of rapid transfer and long-lasting success of a learning strategy in a human amnesic case.",
