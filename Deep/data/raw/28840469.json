     "AB": "Mounting evidence suggests that prolonged exposure to general anesthesia (GA) during brain synaptogenesis damages the immature neurons and results in long-term neurocognitive impairments. Importantly, synaptogenesis relies on timely axon pruning to select axons that participate in active neural circuit formation. This process is in part dependent on proper homeostasis of neurotrophic factors, in particular brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We set out to examine how GA may modulate axon maintenance and pruning and focused on the role of BDNF. We exposed post-natal day (PND)7 mice to ketamine using a well-established dosing regimen known to induce significant developmental neurotoxicity. We performed morphometric analyses of the infrapyramidal bundle (IPB) since IPB is known to undergo intense developmental modeling and as such is commonly used as a well-established model of in vivo pruning in rodents. When IPB remodeling was followed from PND10 until PND65, we noted a delay in axonal pruning in ketamine-treated animals when compared to controls; this impairment coincided with ketamine-induced downregulation in BDNF protein expression and maturation suggesting two conclusions: a surge in BDNF protein expression \"signals\" intense IPB pruning in control animals and ketamine-induced downregulation of BDNF synthesis and maturation could contribute to impaired IPB pruning. We conclude that the combined effects on BDNF homeostasis and impaired axon pruning may in part explain ketamine-induced impairment of neuronal circuitry formation.",
