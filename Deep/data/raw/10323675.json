     "AB": "A comparison of the interaction of 3beta, 5alpha-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (TDOC) on voltage-gated Ca2+ -and the gamma-aminobutyric receptor (GABA(A)) gated-Cl- -channels was examined in freshly dissociated guinea-pig (GP) and rat hippocampal CA1 neurons and rat hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (VMN) neurons. The steady-state inhibition of the peak Ca2+ channel current evoked by depolarized steps from -80 to -10 mV by TDOC increased in concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 1 and 6 pM for rat and GP CA1 neurons, respectively and 3 nM for rat VMN neurons. TDOC rapidly and reversibly inhibited a fraction (up to 26%) of the total Ca2+ channel current in all neurons. Intracellular dialysis with GDP-beta-S (500 microM) significantly diminished the TDOC inhibition of the Ca2+ channel current, suggesting a G-protein involvement. In neurons isolated from pertussis-toxin-treated animals by chronic intracerebroventricular (1000 ng/24/48 h) infusion, the TDOC inhibition was also significantly diminished, suggesting modulation by the Galphai and/or Galphao G-protein subunits. The peak GABA-gated inward Cl- current was enhanced in both species from 0.1 to 10 microM with the greatest increase (48% at 10 microM) seen in the VMN. There was no difference in the enhancement of the GABA current in the CA1 region of both species. The results show that in contrast to the 3a-series, the 3beta-series weakly enhance the GABA-evoked Cl- current but potently inhibit the Ca2+ channel current. In addition, these results also suggest a common mode of action and a lack of interspecies difference for this steroid.",
