     "AB": "Although the cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unknown, nerve growth factor (NGF) has gained attention as a therapeutic agent for the disease. Because NGF maintains the magnocellular cholinergic neurons that are damaged in AD, research interests have been focused on the change in NGF level in patients with AD. This is the first reported study in which human NGF levels were accurately measured and compared between normal and AD samples. We measured NGF levels using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) system for human NGF and found no difference in NGF level in serum, brain-spinal fluid, or brain (hippocampus and parietal cortex) obtained from normal people and patients with AD. These results suggest that a decrease in the NGF level is not a causative factor of AD.",
