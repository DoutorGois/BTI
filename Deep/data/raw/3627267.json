     "AB": "Glial cells in the central nervous systems (CNS) have complex functions which are difficult to decipher because of the intimate intertwining of glial cells with neurons. We have therefore developed an essentially neuron-free preparation of CNS astrocytes in the kainic acid lesioned hippocampal slice. With this preparation we have examined the effect of activating protein kinase C in astrocytes with a phorbol ester, TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate). In most cells, TPA induced rhythmic oscillations (0.1-3.0 Hz) of membrane potential which were typically 5-10 mV in amplitude and were associated with increases of up to eightfold in input resistance during the depolarizing phase. These large changes in membrane conductance are the first reported observations of endogenously generated conductance changes in astrocytes of the mammalian CNS and they could influence excitability of surrounding neurons, possibly by altering extracellular ion concentrations.",
