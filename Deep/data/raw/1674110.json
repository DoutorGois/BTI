     "AB": "The distributions of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor and its subtypes (alpha 1A and alpha 1B) in human and rat hippocampus are analysed by quantitative receptor autoradiography. alpha 1-Adrenoceptors are labelled by [3H]prazosin. The alpha 1A subtype is visualized by [3H]prazosin after irreversible blockade of alpha 1B adrenoceptors with chloroethylclonidine or directly by [3H]5-methyl-urapidil. The alpha 1B subtype is investigated by [3H]prazosin binding in the presence of the alpha 1A antagonist 5-methyl-urapidil. Considerable differences in the regional and laminar patterns of alpha 1-adrenoceptors are found between rat and human hippocampi. The rat hippocampus is characterized by a low overall density and a rather homogeneous regional and laminar distribution. This is in contrast to the human pattern, which shows a much higher overall level of alpha 1 receptor density and a restriction of alpha 1 receptors to the CA3 region of Ammon's horn and the dentate gyrus. Moreover, alpha 1A and alpha 1B receptors of the human hippocampus are differentially distributed with the alpha 1A subtype concentrated in the hilus and lucidum layer of CA3, and the alpha 1B subtype concentrated in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Additionally, the distribution of alpha 1 receptors is compared with the distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptors. The subtype specific pattern is correlated with the distribution of glutamatergic systems in the human (but not in the rat) hippocampus. alpha 1A Receptor localization coincides with the target area of the mossy fibre system, and alpha 1B receptors are preferentially localized in the target area of the hippocampal associational fibres and partly of the perforant pathway. This result points to possible interactions between noradrenaline- and glutamate-mediated neurotransmission differentiated by topographically segregated alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes.",
