     "AB": "The temporal course of cerebral cytokine gene expression was investigated in the ME7/CV murine scrapie model to determine any association with neuropathological events. Analysis by RNase protection assay (RPA) demonstrated no transcripts for ILs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12p40 and 13, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IFN-gamma or lymphotoxin-alpha at any time during the course of this disease. Transcripts for transforming growth factor-beta 1 were constitutively expressed in both control and scrapie-infected brain and were elevated at terminal disease. RPA and quantitative real-time RT-PCR detected low levels of transcripts for IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and TNF alpha in scrapie-infected brain but only IL-1 beta was elevated consistently in all mice studied. Although glial cell activation within the hippocampus was evident from 100 days post-infection (p.i.), elevated IL-1 beta transcripts (and immunoreactivity) were evident from 180 days p.i., around the time of hippocampal pyramidal neuron loss, and increased steadily thereafter to reach a 3.5-fold increase at terminal disease. Even at their maximum, levels of these transcripts were disproportionately low relative to the degree of glial cell activation. It is concluded that cytokine gene expression in the ME7 scrapie-infected mouse brain, relative to the degree of reactive gliosis, is highly restricted, temporally late and disproportionately low.",
