     "AB": "We aimed to investigate if trajectory components (baseline level, slope, and variability) of peripheral interleukin-6 (IL-6) over time were related to cognitive impairment and smaller hippocampal volume and if hippocampal volume explained the associations between IL-6 and cognitive impairment. Multivariable regression models were used to test the association between IL-6 trajectory components with change in neuroimaging measures of the hippocampus and with cognitive impairment among 135 older adults (70-79 years at baseline) from the Healthy Brain Project over 14 years. IL-6 variability was positively associated with cognitive impairment (odds ratio [OR] = 5.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24, 27.61) and with greater decrease per year of gray matter volume of the hippocampus (beta = -0.008, standard error = 0.004, p = 0.03). After adjustment for hippocampal volume, the OR of cognitive impairment decreased for each unit of IL-6 variability and CIs widened (OR = 4.36, 95% CI: 0.67, 28.29). Neither baseline levels nor slopes of IL-6 were related to cognitive impairment or hippocampal volume. We believe this has potential clinical and public health implications by suggesting adults with stable levels of peripheral IL-6 may be better targets for intervention studies for slowing or preventing cognitive decline.",
