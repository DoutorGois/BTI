     "AB": "Gabapentin is currently used as a therapeutic agent against epilepsy as well as neuropathic pain. In contrast to gabapentin, its derivative gabapentin-lactam has a pronounced neuroprotective activity. We have studied in cultured hippocampal neurons whether gabapentin-lactam has also neurotrophic effects. Gabapentin-lactam enhanced the formation of dendritic filopodia, which are necessary for synapse formation. It also induced a network of F-actin-containing neurites. In studies with time lapse microscopy, gabapentin-lactam increased the addition but also the elimination of new branches. Affinity precipitation assays showed that gabapentin-lactam increased the GTP binding of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42, which facilitate branch addition. Gabapentin-lactam also activated RhoA and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases. In neurons transfected with dominant-negative RhoA or treated with the RhoA-inactivating C3 toxin, gabapentin-lactam increased the number of dendrites and branches. In the presence of Y-27632, which inhibits Rho kinase, newly added branches induced by gabapentin-lactam were no longer eliminated so that gabapentin-lactam increased the number of branches. Y-27632 [(+)-(R)-trans-4-(1-aminoethyl)-N-(4-pyridyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide] also prevented the gabapentin-lactam induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 [2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride] reduced the elimination of newly added branches caused by gabapentin-lactam and thus facilitated branch formation. In contrast to gabapentin-lactam, gabapentin had no effect on dendritic filopodia or motility. The effects exerted by gabapentin-lactam on dendritic arborization may be of potential therapeutic interest.",
