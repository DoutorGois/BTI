The organization of these explants was studied by immunocytochemical labeling of calbindin-D 28K (CaBP 28K). The development of the CaBP 28K staining was very close to that of the rat hippocampus in vivo with only 3 subpopulations of labeled cells: granule cells and their mossy fibers, pyramidal cells in the subiculum-CA1 zone and interneurons scattered in strata oriens and radiatum.",
