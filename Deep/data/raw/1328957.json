     "AB": "Previous studies have shown that most neuronal ATP is produced by oxidative metabolism, and consumed by Na+,K(+)-ATPase. We hypothesized that the distribution of Na+,K(+)-ATPase in brain would correlate with that of the energy-producing enzyme, cytochrome oxidase (CO). We localized these enzymes in monkey hippocampus and striate cortex by histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. Their distributions were generally similar, although some differences were observed. We also studied regulation of enzyme levels, using monocular impulse blockage with tetrodotoxin (TTX) to alter neuronal activity in the visual system. Parallel changes in CO and Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity were induced in striate cortex. These results provide further evidence that neuronal energy demands regulate CO levels and distribution.",
