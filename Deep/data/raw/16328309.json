     "AB": "Using magnetic resonance imaging techniques, we examined the time course of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2, and T2* relaxation times in 1-year-old rats after different forms of cerebral oligemia had been induced by (1) transient systemic hypotension, (2) permanent bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO), and (3) combined hypotension and BCCAO over a time period of 14 days after the oligemic event. These groups were compared with a group of sham-operated adult rats (controls, 4) to rule out a drift of the parameters over time. The animals were examined in a 2.35 T scanner. ADC, T2, and T2* were measured in both hemispheres of rat parietotemporal cerebral cortex, thalamic nuclei, and hippocampus 1 day before as well as on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 after sham operation and in different models of oligemia, respectively. Hypotension alone had no significant effect on MRI parameters in rat brain. After BCCAO, an increase in T2* was observed. If a permanent BCCAO was combined with transient hypotension, however, 84% of 1-year-old animals died within 14 days after surgery. In the surviving animals, significant changes in ADC, T2, and T2* were observed in the hippocampus and parietotemporal cerebral cortex. ADC showed a decrease on day 1 after oligemia, and an increase on days 3, 7, and 14. The T2* and T2 values were markedly increased on days 7 and 14 after surgery. In conclusion, only severe oligemia combining BCCAO and hypotension induces significant changes in tissue integrity (as shown by ADC) and in blood oxygenation levels in the subchronic period, whereas no significant changes were detected if permanent BCCAO or transient hypotension was applied separately.",
