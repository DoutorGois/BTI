     "AB": "Current models of brain function hold that learning corresponds to changes in the efficacy of single synapses. The study of learning and of a variety of forms of synaptic plasticity has revealed that both have at least two phases: an early phase that is not dependent on protein synthesis and a late phase that depends on new transcription and translation. Our laboratory has examined synaptic plasticity in Aplysia and in mice to better understand the regulatory events that lead to the induction of the late, protein synthesis-dependent phase of synaptic plasticity. Our recent studies of Aplysia have revealed that the genes that control the late phase of synaptic facilitation are controlled by both an activator, ApCREB1, and a repressor, ApCREB2. This leads to a model in which the late phase of synaptic facilitation is initiated by a perturbation of the balance between activators and repressors of transcription; this perturbation can be accomplished by regulating the activator, the repressor, or both. We, and others, have shown that this transcriptional switch is conserved, at least in part, in the regulation of synaptic plasticity in mice: CREB is implicated in activation of genes required for LTP, a model for synaptic plasticity in the mammalian hippocampus. We speculate that a similar balance between activators and repressors may regulate the genes required for long-term memory in mammals.",
