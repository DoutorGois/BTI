     "AB": "The effects of a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, Kami-Untan-To (KUT), on brain choline (Ch) and Acetylcholine (ACh) levels in aged mice were examined. Further, the expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the medial septum (MS), the vertical limbs of the diagonal band of Broca (VDB), and the nucleus basalis Meynert (NBM) was examined by immunohistochemistry. Following an oral administration of KUT to the aged mice for 3 months, ACh levels in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus were increased significantly. The density of ChAT-immunoreactive cells located in MS, VDB, and NBM in the KUT-treated group was increased significantly as compared to the non-treatment group. The survival rate of aged mice was significantly higher in the KUT-treated group as compared to that in the nontreated group. Our results suggest that KUT potentiates the brain acetylcholinergic system, and may become a possible anti-dementia drug.",
