     "AB": "The study was conducted to test whether CLIP [ACTH(18-39)] influences the neuronal transmission and the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. The population spike was recorded in the hippocampal CA1 region of freely moving rats before and after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of CLIP in comparison to ACTH and saline (controls). After infusion of CLIP, the population spike amplitude (PSA) rose to about 200% of baseline values. After reaching this level, it was impossible to induce a further increase of PSA by tetanization. However, if the stimulus intensity was reduced to a new baseline level, electrically induced LTP could be observed. There were no significant changes after infusion of ACTH. Our results indicate that the ICV administration of CLIP leads to an enhancement of excitability in the hippocampal CA1 region, which might be independent of LTP.",
