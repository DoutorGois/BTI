     "AB": "By connecting the fascia dentata with the hippocampus proper, the axons of the granule cells, the mossy fibers, represent an important element of the main excitatory, trisynaptic pathway of the hippocampal formation. In this review the various synaptic connections of the mossy fibers are discussed. It turns out that the mossy fibers do not only establish synapses with the pyramidal neurons of regio inferior as traditionally assumed, but a variety of local circuit neurons as well as projection cells are also contacted by the mossy fibers. Thus there is an underestimated divergence of the impulse flow within the \"trisynaptic\" pathway at the level of the mossy fibers. Similarly, the pattern of afferent input to the granule cells, especially that of GABAergic neurons, is more complex than previously assumed. In this respect the concept of a unidirectional \"trisynaptic\" pathway certainly is an oversimplification. In particular, the hilus of the fascia dentata, that the mossy fibers traverse on their way to regio inferior, is often neglected in this concept. The hilar region comprises a large variety of morphologically and functionally distinct neuronal types that, to a large extent, are targets of hilar mossy fiber collaterals. By focusing on the mossy fiber system, an attempt is made in this review to summarize new data on hippocampal circuitries that have been accumulated since the original description of the trisynaptic pathway. This concept, which originally comprised the synapses of the perforant path fibers on dentate granule cells, the mossy fiber synapses on CA3 pyramidal neurons, and the synapses of the Schaffer collaterals on CA1 pyramidal cells, has been of great heuristic value but needs to be modified in view of recent morphological and physiological data.",
