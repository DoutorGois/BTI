     "AB": "To figure out hippocampal anatomy features, which can be used as reference in determination of hippocampus-related disease, we rebuilt 3-dimensional brain models with magnetic resonance imaging; then, we chose 1 coronal section of the hippocampus and took 22 linear measurements of each section in 74 healthy adults. In each section, we took paired sample T test for the left and right measurements comparison, independent sample T test for sex difference comparison, and correlation analysis for relationships between age and other measurements. For the left and right comparison, 9 measurements have no significant difference (P > 0.05). For sex difference, 8 measurements have significant differences (P < 0.05). In age linear regression analysis, 5 measurements have significance in statistical analysis. All results above demonstrate that measurements of this section have little significance in L/R difference, but for different sexes, these measurements show significant results, which means male and female were different. As for age linear regression analysis, brain shape and distances were age related. This study provides reference for diagnosis of hippocampal atrophy, and it is an easy approach instead of areal and volumetric measurements in clinical practice.",
