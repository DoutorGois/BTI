     "AB": "In rats with electrodes implanted in the hippocampus or amygdala, the effect was studied of a single episode of low frequency stimulation (125 msec, biphasic 4 Hz, for 1 min at a current 50% of threshold for after-discharge), LFS, on the after-discharge thresholds (ADTs) during the course of hippocampal and amygdaloid kindling. ADTs were significantly increased following the LFS. The effect lasted longer (hippocampus, 12 days; amygdala, 5 days) when the LFS was given on day 1 of kindling than when kindling was fully established (less than 24 h).",
