     "AB": "Cocaine (1-5 mg/kg, IV) shortened the duration of loss of righting reflex produced in pentobarbital-narcotized rabbits. This effect was completely blocked by scopolamine (1 mg/kg, IV), but not by scopolamine methylbromide, suggesting that a central cholinergic mechanism was involved. In urethane-anesthetized rats cocaine (1 mg/kg, IV) consistently generated hippocampal EEG theta rhythm lasting about 40 min. This effect was also abolished by scopolamine. These results suggest that cocaine produced behavioral and EEG arousal responses that involved the septohippocampal cholinergic system.",
