     "AB": "Here, we report features of a novel transcription factor zfh-5, which we isolated from the mouse brain; in addition to the mRNA, the antisense strand of zfh-5 is also expressed in the developing brain, in a manner complementary to the expression of zfh-5 mRNA. Although most neurons express zfh-5 mRNA soon after their final mitosis, several types of neurons, such as the pyramidal and granule cells in the hippocampus, express the zfh-5 antisense RNA prior to the mRNA expression. Using gene-targeting approach, we showed that this antisense RNA has a negative regulatory role on the expression of zfh-5 mRNA. These observations suggest that, in specific types of neurons, the expression of zfh-5 is additionally regulated by a mechanism depending on this antisense RNA.",
