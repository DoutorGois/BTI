     "AB": "We investigated the effect of low dose radiation on diabetes induced suppression of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of rat. After 0.01 Gy, 0.1 Gy, 1 Gy and 10 Gy radiation was delivered, the dentate gyrus of hippocampus of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were evaluated using immunohistochemistry for 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), caspase-3, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining. The number of BrdU positive cells in the non-diabetic rats, diabetic rats without radiation, diabetic rats with 0.01 Gy radiation, diabetic rats with 0.1 Gy radiation, diabetic rats with 1 Gy radiation and diabetic rats with 10 Gy radiation were 55.4+/-8.5/mm2, 33.3+/-6.4/mm2, 67.7+/-10.5/mm2, 66.6+/-10.0/mm2, 23.5+/-6.3/mm2 and 14.3+/-7.2/mm2, respectively. The number of caspase-3 positive cells was 132.6+/-37.4/mm2, 378.6+/-99.1/mm2, 15.0+/-2.8/mm2, 57.1+/-16.9/mm2, 191.8+/-44.8/mm2 and 450.4+/-58.3/mm2, respectively. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was 24.5+/-2.0/mm2, 21.7+/-4.0/mm2, 20.4+/-2.0/mm2, 18.96+/-2.1/mm2, 58.3+/-7.9/mm2, and 106.0+/-9.8/mm2, respectively. These results suggest low doses of radiation paradoxically improved diabetes induced neuronal cell suppression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of rat.",
