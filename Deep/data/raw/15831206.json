     "AB": "We have evaluated the inhibitory activity of flavone, nobiletin, and heptamethoxyflavone on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in the rat. MMP in 9000-g supernatant fraction of lung homogenate was activated by p-aminophenyl mercuric acetate (APMA), and gelatinolytic activity was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by Coomassie staining. This activity should be related to MMP-2 and/or MMP-9 and was confirmed by gelatin zymography. Fluorescent-conjugated collagen used as a substrate for collagenolytic activity wasinvestigated by SDS-PAGE also. The film in-situ zymography method was applied to rat brain and lung tissue in the same manner. Flavone and nobiletin inhibited the APMA-stimulated gelatinolytic activity and also the collagenolytic activity by more than 75%. The film in-situ zymography method indicated that these compounds might be potent inhibitors of MMP, suggesting the specific inhibition of localized MMP in brain hippocampus and/or lung terminal bronchioles, which may contribute to the prevention of some types of brain disease or cancer invasion and metastasis.",
