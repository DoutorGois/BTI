     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to identify mechanisms that mediate the impairment of spatial memory induced by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a 5-HT1A/5-HT7 receptor agonist, in the eight-arm radial maze in rats. WAY-100635 and NAN-190, 5-HT1A receptor antagonists, reversed the impairment of spatial memory induced by systemic injection of 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg, i.p.). On the other hand, the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin and a selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB269970 had no effect on 8-OH-DPAT-induced impairment of spatial memory. Bilateral microinjection of 8-OH-DPAT (4 microg/side) impaired spatial memory when injected into the dorsal hippocampus (DH). Contrastingly, spatial memory was unaffected by microinjections of 8-OH-DPAT into the other six areas examined: ventral hippocampus (VH), central amygdaloid nucleus (ACE), lateral hypothalamus (LH), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and dorsal (DR) and median (MR) raphe nucleus. Furthermore, NAN-190 significantly reversed the impairment of spatial memory induced by intra-DH injection of 8-OH-DPAT. These findings suggest that 5-HT1A receptors in the DH play an important role in the mechanisms underlying the 8-OH-DPAT-induced impairment of spatial memory in rats.",
