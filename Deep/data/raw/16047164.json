     "AB": "Mutations in the DJ-1 gene have been identified to cause Parkinson's disease. In humans, nonmutated DJ-1 is expressed in specific brain areas but seems to be expressed by astrocytes rather than by neurons. In contrast, DJ-1 mRNA is mainly found in neurons in the mouse brain. We have investigated the distribution of DJ-1 protein in the mouse brain and found that DJ-1 protein is predominantly expressed by neurons but can also be detected in astrocytes. Consistent with a global role of DJ-1 in the brain, we found immunoreactivity, for example, in cortical areas, hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, zona incerta, and locus coeruleus. Within the substantia nigra, however, DJ-1 is localized in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells, suggesting a distinct role in this area.",
