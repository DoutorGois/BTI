     "AB": "We have previously shown that pharmacological blockade of the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) during the neonatal period in rats produces behavioral features of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we show that social interaction deficits in this model are reversed by the atypical antipsychotic clozapine given in the adulthood. In addition, we analyzed the mRNA expression of three neuronal receptors potentially involved in the etiology of disorders of the autism spectrum. Rats were injected with the GRPR antagonist RC-3095 or saline (SAL) from postnatal days 1-10, and tested for social behavior and recognition memory in the adulthood. One hour prior to the behavioral testing, rats were given a systemic injection of clozapine or saline. The mRNA expression of the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and GRPR was measured in the hippocampus and cortex of a separate set of rats given RC-3095 or SAL neonatally. Rats given neonatal RC-3095 showed decreased social interaction and impaired object recognition memory. Clozapine rescued the social interaction impairment. Neonatal treatment with RC-3095 also resulted in dose-dependent decreases in the expression of GRPR, NR1, and EGFR in the cortex, whereas all three receptor mRNAs were increased in the hippocampus in rats treated with the lower dose of RC-3095. The results contribute to further validate the novel rat model of neurodevelopmental disorders induced by GRPR blockade, and shows alterations in the expression of neuronal receptors in this model.",
