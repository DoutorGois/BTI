     "AB": "Recently, there have been a number of reports showing a long-term increased expression of fos-related antigens (fra), molecular weight of 35 kDa, after brain injury or chronic treatment of rats with various drugs. We report elevated basal levels of this transcription factor in the olfactory bulb relative to other brain regions. The expression of this protein is further enhanced in the olfactory bulb as long as 3 months after a single injection of kainate, an effect similar to that we previously observed in the hippocampus. The AP-1 DNA binding activity in olfactory bulb from kainate-treated rats contains fra and jun immunoreactivity suggesting that the 35 kDa fra dimerizes with jun protein, probably junD, to bind to AP-1 sites. Elevated basal levels of this transcription factor in the olfactory bulb appear to be related to the constant reinnervation and synaptogenesis which occurs in this brain region. The 35 kDa fra may be involved in long-term genomic program changes required to adapt to an altered biochemical environment.",
