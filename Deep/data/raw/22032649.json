     "AB": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the protective effects of 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (TSG) on learning and (or) memory deficit in aged rats, as well as to explore the possible connection between TSG and the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) pathway. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a young control group (age, 4 months), an aged control group (age, 22 months), and a TSG-treated group (age, 22 months). TSG at doses of 50 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) was intragastrically administered to 22-month-old rats for 4 weeks. The learning and (or) memory ability was measured using the Morris water maze (MWM) test, and the mRNA and protein expression of APP pathway proteins was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. The aged rats exhibited obvious learning and (or) memory deficit when compared with the young rats, but TSG treatment significantly improved the learning and (or) memory ability in the aged rats, as noted from the MWM test. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed an increase in the expression of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) in aged rats, and a decrease in ADAM10; however, TSG treatment significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression of ADAM10 (p < 0.01, compared with aged control rats). These results provide solid evidence for the therapeutic effect of TSG on age-related cognitive impairment, especially spatial learning and memory deficit. TSG might exert this effect through the APP pathway, although further studies on the topic are required.",
