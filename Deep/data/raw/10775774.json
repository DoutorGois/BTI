     "AB": "Embryonic rat hippocampal neurons were grown on patterned silane surface in order to organize synapse formations in a controlled manner. The surface patterns were composed of trimethoxysilylpropyl-diethylenetriamine (DETA) lines separated by tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl-1-dimethylchlorosilane (13F) spaces. Pre- and post-synaptic specializations were identified by immunostaining for synapsin I and microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2). Functional synaptic connections were examined by recording simultaneously from pairs of neurons using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Spontaneous and evoked synaptic currents were recorded in neurons cultured for 2-14 days. The formation of functional connections was accompanied by the appearance of spontaneous synaptic currents (SSCs), which could be detected after approximately 3 days in culture in the absence of evoked synaptic currents (ESCs). ESCs were detected only after approximately 7 days in culture, mostly in the form of unidirectional synaptic connections. Other forms of synaptic connectivity, such as bidirectional and autaptic connections, were also identified. Both transient GABAergic and glutamatergic signals mediated the transmissions between communicating cells. These results demonstrate the combination of various types of synaptic connections forming simple and complex networks in neurons cultured on line (DETA)-space (13F) patterns. Finally, precisely synchronized SSCs were recorded in neuron pairs cultured on pattern indicating the existence of a fast-acting feedback mechanism mediated by pre-synaptic GABA(A) receptors.",
