     "AB": "Vasopressin contents of posterior pituitaries and intra- and extrahypothalamic nuclei of brains from 3-month and 24-month-old Long-Evans rats and from Brattleboro rats heterozygous (HEDI) and homozygous (HODI) for diabetes insipidus were measured by radioimmunoassay. The pituitary content of vasopressin was highest in young rats and was significantly lower in HEDI tissue. The peptide was not detected in HODI pituitaries. In the brain regions studied both aged and HEDI rats showed reduced vasopressin contents as compared to young animals. In light of evidence of memory deficiencies in both HEDI and HODI rats, the possibility arises that memory decrements associated with senescence may be related to altered vasopressin synthesis and/or secretion occurring with aging of these neuronal systems.",
