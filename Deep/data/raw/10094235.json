     "AB": "Serotonin (5-HT) plays a central role in the neurochemistry of the learned helplessness animal model of depression. Using quantitative autoradiography, we measured the density of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and of 5-HT transport sites in medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, septum, hypothalamus, and amygdala in learned helpless rats, and in rats that were nonhelpless after inescapable stress, as well as in shuttlebox-tested and nonhandled controls. We found no changes in 5-HT1A receptor density among the groups in any region studied. In dorsal hippocampus, 5-HT2A receptor density was decreased in nonhelpless rats, while in amygdala 5-HT2A receptor density was decreased in both groups of stressed rats, whether helpless or nonhelpless. In the hypothalamus 5-HT2A receptor density, was decreased in helpless rats as compared to controls. In medial prefrontal cortex, the serotonin transport sites showed decreased density in helpless rats as compared to controls but not to nonhelpless rats. These findings further highlight the complexity of regional 5-HT effects in the learned helplessness animal model.",
