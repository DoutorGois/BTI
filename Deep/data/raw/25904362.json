     "AB": "Decreased expression of the GABA synthetic enzyme glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) in a subset of GABAergic neurons, including parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons, has been observed in postmortem brain studies of schizophrenics and in animal models of schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whether and how the perturbations of GAD67-mediated GABA synthesis and signaling contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. To address this issue, we generated the mice lacking GAD67 primarily in PV neurons and characterized them with focus on schizophrenia-related parameters. We found that heterozygous mutant mice exhibited schizophrenia-related behavioral abnormalities such as deficits in prepulse inhibition, MK-801 sensitivity, and social memory. Furthermore, we observed reduced inhibitory synaptic transmission, altered properties of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic responses in pyramidal neurons, and increased spine density in hippocampal CA1 apical dendrites, suggesting a possible link between GAD67 deficiency and disturbed glutamatergic excitatory synaptic functions in schizophrenia. Thus, our results indicate that the mice heterozygous for GAD67 deficiency primarily in PV neurons share several neurochemical and behavioral abnormalities with schizophrenia, offering a novel tool for addressing the underlying pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",
