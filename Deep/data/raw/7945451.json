     "AB": "The impact of tryptophan (TRP) pretreatment on the neurochemical effects of p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) was investigated. The neurotoxic effects of PCA on serotonin (5-HT) neurons, the acute effects of PCA on extracellular 5-HT and dopamine (DA), and the displacement by PCA of whole blood 5-HT were examined. TRP pretreatment (400 mg/kg of the methyl ester) significantly reduced the long-term (1 week) decrease in tissue 5-HT resulting from PCA (2 mg/kg, i.p., of the hydrochloride salt) in the prefrontal cortex and striatum, but not in the dorsal hippocampus. Microdialysis studies in awake animals showed that this pretreatment regimen resulted in augmented PCA-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT (4-fold) and DA (2-fold). TRP pretreatment also resulted in increased displacement of 5-HT from whole blood. The implications of these results toward possible mechanisms of action of PCA-induced neurotoxicity are discussed.",
