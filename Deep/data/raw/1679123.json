     "AB": "The aim of the present study was to analyze responses of nucleus accumbens neurons to stimulation of the fornix. The recorded neurons were labeled with biocytin and identified as medium spiny neurons. A large majority of cells generated a depolarizing postsynaptic potential in response to stimulation of the fornix. Using intracellular current injection, this depolarizing response was dissociated into an EPSP reversing at -6 +/- 6 mV and an IPSP reversing at -71 +/- 4 mV. Both the EPSP and IPSP were abolished by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione. In addition, the IPSP was blocked by bicuculline and picrotoxin. The onset latency of the EPSP was constant in spite of varying stimulus intensities. In contrast, the onset latency of the IPSP increased with decreasing stimulus intensity. Notably, the stimulus threshold for evoking IPSPs was generally lower than for EPSPs. At stimulus intensities well above threshold, the IPSP onset was only slightly delayed with respect to the EPSP onset. These results indicate that the EPSP can be characterized as a monosynaptic and glutamate-mediated synaptic response. The IPSP, however, appears to be mediated by a disynaptic feed-forward pathway involving both glutamate and GABAA receptors. Recurrent and lateral inhibitory interactions have previously been proposed to be predominant organizational principles in the caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens. This study indicates that feed-forward inhibition is an additional principle governing the activities of striatal neural networks.",
