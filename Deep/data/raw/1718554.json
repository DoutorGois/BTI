The PTPPase activity was found in almost all layers of the hippocampal formation, with a high activity in the stratum moleculare. The activity was inhibited by vanadate and molybdate, but not by NaF and Zn2+. The activity was localized in the dendritic cytoplasm, particularly on the postsynaptic density, of hippocampal neurons.",
