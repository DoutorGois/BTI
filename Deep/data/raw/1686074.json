     "AB": "The levels of preproneuropeptide Y (ppNPY) mRNA and preprosomatostatin (ppSOM) mRNA were analyzed in different brain regions during the development of hippocampal kindling in rats. ppNPY mRNA levels were markedly elevated in the dorsal hippocampus bilaterally, two days after stage 2 (preconvulsive stage) and stage 5 (full seizure expression). The contents of ppSOM mRNA were slightly, although not significantly, increased in the dorsal hippocampus at stage 2 whereas a significant increase was observed in the ipsilateral hippocampus of fully kindled rats. ppNPY and ppSOM mRNA levels were unchanged in the cortex and striatum at both stages of kindling. These results show that an increased synthesis of somatostatin and neuropeptide Y, with a greater effect for the latter, occurs during hippocampal kindling in rats. The relative role of the two peptides in the development and expression of kindling phenomenon remains to be elucidated.",
