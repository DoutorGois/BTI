     "AB": "Although synaptic transmission was assumed to use the same mechanisms in the case of different synapses of the central and peripheral nervous system, recent research revealed a great variety of different processes. Time might be a crucial factor to be considered in this diversity. It is recalled that the speed of a chemical reaction is inversely related to affinity. \"Time is gained at the expense of sensitivity\" as noticed by Bernard Katz (1989). Therefore, synaptic transmission will occur at a high speed only if it is supported by low affinity reactions. In the present work, we compare two examples of ultra-rapid transmission (the Torpedo nerve electroplaque synapse and the rat hippocampus mossy fiber/CA3 synapses), with a cholinergic process operating with high affinity but at a low speed: the release of glutamate elicited by nicotine from mossy fibers of the rat hippocampus.",
