     "AB": "1. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were used to study paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) of the lateral perforant path input to the dentate gyrus in thin hippocampal slices. 2. Orthodromic stimulation of the lateral perforant pathway evoked a excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) with a latency of 3.3 +/- 0.1 ms (mean +/- SE) that fluctuated in amplitude. The EPSC had a rise time (10-90%) of 2.79 +/- 0.06 ms (n = 35) and decayed with a single exponential time course with a time-constant of 9.14 +/- 0.24 ms (n = 35). No correlation was found between the amplitude of the EPSC and the rise time or decay time-constant. The non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione completely blocked the EPSC whereas the NMDA antagonist D-aminophosphonovaleric acid (APV) had modest effects. 3. When a test (T-)EPSC was preceded at an interval of 100 ms by a conditioning (C-)EPSC, a significant increase in the amplitude of the T-EPSC was seen in 38 out of 44 trials analyzed from a total of 27 granule cells. The average amount of PPF was 35.7 +/- 2.1%. There was no apparent correlation between the amount of PPF and the stimulation intensity or mean amplitude of the C-EPSC. The time course of the facilitated T-EPSC was not significantly different from that of the C-EPSC. 4. No correlation was found between the amplitude of the C-EPSC and that of the T-EPSC. Estimates of quantal content (mcv) were determined by calculating the ratio of the squared averaged EPSC amplitude (from 48 responses) to the variance of these responses (M2/sigma 2) whereas quantal amplitudes (qcv) were estimated by calculating the ratio of the response variance to average EPSC amplitude (sigma 2/M). PPF was found to be associated with an average increase in mcv of 64.8 +/- 7.2% (n = 38) whereas qcv was decreased by 12.1 +/- 3.8%. 5. The time course of PPF was studied by varying the interval between the C- and T-pulse from 10 to 400 ms while keeping the stimulation intensity constant. Maximal facilitation of the T-EPSC was obtained with interpulse intervals < or = 25 ms where the average facilitation amounted to approximately 70% (n = 6). The decline of facilitation was nearly exponential and was no longer evident with intervals > 350 ms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
