     "AB": "Auxiliary proteins modify the biophysical function and pharmacological properties of ionotropic glutamate receptors and likely are important components of receptor signaling complexes in vivo. The neuropilin and tolloid-like proteins (NETO) 1 and NETO2, two closely related CUB domain-containing integral membrane proteins, were identified recently as auxiliary proteins that slowed GluK2a kainate receptor current kinetics without impacting receptor membrane localization. Here we demonstrate that NETO2 profoundly slows the desensitization rate of GluK1 kainate receptors, promotes plasma membrane localization of transfected receptors in heterologous cells and rat hippocampal neurons, and targets GluK1-containing receptors to synapses. Conversely, the closely related protein NETO1 increases the rate of GluK1 receptor desensitization. Incorporation of NETO proteins into kainate receptor-signaling complexes therefore extends the temporal range of receptor gating by over an order of magnitude. The presence of these auxiliary proteins could underlie some of the unusual aspects of kainate receptor function in the mammalian CNS.",
