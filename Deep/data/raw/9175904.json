     "AB": "The effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) on axoplasmic transport of cultured hippocampal neuron cells from postnatal 1-day mice was analyzed with a computer-assisted video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscope system. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP increased the axoplasmic transport in both anterograde and retrograde directions. The number of particles flowing in the neurites was increased by 0.5 mM dbcAMP. The peak reached about 160% of the initial value. The instantaneous velocity of axoplasmic transport was also increased by 0.5 mM dbcAMP. The average velocity of anterograde and retrograde direction changed respectively from 1.95 +/- 1.01 microm/s (n = 55) to 2.66 +/- 1.26 microm/s (n = 58) and from 1.94 +/- 0.85 (n = 57) to 2.39 +/- 0.93 (n = 57). Rates were 136.1 and 123.1%, respectively. Previously, we have found that acetylcholine suppressed and adrenaline increased the axoplasmic transport in superior cervical ganglion cells. These effects are related to the amount of endogeneous cAMP. The results of the present report suggest that endogeneous cAMP is also related to hippocampal axoplasmic transport.",
