     "AB": "Chronic memory deficits are a major cause of morbidity following traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the rat, the hippocampal theta rhythm is a well-studied correlate of memory function. This study sought to investigate disturbances in hippocampal theta rhythm following lateral fluid percussion injury in the rat. A total of 13 control rats and 12 TBI rats were used. Electrodes were implanted in bilateral hippocampi and an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while the rats explored a new environment, and also while navigating a modified version of the Barnes maze. Theta power and peak theta frequency were significantly attenuated in the injured animals. Further, injured rats were less likely to develop a spatial strategy for Barnes maze navigation compared to control rats. In conclusion, rats sustaining lateral fluid percussion injury demonstrated deficits in hippocampal theta activity. These deficits may contribute to the underlying memory problems seen in chronic TBI.",
