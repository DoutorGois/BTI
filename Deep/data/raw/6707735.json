     "AB": "The postnatal development of IPSPs and response to locally applied GABA were examined using intracellular recording techniques in region CA1 of rabbit hippocampal slices maintained in vitro. Pyramidal neurons in slices from mature rabbits demonstrated an EPSP-IPSP sequence following stimulation of stratum radiatum. In these same slices, pressure application of GABA into stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum produced membrane hyperpolarization and depolarization, respectively. Pyramidal neurons in slices from immature rabbits (age 6 to 10 days) responded differently. Stimulation of stratum radiatum produced a prolonged depolarizing postsynaptic potential; few IPSPs were observed. Ejection of GABA into either stratum pyramidale or stratum radiatum evoked a depolarizing response. The GABA agonist, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-c] pyridine-3-ol (THIP), which has been reported to activate \"hyperpolarizing\" GABA receptors selectively, primarily produced membrane hyperpolarization when applied to the somata of mature neurons, but it evoked a depolarization when applied to immature neurons. Bicuculline, a GABA antagonist which may have a preferential selectivity for \"depolarizing\" GABA receptors, was somewhat more efficacious (at 50 microM concentration) at antagonizing GABA-evoked depolarization in immature cells than GABA-evoked hyperpolarization in mature cells. This same concentration of bicuculline partially antagonized IPSPs in mature cells, and it markedly potentiated depolarizing PSPs in immature cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the late development of synaptic inhibition in rabbit hippocampus is due, at least in part, to an immaturity in the GABAergic system.",
