     "AB": "Among the non-motor phenomena of Parkinson's disease (PD) are depressive symptoms, with a prevalence of 40-70%. The reason for this high prevalence is not yet clear. The basal ganglia receives dopamine (DA) inputs from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), which is known to be impaired in PD patients. The neurotransmitter deficiency hypothesis of PD considers that low serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) activity in the brain in PD patients is a risk factor for depression. We investigated whether DA depletion promoted by the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is able to induce depressive-like behavior and neurotransmitter alterations that are similar to those observed in PD. To test this hypothesis, we performed intranigral injections of 6-OHDA in male Wistar rats and conducted motor behavior, depressive-like behavior, histological, and neurochemical tests. After the motor recovery period, 6-OHDA was able to produce anhedonia and behavioral despair 7, 14, and 21 days after neurotoxin infusion. These altered behavioral responses were accompanied by reductions of striatal DA. Additionally, decreases in hippocampal 5-HT content were detected in the 6-OHDA group. Notably, correlations were found between 5-HT and DA levels and swimming, immobility, and sucrose preference. Our results indicate that 6-OHDA produced depressive-like behavior accompanied by striatal DA and hippocampal 5-HT reductions. Moreover, DA and 5-HT levels were strongly correlated with \"emotional\" impairments, suggesting the important participation of these neurotransmitters in anhedonia and behavioral despair after 6-OHDA-induced nigral lesions.",
