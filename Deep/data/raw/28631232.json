     "AB": "There is a lack of information concerning the molecular events underlying the depressive-like effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) in mice. The elevated activity of the tryptophan-degrading enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) has been proposed to mediate depression in inflammatory disorders. In the present study, we reported that ICV-STZ activates IDO in the hippocampus of mice and culminates in depressive-like behaviors, as measured by the increased duration of immobility in the tail suspension test and decreased sucrose intake in the sucrose preference test. The blockade of IDO activation by the IDO inhibitor 1-methyltryptophan (1-MT) prevents the development of depressive-like behaviors and attenuates STZ-induced up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. 1-MT abrogates kynurenine production and normalizes brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio, but does not protect the biomarkers of the serotonin (5-HT) system in the hippocampus of STZ-injected mice. These results implicate IDO as a critical molecular mediator of STZ-induced depressive-like behavior, likely through activation of the kynurenine pathway and subsequent reduction of BDNF levels. Impairment of the 5-HT system may reflect the inflammatory response induced by STZ and also contributes to observed depression symptoms. The present study not only provides evidence that IDO plays a critical role in mediating inflammation-induced depression but also supports the notion that neuroinflammation and the kynurenine pathway are important targets for novel therapeutic drugs for depression. In addition, this study provides new insights on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying ICV-STZ and indicates that this model could be employed in preclinical research of depression.",
