     "AB": "BACKGROUND: To investigate the effect of systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on function of hippocampus and corpus callosum (CC) in adult rats. METHODS: Adult rats with mature white matter tract were divided into systemic LPS and saline injection groups. Animal were euthanized following 3 daily injections (day 3) and 3-day after cessation of injections (day 6). At both time points, hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) and CC compound action potentials (CAP) were recorded, beta amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) level in CC tissue was measured by Western blot, and microglia activation was examined by immunostaining and proportional area analysis. RESULTS: Systemic LPS significantly decreased amplitude of both post tetanic potentiation (PTP) and LTP at day 3, but PTP and LTP turned to be normal at day 6. CAP was significantly declined at day 3 but was further declined at day 6. The beta-APP levels in CC tissues of LPS injected rats were significantly higher than that of saline group at both time-points. Interestingly, proportional area measurement disclosed that microglial areas in both hippocampus and CC significantly expanded at day3, but at the day 6, microglial area decreased in hippocampus but further increased in CC. CONCLUSION: Systemic LPS resulted in a transient hippocampus malfunction but a prolonged CC injury. Microglia activation may correlate with such LPS induced white matter injury.",
