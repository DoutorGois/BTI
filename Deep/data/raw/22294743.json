     "AB": "Across vertebrate species, 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) acts on the brain via both genomic and nongenomic mechanisms to influence neuronal physiology and behavior. Nongenomic E(2) signaling is typically initiated by membrane-associated estrogen receptors that modulate intracellular signaling cascades, including rapid phosphorylation of ERK. Phosphorylated ERK (pERK) can, in turn, rapidly phosphorylate tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Recent data suggest that the rapid effects of E(2) on mouse aggressive behavior are more prominent during short photoperiods (winter) and that acute aromatase inhibition reduces songbird aggression in winter only. To date, seasonal plasticity in the rapid effects of E(2) on intracellular signaling has not been investigated. Here, we compared the effects of acute (15 min) E(2) treatment on pERK, pTH, and pCREB immunoreactivity in male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) pretreated with the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole during the breeding and nonbreeding seasons. We examined immunoreactivity in 14 brain regions including portions of the song control system, social behavior network, and the hippocampus (Hp). In both seasons, E(2) significantly decreased pERK in nucleus taeniae of the amygdala, pTH in ventromedial hypothalamus, and pCREB in mesencephalic central gray, robust nucleus of the arcopallium, and caudomedial nidopallium. However, several effects were critically dependent upon season. E(2) decreased pERK in caudomedial nidopallium in the breeding season only and decreased pCREB in the medial preoptic nucleus in the nonbreeding season only. Remarkably, E(2) decreased pERK in Hp in the breeding season but increased pERK in Hp in the nonbreeding season. Together, these data demonstrate that E(2) has rapid effects on intracellular signaling in multiple regions of the male brain and also demonstrate that rapid effects of E(2) can be profoundly different across the seasons.",
