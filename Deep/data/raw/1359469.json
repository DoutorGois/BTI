     "AB": "We explore the possible involvement of the hippocampal formation in penile erection, using male, adult Sprague-Dawley rats that were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. The intracavernous pressure (ICP) was used as the experimental index for penile erection. Electrical activation of the hippocampal formation resulted in two patterns, viz, multiple and single episodes of elevation in ICP, along with visible penile erection and ejaculation. The former pattern exhibited an increase in ICP that was more sustained, with higher peak amplitude and longer latency. Furthermore, they originated respectively from the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells of the CA1 and CA3 fields of the Ammon's horn. Chemical stimulation of the hippocampus with glutamate also elicited significant increase in ICP. These results thus provided direct evidence to establish that the hippocampal formation may be involved in central neural regulation of the erectile process.",
