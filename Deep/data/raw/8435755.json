     "AB": "Using the low-frequency kindling procedure, we studied the effects of periodic 2-week stimulus-free intervals and chronic scopolamine administration on hippocampal kindling seizure development. In Experiment 1, rats were divided into two groups, interval group and no-interval group. In the interval group a 2-week stimulus interval was set after every five consecutive daily stimulations until the 21st stimulation. The number of stimulating pulses required for the triggering of epileptic afterdischarge, pulse-number threshold (PNT), was used as an indicator of the seizure threshold. PNT, afterdischarge duration (ADD) and behavioral seizure stage (BSS) of each induced seizure in the initial stage of kindling, kindling rate, seizure parameters at the completion of kindling were recorded and compared to the values of the no-interval, control group. Our result showed that PNT at the 6th stimulation, the first stimulation after the first 2-week stimulus interval increased significantly compared to control. Other seizure parameters did not differ significantly between the two groups. In Experiment 2 scopolamine hydrobromide, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg i.p., was administered 1 h before each electrical stimulation until each rat showed the stage-3 seizure. PNT, ADD and BSS in the initial stage of kindling, kindling rate for the stage-3 and -5 seizures, seizure parameters at the first stage-3 and -5 were recorded and compared to the values of saline-treated, control group. Although scopolamine 1.0 mg/kg increased PNT at the 5th stimulation compared to control, no other significant changes of the seizure parameters were found by scopolamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
