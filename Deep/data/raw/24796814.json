     "AB": "Gamma-animobutyric acid (GABA) systems are emerging as targets for development of medications for mood disorders. Deficits in GABA-containing neurons are consistently reported in psychiatric disease, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) that use magnetic field to stimulate focal cortical regions with electrical current have a potential therapeutic effects with non-invasive and painless method. In this study, we used chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model of depression to investigate the behavioral and neurochemical alterations. Furthermore, chronic rTMS treatment effect on neurochemical profile in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of rats were assessed. The CUMS induced significant reductions in absolute sucrose intake and sucrose preference. In addition, high-resolution (1)H-NMR spectra from brain extracts revealed significantly reduced prefrontal and hippocampal GABA levels in CUMS rats compared to control. The behavioral and neurochemical changes were reversed by chronic rTMS treatment. Furthermore, chronic rTMS treatments results in differential effects on different brain regions. Our results suggest specific and regionally different metabolic response to chronic rTMS treatment in animal model of depression.",
