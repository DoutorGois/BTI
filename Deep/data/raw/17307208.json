     "AB": "Biochemical modifications induced by a combination of anabolic compounds in target organs of male veal calves have been evaluated. Six male Friesian crossbred calves were treated with of 17beta-estradiol, dexamethasone sodium phosphate and clenbuterol or served as controls. beta-Adrenoceptors (beta-ARs) were measured in myocardium, lung, spleen, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and hypophysis, glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the spleen and androgen receptors (AnRs) in the testis, by binding assay. A significant decrease in beta-ARs was observed in all tissue samples from treated animals. In the spleen the two GR subtypes found, low (LA) and high (HA) affinity GRs, were down-regulated by the treatment. A significant (P<0.05) decrease of testis weight and a significant (P<0.05) up-regulation of AnRs was also observed. Our data demonstrate that long-term treatment with anabolic compounds markedly affects receptor concentrations in target organs of male veal calves. Thus, studies investigating biological assays as screening methods to detect such compounds should be encouraged.",
