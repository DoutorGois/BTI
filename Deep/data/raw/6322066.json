     "AB": "In order to localize the site of action of neuropeptides in relation to their effects on behavior and memory various approaches have been used. As a result of studies using rats bearing lesions in different areas of the limbic system as well as of studies in which neuropeptides were locally applied into various areas of the brain it appeared that the limbic system (amygdala, hippocampus, septum and some thalamic areas) plays an essential role in the effect of vasopressin and ACTH and their derivatives on behavior and memory. Neurochemical studies generally indicate that changes occur in catecholamine utilization in these various limbic regions upon administration of these neuropeptides. It can be concluded that the effects of vasopressin in the terminal regions of the coeruleo-telencephalic noradrenalin system correlate with its effects on consolidation of memory. It is likely that the effects of vasopressin on other transmitter systems (e.g. dopamine in the amygdala and serotonin in the hippocampus) correspond with the effect of this neuropeptide on retrieval processes. In addition, regional differences in biotransformation of the neurohypophyseal hormones suggest that different patterns of behaviorally active fragments of these peptides may be present locally in the brain.",
