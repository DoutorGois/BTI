     "AB": "In slices of rat hippocampus, the influence of puromycin (0.5 mM) on dopamine (0.5 mM)-stimulated L-fucose incorporation into glycoproteins was studied. Puromycin (15 min, 2 h and 4 h pretreatment) inhibited protein synthesis by some -70% (estimated by the in vitro incorporation rate of L-leucine), whilst L-fucose incorporation into rat hippocampal glycoproteins was only inhibited about -20% (4 h pretreatment) compared to control values (100%). Under these experimental conditions, the dopamine-induced increase in both the L-fucose incorporation into glycoproteins and the activity of fucokinase was not affected by puromycin. These data suggest that these short-lasting dopamine actions do not depend on protein synthesis.",
