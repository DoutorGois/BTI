     "AB": "Aging has been associated with a decay of hippocampal function that may begin well before senescence. Conditioned blocking is a complex learning phenomenon that requires an intact hippocampus in young-adult rats and is absent in middle-aged rats. The aim of the present study was to test the possibility of re-establishing conditioned blocking in 17-month-old Wistar rats by neurotransplantation. Solid embryonic hippocampal or nigral tissue was bilaterally transplanted in the proximity of the dorsal hippocampus (lateral ventricle and alveus). Conditioned blocking of an aversion to a cider vinegar (3%) solution presented in compound with a previously conditioned saccharin solution (0.1%) appeared 14 days after transplantation and persisted 3 months later only in the hippocampal grafted group, showing the possibility of restoring age-related cognitive deficits.",
