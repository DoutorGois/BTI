     "AB": "The distribution of ryanodine receptor-like immunoreactivity in the mouse central nervous system was studied using two antibodies raised against synthetic peptides. These peptides represented a region conserved between the cardiac and skeletal muscle forms and a region specific to the cardiac form. Western blotting analysis and [3H]ryanodine binding analysis showed ryanodine receptors are expressed in all the brain regions. The activity was prominent in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated that the ryanodine receptors were localized unevenly in somata. Some apical and proximal dendrites in some cells were also labeled. In hippocampus pyramidal neurons in CA2-3 region were more labeled than CA1 region. Immunohistochemical distribution revealed by two antibodies was essentially the same but the fibers were more immunoreactive with the antibody raised against the cardiac muscle ryanodine form. The localization of ryanodine receptors was quite different from that of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors.",
