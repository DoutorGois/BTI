     "AB": "In the present study the behavioural effects of Cerebrolysin (Cere), a peptidergic nootropic drug, and E021, the concentrated peptide fraction of Cere, were investigated in 24-month-old rats. Rats passing a pretest to exclude motor- and eye-deficits were treated with either drugs or saline as control (2.5 ml/kg, intraperitoneally i.p.) for 19 days. Animals were tested in a standard Morris water maze on day 16 after pretest for 4 consecutive days (test days 1-4), eight trials per day. No significant differences of escape latency between males and females were found, therefore, results were pooled. Both Cere and E021 treated rats showed significant lower escape latencies than saline treated controls on all four test days (p < 0.01). More pronounced effects of both drugs were found for female rats. Female rats showed no significant differences in motor activity whereas drug treated males swam quicker on test day 1 (Cere p < 0.01: E021 p < 0.05) and day 2 (Cere p < 0.01). In the present experiments it was demonstrated that i.p. administration of both Cere and E021 improves the spatial learning and memory of 24 month-old male and female rats.",
