     "AB": "We isolated and sequenced genomic and cDNA clones of the guinea pig preprodynorphin (ppDyn) mRNA. The sequence of ppDyn mRNA was deduced from a combination of genomic and cDNA clones: The primary structure of two coding exons was derived from a genomic clone and 5' and 3' untranslated sequences were obtained using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The predicted mRNA of 2,350 nucleotides coincides well with the size of transcripts in Northern blot analyses of RNA from different brain regions. The deduced amino acid sequence of guinea pig ppDyn shares 70%, 68%, and 61% identity to porcine, human, and rat ppDyn, respectively. The 5' untranslated sequences of guinea pig hippocampal and adrenal ppDyn mRNA are identical; both contain sequences of exon I and, like porcine mRNA, lack an exon (exon II) present in human and rat mRNA. Quantitative solution hybridization RNase protection analysis of total RNA from selected guinea pig brain regions was performed. The nucleus accumbens was found to have the greatest abundance of ppDyn mRNA, followed by caudate putamen, hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala, frontal cortex, olfactory bulb, and pons/medulla.",
