     "AB": "The inferior temporal gyrus in the monkey appears to be unique among the many extrastriate visual cortices in its importance for normal performance of delayed match-to-sample, a visual memory task. However, the anatomical pathway providing visual information to this portion of the temporal lobe remains unclear. In this study, wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was injected into the anterior inferior temporal gyrus and heavy projections were found to arise in cytoarchitectural area TF of the parahippocampal gyrus, as well as moderate projections in more posterior portions of inferior temporal gyrus and perirhinal and entorhinal cortices. Subsequently, WGA-HRP was injected into area TF, resulting in retrogradely labeled cells primarily located in the portions of area TF adjacent to the injection and also in the occipitotemporal sulcus including the ventral portion of the prestriate visual area V4. Moderate projections were found to originate from the dorsal region of area V4 in the lunate sulcus, portions of the caudal parietal lobe, the posterior bank of caudal superior temporal sulcus, and area OPT located at the tip of the superior temporal sulcus. The middle temporal gyrus, foveal prestriate cortex, and area TEO, a transitional area between temporal and occipital visual areas, were all free from retrogradely labeled cells. These latter areas are included in the well-established anatomical system that is known to carry visual information from striate cortex through prestriate to eventually reach dorsal portions of inferotemporal cortex which is coincident with the temporal lobe visual area TE. It is suggested here that there is an additional ventral pathway into area TE as well, which includes projections through portions of the prestriate cortex, occipitotemporal sulcus, and parahippocampal gyrus, ultimately reaching the anterior inferior temporal gyrus, an area that may be specialized to hold visual information over brief periods of time.",
