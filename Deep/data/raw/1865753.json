     "PG": "595-601",
     "AB": "SKF 38393 (5 mg/kg), but not quinpirole, shortened the duration of loss of righting reflex produced in pentobarbital-narcotized rats. This effect was blocked by atropine (2 mg/kg), but not by atropine methylbromide, suggesting involvement of central cholinergic mechanisms. The analeptic effect was also blocked by SCH 23390 (0.2 mg/kg) or raclopride (2 mg/kg). SKF 38393 also increased sodium dependent high affinity choline uptake (HACU) in cortical and hippocampal synaptosomes that had been depressed by pentobarbital. SCH 23390 or raclopride prevented the SKF 38393 reversal of the depressed HACU, indicating that both D1 and D2 mechanisms were involved mediating the analeptic effect. These results provide neurochemical evidence that cortical and hippocampal D1-mediated cholinergic activation results in a behavioral arousal (analeptic) response. They also suggest that DA mechanisms may be involved in regulation of cortical and hippocampal cholinergic neurons.",
