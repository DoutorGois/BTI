     "AB": "Chronic alcohol consumption has adverse effects on the central nervous system, affecting some hippocampal and hypothalamic functions. In this study we tempted to demonstrate that some of these modifications could involve impairment of neurotrophic factors. Three experimental groups of male Sprague Dawley rats were studied: one control group, one chronically treated with alcohol vapor according to a well-established model that induces behavioral dependence, and a third group treated similarly but killed 12 hr after alcohol withdrawal. In all groups, changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA expression occurring in the hippocampus and supraoptic nucleus were first analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and then by in situ hybridization. In parallel, we used ribonuclease protection assay to measure mRNA levels encoding trkB in the two central nervous system regions. We showed that chronic alcohol intoxication decreases brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA expression in discrete regions of the rat hippocampus (CA1 region and dentate gyrus) and in the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. We also showed a global up-regulation of trkB mRNA expression encoding the high-affinity brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor (TrkB), after applying the same treatment. Following 12 hr of alcohol withdrawal, a significant increase in BDNF mRNA expression was observed in the dentate gyrus and CA3 region of hippocampus and in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus. These findings suggest that chronic alcohol intake may modify hippocampal and hypothalamic neuronal functions through modifications in growth factors and its receptors.",
