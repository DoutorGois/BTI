     "AB": "The enzyme 5alpha-reductase (5alphaR) catalyzes the conversion of testosterone and other Delta(4)-3-ketosteroids into their 5alpha-reduced metabolites. Of the five members of the 5alphaR family, the type 2 enzyme (5alphaR2) plays a key role in androgen metabolism, and is abundantly distributed in the urogenital system. Although 5alphaR2 has been reported to be highly expressed in the brain during early developmental stages, little is currently known on its anatomical and cellular distribution in the adult brain. Thus, the present study was designed to determine the detailed localization of 5alphaR2 in the adult rat brain, using a highly specific polyclonal antibody against this isoform. Parasagittal and coronal sections revealed 5alphaR2 immunoreactivity throughout most brain regions, with strong immunolabeling in the layers III and VI of the prefrontal and somatosensory cortex, olfactory bulb, thalamic nuclei, CA3 field of hippocampus, basolateral amygdala and Purkinje cell layer of cerebellum. Lower 5alphaR2 levels were detected in the hypothalamus and midbrain. Moreover, double labeling fluorescence with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) revealed that 5alphaR2 is localized in neurons, but not in glial cells. Specifically, the enzyme was documented in the pyramidal neurons of the cortex by CLSM analysis of simultaneous Golgi-Cox and immunofluorescent staining. Finally, low levels of 5alphaR2 expression were identified in GABAergic cells across the cortex, hippocampus and striatum. These findings show that, in the adult brain, 5alphaR2 is distributed in critical regions for behavioral regulation, suggesting that the functional role of this isoform is present throughout the entire lifespan of the individual.",
