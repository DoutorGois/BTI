     "AB": "Rats with conventional lesions of the hippocampus or fornix were compared postoperatively with controls on nonspatial memory tasks. Neither lesion impaired delayed matching-to-sample (DMS) performance in a discrete-trial task involving \"pseudo-trial-unique\" complex stimuli. An impairment emerged if a single pair of complex stimuli was used throughout each day's session, and the greatest impairment was obtained with the use of a single pair of less complex stimuli throughout each day's test. Transfer to a continuous DMS task with no explicit intertrial interval produced a different pattern because both lesion and control levels of performance were depressed when two complex stimuli were used repeatedly. A final, separate discrimination learning experiment showed that hippocampectomized rats readily discriminated between the stimuli associated with the greatest lesion-induced DMS deficit. Hippocampal dysfunction thus produces clear deficits on non-spatial memory tasks under appropriate test conditions.",
