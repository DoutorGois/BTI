     "AB": "Elapid snake venom neurotoxins exert their effects through high-affinity interactions with specific neurotransmitter receptors. A novel murine gene, lynx1, is highly expressed in the brain and contains the cysteine-rich motif characteristic of this class of neurotoxins. Primary sequence and gene structure analyses reveal an evolutionary relationship between lynx1 and the Ly-6/neurotoxin gene family. lynx1 is expressed in large projection neurons in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum. In cerebellar neurons, lynx1 protein is localized to a specific subdomain including the soma and proximal dendrites. lynx1 binding to brain sections correlates with the distribution of nAChRs, and application of lynx1 to Xenopus oocytes expressing nAChRs results in an increase in acetylcholine-evoked macroscopic currents. These results identify lynx1 as a novel protein modulator for nAChRs in vitro, which could have important implications in the regulation of cholinergic function in vivo.",
