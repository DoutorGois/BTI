     "AB": "STAM2 (signal transducing adaptor molecule 2), a subunit of the ESCRT-0 complex, is an endosomal protein acting as a regulator of receptor signaling and trafficking. To analyze STAM2 in the nervous system, its gene expression and protein localization in the mouse brain were identified using three methods: mRNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and via lacZ reporter in frame with Stam2 gene using the gene trap mouse line Stam2(Gt1Gaj). STAM2 intracellular localization was analyzed by subcellular fractionation and co-immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. Stam2 was strongly expressed in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex, hippocampal formation, olfactory bulb, and medial habenula. The majority of STAM2-positive cells co-stained with the neuronal markers. In neurons STAM2 was found in the early endosomes and also in the nucleus. The other members of the ESCRT-0 complex co-localized with STAM2 in the cytoplasm, but they were not present in the nucleus. The newly identified neuron-specific nuclear localization of STAM2, together with its high expression in the brain indicated that STAM2 might have a specific function in the mouse nervous system.",
