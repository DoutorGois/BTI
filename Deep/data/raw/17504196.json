     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The postmortem and magnetic resonance imaging studies for schizophrenic patients showed neuropathological abnormalities including neuron loss and volume reduction in ventral hippocampus (VH), some longitudinal studies suggest these changes may be a neurodegenerative process. OBJECTIVES: The present study examined the effects of adult bilateral VH lesions on a dopaminergic stimulant, methamphetamine (METH)-induced and an N-methyl-(D)-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, dizocilpine (MK-801)-induced behavioral and neurochemical changes in rats, in order to evaluate a potential of adult VH lesion animals for a model of schizophrenia. METHODS: To study the behavioral effects after bilateral VH lesions in adult rats, locomotor activity was measured individually by an infra-red sensor. Extracellular concentrations of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) were measured using in vivo brain microdialysis. RESULTS: The bilateral adult VH lesion rats showed a significant enhanced hyperlocomotion in response to METH but no changes to MK-801 and phencyclidine; while bilateral adult VH lesion enhanced METH-induced increasing dopamine levels in the NAc. CONCLUSIONS: The bilateral adult VH lesions enhanced locomotor activity, which related to increased dopamine releases in the NAc, induced by a dopaminergic stimulant; these findings may suggest a potential of adult VH lesion animal for a model reflecting dopamine D2 receptor antagonist-responsive pathophysiology of schizophrenia by way of neurodegenerative processes.",
