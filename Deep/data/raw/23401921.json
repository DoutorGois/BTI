     "AB": "In vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) of ICR male mice was used to study the brain (hippocampus) metabolic response to the acute deficiency of the available energy or to the pro-inflammatory stimulus. Inhibition of glycolysis by means of an intraperitoneal injection with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) reduced the levels of gamma-aminobutiric acid (GABA), N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline compounds, and at the same time increased the levels of glutamate and glutamine. An opposite effect was found after injection with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)--a very common pro-inflammatory inducer. An increase in the amounts of GABA, NAA and choline compounds in the brain occurred three hours after the injection of LPS. Different metabolic responses to the energy deficiency and the pro-inflammatory stimuli can explain the contradictory results of the brain MRS studies under neurodegenerative pathology, which is accompanied by both mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. Prevalence of the excitatory metabolites such as glutamate and glutamine in 2DG treated mice is in good agreement with excitation observed during temporary reduction of the available energy under acute hypoxia or starvation. In turn, LPS, as an inducer of the sickness behavior, shifts brain metabolic pattern to prevalence of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.",
