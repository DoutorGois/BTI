     "AB": "In the CA3 region of rat hippocampal slices gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)(A/B) receptor antagonists induce low frequency bursting activity that was either inhibited (in 21% of slices) or increased by the selective 5-HT receptor agonists 5-carboxy-tryptamine (0.1-1 microM) and 8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT). The selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexane carboxamide (WAY 100635) reversed the depression of bursting activity whereas the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, (R)-3-(2-(2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-ethyl)pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl)phenol (SB-269970; 1-10 microM), but not the 5-HT1A, 4 or 6 receptor antagonists WAY100635 (10 microM), SB-204070 (10 microM) and SB-271046 (10 microM), reversed the increase in bursting activity. The apparent -log10 K(D) value (8.4) for the effect of SB-269970 was consistent with a selective action at 5-HT7 receptors. Accompanying the 5-CT-induced increase in bursting frequency there was a shortening of the burst event waveform and a reduction in the after-hyperpolarization following each bursting event both of which were inhibited by SB-269970. These effects appeared to result predominantly from a direct 5-HT(7) receptor-mediated inhibition of a Ca2+ activated K+ channel.",
