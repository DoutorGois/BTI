     "AB": "Quantitative autoradiography was used to evaluate the time course and reversibility of corticosterone (CORT)-induced decreases in binding at 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal hippocampus, cortex and septum of the male rat. Continuous exposure to high levels of CORT decreased binding of [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin at 5-HT1A receptors in the dentate gyrus and in the oriens and lacunosum moleculare layers of CA4 after 16 to 48 h. CORT-induced decreases in binding were also observed in the dorsal lateral septum after 2-4 days, and in the intermediate lateral septum after 4-8 days of exposure to high levels of CORT. When CORT pellets that had remained in rats for 8 days were removed 3 weeks prior to sacrifice, binding at 5-HT1A receptors increased in comparison to control values in the oriens and lacunosum moleculare layers of CA2, and in layers 4-6 of the parietal/temporal cortex. These increases in binding were associated with very low serum CORT levels, and resembled increases previously observed in those areas in ADX rats. Although removal of CORT reversed the decreases in binding in the septum, no significant increases above control values were observed. Thus, there appear to be differences in the degree of sensitivity in the various brain regions to low and high levels of circulating adrenal steroids.",
