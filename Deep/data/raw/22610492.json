     "AB": "Corticosteroid hormones are secreted from the adrenal glands in hourly pulses and signal the hippocampus for the development and function. In contrast, the stress-induced rise in corticosteroid concentrations has a profound effect on emotional arousal, motivational processes and cognitive performance. This rise is required as the stress response to maintain homeostasis in the living body or restore it. However, abnormal rise in corticosteroid concentrations is a disadvantage to the hippocampus. Corticosteroid-glutamatergic interactions during information processing are proposed as a potential model to explain many of the diverse actions of corticosteroids in synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation and cognition. Because zincergic neurons are a subtype of glutamatergic neurons and release Zn(2+) and glutamate into the synaptic cleft, it is possible that homeostasis of synaptic Zn(2+), in addition to homeostasis of glutamate, is modified by glucocorticoids, followed by the changes in cognitive function and stress response. Zn(2+) signal participates in cognitive and emotional behavior in cooperation with signaling of glucocorticoids and glutamate, while can disadvantageously act on the hippocampus under sever stress circumstances. This paper analyzes the actions of glucocorticoid-mediated Zn(2+) signal in the hippocampus under stressful circumstances and its significance in both hippocampal function and dysfunction.",
