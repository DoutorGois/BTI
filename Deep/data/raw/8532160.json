     "AB": "It has been reported that application of 1S,3R-1-aminocyclopentane 1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD) in vitro triggers a slow-onset potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region. This study examined the effect of ACPD in the CA1 of freely moving rats. No effect on fEPSP baseline recordings occurred at 40 and 400 microM/5 microliters, however at 4 mM/5 microliters ACPD induced a slow-onset potentiation. MCPG (200 mM/5 microliters) completely inhibited this ACPD effect. These results indicate that slow-onset potentiation in the CA1 region, also occurs in vivo.",
