     "AB": "The effect of methoxamine, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, on ischemic neuronal damage was studied in the gerbil. The animals were subjected to 5 min of ischemia by bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion. Morphological changes and calcium accumulation were evaluated in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus after 7 days of survival. The degree of ischemic neuronal damage and calcium accumulation in the methoxamine-treated groups were significantly attenuated compared with the saline-treated ischemic group. The results suggest that alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation prevents ischemic neuronal damage.",
