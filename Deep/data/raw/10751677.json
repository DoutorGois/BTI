     "AB": "Strong evidences link status epilepticus (SE) in childhood with the later development of epilepsy. Pilocarpine-induced SE in developing rats leads to late appearance of spontaneous epileptic seizures only when SE is induced after the 18th day of life. We examined the possibility that 3 consecutive episodes of pilocarpine-induced SE on postnatal days 7, 8 and 9 could induce behavioral, electrographic and histological epileptic changes in adult life. The animals also underwent behavioral tests (inhibitory step-down avoidance, skinner box, rota-rod, open field and elevated plus-maze). EEG recordings made at the age of 30, 60 and 90 days showed the occurrence of several episodes of spikes and/or polyspikes appearing simultaneously in hippocampus and cortex. Only three isolated spontaneous seizures were observed during the whole period of observation (120 days). The long-term effects of three consecutive episodes of SE include increased spontaneous exploratory activity, learning impairment, and reduced anxiety when tested on P60. Our findings provide evidence for EEG changes and cognitive deficits in adult life following recurrent SE on postnatal days 7-9.",
