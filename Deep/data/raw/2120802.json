     "AB": "A combined autoradiographic and immunohistochemical method was used to correlate the extent of focal cerebral ischemia and morphologic ischemic damage following unilateral carotid occlusion in 16 gerbils for 5-30 minutes. Immunohistochemical lesions detectable by the reaction for microtubule-associated proteins 1 and 2 were visible in the subiculum-CA1 and CA2 regions of the hippocampus and layer III/IV of the cerebral cortex after 5 minutes of ischemia (n = 4). Local blood flow was promptly reduced but still heterogeneous after 10 minutes of ischemia (n = 4); local blood flow in immunohistochemical lesions was less than 5 ml/100 g/min except in highly vulnerable regions, where flow values of 5-15 ml/100 g/min were observed. After 15 minutes of ischemia (n = 4) local blood flow in less vulnerable regions including the thalamus and caudoputamen also declined to less than 5 ml/100 g/min, and immunohistochemical lesions became visible in those regions after 30 minutes of ischemia (n = 4). On the other hand, many brain regions tolerated local blood flow of less than 5 ml/100 g/min without ischemic damage. The present study demonstrates that selective tissue vulnerability during progressive cerebral ischemia depends on the degree of hypoperfusion and on factors inherent to neurons in various brain regions.",
