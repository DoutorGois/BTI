     "AB": "Mapping on arrangement of mitoses (M) and pyknoses (P) has been performed in the mouse developing hippocamp. Analysis on the M arrangement confirms the data known on the hippocampal germinative zones and time of their reduction in the mouse ontogenesis. Previously unknown germinative zone of Ammon's horn has been revealed--the suprafimbrial zone that exists since the 16th day of embryogenesis up to the 7th postnatal day. Analysis on the P arrangement demonstrates that they appear in the hippocampal germinative zones during the perinatal periods. Localization of the P corresponding to that of the M agree with the data on \"mitotic\" death of the germinative and glial cells in the developing brain.",
