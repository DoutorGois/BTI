     "AB": "The effects of phenytoin (35 micrograms/ml) on membrane properties and inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSPs) in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of the in vitro rat hippocampus were examined. No significant change was observed on input resistance or resting membrane potential. Action potential amplitude, overshoot, rate of rise and rate of decay were decreased. IPSP conductance increase and reversal potential, evoked in CA3 cells through mossy fiber stimulation and in CA1 cells through recurrent and Schaffer's collateral stimulation, were unaffected.",
