     "AB": "A number of assays were performed to assess immunologic function in 28 patients with clinically well-defined schizophrenia. Our data provide laboratory evidence that patients with schizophrenia have characteristics consistent with an autoimmune process, directed to components of the brain, which may participate in either the pathogenesis or etiology of schizophrenia. One-third of our patients had a clinically evident autoimmune syndrome unrelated to their psychiatric illness. Of the nine patients with an autoimmune disease, two had one autoantibody in their serum and five had more than one autoantibodies. Twelve of eighteen patients without clinical evidence of autoimmune disease had no detectable autoantibodies. Mitogenic responses to PHA and PWM were significantly reduced in the patient population when compared to controls. Fifty percent of the patients had an increased percentage (greater than 5%) of blood-borne HLA-DR (+) OKT4 (+) T-helper lymphocytes. Immune reactivity toward brain antigens was sought by measuring lymphocyte transformation to a saline extract of frontal lobe, and by immunoblotting of antigens extracted from frontal lobe, cingulate gyrus, interventricular septum, and hippocampus. Lymphocyte transformation did not reveal differences between patient and control groups. Normal sera were found to contain antibody to some of these brain antigens. However, patients with schizophrenia had antibody to antigens of the hippocampus, septal region and cingulate gyrus which were not encountered during analysis of normal sera.",
