     "AB": "Hokoei-to (pugongying-tang) is one of the Kampo formulae clinically used for gynecological disturbances such as lack of lactation and mammary swelling. We investigated the effect of hokoei-to on the nervous and immune systems in ovariectomized mice as a climacteric disorder model. Hokoei-to suppressed the decrease of monoamines in the ventral hippocampus and dorsal hippocampus of ovariectomized mice. It was shown that the hokoei-to could improve the metabolic turnover of dopamine. The mitogenic activity of lymphocytes in the spleen was reduced after ovariectomy; a suppression of this reduced activity was observed in the group given hokoei-to.",
