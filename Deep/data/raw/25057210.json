     "AB": "Secretory carrier membrane protein 5 (SCAMP5), a recently identified candidate gene for autism, is brain specific and highly abundant in synaptic vesicles (SVs), but its function is currently unknown. Here, we found that knockdown (KD) of endogenous SCAMP5 by SCAMP5-specific shRNAs in cultured rat hippocampal neurons resulted in a reduction in total vesicle pool size as well as in recycling pool size, but the recycling/resting pool ratio was significantly increased. SCAMP5 KD slowed endocytosis after stimulation, but impaired it severely during strong stimulation. We also found that KD dramatically lowered the threshold of activity at which SV endocytosis became unable to compensate for the ongoing exocytosis occurring during a stimulus. Reintroducing shRNA-resistant SCAMP5 reversed these endocytic defects. Therefore, our results suggest that SCAMP5 functions during high neuronal activity when a heavy load is imposed on endocytosis. Our data also raise the possibility that the reduction in expression of SCAMP5 in autistic patients may be related to the synaptic dysfunction observed in autism.",
