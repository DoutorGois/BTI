     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe effect of acupuncture combined with hypothermia therapy on MAPK/ERK pathway and apoptosis related factorsin rats suffered cerebral ischemia reperfusion and to explore underlying mechanisms. Methods: Middle cerebral artery ischemia model were established.Ninety SD rats were randomly assigned into a blank group, a control group, a model group, an acupuncture group, a mild hypothermia group, and an acupuncture with hypothermia group. After 72 h treatment, nerve function defect scores were observed, and infarction area percent was detected by 2, 3, 5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining; expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax were examined by immunohistochemistry; apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL assay; and expression levels of phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase(p-MEK2) and phospho-extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in the rats' hippocampus ischemic side were determined by Western blot. Results: In the rats of the model group, the neural function defect scores, the infarction area percent, the expression level of Bax, and apoptotic cells increased, while the level of Bcl-2 decreased significantly. The level of p-MEK2 and p-ERK1/2 increased obviously compared with the blank and control groups (P<0.05 or P<0.01). After treatment with acupuncture and hypothermia, the neural function defect scores, infarction area percent, and the level of Bax, apoptotic cells and the levels of p-MEK2 and p-ERK1/2 were significantly decreased, while the level of Bcl-2 in the treatment group was significantly elevated (P<0.05 or P<0.01) compared with the model group. Compared with the acupuncture group or the hypothermia group, the neural function defect scores and the levels of p-MEK2 and p-ERK1/2 in the acupuncture combined with hypothermia group were significantly reduced (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Conclusion: Acupuncture and hypothermia therapy can improve cerebral function, and reduce the cerebral injury through down-regulation of Bax level, and up-regulation of Bcl-2 level, which is related to reducing the levels of p-MEK2 and p-ERK1/2. The therapeutic effects on cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury for combination of acupuncture with hypothermia are better than those with single application of acupuncture or hypothermia.",
