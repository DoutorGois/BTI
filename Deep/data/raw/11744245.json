     "AB": "Global cerebral ischemia, with or without preconditioning, leads to an increase in heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) immunocontent and alterations in HSP27 phosphorylation in CA1 and dentate gyrus areas of the hippocampus. We studied different times of reperfusion (1, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 30 days) using 2 min, 10 min or 2+10 min of ischemia. The results showed an increase in HSP27 immunocontent of about 300% after 10 min of ischemia in CA1 and dentate gyrus. CA1, a hippocampal vulnerable area, showed an increase in HSP27 phosphorylation, parallel with immunocontent. In dentate gyrus, a resistant area, the increase in HSP phosphorylation was lower than immunocontent. After preconditioned ischemia (2+10 min), when CA1 neurons are protected to a lethal, 10 min insult, we observed an increase in HSP immunocontent and a decrease in phosphorylation in both regions of the hippocampus, suggesting that, when there is no neuronal death, HSP27 in a vulnerable area responds similarly to the resistant area.When dephosphorylated, HSP27 acts as a chaperone, protecting other proteins from denaturation. As it is markedly expressed in astrocytes, we suggest that HSP27 could be protecting hippocampal astrocytes, which could then be helping neurons to resist to the insult, maintaining tissue normal homeostasis.",
