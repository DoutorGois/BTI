As demonstrated, there arose specific neuropathological signs dissimilar to those developing with different TT localization, i.e. as a rule the action of TT in the given brain parts was local. Experiments carried out confirmed the theory of the generator mechanisms of the neuropathological syndromes according to which specific manifestations of the corresponding syndrome were due to the localization of a generator of pathologically-enhanced excitation in definite brain structures.",
