     "AB": "To determine factors contributing to the expression of the brain-derived protein, hippocalcin, we mapped its distribution in the brain of Snell pituitary dwarf mutant mice (dw) by immunohistochemical and immunoblot methods. Our findings are as follows. (1) In the hippocampus, hippocalcin immunoreactivity was found in the cell body and dendrites of pyramidal neurons of the normal controls and dw mice, although the intensity of immunoreactivity in the dw mice was lower. (2) In the cerebellum, hippocalcin immunoreactivity was strongly expressed in the Purkinje cell body of both the control and dw mice. However, the Purkinje cell dendrites were found to be more intensely stained in the dw mice than in the normal controls. (3) In the dw cerebral cortex, the pyramidal neurons of layers II to VI strongly expressed hippocalcin, whereas its expression in the controls was weak. (4) The amount of hippocalcin in the dw hippocampus was less than in the normal controls, whereas the amount in the dw cerebral cortex and cerebellum was greater. These results indicate that the developmental expression of hippocalcin in the dw brain is affected by the retarded maturation of the neuronal network due to the deficient hormonal state (the lack of growth and thyroid hormones).",
