     "AB": "Immobility time of rats in the forced swim test was reduced after bilateral infusion of an 18-mer antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide targeted to the glucocorticoid receptor mRNA into the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Vehicle-, sense- and scrambled sequence-treated animals spent significantly more time immobile than antisense-treated animals during the initial test. Immunolabeling of the glucocorticoid receptor in brain sections demonstrated a reduced expression of glucocorticoid receptor proteins in antisense-treated dentate gyrus compared to the contralateral sense-treated dentate gyrus or contralateral scrambled sequence-treated dentate gyrus. During the initial test the time spent on immobility was also reduced when rats were treated with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486 (17 beta-hydroxy-11 beta-(4-dimethylamino-phenyl)17 alpha-(1-propnyl)estra-4,9-diene-3-one)) 6 h (but not 1 h) earlier. These results demonstrate the participation of glucocorticoid receptors in the expression of immobility in a forced swim test during the initial test.",
