     "AB": "Various doses (0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 mg/kg) of methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM), a potent alkylating agent, were injected singly into pregnant rats intraperitoneally on day 15 of gestation. Relationships between brain weights and neurochemical changes in the cerebral hemispheres (CHs; cerebral cortex and subjacent white matter, hippocampus, amygdala) and remainder of the brain (BGDM; basal ganglia, diencephalon, and mesencephalon) were examined at 60 days of age in offspring; varying degrees of microencephaly were observed. Dose-dependent reductions in the weights of CH and BGDM were observed. Reductions in total DNA content positively correlated with decreases in brain weights also observed. Dose-dependent elevations of noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) were observed in CH at MAM levels 10 mg/kg and above; dose-dependent elevations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were observed at 15 mg/kg and above; and in BGDM at 20 mg/kg and above dose-dependent elevations for NA and 5-HT were observed; dose-dependent elevations at 15 mg/kg and above were observed for DA. Monoamine concentrations were negatively correlated with brain weights or total DNA contents. NA and DA concentrations increased to the extent of approximately 1.3 times of control at a time when an 18% loss of CH weight was noted in animals treated with 10 mg/kg MAM. It is suggested that the above variables might be appropriately sensitive neurochemical markers for detecting minor developmental anomalies in the brain.",
