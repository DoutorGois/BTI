     "AB": "An improved iodinated tracer, ADAM (2-((2-((dimethylamino)methyl)- phenyl)thio)-5-iodophenylamine) for imaging serotonin transporters (SERT) with single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), was prepared and characterized. Scatchard analysis of saturation binding of [(125)I]ADAM to rat frontal cortical membrane homogenates gave a K(d) value of 0.15 +/- 0.03 nM and a B(max) value of 194 +/- 65 fmol/mg protein. Biodistribution of [(125)I]ADAM in rat brain after an iv injection showed a high specific binding in the regions of hypothalamus, cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, where SERT are concentrated and the specific binding peaked at 120-240 min postinjection [(hypothalamus-cerebellum)/cerebellum = 4.3 at 120 min post-iv injection]. Moreover, the specific hypothalamic uptake was blocked by pretreatment with SERT selective competing drugs, such as paroxetine and (+)McN5652, while other noncompeting drugs, such as ketanserin, raclopride, and methylphenidate, showed no effect. The radioactive material recovered from rat brain homogenates at 120 min after [(125)I]ADAM injection showed primarily the original compound (>90%), a good indication of in vivo stability in the brain tissues. Both male and female rats showed similar and comparable organ distribution pattern and regional brain uptakes. Ex vivo autoradiograms of rat brain sections (120 min after iv injection of [(125)I]ADAM) showed intense labeling in several regions (olfactory tubercle, lateral septal nucleus, hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei, globus pallidus, central gray, superior colliculus, substantia nigra, interpeduncular nucleus, dorsal and median raphes, and locus coerulus), which parallel known SERT density. These results strongly suggest that the novel tracer ADAM is superior to the congers (i.e., IDAM) reported previously. When labeled with I-123, ADAM will be an improved and useful SPECT imaging agent for SERT in the brain.",
