Changes in spectra of the electrical activity of the nucleus accumbens, frontal neocortex, amygdala, and caudate putamen during the development of pain-depressive syndrome pointed to the formation of a new functional state as compared to depressive state and pain syndrome simulated individually. Alterations in the state of hippocampus did not reach the level of statistical significance.",
