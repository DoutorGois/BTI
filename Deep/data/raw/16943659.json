     "AB": "Posttraumatic seizures and epilepsy are common in children experiencing traumatic brain injury and portend worse functional outcome. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of pediatric posttraumatic seizures and epilepsy remains poorly understood, and no efficacious preventive therapy for post-traumatic epilepsy has been identified. This article reviews the epidemiology of pediatric posttraumatic seizures, discusses prominent putative mechanisms of posttraumatic epileptogenesis and highlights recent promising progress in experimental investigations of posttraumatic seizures and epilepsy.",
