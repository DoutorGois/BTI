     "AB": "1. The effect of ethanol and its withdrawal on the dendritic microtubules in the dentate fascia of male mice was studied in the ethanol-sensitive, long-sleep (LS) line and the ethanol-insensitive, short-sleep (SS) line. 2. Both mouse lines were treated with a liquid ethanol diet. Dendrites in the dentate molecular layer (DML) of the right hippocampus were examined. 3. They revealed marked changes in microtubule density as compared with the controls. While the microtubule density in LS mice was significantly reduced by 15% and 18% in the middle and distal third of the DML, respectively, in SS mice the reduction (by 12%) took place in the distal third only. During withdrawal a recovery of the microtubule density has been observed in both lines.",
