     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of dopamine (DA) receptor agonists and antagonists on neuronal apoptosis in hippocampal CA1 region after forebrain ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in gerbils. METHODS: Gerbil forebrain ischemia was induced by occluding bilateral carotid arteries for 5 minutes. The open field test, hematoxylin-eosin staining and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) methods were used 1, 3 and 7 days after reperfusion. Western blot was used to examine the phosphorylation of c-Jun. RESULTS: Pergolide could significantly reduce the habituation impairments of ischemic gerbils, increase the number of normal neurons and reduce the number of apoptotic neurons in hippocampal CA1 region after reperfusion. SKF38393, SCH23390 and spiperone had no effects on these changes in this transient I/R injury model. Furthermore, pergolide can significantly reduce the phosphorylation of c-Jun induced by transient forebrain ischemia.",
