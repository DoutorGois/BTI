Brain regions important in the neuroanatomic substrate of memory include the hippocampus, and sections of the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices and the thalamus. Acetylcholine and many other neurotransmitters and neuromodulators including dopamine, glutamate, GABA, the catecholamines, and estrogen modulate cognitive function. Treatment approaches to memory loss typically use Alzheimer's dementia as the template, and are discussed in this report.",
