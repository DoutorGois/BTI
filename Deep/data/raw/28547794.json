     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current antidepressants in clinic need weeks of administration and always have significant limitations. Tetrahydroxystilbene glucoside (TSG) is one of the major bioactive ingredients of Polygonum multiflorum with neuroprotective effects. This study aimed to evaluate the antidepressant effects of TSG in mice. METHODS: The antidepressant-like effects of TSG in mice were examined in the forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), and chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model of depression. The effects of CSDS and TSG on the hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway and neurogenesis were further investigated. Moreover, the pharmacological inhibitors and lentiviral-shRNA were used to explore the antidepressant mechanisms of TSG. RESULTS: TSG produced antidepressant-like effects in the FST and TST and also reversed the CSDS-induced depressive-like symptoms. Moreover, TSG treatment significantly restored the decreased hippocampal BDNF signaling pathway and neurogenesis in CSDS mice. Importantly, blockade of the hippocampal BDNF system fully abolished the antidepressant-like effects of TSG in mice. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, TSG produces antidepressant-like effects in mice via enhancement of the hippocampal BDNF system.",
