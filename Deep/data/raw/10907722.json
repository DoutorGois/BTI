     "AB": "DSP-4 is a neurotoxin highly selective for the noradrenergic nerve terminals originating from the locus coeruleus. Preliminary data suggested that its effect in a typical screening test for antidepressant drugs, the forced swimming test, is biphasic dependent on the dose. In the present study, DSP-4 was administered in four doses (5, 10, 30 and 50mg/kg) to male Wistar rats. Administration of the neurotoxin had a dose-dependent biphasic effect on immobility time in the forced swimming test 8 and 9 days later. Thus, DSP-4 at the dose of 10mg/kg increased immobility, but higher doses reduced this measure. The reduction of noradrenaline concentration in the frontal cortex and hippocampus was dose-dependent starting from the dose 10mg/kg. Cortical beta-adrenoceptor binding was increased by DSP-4 treatment at the doses 30mg/kg and 50mg/kg. These results suggest that the increase in immobility time in the forced swimming test is associated with presynaptic changes in noradrenaline availability, whereas the decrease in immobility observed after more complete denervation is associated with postsynaptic receptor supersensitivity.",
