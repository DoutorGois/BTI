     "AB": "The myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) gene (i.e., the PLP/DM20 gene) has been of some interest because of its role in certain human demyelinating diseases, such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. A substantial amount of evidence, including neuronal pathology in knock-out and transgenic animals, suggests the gene also has functions unrelated to myelin structure, but the products of the gene responsible for these putative functions have not yet been identified. Here we report the identification of a new exon of the PLP/DM20 gene and at least two new products of the gene that contain this exon. The new exon, located between exons 1 and 2, is spliced into PLP and DM20 mRNAs creating a new translation initiation site that generates PLP and DM20 proteins with a 12 amino acid leader sequence. This leader sequence appears to target these proteins to a different cellular compartment within the cell bodies of oligodendrocytes and away from the myelin membranes. Furthermore, these new products are also expressed in a number of neuronal populations within the postnatal mouse brain, including the cerebellum, hippocampus, and olfactory system. We term these products somal-restricted PLP and DM20 proteins to distinguish them from the classic PLP and DM20 proteolipids. They represent putative candidates for some of the nonmyelin-related functions of the PLP/DM20 gene.",
