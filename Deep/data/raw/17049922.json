     "AB": "Major depression is associated with reduced volumes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, whereas antidepressant treatments promote several forms of neuronal plasticity, including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and neuronal maturation, in the hippocampus. Several neurotrophic factors are associated with depression or antidepressant action. Stress suppresses brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) synthesis in the hippocampus, at least partially through a sustained modification of chromatin structure. Essentially all antidepressant treatments increase BDNF synthesis and signaling in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. This signaling is required for the behavioral effects of antidepressant drugs in rodents, and increased BDNF levels in the hippocampus mimic the behavioral effects of antidepressants. However, injection of BDNF into the mesolimbic dopamine pathway produces an opposing depression-like response. One hypothesis emerging from these data proposes that mood disorders reflect failed function of critical neuronal networks, whereas a gradual network recovery through activity-dependent neuronal plasticity induces the antidepressant effect. Neurotrophic factors themselves do not control mood, but they act as necessary tools in the activity-dependent modulation of networks, the physiological function of which determines how a plastic change influences mood.",
