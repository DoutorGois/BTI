     "AB": "Hippocampal EEG was recorded in behaving rats in which the brain stem afferents to the septal region were previously damaged. In these animals rhythmic slow activity (RSA or theta) was continuously present, including drinking and immobility. The average frequency of RSA, however, was significantly higher during running (8-9 Hz) than during drinking or awake motionless state (6-8 Hz). In normal rats irregular sharp waves, rather than RSA were present during drinking and immobility. The results suggest that brain stem afferents are necessary to suppress the rhythmic firing of septal \"pacemaker\" cells.",
