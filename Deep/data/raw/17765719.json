     "AB": "The availability of human hippocampi obtained through surgery (usually for treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy) has allowed us to investigate the properties of the human dentate in a way that cannot be done with other brain regions. The dentate has been the primary focus of these studies because of its relative preservation in all patient specimens. Moreover, there is extensive synaptic reorganization of numerous neurotransmitter systems in this the fascia dentate (dentate gyrus and the hilus) in humans with specific forms of TLE. These changes are not evident in tissue from patients with seizure that begin outside the hippocampus, and, as a result, this tissue provides an invaluable resource for comparisons. Physiological data using both slices and acutely dissociated cells demonstrate that the granule cells have membrane properties similar to those of rodents although there are specific changes that appear to be associated with seizures. Similarly, in the non-sclerotic hippocampi, the synaptic properties are similar to those reported in rodents. There are also a number of parallels between the findings in humans and in status animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy. This review will cover analyses of membrane properties as well as of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and neuromodulatory systems. Thus, while there are a number of issues that invariably arise with studies of pathological human tissue, this tissue is ideally suited to verify and refine animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy. In addition, one can argue that human tissue provides the only resource to evaluate the ways that granule cells recorded from laboratory animals approximate human granule cell physiology.",
