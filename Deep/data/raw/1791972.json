     "AB": "The effect of altered extracellular Ca concentration was studied on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) induced short-term potentiation (STP) of the population excitatory post-synaptic potential recorded from the stratum radiatum of CA1 of the rat hippocampal slice. Perfusion of 130 microM of NMDA for 10 s in control media containing 2.0 mM extracellular Ca evoked an STP with a maximum amplitude of 46% and a duration of 16 min. Perfusion of media containing a reduced Ca concentration of 0.8 mM or 1.0 mM did not alter the amplitude or time course of the STP. However, raising the Ca concentration to 3.0 mM or 4.0 mM caused a significant reduction in the amplitude of the STP to 23% and 2% respectively. The abolition of the NMDA induced STP in 4 mM Ca could not have been produced by response saturation since an identical long-term potentiation (LTP) was produced in this high Ca media as in the control media. These studies show that the NMDA induced STP has a very different Ca dependency to LTP.",
