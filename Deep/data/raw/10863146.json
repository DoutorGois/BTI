     "AB": "To clarify the mechanisms of action of carbamazepine (CBZ), we investigated the effects of CBZ on acetylcholine (ACh) release and metabolism in rat striatum and hippocampus. Acute administration of effective dose of CBZ (25 mg/kg) increased both striatal and hippocampal extracellular levels of ACh, whereas a supraeffective dose of CBZ (50 mg/kg) did not affect the levels and a toxic dose of CBZ (100 mg/kg) decreased the extracellular ACh levels in both brain regions. Both acute and chronic administrations of CBZ (25 and 50 mg/kg, mg/kg per day) increased intracellular ACh levels in striatum and hippocampus. The striatal intracellular ACh levels were decreased by both acute and chronic administrations of CBZ (100 mg/kg, mg/kg per day), whereas the hippocampal intracellular ACh levels were not affected. The effective CBZ concentration did not affect cholinesterase activity, whereas supraeffective CBZ concentration reduced it weakly. Effective dose of CBZ enhanced ACh release and synthesis; however, supraeffective doses of CBZ reduced ACh release and synthesis without enhancement of ACh degradation, indicating that CBZ has biphasic effects on ACh release and synthesis. Thus, the present findings, the slight stimulation of ACh function by effective dose of CBZ, are involved, at least partially, in the antiepileptic and mood stabilizing mechanisms of action of CBZ.",
