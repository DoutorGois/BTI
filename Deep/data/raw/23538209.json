     "AB": "Accumulating evidence indicates that the brain-gut peptide ghrelin which is expressed in hippocampus improves memory and learning processes. The MK-801, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, has also shown amnesic properties in animal model. The current study was to find out whether intracerebroventricular administration of ghrelin can prevent amnesia induced by MK-801 in rats. A week after the surgery, during which cannuals were implanted in the lateral ventricular, the animals were trained and tested in a step-through type passive avoidance task. Memory retrieval was measured by step-through latency (STL) and total time in dark compartments (TDC). In the first series of experiments, we established a dose-response relationship for ghrelin on the passive avoidance paradigm. In the second set of experiments, animals were divided to two groups. In the first group, MK-801 (0.075, 0.15 and 0.3mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) immediately after the acquisition session and in the second group MK-801 (same doses) was injected (i.p.) 30 min before the retention session. Analysis of data showed that in both groups, MK-801 impaired learning and memory. In the third set of experiments, administration of ghrelin (200 ng/rat) right after the acquisition session (i.e. before MK-801 injection) improved the MK-801 induced memory impairment, but administration of ghrelin before retrieval session did not affect the MK-801 induced memory impairment. These results show an interaction between ghrelin and glutamatergic system. A novel finding in this study is that ghrelin can prevent amnesia produced by NMDA antagonist in rats when injected in post-training phase.",
