     "AB": "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has recently been shown to signal by binding to GDNF receptor-alpha (GDNFR-alpha), after which the GDNF-GDNFR-alpha associates with and activates the tyrosine kinase receptor Ret. We have localized Ret messenger RNA (mRNA) in the developing and adult rodent and compared with to the expression of GDNF and GDNFR-alpha mRNA. Ret mRNA is strongly expressed in dopamine neurons and alpha-motor neurons as well as in thalamus, ruber and occluomotor nuclei, the habenular complex, septum, cerebellum, and brain stem nuclei. Ret mRNA was also found in several sensory systems, in ganglia, and in nonneuronal tissues such as teeth and vibrissae. Very strong Ret mRNA signals are present in kidney and the gastrointestinal tract, where Ret and GDNF mRNA expression patterns are precisely complementary. The presence of Ret protein was confirmed in adult dopamine neurons using immunohistochemistry. GDNFR-alpha mRNA was strongly expressed in the developing and adult dopamine neurons. It was also found in neurons in deep layers of cortex cerebri, in hippocampus, septum, the dentate gyrus, tectum, and the developing spinal cord. In the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract, GDNFR-alpha mRNA and Ret mRNA distribution overlapped. Dorsal root ganglia, cranial ganglia, and developing peripheral nerves were also positive. GDNFR-alpha was additionally found in sensory areas and in developing teeth. Sensory areas included inner ear, eye, olfactory epithelium, and the vomeronasal organ, as well as developing tongue papillae. The temporospatial pattern of expression of GDNFR-alpha mRNA did not always match that of Ret mRNA. For instance, GDNFR-alpha mRNA was also found in the developing ventral striatum, including the olfactory tubercle, and in hippocampus. These areas seemed devoid of Ret mRNA, suggesting that GDNFR-alpha might also have functions unrelated to Ret.",
