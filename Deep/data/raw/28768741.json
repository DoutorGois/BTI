     "AB": "The ability to distill specific frequencies from complex spatiotemporal patterns of afferent inputs is a pivotal functional requirement for neurons residing in networks receiving frequency-multiplexed inputs. Although the expression of theta-frequency subthreshold resonance is established in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, it is not known if their spike initiation dynamics manifest spectral selectivity, or if their intrinsic properties are tuned to process gamma-frequency inputs. Here, we measured the spike-triggered average (STA) of rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons through electrophysiological recordings and quantified spectral selectivity in their spike initiation dynamics and their coincidence detection window (CDW). Our results revealed strong theta-frequency selectivity in the STA, which was also endowed with gamma-range CDW, with prominent neuron-to-neuron variability that manifested distinct pairwise dissociations and correlations with different intrinsic measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the STA and its measurements substantially adapted to the state of the neuron defined by its membrane potential and to the statistics of its afferent inputs. Finally, we tested the effect of pharmacologically blocking the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels on the STA and found that the STA characteristic frequency reduced significantly to the delta-frequency band after HCN channel blockade. This delta-frequency selectivity in the STA emerged in the absence of subthreshold resonance, which was abolished by HCN channel blockade, thereby confirming computational predictions on the dissociation between these two forms of spectral selectivity. Our results expand the roles of HCN channels to theta-frequency selectivity in the spike initiation dynamics, apart from underscoring the critical role of interactions among different ion channels in regulating neuronal physiology.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We had previously predicted, using computational analyses, that the spike-triggered average (STA) of hippocampal neurons would exhibit theta-frequency (4-10 Hz) spectral selectivity and would manifest coincidence detection capabilities for inputs in the gamma-frequency band (25-150 Hz). Here, we confirmed these predictions through direct electrophysiological recordings of STA from rat CA1 pyramidal neurons and demonstrate that blocking HCN channels reduces the frequency of STA spectral selectivity to the delta-frequency range (0.5-4 Hz).",
