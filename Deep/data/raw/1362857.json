     "AB": "The levels of five amino acids together with glutamine synthetase activity, were measured in brain regions of rats with bilateral adrenalectomy, performed in newly weaning rats on postnatal day 22 and sacrificed 3 months later. Adrenalectomy caused a general decrease of glutamine concentration in three hippocampal regions (CA1-CA2, CA3, CA4-dentate gyrus), in hypothalamus, striatum and cerebellum. This reduction, which was particularly significant in hippocampus and cerebellum, was paralleled by a decrease of glutamine synthetase activity. Treatment with corticosterone reversed the effect of adrenalectomy. Little or no change was observed in the tissue levels of taurine, aspartic, glutamic or gamma-amino butyric acids.",
