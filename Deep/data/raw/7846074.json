     "AB": "Protease nexin I (PNI) is a member of the family of serine protease inhibitors (serpins) that have been shown to promote neurite outgrowth in vitro from different neuronal cell types. These include neuroblastoma cells, hippocampal neurons, and sympathetic neurons. Free PNI protein is markedly decreased in various anatomical brain regions, including hippocampus, of patients with Alzheimer disease. Here, we report that PNI rescued spinal motoneurons during the period of naturally occurring (programmed) cell death in the chicken in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, PNI prevented axotomy-induced spinal motoneuron death in the neonatal mouse. The survival effect of PNI on motoneurons during the period of programmed cell death was not associated with increased intramuscular nerve branching. PNI also significantly increased the nuclear size of motoneurons during the period of programmed cell death and prevented axotomy-induced atrophy of surviving motoneurons. These results are consistent with the possible role of PNI as a neurotrophic agent. They also support the idea that serine proteases or, more precisely, the balance of proteases and serpins may be involved in regulating the fate of neuronal cells during development.",
