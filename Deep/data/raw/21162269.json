     "AB": "AIM: To investigate the effect of Naoyikang serum on the damage induced by glutamate in hippocampal neuron. METHODS: Morphological observation, MTT assay and nuclear DNA-associated fluorescence with DAPI dye were applied to evaluate the viability of hippocampal neuron, immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR were used to determine the expression of PTEN. RESULTS: A decreased viability and increased expression of PTEN were shown in hippocampal neuron in response to the treatment with glutamate. It was shown that the percentage of cell death and the expression of PTEN were reduced by the treatment with Naoyikang serum. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Naoyikang may prevent the toxicity of glutamate by suppressing the expression of PTEN.",
