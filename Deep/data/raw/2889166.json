     "AB": "The effects of ketamine and (+)cyclazocine on three in vitro models of epilepsy: the \"Mg2+ free\", the 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and, for comparison, the penicillin model were studied. These data indicate that the two compounds had an inhibitory effect in hippocampal slices of rats, bathed in \"Mg2+ free\" solution at a concentration that did not influence the basal field potential. They also had an inhibitory effect on the penicillin model, but at concentrations ten times greater than those effective against \"Mg2+ free\" model. On the other hand, (+)cyclazocine was equally active against epileptogenic activity produced by 4-AP and \"Mg2+ free\" solution, while ketamine failed to produce an effect on epileptiform activity induced by 4-AP.",
