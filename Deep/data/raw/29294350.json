     "AB": "The early electrophysiological phenomena linked to systemic inflammation are largely underexplored. We developed here local field analyses to detect prodromal oscillatory abnormalities. We identified early band-specific patterns in local field potential recorded from freely-moving rats injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1mg/kg). Theta frequency was significantly reduced and this effect was not related to the decreased locomotion of the animal. Furthermore, LPS-induced alterations show a region-specific response when compared between the hippocampal region and medial prefrontal cortex. Delta mean frequency increased in the hippocampal region but not in the prefrontal cortex. We explored also the hypothesis that systemic inflammation increases the propensity of abnormally synchronized brain activity. Our data indicate that the LPS-evoked alteration of delta and theta frequency parameters reflects the formation of abnormal synchronization in similar frequency ranges. The onset of abnormal brain activity was indicated by spike-wave discharges in the range of 1-10Hz with three main frequency domains. Importantly, the occurrence of spike-wave discharges was observed in the hippocampus but not in the cortex. In summary, the hippocampal theta rhythm is an accurate indicator of the oscillatory changes evoked by LPS application. The findings offer clear patterns of altered brain function that will facilitate mechanistic investigations of brain dysfunction and delirium occurring during sepsis.",
