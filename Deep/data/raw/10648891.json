     "AB": "The calcium-binding protein calbindin D28k (CB) is expressed in limited subpopulations of neurons in the brain. In the hippocampus, CB is expressed in all dentate granule cells and a subpopulation of CA1 pyramidal neurons, but is absent from CA3 neurons. This pattern of CB expression is inversely correlated with neuronal vulnerability to seizure-induced damage suggesting the possibility that expression of CB confers resistance to excitotoxicity. While data from cell culture studies support an excitoprotective role for calbindin, it is not known whether CB is a key determinant of neuronal vulnerability in vivo. We therefore examined the pattern of damage to hippocampal neurons following intrahippocampal injection of the seizure-inducing excitotoxin kainate in CB homozygous (CB-/-) and CB heterozygous (CB+/-) knockout mice in comparison with wild-type mice (CB+/+). Whereas the extent of damage to CA1 neurons was similar in CB-/- and CB+/+ mice, damage to CA1 neurons was significantly reduced in CB+/- mice. Dentate granule neurons were not damaged following kainate-induced seizures in CB+/+, CB+/- or CB-/- mice. These findings suggest that CB can modify vulnerability of hippocampal CA1 neurons to seizure-induced injury, and that either CB is not a critical determinant of resistance of dentate granule neurons, or compensatory changes occur and lack of CB is not the only difference between CB-/- and CB+/+ mice.",
