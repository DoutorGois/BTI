     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the changes of expression of heat-shock proteins (HSP) 70 mRNA in hippocampus of rats after diffuse axonal injury (DAI). METHODS: RT-PCR products of HSP70 mRNA were tested by agarose gel electrophoresis after RT-PCR amplification. The changes of HSP70 mRNA expression were observed in rat hippocampus after DAI. RESULTS: The expression of HSP70 mRNA in the hippocampus could be detected 4 h after DAI. It reached maximum at 24 h and declined after 48 h. CONCLUSION: HSP70 mRNA in hippocampus of rats could be useful for diagnosis of DAI.",
