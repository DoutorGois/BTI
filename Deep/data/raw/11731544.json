     "AB": "The slow Ca2+-activated K+ current (sI(AHP)) plays a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability, but its modulation during abnormal bursting activity, as in epilepsy, is unknown. Because synaptic transmission is enhanced during epilepsy, we investigated the synaptically mediated regulation of the sI(AHP) and its control of neuronal excitability during epileptiform activity induced by 4-aminopyridine (4AP) or 4AP+Mg2+-free treatment in rat hippocampal slices. We used electrophysiological and photometric Ca2+ techniques to analyze the sI(AHP) modifications that parallel epileptiform activity. Epileptiform activity was characterized by slow, repetitive, spontaneous depolarizations and action potential bursts and was associated with increased frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents and a reduced sI(AHP.) The metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist (S)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine did not modify synaptic activity enhancement but did prevent sI(AHP) inhibition and epileptiform discharges. The mGluR-dependent regulation of the sI(AHP) was not caused by modulated intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Histamine, isoproterenol, and (+/-)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid reduced the sI(AHP) but did not increase synaptic activity and failed to evoke epileptiform activity. We conclude that 4AP or 4AP+Mg-free-induced enhancement of synaptic activity reduced the sI(AHP) via activation of postsynaptic group I/II mGluRs. The increased excitability caused by the lack of negative feedback provided by the sI(AHP) contributes to epileptiform activity, which requires the cooperative action of increased synaptic activity.",
