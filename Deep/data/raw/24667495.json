     "AB": "Healthy subjects differ in the memory system they engage to learn dual-solution tasks. Both genotype and stress experience could contribute to this phenotypic variability. The present experiments tested whether the hippocampus and the dorsal striatum, the core nodes of two different memory systems, are differently involved in 24 h retention of a stress-associated memory in two genetically unrelated inbred strains of mice. Mice from both the C57BL/6J and the DBA/2J inbred strains showed progressive increase of immobility during 10 min exposure to forced swim (FS) and retrieved the acquired levels of immobility when tested 24h later. The pattern of c-fos immunostaining promoted by FS revealed activation of a large number of brain areas in both strains, including CA1 and CA3 fields of the hippocampus. However, only DBA/2J mice showed activation of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). In addition, FS induced a positive correlation between c-fos expression in the amygdala and CA1 and CA3 in C57BL/6J mice whereas it induced a positive correlation between c-fos expression in the amygdala and DLS in DBA/2J mice. Finally, temporary post-training inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus, by local infusion of lidocaine, prevented 24h retention of immobility in C57BL/6J mice only, whereas inactivation of the DLS prevented retention in DBA/2J mice only. These findings support the view that genetic factors can determine whether the dorsal hippocampus or the DLS are selectively engaged to consolidate stress-related memory.",
