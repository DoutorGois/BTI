     "AB": "The mu opioid receptor gene Oprm is alternatively spliced into many variants, providing for the multiplicity of mu opioid receptor subtypes. One of the mouse variants, mMOR-1B4, is unique in that it displays high affinity towards a wide range of mu opioid receptor antagonists, but poor affinity towards most classical mu opioid agonists. The present study examined the immunohistochemical distribution of the mMOR-1B4 variant in mouse brain and spinal cord. mMOR-1B4-like immunoreactivity (mMOR-1B4-LI) was enriched in many regions of the brain, spinal cord and in the dorsal root ganglia. Some of the structures showing prominent mMOR-1B4-LI include the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, hippocampus, habenular nucleus, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, medium eminence, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, oculomotor nucleus, red nucleus, raphe nuclei, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, trigeminal nucleus, reticular formation, area postrema and Purkinje cell layer and deep nuclei of cerebellum. mMOR-1B4-LI was present in afferent neurons of the dorsal root ganglia and their projecting fibers into the superficial laminae of the spinal dorsal horn. Some motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord also were immunopositive. The overall distribution of mMOR-1B4-LI in the central nervous system is distinguishable from previously characterized variants such as MOR-1-LI, MOR-1C-LI and exon-11-LI. These studies provide evidence for the region- and neuron-specific processing of the Oprm gene and support the possibility of functional differences among the variants.",
