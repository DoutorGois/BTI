     "AB": "Fibrillar amyloid beta (fAbeta) peptide is the major component of Abeta plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Inflammatory mediators have previously been proposed to be drivers of Abeta pathology in AD patients by increasing amyloidogenic processing of APP and promoting Abeta accumulation, but recent data have shown that expression of various inflammatory cytokines attenuates Abeta pathology in mouse models. In an effort to further study the role of different inflammatory cytokines on Abeta pathology in vivo, we explored the effect of murine Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (mTNFalpha) in regulating Abeta accumulation. Recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV2/1) mediated expression of mTNFalpha in the hippocampus of 4 month old APP transgenic TgCRND8 mice resulted in significant reduction in hippocampal Abeta burden. No changes in APP levels or APP processing were observed in either mTNFalpha expressing APP transgenic mice or in non-transgenic littermates. Analysis of Abeta plaque burden in mTNFalpha expressing mice showed that even after substantial reduction compared to EGFP expressing age-matched controls, the Abeta plaque burden levels of the former do not decrease to the levels of 4 month old unmanipulated mice. Taken together, our data suggests that proinflammatory cytokine expression induced robust glial activation can attenuate plaque deposition. Whether such an enhanced microglial response actually clears preexisting deposits without causing bystander neurotoxicity remains an open question.",
