     "AB": "Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration was measured in rat striatal and hippocampal synaptosomes. Incubation in 50 mM K+ medium caused a decrease in both striatal and hippocampal cAMP: this effect was dependent on extracellular Ca2+. Replacement of NaCl with sucrose in the incubation medium increased cAMP. Incubation with 0.5 mM ouabain was without effect.",
