     "AB": "Recent studies have focused on the role of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) in brain injury. The present study is aimed at verifying memory, anxiety/depression parameters, and cellular viability in the brain of mice preconditioned with NMDA and subjected to the model of mild traumatic brain injury. For this purpose, male albino CF-1 mice were pre-treated with NMDA (75 mg/kg) and subjected to brain trauma, and after 24h submitted to memory tasks and anxiety and depression-like behavioral tests. The memory tests were evaluated at 1.5h, 24h, and 7 days after the training. In addition, the cellular viability was evaluated in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus 96 h after the trauma. It was observed that the cellular viability was reduced in the hippocampus of the mice subjected to trauma and the preconditioning with NMDA was able to protect this damage. All mice learnt the task in the habituation test, but in the object recognition task the mice preconditioned with NMDA were protected against impairment induced by TBI in both short and long-term memory. On the other hand, in the step-down inhibitory avoidance test, only the mice treated with NMDA showed impairment of long-term memory (7 days after training session). The evaluation of anxiety/depression behavior showed no changes after TBI. In conclusion, NMDA preconditioning induced impairment of the long-term memory; however, it was able to protect against the novel recognition memory impairment and increase the cellular survival in the hippocampus of mice exposed to traumatic brain injury.",
