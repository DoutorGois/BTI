     "AB": "The rat hippocampus receives a dense noradrenergic innervation originating exclusively from the locus coeruleus. The present electrophysiological study was undertaken to characterize the adrenoceptor mediating the suppressant effect of microiontophoretically applied norepinephrine (NE) on CA1 and CA3 dorsal hippocampus pyramidal neurons of the rat. The rank order of potency of microiontophoretically applied agonists, in suppressing the firing rate of hippocampus pyramidal neurons was: oxymetazoline greater than NE greater than phenylephrine greater than isoproterenol greater than clonidine. In the hippocampus, oxymetazoline was more potent than NE, whereas it was ineffective in the lateral geniculate nucleus where the effect of NE is mediated by an alpha 1-adrenoceptor. Low currents of clonidine antagonized the effect of NE suggesting that clonidine may exert a partial agonistic effect. The rank order of potency of i.v. administered adrenergic antagonists in blocking the suppressant effect of microiontophoretically applied NE was: idazoxan much greater than prazosin much greater than propranolol. Idazoxan also blocked the effect of oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, and isoproterenol but did not modify the effect of microiontophoretically applied gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In addition, idazoxan, applied by microiontophoresis, readily blocked the suppressant effect of NE without affecting that of GABA. These results suggest that the suppressant effect of microiontophoretically applied NE on rat dorsal hippocampus pyramidal neurons is primarily mediated by alpha 2-adrenoceptors.",
