     "AB": "The highest MAO was found in alert ground squirrels and it became minimum in hibernating animals. The temperature relations of the oxidative serotonin desamination (OSD) in alert ground squirrels was relatively low from 7 to 37 degrees C. At the beginning of hibernation OSD did not differ from that of alert animals at 22--37 degrees C, while at 7--22 degrees C it was significantly lower--about 1.0. In hibernating ground squirrels, high OSD was observed at low and high temperatures in all parts of the brain except hypothalamus. At awaikening OSD remained high.",
