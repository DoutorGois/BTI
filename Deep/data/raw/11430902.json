     "AB": "Hippocampal cells are particularly vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease but the cause of cell death is unknown. Amyloid toxicity has been implicated in hippocampal cell death, but its specific mechanisms are poorly understood. We used confocal microscopy to examine the effects of the amyloid peptide fragment 25-35 (Abeta(25-35)) on cell death in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Addition of glutamate to the culture medium significantly improved nerve cell survival in cultures subjected to consecutive medium exchanges. This effect was lost if cultures were treated with the amyloid peptide fragment Abeta(25-35) but not the inactive peptide 35-25. These data suggest that one of the mechanisms responsible for amyloid toxicity may be inhibition of the survival promoting effects of extracellular glutamate.",
