     "AB": "In adults, the neural substrate associated with encoding memories connected to a specific time and place include the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe (MTL). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, this research studied the developmental trajectory of this frontal-MTL system by comparing 7- and 8-year-old children to those who were 10 or older in conditions that promoted episodic encoding. In 1 condition, participants generated verbs from nouns heard; in another, they listened to short stories for comprehension. Regions in which brain activation predicted subsequent recognition memory performance were identified. These included the left prefrontal cortex, but not MTL, in the verb generation condition for both age groups. In the story comprehension condition, activation in left posterior MTL predicted subsequent memory performance in both age groups, and activation in left anterior MTL (including the hippocampus proper) and left prefrontal cortex predicted subsequent memory only for the older children. These results illustrate both similarities and differences in how brain systems interact in development to mediate the formation of episodic memories.",
