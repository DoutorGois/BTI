     "AB": "The effects of tetrahydro-9-aminoacridine (THA), an anticholinesterase drug, have been studied in the rat both in vivo (cerebral cortex) and in vitro (CA1 field of the hippocampus) and compared with those of physostigmine. In the cerebral cortex THA potentiated the excitatory effect of acetylcholine in most neurons, including cortical neurons recorded from chronic unanesthetized animals. In vitro, THA (but not physostigmine) had a depolarizing, atropine- and tetrodotoxin-insensitive effect. This effect is associated with an increase in membrane resistance which suggests a direct effect of THA on hippocampal neurons. In addition THA blocked the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential. At the same concentration THA potentiated the slow cholinergic excitatory postsynaptic potential produced by electrical stimulation of the cholinergic afferents. Its potency was, however, about 10 times lower than that of physostigmine. These results show that THA: (1) is an anticholinesterase much less potent than physostigmine; but (2) has also direct effects on central neurons, not observed with physostigmine and unrelated to its anticholinesterase activity.",
