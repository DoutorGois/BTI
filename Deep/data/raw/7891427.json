     "AB": "This is a case of Alzheimer disease with myoclonus and periodic spikes on EEG. A 56-year-old man developed progressive dementia and, 3 years later, generalized convulsions. Eight years later, he showed myoclonus and periodic spikes on EEG. Cranial CT showed cortical atrophy and ventricular dilatation. He became apallic and died of pneumonia at the age of 65.9 years after the onset of the disease. The brain weighed 1,050 g. Neuropathologically, diffuse neuronal loss, abundant neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, particularly diffuse plaques, were found extensively in the cerebral cortex. The white matter was preserved. In the Ammon's horn, abundant neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques were observed. Grumose degeneration of the cerebellar dentate nucleus, Kuru plaques or prions were not found. Numerous diffuse plaques of the cerebral cortex have rarely been reported in autopsy cases of Alzheimer disease with myoclonus and periodic spikes on EEG.",
