     "AB": "It has been suggested that theta rhythm gates the flow of information between the hippocampus and cortex during memory processes. The cholinergic system plays an important role in regulating vigilance states and in generating theta rhythm. This study aims to analyse the effects of the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine (120 and 360 microg, i.c.v.) on hippocampal and frontal cortical theta rhythm during several vigilance states in rats. Pilocarpine injection increased the duration and number of episodes with theta activity, particularly when theta rhythm appeared during waking states in the cortex and hippocampus simultaneously. It seems that the effects of pilocarpine are related to the appearance of cortical theta activity in waking states, and suggest that pilocarpine could modify the transference rate of information from the hippocampus to cortex in rats during wakefulness states, in relation to the postulated effect of cholinergic system modulating memory consolidation.",
