     "AB": "Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) with the broad spectrum mGluR agonist 1S,3R ACPD (10-50 microM) induced spontaneous field potentials at low frequencies ('burst-mode' activity; <1 Hz) in the CA3 region of rat hippocampal slices. At higher concentrations (100-400 microM) ACPD switched this form of activity to a second, more complex pattern of activity in which intermittent episodes of theta frequency oscillations predominated ('theta-mode' activity; 4-14 Hz). Both patterns of activity were evoked by selective activation of group I mGluRs and, in particular, could be induced by activation of mGluR5 alone using the subtype selective agonist CHPG (0.5-5 mM). In contrast, activation of group II mGluRs (DCG IV; 100 microM) produced only burst-mode behaviour whilst activation of group III mGluRs (L-AP4; 100 microM) did not result in synchronised network activity. Concurrent extra- and intracellular recordings demonstrated that this mGluR-induced theta-mode activity represented the synchronous firing of CA3 pyramidal cells and that it shared a similar temporal signature to that generated by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). Furthermore, application of mGluR and mAChR agonists at concentrations sufficient to produce only burst-mode activity when applied individually, produced theta-mode activity when co-applied. These data suggest that the level of activation of different mGluRs and mAChRs crucially determine the pattern of rhythmical network activity generated in the hippocampal CA3 network. These results also indicate that individual receptor subtypes (i.e. mGluR5) can initiate patterns of coherent network activity but that interactions between the cholinergic and glutamatergic transmitter systems may also be important factors in governing the temporal patterning of hippocampal network activity.",
