     "AB": "The monoacylglycerol 2-arachidonylglycerol is an endogenous ligand of cannabinoid receptors. We examined whether 2-arachidonylglycerol can influence excessive neuronal activity by investigating stimulation-induced population spikes and epileptiform activity in rat hippocampal slices. For this purpose, the effects of 2-arachidonylglycerol were compared with those of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2. At concentrations of 10-50 microM, 2-arachidonylglycerol attenuated the amplitude of the orthodromic population spike and the slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (field EPSP). However, the effect of the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (R(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolol[ 1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazinyl]-(1-naphthalenyl)methanone; 0.1 microM and 1 microM) was significantly higher than that of the endogenous ligand. At a concentration of 1 microM, WIN 55,212-2 completely suppressed the field EPSP. However, none of the investigated compounds did affect the presynaptic fiber spike of the afferents. The CB1 receptor antagonist SR 141716 (N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorphenyl)-4-methyl-3- pyrazole-carboxamide) blocked the inhibition evoked by the cannabinoids. Both 2-arachidonylglycerol (30 microM) and WIN 55,212-2 (100 nM) shifted the input-output curve of the postsynaptic spike and the field EPSP to the right and increased the magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation, indicating a presynaptic mechanism of action. 2-Arachidonylglycerol and WIN 55,212-2 attenuated the frequency of spontaneously occurring epileptiform burst discharges in CA3 elicited by omission of Mg2+ and elevation of K+ to 8 mM. The antiepileptiform effect of these cannabinoids was blocked by SR 141716. In conclusion, 2-arachidonylglycerol seems to limit neuronal excitability via cannabinoid receptors of the CB1 type. By acting predominantly at a presynaptic site, it is capable of reducing excitatory neurotransmission, a mechanism which might be involved in the prevention of excessive excitability leading to epileptiform activity.",
