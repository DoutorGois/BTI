     "AB": "It has been reported that the antiepileptic drug qingyangshenylycosides (QYS) modulated the function of GABAergic system. However, little is known about the effects of QYS on the gene expression of GABA receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). In the present study, we examined the effects of QYS on the expression of GABAA receptor subunits in different regions of the mouse brain. The results showed that treatment of QYS significantly increased the expressions of Gabra1, Gabra2 and Gabr4 and decreased the expression of Gabrg2 in inferior colliculus. Moreover, Gabrb2 expression was up-regulated and Gabra5 was down-regulated in hippocampus, while the expressions of Gabra1 and Gabrb2 were induced in cortex after QYS treatment. These data indicated that QYS had different effects on the expression of GABAA receptor subunits in different brain regions. These results may help to reveal the molecular mechanism of anticonvulsant action of QYS.",
