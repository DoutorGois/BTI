     "AB": "The effect of adenosine analogues and some putative neurotransmitters have been studied on cyclic AMP accumulation in rat hippocampal slices treated with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. The effects of PGE2 and histamine were potentiated by forskolin (0.1 microM). Isoprenaline and NECA had essentially additive effects with 0.1 microM forskolin and serotonin (above 10(-4) M) inhibited forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. The A1-adenosine receptor selective adenosine analogue R-PIA inhibited forskolin stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in low doses and stimulated in high. NECA, adenosine and 2-chloroadenosine uniformly stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine inhibited, but only at high concentrations. Both the stimulatory and the inhibitory effects of R-PIA were antagonized by 8-phenyltheophylline (10 microM). Enprofylline (100 microM) selectively inhibited the stimulatory effect. In the presence of enprofylline both 2-chloroadenosine showed an inhibitory effect on cyclic AMP accumulation. It is concluded that the forskolin-treated rat hippocampal slice is a useful preparation to study both stimulatory and inhibitory effects of transmitters and modulators on adenylate cyclase. The results also show that the rat hippocampus has both A1-receptors that are linked to inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation and A2-receptors that are linked to stimulation. Furthermore, enprofylline is shown to selectively antagonize the stimulatory response, revealing inhibitory effects of compounds such as 2-chloroadenosine and adenosine.",
