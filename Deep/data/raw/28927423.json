     "AB": "BACKGROUND: The primary cilium is an organelle that can act as a master regulator of cellular signaling. Despite the presence of primary cilia in hippocampal neurons, their function is not fully understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that the primary cilium influences interleukin (IL)-1beta-induced NF-kappaB signaling, ultimately mediating the inflammatory response. We, therefore, investigated ciliary function and NF-kappaB signaling in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in conjunction with ciliary length analysis. METHODS: Since TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling is a well-known inflammatory pathway, we measured ciliary length and inflammatory mediators in wild type (WT) and TLR4(-/-) mice injected with LPS. Next, to exclude the effects of microglial TLR4, we examined the ciliary length, ciliary components, inflammatory cytokine, and mediators in HT22 hippocampal neuronal cells. RESULTS: Primary ciliary length decreased in hippocampal pyramidal neurons after intracerebroventricular injection of LPS in WT mice, whereas it increased in TLR4(-/-) mice. LPS treatment decreased primary ciliary length, activated NF-kappaB signaling, and increased Cox2 and iNOS levels in HT22 hippocampal neurons. In contrast, silencing Kif3a, a key protein component of cilia, increased ARL13B ciliary protein levels and suppressed NF-kappaB signaling and expression of inflammatory mediators. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that LPS-induced NF-kappaB signaling and inflammatory mediator expression are modulated by cilia and that the blockade of primary cilium formation by Kif3a siRNA regulates TLR4-induced NF-kappaB signaling. We propose that primary cilia are critical for regulating NF-kappaB signaling events in neuroinflammation and in the innate immune response.",
