     "AB": "The effects of excess glutamate on the survival rate of cultured hippocampal neurons, the population spike (PS) of CA1 area of hippocampal slices and the Ca(2+) current of hippocampal neurons were observed in rats. Decreased survival rate of hippocampal neurons in the presence of excess glutamate was partially reversed by 5-HT, which was in association with a less decrease of PS magnitudes. The Ca(2+) inward current induced by glutamate was significantly diminished in the presence of 5-HT. It is suggested that 5-HT can inhibit excess glutamate-induced neurotoxicity by suppressing the glutamate triggered calcium influx.",
