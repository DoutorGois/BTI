     "AB": "The present study aimed to elucidate the distribution of betaine/gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter-1 (BGT-1) in the normal monkey cerebral neocortex and hippocampus by immunoperoxidase and Immunogold labelling. BGT-1 was observed in pyramidal neurons in the cerebral neocortex and the CA fields of the hippocampus. Large numbers of small diameter dendrites or dendritic spines were observed in the neuropil. These made asymmetrical synaptic contacts with unlabelled axon terminals containing small round vesicles, characteristic of glutamatergic terminals. BGT-1 label was observed in an extra-perisynaptic region, away from the post-synaptic density. Immunoreactivity was not observed in portions of dendrites that formed symmetrical synapses, axon terminals, or glial cells. The distribution of BGT-1 on dendritic spines, rather than at GABAergic axon terminals, suggests that the transporter is unlikely to play a major role in terminating the action of GABA at a synapse. Instead, the osmolyte betaine is more likely to be the physiological substrate of BGT-1 in the brain, and the presence of the transporter in pyramidal neurons suggests that these neurons utilize betaine to maintain osmolarity.",
