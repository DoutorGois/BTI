     "AB": "The techniques of extracellular single cell recording and microiontophoresis were used to study the effect of 5-HT3 receptor agonists on glutamate-activated firing of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells. Iontophoretic application of 5-HT3 receptor agonists 2-methyl-5-HT and SR 57227A produced a current (dose)-dependent suppression of the firing of CA1 pyramidal cells; SR 57227A was more effective than 2-methyl-5-HT. The suppressant action of 2-methyl-5-HT and SR 57227A had a slow onset and showed little or no desensitization. This effect was markedly attenuated or completely blocked by the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist BRL 46470A but not by the nonspecific 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist metergoline or by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100478. Intravenous administration of SR 57227A was effective in reducing the firing rate of CA1 pyramidal cells and this effect was prevented by BRL 46470A administered either i.v. or iontophoretically. Iontophoresis of 2-methyl-5-HT also diminished CA1 postsynaptic field potentials evoked by electrical stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals. Again, BRL 46470A but not metergoline prevented the suppressant action of 2-methyl-5-HT. Taken together, our results indicate that activation of 5-HT3-like receptors in the hippocampal CA1 region effectively reduces the efficacy of glutamatergic neurotransmission.",
