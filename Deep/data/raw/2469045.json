     "AB": "Galanin immunoreactivity has been shown to be present in cholinergic magnocellular basal forebrain neurons in both rat and monkey brain. In the present study galanin immunoreactivity in human substantia innominata was found in both the magnocellular neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert and in a dorsomedial group of intensely immunoreactive parvocellular neurons. Scattered galanin-immunoreactive fibers, but no immunoreactive neurons, were found in normal human cerebral cortex. Galanin-immunoreactive neurites were found in a small number of senile plaques in the hippocampus and temporal isocortex of Alzheimer's disease patients. The existence of galanin immunoreactivity in human magnocellular basal forebrain neurons which are depleted in Alzheimer's disease suggests that galanin may be similarly affected.",
