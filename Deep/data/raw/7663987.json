     "AB": "We have examined the changes in GABAA-mediated synaptic potentials recorded from CA3 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slice cultures following application of zinc (Zn2+). Unlike 4-AP, Zn2+ did not enhance fast hyperpolarizing potentials but primarily enhanced depolarizing GABAA potentials. Zn2+ did not alter the postsynaptic response of pyramidal neurons to pressure applied GABA, consistent with previous reports that Zn2+ enhances the release of GABA from presynaptic terminals. To examine the role of local circuitry in the production of Zn2+ responses, we recorded from cultures maintained for 7-10 days following removal of the dentate and hilus to allow complete degeneration of the mossy fibers (DGX cultures). Zn2+ produced giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) in DGX cultures that were identical to those in intact cultures. In contrast, the 4-AP response was dramatically altered in DGX cultures. In DGX cultures, Zn2+ co-applied with 4-AP appeared to inhibit the production of fast hyperpolarizing GABAA synaptic potentials produced by 4-AP alone. This inhibition of fast hyperpolarizing potentials suggests that Zn2+ may reduce the release of GABA onto pyramidal cell somata. These observations suggest that Zn2+ enhances GABA release from local circuit neurons that synapse onto pyramidal cell dendrites, and inhibits GABA release onto pyramidal cell somata.",
