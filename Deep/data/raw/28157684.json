     "AB": "Deregulated Cdk5 causes neurotoxic amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) processing and cell death, two hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, through the Foxo3 transcriptional factor in hippocampal cells, primary neurons and an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Using an innovative chemical genetic screen, we identified Foxo3 as a direct substrate of Cdk5 in brain lysates. Cdk5 directly phosphorylates Foxo3, which increased its levels and nuclear translocation. Nuclear Foxo3 initially rescued cells from ensuing oxidative stress by upregulating MnSOD (also known as SOD2). However, following prolonged exposure, Foxo3 upregulated Bim (also known as BCL2L11) and FasL (also known as FASLG) causing cell death. Active Foxo3 also increased Abeta(1-42) levels in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. These events were completely inhibited either by expressing phosphorylation-resistant Foxo3 or by depleting Cdk5 or Foxo3, highlighting a key role for Cdk5 in regulating Foxo3. These results were confirmed in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model, which exhibited increased levels and nuclear localization of Foxo3 in hippocampal neurons, which preceded neurodegeneration and Abeta plaque formation, indicating this phenomenon is an early event in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Collectively, these results show that Cdk5-mediated phospho-regulation of Foxo3 can activate several genes that promote neuronal death and aberrant Abeta processing, thereby contributing to the progression of neurodegenerative pathologies.",
