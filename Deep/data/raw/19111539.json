     "AB": "Hippocampal neuronal death following transient global ischemia in the mouse takes days to occur, providing a potential timeframe for therapeutic intervention. Since matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) enhances inflammation and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) promotes apoptosis in ischemia, we hypothesized that they are involved in neuronal death secondary to transient global ischemia. Timp-3 knockout (T3KO) and wild type (T3WT) mice underwent 30 min bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO), which causes hippocampal neuronal death 7 days after reperfusion. Mice lacking the Timp-3 gene have significantly less astrocytosis, microglial reactivity, MMP-3 activity and neuronal cell death. In addition, T3KO mice had decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 (TNFR1) expression and increased TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) activity. Mmp-3 KO mice with a similar BCAO showed significantly fewer microglial cells, reduced TNF-alpha expression, and less neuronal death than the Mmp-3 WT. To see if TIMP-3 and MMP-3 cell death pathways were independent, we blocked MMPs with the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, BB-94, on days 3 through 6 of reperfusion in T3WT and T3KO mice. BB-94 rescued hippocampal neurons at 7 days in both T3WT and T3KO mice, but significantly fewer neurons died in T3KO mice treated with BB-94. Our results indicate a novel additive role for TIMP-3 and MMP-3 in delayed neuronal death, and show that delayed treatment with MMP inhibitors can be used to reduce hippocampal death.",
