     "AB": "Long-term facilitation in extracellularly recorded population spikes was demonstrated by repeated paired stimulation (RPS) in CA1 neurons of the guinea pig hippocampal slices. Paired stimulation, consisting of a single orthodromic \"test\" stimulus and a train (5 pulses at 200 Hz) of antidromic stimuli with an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 20, 500 msec or 1 sec was repeated every 5 sec over a 250 sec period. The amplitude of the population spike in response to the test stimulus increased gradually after RPS and reached a plateau level 30-50 min after RPS. The plateau value was dependent on ISI; the shorter the ISI the greater the increase of responses. In contrast, no facilitation was observed when either the test stimulus or the antidromic stimuli were applied separately, without pairing.",
