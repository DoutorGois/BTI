     "AB": "The role of the dopamine transporter (DAT) in mediating the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine (METH) was tested in mice lacking DAT. Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) content, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, and free radical formation were assessed as markers of METH neurotoxicity in the striatum and/or hippocampus of wild-type, heterozygote, and homozygote (DAT -/-) mice. Four injections of METH (15 mg/kg, s.c.), each given 2 hr apart, produced 80 and 30% decreases in striatal DA and 5-HT levels, respectively, in wild-type animals 2 d after administration. In addition, GFAP mRNA and protein expression levels, extracellular DA levels, and free radical formation were increased markedly. Hippocampal 5-HT content was decreased significantly as well (43%). Conversely, no significant changes were observed in total DA content, GFAP expression, extracellular DA levels, or free radical formation in the striatum of DAT -/- mice after METH administration. However, modest decreases were observed in striatal and hippocampal 5-HT levels (10 and 17%, respectively). These observations demonstrate that DAT is required for, and DA is an essential mediator of, METH-induced striatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity, whereas serotonergic deficits are only partially dependent on DAT.",
