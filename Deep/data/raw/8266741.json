     "AB": "Effects of long-term treatment of haloperidol on D2 dopamine receptors in various brain areas were examined. Haloperidol treatment was found to increase the number of binding sites of D2 dopamine receptors in striatum, olfactory tubercle, hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, while Bmax of D2 receptors in hippocampus was decreased by haloperidol treatment. Therefore it is suggested that D2 dopamine receptors in hippocampus and other brain areas are regulated differently.",
