     "AB": "Selective antagonism of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) 2B subunit containing receptors has been suggested to have potential therapeutic application for multiple CNS disorders. The amino terminal NR2B residues 1 to 282 were found to be both necessary and sufficient for the binding and function of highly NR2B subunit specific antagonists like ifenprodil and CP-101,606. Using a genetic approach in mice, we successfully replaced the murine NR2B gene function by \"knocking-in\" (KI) a chimeric human NR2A/B cDNA containing the minimal domain abolishing ifenprodil binding into the endogenous NR2B locus. Patch-clamp recording from hippocampal cultures of the NR2B KI mice demonstrated that their NMDA receptors have reduced sensitivity to both ifenprodil and CP-101,606, as predicted, but also have a lower affinity for glycine. The NR2B KI mice exhibited normal locomotor activity making this ifenprodil-insensitive mouse model a valuable tool to test the specificity of NR2B selective antagonists in vivo.",
