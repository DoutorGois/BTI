     "AB": "Kindling involves long-term changes in brain excitability and is considered a model of epilepsy and neuroplasticity. Differentially expressed genes in the kindled mouse brain were screened using an reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) differential display (DD) method. C3H male mice were kindled with 40 stimuli in the hippocampus at 5-min intervals. Hippocampal RNA was isolated for DD from mice at 0.5 h, 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after kindling and from sham-operated controls. About 30,000 bands were screened and of these, 50 were displayed differentially. Northern blot analysis confirmed that 26 of the 50 bands were differentially expressed following rapid kindling. Further sequence analysis revealed that 14 of the genes were previously identified and 12 were novel. The novel genes are referred to as King (1-12) genes because of their association with kindling. According to their temporal and quantitative pattern of expression in forebrain, the 26 genes were grouped into five types. Expression of five of the DD genes, one from each expression type, was further analyzed in hippocampus, forebrain, brainstem, and cerebellum of the kindled mice. Differential expression of these genes was observed in hippocampus and forebrain, but not in brainstem or cerebellum. Only one gene, a regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4), showed prolonged changes in expression in response to kindling. Our results show that rapid kindling produces spatial and temporal changes in gene expression that may influence kindling-associated neuroplasticity.",
