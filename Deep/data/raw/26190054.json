     "AB": "The hippocampus exhibits a variety of distinct states of activity under different conditions. For instance the rhythmic patterns of activity orchestrated by the theta oscillation during running and REM sleep are markedly different from the large irregular activity (LIA) observed during awake resting and slow wave sleep. We found that under different levels of isoflurane anesthesia activity in the hippocampus of rats displays two distinct states, which have several qualities that mirror the theta and LIA states. These data provide further evidence that the two states are intrinsic modes of the hippocampus; while also characterizing a preparation that could be useful for studying the natural activity states in hippocampus.",
