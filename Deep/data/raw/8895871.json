     "AB": "The effects of a recently synthesized benzoyl-piperidine drug that enhances currents mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors were tested on monosynaptic and polysynaptic responses in hippocampal slices of the rat. Stimulation of perforant path inputs to the dentate gyrus evoked extracellular responses in field CA1 that had latencies and laminar profiles indicating that they were relayed through the trisynaptic intrahippocampal circuit. Under control conditions, trisynaptic field excitatory postsynaptic potentials did not show larger paired-pulse facilitation than monosynaptic responses and failed to exhibit frequency facilitation. Low concentrations of picrotoxin greatly enhanced trisynaptic responses and, under these conditions, frequency facilitation was obtained. Benzoyl-piperidine-12 (250 microM) had a three-fold greater effect on the amplitude of trisynaptic responses than on monosynaptic field excitatory postsynaptic potentials, indicating that the drug's effect is amplified across the successive stages of a polysynaptic circuit. The AMPA receptor modulator did not change the frequency characteristics of monosynaptic potentials and had only a modest influence on those of the trisynaptic response. The effect of benzoyl-piperidine-12 on trisynaptic responses was significantly greater when GABAergic inhibition was partially blocked with picrotoxin; the GABA blocker did not alter the effects of benzoyl-piperidine-12 on monosynaptic responses. These results indicate that centrally active AMPA receptor modulators are likely to have a greater influence on brain operations involving long chains of connections than on those mediated by simple reflex-like circuits, and will vary markedly in their effects depending upon the excitability of local interneurons.",
