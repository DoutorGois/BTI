     "AB": "Following profound (greater than 90%) depletions of norepinephrine (NE) by the noradrenergic neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4), the numbers of beta-adrenergic receptors were significantly increased (20-25%) in rat hippocampal and somatosensory cortical membranes; however, the numbers of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and the affinities of both types of receptors were unaffected. This selective up-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors was evident 1 week after DSP4 administration and was maintained for at least 2 more weeks. In electrophysiological experiments in the hippocampal slice preparation, responses to threshold as well as maximal concentrations of isoproterenol were enhanced 150% and 33%, respectively, in the DSP4-lesioned animals. The results demonstrate that nearly complete depletion of brain NE produced by administration of DSP4, like that produced by 6-hydroxydopamine, results in increased numbers of beta- but not alpha-adrenergic receptors, and suggest that the density of the former are regulated by afferent noradrenergic fibers. Furthermore, the functional significance of the increased number of hippocampal beta-adrenergic receptors is directly manifested in a greater electrophysiological responsiveness to an exogenously administered beta-adrenergic receptor agonist.",
