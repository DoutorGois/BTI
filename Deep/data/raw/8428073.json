Knowledge about the psychological nature and neural basis of specific memory systems has come primarily from lesion analysis, but this year functional brain imaging has provided a new source of convergent evidence. Recent findings are reviewed that provide new information about a limbic-diencephalic system critical for learning new declarative information, a temporal lobe system that stores long-term semantic knowledge in a domain-specific fashion, an occipital system that subserves visuoperceptual implicit memory, and a fronto-thalamo-neostriatal system that mediates the executive component of working memory and that plays an important role in some forms of sensorimotor skill learning.",
