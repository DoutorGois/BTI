     "AB": "Low-molecular-weight GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family control the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. Dramatic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is caused by the C3 exoenzyme derived from Clostridium botulinum (C3), based on ADP-ribosylation of RhoA/B/C. In addition, wild-type as well as ADP-ribosyltransferase-deficient C3-E174Q induce axonal outgrowth of primary murine hippocampal neurons and prevent growth cone collapse, indicating a non-enzymatic mode of action. In this study, we compared the effects of C3-E174Q and wild-type C3 in the murine hippocampal cell line HT22. Treatment of HT22 cells with C3 resulted in Rho ADP-ribosylation and cell rounding. The ADP-ribosyltransferase-deficient mutant C3-E174Q did not induce either Rho ADP-ribosylation or morphological changes. C3 as well as C3-E174Q treatment resulted in growth arrest, reduced expression of cyclin D levels, and increased expression of RhoB, a negative regulator of cell-cycle progression. Serum starvation induced apoptosis in HT22 cells, as determined on the basis of increased expression of caspase-9 and Bax. C3 but not C3-E174Q protected serum-starved HT22 cells from apoptosis. This is the first study separating ADP-ribosyltransferase-dependent from ADP-ribosyltransferase-independent effects of C3. While morphological changes and anti-apoptotic activity strictly depend on ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, the anti-proliferative effects are independent of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity.",
