     "AB": "We report that maintaining rats under chloral hydrate anesthesia for the first 3 h following the administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) blocks the decrease in forebrain concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) measured 1 week later. In contrast, the acute effect of MDMA (3 h) on forebrain 5-HT was not altered by the anesthetic. This protective effect of chloral hydrate was not due to an anesthetic-induced hypothermia but may be related to the hypothesized role of dopamine in the neurotoxic effects of MDMA.",
