     "AB": "This study examined c-fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in the brain of obese (ob/ob) and lean (+/+) mice during states of satiety and hunger. The results demonstrated that there is an altered neural activity primarily in the hypothalamus of the obese mouse brain. Most interestingly, only obese mice had an increased FLI in the dorsomedial and supramammillary nuclei. Conversely, only lean mice showed increase in FLI in the medial part of perifornical nucleus following food deprivation for 24 h.",
