     "AB": "Male albino rats were administered styrene in groundnut oil, PO at doses of 100 mg and 200 mg/kg body weight daily for 14 consecutive days. No neurological deficit was observed in any animal during the course of the experiment. Mean % avoidance response (learning) for each treated group, from day 1 to day 4 of conditioned avoidance response training, revealed a general increase. Styrene significantly increased the % avoidance response at both doses as compared to controls, although no definite dose-response relationship was evident. No significant difference was noted in the spontaneous locomotor activity and regional brain catecholamine levels, between controls and treated rats of either dose. Serotonin levels in hippocampus, hypothalamus, and mid-brain were significantly raised at the higher dose of styrene. Therefore, elevated serotonin levels in these brain regions may account for styrene-induced learning.",
