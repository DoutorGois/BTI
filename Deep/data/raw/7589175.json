     "AB": "The effects of nicardipine, a Ca2+ channel antagonist, on the abnormal excitability of hippocampal CA3 neurons in spontaneously epileptic rats (SER), a double mutant (zi/zi, tm/tm), were examined to elucidate whether or not the abnormality was due to that of Ca2+ channels. An intracellular recording study was performed using brain slice preparations of SER 12-15 weeks of age, when SER showed both tonic convulsions and absence-like seizures. Bath application of nicardipine (10 nM) completely inhibited the depolarizing shifts lasting for 60-120 ms and accompanying repetitive firings on mossy fiber stimulation in SER. However, this drug did not affect the single action potential induced by the mossy fiber stimulation in CA3 neurons of SER and normal Wistar rats. In the CA3 pyramidal neurons of SER, the Ca2+ spikes induced by the depolarizing pulse applied in the cell in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium had a different configuration from that in normal Wistar rats. Nicardipine also inhibited the Ca2+ spikes in SER CA3 neurons at a concentration (1 nM) that had no effect on those in normal Wistar rats, while the Ca2+ spikes in Wistar rat CA3 neurons were inhibited by 10 nM nicardipine. These findings suggest that the abnormal excitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons in SER might be attributed to abnormalities of the Ca2+ channels, and that the Ca2+ channel antagonist may be effective as an antiepileptic drug.",
