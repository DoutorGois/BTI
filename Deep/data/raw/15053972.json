     "AB": "The Wiskott-Aldrich homology domain 2 (WH2) family protein Spir and the formin Cappuccino belong to two distinct classes of actin organizers. Despite their functional classification as actin organizers, a major defect of Drosophila spire and cappuccino mutant oocytes is a failure in the orientation of microtubule plus ends towards the posterior pole. Mammalian homologues of spire are the spir-1 and spir-2 genes. The mouse and human formin-1 and formin-2 genes have high similarity to the cappuccino gene. The mouse formin-2 gene has been found to be expressed in the developing nervous system and in neuronal cells of the adult brain. By analyzing the expression of the spir-1 gene we show that spir-1 and formin-2 have a nearly identical expression pattern during mouse embryogenesis and in the adult brain. In mouse embryos both genes are expressed in the developing nervous system. In the adult brain high expression of the genes was found in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and in neuronal cells of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus.",
