     "AB": "We tested the hypothesis that vascular remodeling in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus is associated with long-term functional recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We induced TBI with lateral fluid-percussion (LFP) injury in adult rats. Animals were followed-up for 9 months, during which we tested motor performance using a neuroscore test, spatial learning and memory with a Morris water maze, and seizure susceptibility with a pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) test. At 8 months, they underwent structural MRI, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed by arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. Then, rats were perfused for histology to assess the density of blood vessels. In the perilesional cortex, the CBF decreased by 56% (p < 0.01 compared to controls), and vessel density increased by 28% (p < 0.01). There was a negative correlation between CBF in the perilesional cortex and vessel density (r = -0.75, p < 0.01). However, in the hippocampus, we found a 13% decrease in CBF ipsilaterally (p < 0.05) and 20% contralaterally (p < 0.01), and no change in vessel number. In the ipsilateral thalamus, the increase in CBF (34%, p < 0.01) was associated with a remarkable increase in vessel density (78%, p < 0.01). Animals showed motor impairment that was not associated with vascular changes. Instead, poor performance in the Morris water maze correlated with enhanced thalamic vessel density (r = -0.81, p < 0.01). Finally, enhanced seizure susceptibility was associated with reduced CBF in the ipsilateral hippocampus (r = 0.78, p < 0.05) and increased vascular density in the thalamus (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). There was little interaction between the behavioral measures. The present study demonstrates that each of the investigated brain areas has a unique pattern of vascular abnormalities. Chronic alterations in CBF could not be attributed to changes in vascular density. Association of thalamic hypervascularity to epileptogenesis warrants further studies. Finally, hippocampal hypoperfusion may predict later seizure susceptibility in the LFP injury model of TBI, which could be of value for pre-clinical antiepileptogenesis trials.",
