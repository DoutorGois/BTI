     "AB": "The aluminium-induced neurotoxic consequences include, among other factors, dephosphorylation, phosphorylation as well as hyperphosphorylation of specific macromolecules. Accordingly, activities of phosphoesterases were measured in different regions of rat brain, maintained with either adequate or inadequate protein diet, following aluminium exposure. Male Wistar rats weighing 80-100 g were treated with aluminium chloride at a dose of 15% of the LD50 for 4 weeks. In different regions of the brain of aluminium-exposed rats, significant variation in both phosphomonoesterase and phosphodiesterase activities have been recorded. These alterations were found to be varied when the rats were subjected to dietary protein insufficiency. These findings demonstrate the specificity of aluminium on different phosphoesterases. These regional variations may be attributed to the accumulated level of aluminium or may be due to cellular localization of these enzymes and linked to whether the enzymes are compartmentalized with different aluminium hydration species.",
