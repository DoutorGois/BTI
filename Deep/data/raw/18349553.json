     "AB": "Although it has been reported in a lot of studies that hypoxic preconditioning could protect the brain from hypoxic/ischemic injury, it is not clear whether hypoxic preconditioning could affect brain functions such as cognitive ability. This work aims at investigating the effect of hypoxic preconditioning on spatial cognitive ability in mice after acute and repeated hypoxic exposures. The mice were randomly divided into 3 groups: a control group in which mice were not exposed to hypoxia (H0) and experimental groups in which mice encountered hypoxia either once (H1) or 4 times (H4). Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) expression, long-term potentiation (LTP) recording and Morris water maze test were used to measure the animals' cognitive ability. The tolerance time was progressively prolonged as exposure went on. The expression of both NCAM mRNA and NCAM protein as well as the LTP induction rate decreased in group H1, but recovered to control level in group H4. The performance of mice in the maze test was improved in H4 in comparison with that in both H1 and H0. These findings may indicate that spatial cognitive ability is improved in adult mice by their hypoxic preconditioning.",
