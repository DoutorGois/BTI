     "AB": "The efficacy of stimulation patterns consisting of brief high frequency bursts repeated at various intervals to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) at synapses on apical and basal dendrites of CA1 hippocampal neurons was tested in vitro. Both apical and basal dendritic synapses exhibited maximal LTP after bursts repeated at 5-10 Hz, i.e. close to the frequency of the endogenous hippocampal theta rhythm. As at apical dendritic synapses, LTP at basal dendritic synapses was blocked by an antagonist of NMDA receptors. Basal dendritic LTP was significantly greater in magnitude than apical dendritic LTP, although the reason for this is unknown.",
