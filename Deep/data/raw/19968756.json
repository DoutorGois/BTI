     "AB": "Expression of the nuclear orphan receptor gene Nur77 in neuronal cells is induced by activity-dependent increases in intracellular Ca2+ ions. Ca2+ responsiveness of the Nur77 gene has been attributed to two distinct DNA regulatory regions that recruit the transcription factors cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2). Here we used dominant interfering and constitutively active mutants of CREB and MEF2 proteins to assess their relative contribution to depolarization-induced Nur77 expression in undifferentiated PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons. We show that while CREB is necessary for Ca2+-activated Nur77 expression MEF2 functions to modulate CREB-dependent Nur77 expression by acting as a repressor in quiescent cells.",
