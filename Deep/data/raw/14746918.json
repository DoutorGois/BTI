     "AB": "In CA1 neurons of guinea pig hippocampal slices, long-term depression (LTD) was induced in the field EPSP response in the absence of test synaptic inputs (one stimulus every 20 s) by application of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, aminocyclopentane-1S, 3R-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD). This effect was blocked and long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by co-application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) during ACPD perfusion (ACPD/NMDA-induced LTD). These results indicate that the state of NMDA receptor activation during ACPD perfusion determines whether LTP or LTD is induced in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Co-application of an inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor inhibitor, 2-aminotheoxydiphenyl borate, during ACPD application had no effect on the ACPD/NMDA-induced LTP, but increased the magnitude of the ACPD-induced LTD, suggesting that the ACPD/NMDA-induced LTP involves NMDA receptors, but not IP3 receptors, whereas the converse applies to the ACPD-induced LTD.",
