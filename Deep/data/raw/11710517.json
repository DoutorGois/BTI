     "AB": "We studied the expression pattern of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor1 (InsP3R1) mRNA after a single electroconvulsive shock (ECS) in the rat brain by in situ hybridization. The expression was significantly decreased in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 area of the hippocampal formation 3 to 24 h after ECS. While the downregulation of InsP3R1 by accelerated protein degradation has been reported, our results indicate that the downregulation of InsP3R1 occurs at the mRNA level. This finding, along with our previous report on the InsP3 3-kinase(A), suggests that ECS regulates the phosphoinositide mediated signaling, which might be related to the therapeutic mechanism of ECS.",
