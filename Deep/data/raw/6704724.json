     "AB": "The influence of extracellular fields on the transmembrane potential (TMP) of CA1 pyramidal neurons was investigated following both ortho- and antidromic stimulation in the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation. A short latency negative deflection on the intracellular potential coincided with the falling phase of the extracellular population spike. Subtraction of extracellular field potentials from ground referenced intracellular records revealed a sharp depolarizing wave of the TMP superimposed upon the underlying synaptic potential. This graded depolarization was capable of discharging CA1 cells and displayed a parallel shift in latency and amplitude with the extracellular population spike. A similar depolarizing wave was associated with the antidromically evoked population spike which persisted following blockade of synaptic activity. Finally, multiple population spike activity similar to that observed during epileptiform discharge was associated with repetitive depolarizing waves of the TMP. These data suggest that extracellular field potentials can ephaptically discharge CA1 neurons and may play a role in recruitment and synchronization of neuronal activity in the hippocampus.",
