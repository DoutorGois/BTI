     "AB": "Stressful events early in life are reported to be more prevalent among patients with an adult life psychiatric disorder. Early maternal deprivation is considered an animal model of early life stress. Maternally deprived adult rats display long-term alterations in the neuroendocrine system, brain and behavior that are in many ways analogous to depressive and schizophrenic symptomatology. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) have been implicated in both disorders and also been suggested to play a role in the neuroadaptational response to stress. Consequently, male Wistar rat-pups were subjected to early maternal deprivation or control handling, on postnatal day (pnd) 9. On pnd 21, pups were weaned and split into two groups that were reared either on a saw-dust floor or on a grid-floor, considered to be a mild stressor. On pnd 67, all animals were subjected to the prepulse inhibition test. One week later, the animals were sacrificed, the brains removed and dissected on ice. Levels of NPY-like immunoreactivity (LI) and CGRP-LI were quantified by radioimmunoassay in brain regional extracts. Maternal deprivation led to a significant reduction in basal startle amplitude and disruption of prepulse inhibition. These findings were paralleled by significantly reduced levels of NPY and CGRP in the hippocampus and occipital cortex. It is hypothesised that these changes may be of relevance to aspects of schizophrenic and affective symptomatology. The present study further shows that brain NPY and, in particular, CGRP are sensitive to long-term mild stress and further implicate the involvement of these peptides in the neuroendocrine stress response.",
