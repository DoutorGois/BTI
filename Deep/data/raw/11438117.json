     "AB": "Changes occurring in intracerebral arteries of 24-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared with age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were assessed using microanatomical techniques associated with image analysis. Morphometric parameters investigated included arterial diameter, lumen area, wall area, and wall-to-lumen ratio. Intracerebral arteries (lumen diameter>46 microm) and arterioles (lumen diameter 46-10 microm) of frontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus were examined. In frontal cortex of SHR arterial wall hypertrophy and luminal narrowing were observed. In striatum, an increase of wall area not accompanied by luminal narrowing predominates resulting in arterial hypertrophy without vasoconstriction. In hippocampal arteries of SHR, luminal narrowing, without changes of wall area was found indicating the occurrence of remodeling. In brain areas investigated, hypertensive changes affected primarily arterioles. The demonstration of a sensitivity of intracerebral arteries to hypertension suggests that changes of these vessels may represent a cause of brain structural alterations occurring in hypertension. The specificity of alterations occurring in intracerebral arteries of brain areas investigated may account for the different localization of cerebral lesions in cerebrovascular disease. The possibility that microanatomical changes developed in intracerebral arteries of SHR may represent a model of cerebrovascular disease of the elderly is discussed.",
