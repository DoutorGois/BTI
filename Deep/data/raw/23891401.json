     "AB": "Spatial navigation is a complex process, but one that is essential for any mobile organism. We localized a region in the macaque occipitotemporal sulcus that responds preferentially to images of scenes. Single-unit recording revealed that this region, which we term the lateral place patch (LPP), contained a large concentration of scene-selective single units. These units were not modulated by spatial layout alone but were instead modulated by a combination of spatial and nonspatial factors, with individual units coding specific scene parts. We further demonstrate by microstimulation that LPP is connected with extrastriate visual areas V4V and DP and a scene-selective medial place patch in the parahippocampal gyrus, revealing a ventral network for visual scene processing in the macaque.",
