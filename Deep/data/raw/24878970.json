Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed hyperintense signal in right basal ganglia followed by hyperintense signals in left hippocampus and bilateral basal ganglia half a month later. This case expands the spectrum of limbic encephalitis to include LGI1 antibodies and cranial MRI changing process.",
