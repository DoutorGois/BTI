     "AB": "The amyloid-beta peptides (A beta) are produced in excess in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. This study provides strong evidence for a novel cellular target for the actions of A beta, the phospholipase C-coupled, extracellular Ca(2+)-sensing receptor (CaR). We demonstrate that A beta(s) produce a CaR-mediated activation of a Ca(2+)-permeable, nonselective cation channel (NCC), probably via elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ (Cai), in cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons from normal rats and from wild type mice but not those from mice with targeted disruption of the CaR gene (CaR -/-). A beta(s) also activate NCC in CaR-transfected but not in nontransfected human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Thus aggregates of A beta deposited on hippocampal neurons in AD could appropriately activate the CaR, stimulating Ca(2+)-permeable channels and causing sustained elevation of Cai with resultant neuronal dysfunction.",
