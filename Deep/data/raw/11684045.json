     "AB": "The distributions of the neuropeptides substance P (SP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were investigated in four songbird species that differ in their food-storing behavior. The food-storing black-capped chickadee (Parus atricapillus) was compared to the non-storing blue tit (Parus caeruleus) and great tit (Parus major) within the avian family Paridae, as well as to the non-storing dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). All four species showed a similar distribution of SP throughout the brain with the exception of two areas, the hippocampal complex (including hippocampus (Hp) and parahippocampus (APH)) and the Wulst (including the hyperstriatum accessorium (HA)). SP-like immunoreactivity was found in cells of the Hp in juncos, but not in the three parid species. Two areas within the APH and HA showed SP-like immunoreactivity in all four species. The more medial of these (designated SPm) is a distinctive field of fibers and terminals found throughout the APH and extending into the HA. A positive relationship between SPm and Hp volume was found for all four species with the chickadee having a significantly larger SPm area relative to telencephalon than the other species. The distribution of SP in this region may be related to differences in food-storing behavior. In contrast to substance P, NPY distribution throughout the brain was similar in all four species. Further, NPY-immunoreactive cells were found in the Hp of all four species and no species differences in the number of NPY cells was observed.",
