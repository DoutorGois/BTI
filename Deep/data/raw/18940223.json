     "AB": "We tested two post-exposure prophylaxes (PEPs) for rabies in laboratory animals; one was a traditional antirabies vaccine for humans via intramuscular route (IM), and the other was a DNA vaccine administered by intranasal route (IN). In contrast to The World Health Organization's recommended five-dose PEP, we gave only four doses without hyper-immune antirabies sera, making the PEP more rigorous. All animals were challenged with challenge virus strain (CVS); 16h later, PEP was applied. All animals that received the PEP with DNA/IN survived, and 87% of the rabbits and 80% of the mice that received the PEP with traditional antirabies vaccine/IM survived. Negative controls succumbed to infection. The expression of G protein was detected in the NALT, cerebellum, cerebral cortex (neocortex), cerebellum and hippocampus, mainly in the glial cells (microglia) and microvessels. On the other hand, plasmid construct was detected in brain and its mRNA expression in medium and posterior encephalon. The efficiency of this DNA/IN PEP is probably due to the early expression of the antigen in the brain stimulating the immune system locally.",
