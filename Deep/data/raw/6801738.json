     "AB": "We have measured the endogenous TRH concentration in the pineal and 9 brain regions of a seasonal hibernator, the golden-mantled ground squirrel, during euthermia and hibernation in order to investigate the possibility that changes in TRH concentration might occur in association with naturally-occurring changes in CNS-mediated physiological and behavioral processes. Regional TRH content was assessed by radioimmunoassay in adult animals that were killed during euthermia in the mid-portion of each season and during hibernation in mid-winter. No significant changes in TRH concentration related to season or to hibernation versus euthermic state were noted in the hippocampus, brainstem, or cerebellum. In the olfactory bulb, preoptic area, and pineal, seasonal variation within euthermic groups was evident. During hibernation, statistically significant decreases in TRH content occurred in the forebrain, olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, septum, preoptic area, and midbrain. Significant fluctuations during hibernation were also observed in the pineal. In this structure, TRH concentration varied in relation to the phase of the hibernation bout. TRH content in the last quarter of the bout was three times greater when compared to values observed in the first quarter of the bout. These results suggest that TRH may be involved in the control processes attributed to these regions and support a role for TRH in the neural control of hibernation.",
