     "AB": "Plasticity in the adult brain enables lifelong learning. The fundamental mechanism of adult neural plasticity is activity-dependent reorganization of pre-existing structure, in contrast to the widespread cellular proliferation and migration that occurs during development. Whereas adult hippocampal dentate gyrus continuously generates cohorts of neurons, and newborn neurons integrate into the existing neural circuit under the regulation of existing global and local neural activity, demonstrating a unique cellular and synaptic flexibility in adult brain. Exhibiting an enhanced structural and synaptic plasticity during the maturation, adult-born hippocampal neurons may represent a unique population for hippocampal function. Current evidence indicates that lifelong addition of new hippocampal neurons may extend early developmental plasticity to adulthood, which continuously rejuvenates adult brain. We reviewed most recent advancements in exploring the circuit and behavioral role of adult-born hippocampal neurons.",
