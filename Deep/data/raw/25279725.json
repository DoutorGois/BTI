     "AB": "Developmental topographical disorientation (DTD) causes impaired spatial orientation and navigation from early childhood with no evidence of cerebral damage. Using fMRI and a landmark sequencing task, we investigated the hypothesis that Dr Wai's abnormal cerebral activation pattern was related to his peculiar behavioral profile. Although Dr Wai was able to correctly perform landmark sequencing, he showed a lack of activity in regions activated in all control subjects and activity in areas that were not activated in any control subject. These results are discussed in light of cognitive and functional model of navigation, with relevant implications for DTD physiology.",
