     "AB": "To examine the time course of the histopathological effects of bilateral injections of amyloid-beta 25-35 (A beta) and to determine if these effects are associated with a reduction in choline acetyltransferase activity and behavioral impairments, we injected A beta (5.0 nmol) into the amygdala of young male Fischer rats. Control rats received vehicle infusions. For histological analysis, animals were sacrificed at 8, 32, 64, 96, and 128 days postoperatively (n = 21-33 per timepoint). A beta induced neuronal tau-2 staining in the right, but not the left amygdala and hippocampus. A beta also induced reactive astrocytosis and neuronal shrinkage within the right hippocampus and amygdala, respectively. As with tau-2, these same brain regions within the left hemisphere in the A beta-treated rats were significantly less affected. In addition, A beta appeared to induce microglial and neuronal interleukin-1beta staining. The histopathological effects of A beta peaked at 32 days postoperatively but were not associated with a reduction in amygdaloid choline acetyltransferase activity. In a separate experiment, behavioral effects of bilateral intra-amygdaloid injections of A beta were analyzed at 34-52 days postoperatively. In an open field test, the treatment groups differed only in the numbers of rears emitted (p = 0.016). There was no effect of A beta in the Morris water maze or in the acquisition and retention of a one-way conditioned avoidance response. These data suggest a laterality in the histopathological effects of A beta and that the effects of single injections are in part transient. These findings also suggest a direct association between plaque and tangle formation in Alzheimer's disease, and support the use of this rat model to screen drugs that may alter the initial pathological events associated with Alzheimer's disease, that occur before the manifestations of extensive behavioral impairments become evident.",
