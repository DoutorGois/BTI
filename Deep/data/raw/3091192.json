     "AB": "Protein kinase C can be activated by oleate, an unsaturated fatty acid. Since protein kinase C is activated by long-term potentiation, we wished to determine whether iontophoretic ejection of oleate into the intact hippocampal dentate gyrus of urethane-anesthetized rats would cause an enhancement of the response potentiated by high frequency stimulation of the perforant path. Oleate ejection did significantly enhance the persistence of the potentiated response. Moreover, a growth of the response beyond the initial potentiation was seen. Arachidonate, which stimulates protein kinase C to a lesser degree, had a significant preservation effect, but no effect on growth of the response. After vehicle and elaidate (trans-stereoisomer of oleate) ejections, the potentiated response decayed to baseline values. In addition, the persistence of the potentiated response observed two hours after its induction was positively correlated with the ability of an unsaturated fatty acid to activate protein kinase C in vitro. The present results support the proposal that protein kinase C activation enhances synaptic strength. It is suggested that one mechanism for this activation may be PLA2-mediated release of oleate.",
