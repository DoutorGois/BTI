     "AB": "After removal of the perforant path input to the rat fascia dentata at the age of 11 days, cholinergic septohippocampal fibers invade the denervated area. We have examined the effect of this lesion on hemicholinium-sensitive, high affinity choline uptake and its coupling to acetylcholine synthesis, specific properties of the septohippocampal input. Removal of the ipsilateral perforant path fibers increased the velocity of high affinity choline uptake by dentate particulate preparations, usually within 1 day. Studies conducted 5--104 days after operation showed a consistent 50--65% elevation in the molecular (denervated) layer. In contrast, the choline uptake rate in the granular layer eventually decreased slightly. Calculation of choline uptake rates independently of protein (per whole region) revealed that fasciae dentatae from operated and control sides accumulated choline at approximately equal rates, but on the operated side a greater percentage was transported by structures from the molecular layer and a lesser percentage by those from the granular layer. The rate of acetylcholine synthesis from exogenous choline increased to the same extent as high affinity choline uptake from 3 days after operation onwards. The changes in high affinity choline uptake and acetylcholine synthesis coincided spatially and temporally with the reactive growth of septohippocampal fibers. Our results support the view that a perforant path lesion during development permanently alters the distribution of functional septohippocampal boutons in the fascia dentata. Acetylcholine synthesis is regulated to the same extent by high affinity choline uptake in the anomalous boutons as in normally located boutons.",
