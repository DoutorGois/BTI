     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Membrane lipid degradation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain damage, but there is little information on changes in cerebrosides, sulfatides, and sphingomyelin. We studied regional changes in the quantities of these lipids during complete global brain ischemia in rats. METHODS: Nitrous oxide-anesthetized rats were subjected to ischemia by a high-pressure neck cuff and arterial hypotension for 0 (control), 3, 10, or 30 minutes (n = 5 at each time). Brain temperature was allowed to fall spontaneously during ischemia, and the brain was frozen in situ with liquid N2 without recirculation. The frontal cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia were dissected at -15 degrees C. The lipids were separated by column and high-performance thin-layer chromatography and quantified by charring and densitometry. RESULTS: Total lipid content was higher (p less than 0.01) in the hippocampus (72.6 +/- 2.8 mg/g wet wt, mean +/- SD) than in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia (57.7 +/- 2.1 and 62.6 +/- 1.5 mg/g wet wt, respectively). Ischemic changes occurred only in the frontal cortex, where total lipid content fell (p less than 0.01) by 11% after 30 minutes of ischemia because sulfatide and cerebroside contents fell by 44% and 38%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a marked accumulation of free fatty acids during complete global brain ischemia in rats, the only detectable changes in brain lipids were in the amounts of cerebrosides and sulfatides in the frontal cortex.",
