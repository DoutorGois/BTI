     "AB": "Grouped, nonkiller and killer animals were centrally injected either with vehicle or with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. After a period of 7-10 days, forepaw treading and hindlimb abduction were induced by 5-MeODMT administration in all sham and lesioned rats. As expected, behavioral supersensitivity was observed in grouped and nonkiller lesioned rats. A reduced increase in 5-MeODMT-induced behaviors was obtained in killer lesioned animals. 5-HT uptake studies showed a comparable reduction of 5-HT uptake within all the lesioned rats. This evidence suggests an altered capacity to promote adaptive changes on 5-HT sites in killer rats following the destruction of central serotonergic fibers.",
