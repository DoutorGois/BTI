     "AB": "Two weeks after infracallosal electrolytic fimbria-fornix lesions, Long-Evans female rats received intrahippocampal suspension grafts of either fetal septal or mesencephalic raphe tissue, or a mixture of both. Ten months after lesion surgery, the concentrations of alanine, aspartate, GABA, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, serine and taurine were determined in a dorsal, a \"middle\" and a ventral region of the hippocampus. We found neither the lesions nor the grafts to have significantly modified the concentration of these amino acids which, in all groups, presented a regional heterogeneity in their hippocampal distribution. GABA, glutamate and glutamine were highest in the ventral hippocampus, whereas the other amino acids were highest in the dorsal region. Our results (i) show that fimbria-fornix lesions do not result in lasting effects on hippocampal concentrations of the assessed amino acids, (ii) confirm the regional heterogeneity in the distribution of these amino acids in the hippocampus and (iii) demonstrate that cell suspension grafts of fetal septal or mesencephalic raphe tissue, as well as grafts of a mixture of both of these tissues, do not exert a non-specific effect on either of the amino acid concentrations measured. These data complete those of the preceeding paper [Kiss et al. (1990) Neuroscience 36, 61-72] concerning the effects of the same grafts on hippocampal cholinergic, serotonergic and noradrenergic markers, as well as on several behavioural variables.",
