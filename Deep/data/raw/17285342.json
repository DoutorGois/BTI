     "AB": "The histological hallmark feature of Huntington's disease (HD) and other polyglutamine repeat diseases is the presence of intracellular inclusions. Much work has been devoted to trying to determine the relationship between inclusion formation and neuronal injury. However, little attention has been paid to the variability and characteristics of inclusions themselves. Here, we characterize the morphological and biochemical composition of inclusions in both a transgenic mouse model (R6/2 line) and an inducible cell culture model of HD (iPC12Q74). We identified several morphologically distinct kinds of inclusions in different locations (nuclei, cytoplasm and cellular processes). Ubiquitin colocalized completely with all of these inclusions in both the iPC12Q72 and R6/2 models. In the inclusions in iPC12Q74 cells, the 20S and 11S proteasome subunits colocalized variably, and the 19S subunit did not colocalize at all. In inclusions in R6/2 mouse neurons, the 20S subunit colocalized completely, but neither the 11S nor the 19S subunits colocalized at all. While the role of inclusions in the pathogenesis of HD continues to be debated, we suggest that the content and structure of inclusions vary considerably, not only from cell to cell but even within individual cells. Their role in the pathogenesis of HD is likely to depend on their location as well as their composition.",
