Determination of dominating frequency of rhythmical activity was carried out by means of mathematical methods of analysis on a computer. It was found out, that during the action of conditioned alimentary stimulus the frequency of dominating oscillations became enhanced. Animals with a more frequent initial theta-rhythm formed the delayed alimentary reflex more rapidly.",
