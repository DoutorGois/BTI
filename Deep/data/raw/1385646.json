     "AB": "Using in vivo microdialysis, we have examined the effects of local administration of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) into either the dorsal (DRN) or the median (MRN) raphe nucleus on extracellular levels of serotonin (5-HT) in the corresponding projection fields, namely striatum and ventral hippocampus in the anaesthetized rat. Local injection of 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 microgram/0.1 microliter) in the DRN reduced extracellular 5-HT levels in the striatum (-55%) and to a lesser extent in the hippocampus (-22%). When injected at the same dose in the MRN, 8-OH-DPAT caused a marked decrease in 5-HT output in the hippocampus (-41%) and had no effect in the striatum. Autoradiographic studies performed on brains from animals that received a local injection of [8H]8-OH-DPAT into either the DRN or MRN under similar experimental conditions indicated that the radioactivity remained localized within each midbrain raphe nucleus. These results confirm anatomical data demonstrating that the striatum and the ventral hippocampus receive their serotonergic innervation preferentially from the DRN and the MRN, respectively.",
