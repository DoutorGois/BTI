     "AB": "The influences of protein kinase inhibitors, K-252a and staurosporine, on the neurotrophic effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) were investigated in dissociated cell cultures of the hippocampus and cerebellum of fetal rats. Addition of 1 ng/ml EGF enhanced the survival of cultured neurons of both brain regions. Both K-252a (10-200 nM) and staurosporine (1-100 nM) blocked the survival-promoting effects of EGF in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that activation of protein kinase(s) is involved in the neurotrophic effects of EGF.",
