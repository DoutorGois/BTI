     "AB": "Recent data on the aptitude of adamantamines to inhibit or to stimulate glutamatergic (NMDA) neuromediation, to display anti-GABAergic and antiglycinergic components (by blocking the Cl- channel), on the one hand, and on the opposition of the central glutamatergic and dopaminergic systems, on the other, could suggest that the glutamatergic (NMDA) or the anti-NMDA activity, exhibited by some adamantamines, could play an important role in the expression of their pharmacological profile. Anti-NMDA properties, for the adamantamines which exhibited them, could be, by themselves or by developing their anti-GABAergic or antiglycinergic components, the first cause of the hypermotility and dopaminomimetic activity induced by these molecules. Glutamatergic (NMDA) component, which could be displayed by some lipophilic or important steric obstruction on azote exhibiting adamantamines, could amplifie the excitating effects of their anti-GABAergic and antiglycinergic components on the limbic system's brain structures (hippocampus, amygdala) and could contribute to the exhibition of hypomotility, fright, agressivity and convulsions. According to these data, which must be amplier confirmed and deeped, it would be possible to envisage the improvement of adamantamines against the Parkinson's disease (when they exhibit anti-NMDA activity) or their use against the Alzheimer's disease and the late stages of the Parkinson's disease (when they exhibit NMDA activity).",
