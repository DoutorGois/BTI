     "AB": "Recent clinical studies have suggested that there is an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients undergoing surgical interventions, but it is unknown whether this effect is related to anesthesia, cardiovascular complications of surgery, or associated conditions such as hypothermia. In addition, many patients, especially the elderly, present persistent post-operative cognitive deterioration after anesthesia, without clear complications during surgery. Experimental studies in animals may be helpful to dissect the pathogenic role of the different factors involved in surgery. Here, we review studies on the effects of anesthesia on neuronal function performed in tissue culture and in experimental animals. Several studies have shown that a small inhalation of anesthetics induces activation of caspases and cell toxicity on glioma and pheochromocitoma cells in culture, which is prevented by treatment with the metal chelating agent clioquinol. Exposure of old rodents to anesthesia produced memory deficits and increased levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and phosphorylated tau in brain. The effects of long term or short term repetitive exposure to small molecular weight anesthetics are more severe in transgenic AbetaPPswe than in wild type mice. In the former, low molecular weight increased the number of TUNEL(+) apoptotic cells and the ratio of pro-apoptotic proteins in hippocampus; reduced astroglial and increased microglial responses; increased Abeta aggregates and high molecular weight peptides; abnormal chaperone responses and reduced autophagy. In conclusion, anesthetic gases induce changes which may reproduce AD pathology in mice with mutations which produced AD. It would be interesting to know whether anesthetics are risky for subjects with special genetic risk factors.",
