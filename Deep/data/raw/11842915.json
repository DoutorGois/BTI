     "AB": "Previously, in monkeys undergoing 20 min whole brain ischemia we demonstrated that the activated calpain-induced lysosomal disruption with the resultant leakage of cathepsins B and L, causes neuronal death in the cornu Ammonis (CA) 1 sector on day 5. Selective cathepsin inhibitors significantly protected ischemic CA1 neurons from delayed necrosis. Recently, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxal (hydrochloride) (PL) were demonstrated to inhibit cathepsins B and L in vitro, because the active aldehyde at position 4 of the pyridine ring has an affinity for the active site -SH of cysteine residues of cathepsins. Here, we studied whether PLP and PL can, in vivo, protect monkey CA1 neurons from ischemic insult. In monkeys undergoing 20 min whole brain ischemia, 15 mg/kg body weight/day of drugs were intravenously injected for 10 days before and after the ischemic insult. Histological analysis of the surviving CA1 neurons was done using the hippocampus resected on day 5 after ischemia. For PLP or PL, approximately 17% (P = 0.0639) or 54% (P < 0.0001) of the total population (100%) of control CA1 neurons were, respectively, saved from the ischemia-induced neuronal death, showing a remarkable contrast to the surviving neurons (approximately 3.9%) in non-treated monkeys. These data suggested that PL (perhaps PLP intracellularly) is useful as a novel neuroprotectant in primates.",
