     "AB": "In the present study, 40 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into forced swim stress group and controls, with 20 rats in each group (10 for behavioral tests, 10 for protein detection). The forced swim stress group received swim stress for 14 consecutive days, and the controls were stress-free. After stress, 20 rats were tested for behavioral observation using body weight gain, open field, elevated plus-maze and saccharin preference test, and 20 rats were decapitated for protein detection. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and phospho-Erk (P-Erk) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were determined using western blot. It was found that the body weight gain of stressed animals during the 7 stressed days and the 14 stressed days was significantly decreased compared to that of controls. Stressed animals spent less time in open arms and longer time in closed arms. The stressed animals demonstrated decreased locomotor activity and increased grooming in open field. The saccharin solution intake and the ratio of saccharin solution intake to total liquid intake were both decreased in the stressed group. Stressed animals showed decreased P-Erk2 and decreased ratio of P-Erk2 to total Erk2 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, but their Erk1/2 was increased in the prefrontal cortex with no change in hippocampus. The saccharin solution intake positively correlated with the P-Erk2 in the hippocampus and negatively correlated with the Erk2 in the prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, chronic forced swim stress was a good animal model of depression, and it induced depressive-like behavior and decreased P-Erk2 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in rats. The depressive-like behaviors were correlated with decreased phosphorylation of Erk, which suggested that the dysfunction of Erk activity might be one of biological mechanisms underlying depression induced by stress.",
