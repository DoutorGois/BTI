     "AB": "Inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation was measured in two stable HeLa cell lines HA6 and HA7 expressing different levels of recombinant human 5-HT1A receptors. These cells were studied previously to characterize another second messenger system activated by 5-HT1A receptors, i.e. calcium mobilization. The pharmacological characterization of the inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation was made using agonists (5-HT, 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone, MDL 73005) and putative antagonists (SDZ 216-525, NAN-190, WAY-100135, pindolol, propranolol, WAY 100635). It is shown that 5-HT, 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone, MDL 73005 behaved as full (or nearly full) and potent agonists, whereas SDZ 216-525, NAN-190 and WAY-100135 displayed a limited (and similar) degree of intrinsic activity at human 5-HT1A receptors; on the other hand pindolol, propranolol and WAY 100635 behaved as \"silent\" antagonists. The effects were quantitatively and qualitatively very similar in both cells lines for all drugs tested, suggesting that the coupling between 5-HT1A receptors and inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation in HeLa cells is very tight. There were, however, significant variations in both the level of agonism and the potency of a number of compounds when calcium mobilization and the inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation were compared. Especially in HA7 cells which express lower receptor levels, a number of drugs failed to display agonism (e.g. buspirone or MDL 73005), whereas in HA6 cells they acted as partial agonists. Together, the data show that functional responses mediated by the same receptor can vary rather dramatically depending on receptor density and/or on the effector system involved. Interestingly, 5-HT1A receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity measured in calf hippocampal membranes shows very similar degrees of potency and intrinsic activity for a number of compounds that have been tested on the inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation in HeLa cells, suggesting that the very tight coupling observed in the recombinant system may apply to native 5-HT1A receptors.",
