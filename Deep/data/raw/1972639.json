     "AB": "In rats under urethane anesthesia, iontophoresis of large amounts (30-300 nA) of glutamate in the hippocampus induced a negative wave on the field potential evoked by stimulation of fimbria/commissura or perforant pathway. The amplitudes of the negative waves ranged between 0.2 and 9.8 mV and their mean duration was 341 +/- 12 ms. This activity was antagonized by iontophoresis of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists: Mg2+ (80-100 nA), ketamine (50-150 nA), MK-801 (50-150 nA) and by systemic ketamine (5 mg/kg, i.v.) administration. Iontophoresis of N-methyl-DL-aspartate (NMDLA) (20-40 nA) and glycine (25-100 nA) also elicited a negative wave which was blocked by NMDA antagonists. The negative waves were induced in all hippocampal layers except the dentate hilus by glutamate, NMDLA and glycine. Pyramidal regions were found to be as sensitive as dendritic layers; the mean amplitudes of glutamate-induced negative waves on the field response were 4.1 +/- 0.6 and 4.2 +/- 0.5 mV for CA1 stratum pyramidale and radiatum, respectively. These data suggest that large amounts of glutamate activate NMDA receptor/ion channels causing appearance of a long-lasting negative wave on the hippocampal field response. The data also demonstrate that glycine leads to a significant participation of NMDA receptors during glutamatergic transmission which is largely mediated through non-NMDA receptors.",
