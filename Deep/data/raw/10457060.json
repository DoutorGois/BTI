     "AB": "1. The activity-dependent regulation of presynaptic K+ currents at the CA3-CA1 synapse in the rat hippocampus was investigated during a train of evoked afferent action potentials. The waveforms of presynaptic compound action potentials (cAPs) and presynaptic Ca2+ transients ([Ca2+]pre,t) were measured with fluorescent voltage-sensitive and Ca2+-sensitive indicators in rat brain slices. 2. Under control conditions, presynaptic cAPs and the accompanying [Ca2+]pre,t displayed similar amplitudes for each stimulus, suggesting that there was no cumulative change of K+ and Ca2+ currents during the test train. However, when a subgroup of presynaptic K+ channels was blocked by a low concentration of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 40 microM), a significant facilitation of the [Ca2+]pre,t was observed. 3. This phenomenon was not due to a direct action of 4-AP on presynaptic Ca2+ channels, but to cumulative suppression of the K+ conductance as indicated by the corresponding change in waveforms of the cAP and presynaptic fibre volley. The observed facilitation was not an artifact by virtue of increased fibre recruitment, nor was it related to the accumulation of extracellular K+; rather, it was dependent on Ca2+ influx and stimulation frequency. The time course of recovery from facilitation was closely related to the decay of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. 4. The facilitation was not blocked by a saturating concentration of 4-AP (8 mM) but was reduced during the application of the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA, 10 mM), implicating the involvement of TEA-sensitive K+ channels. Such activity-dependent suppression of presynaptic K+ conductance could lead to excessive transmitter release and might explain the hippocampal epileptiform activity that can be induced by application of 4-AP.",
