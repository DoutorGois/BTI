     "AB": "Many studies have explored the premature aging of accelerated senescence-prone (SAMP8) mice. However, the cause of premature aging in this strain remains unknown. We analyzed the expression of ecotropic, xenotropic, and polytropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) in the brains of accelerated senescence-resistant (SAMR1) and SAMP8 mice. No ecotropic mRNA was detected in SAMR1 mice, and only Akv-type ecotropic MuLV mRNA was detected in SAMP8 mice. Restriction mapping of the full-length infectious E-MuLV genome from SAMP8 confirmed its identity as Akv. mRNAs corresponding to a prototypical polytropic MuLV and to an unusual xenotropic MuLV were detected at equal levels in SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice, but no infectious virus of either host range type was detected. In order to determine the cellular localization of Akv expression in SAMP8 mice, we used immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to detect expression of the E-MuLV capsid gag (CAgag) gene in striatum, brainstem, hippocampus, and cerebellum of 12-month-old SAMR1 and SAMP8 mice. The CAgag antigen was seen in the neurons, oligodendroglia, and vascular endothelium of these brain regions of SAMP8 mice, but not in SAMR1 mice. To evaluate the correlation between activation of astrocytes and expression of Akv, we performed double-immunohistochemical staining for both glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CAgag in SAMR1 and SAMP8 mice. Strong astrocytic activation and extensive vacuolation were observed around CAgag-positive neurons in SAMP8 mice, whereas in SAMR1 mice neither astrocytosis nor vacuolation were present. CAgag antigen was also localized in astrocytes of the hippocampus region of SAMP8 mice. Electron micrography showed that a number of vacuoles were found in the cytoplasm of MuLV-positive neurons and the extracellular space surrounding these neurons showed lytic changes. These results suggest that endogenous Akv provirus is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, vascular endothelium, and oligodendroglia in the brains of SAMP8 and that this virus could play an important role in the brain aging processes in this mouse strain.",
