     "AB": "In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we aimed to evaluate whether distinct regions of the hippocampus were associated with spatial memory for items presented in different locations of the visual field. In Experiment 1, during the study phase, participants viewed abstract shapes in the left or right visual field while maintaining central fixation. At test, old shapes were presented at fixation and participants classified each shape as previously in the \"left\" or \"right\" visual field followed by an \"unsure\"-\"sure\"-\"very sure\" confidence rating. Accurate spatial memory for shapes in the left visual field was isolated by contrasting accurate versus inaccurate spatial location responses. This contrast produced one hippocampal activation in which the interaction between item type and accuracy was significant. The analogous contrast for right visual field shapes did not produce activity in the hippocampus; however, the contrast of high confidence versus low confidence right-hits produced one hippocampal activation in which the interaction between item type and confidence was significant. In Experiment 2, the same paradigm was used but shapes were presented in each quadrant of the visual field during the study phase. Accurate memory for shapes in each quadrant, exclusively masked by accurate memory for shapes in the other quadrants, produced a distinct activation in the hippocampus. A multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of hippocampal activity revealed a significant correlation between behavioral spatial location accuracy and hippocampal MVPA accuracy across participants. The findings of both experiments indicate that distinct hippocampal regions are associated with different visual field locations.",
