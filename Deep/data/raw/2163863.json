     "AB": "The density of cortical [3H]nitrendipine binding sites was elevated by over 40% in rats rendered morphine-abstinent by administration of naloxone after chronic treatment with morphine. The morphine-abstinent rats had significantly shortened response latencies in the hot-plate test. Nifedipine treatment abolished the signs of abstinence and normalized the hot-plate latencies in morphine-dependent, naloxone-treated rats. The results indicate that the symptoms of abstinence are related to a functional state of cortical dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels.",
