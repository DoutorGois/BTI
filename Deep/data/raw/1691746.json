     "AB": "This study identifies the neuronal types of the rhesus monkey lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and discusses the importance of these data in the context of the connectional patterns of the LEC and the possible role of these cells in neurodegenerative diseases. These neuronal types were characterized with the aid of Golgi impregnation techniques. These characterizations were based upon their spine densities, dendritic arrays, and, where possible, axonal arborizations. The cells could be segregated into only spinous and sparsely spinous types. The most numerous spinous types were pyramidal neurons. Other spinous types included multipolar, vertical bipolar and bitufted, and vertical tripolar neurons. The sparsely spinous neuronal types consisted of multipolar, horizontal bipolar and bitufted, and neurogliaform cells. These cells were further classified with the aid of histochemical stains and immunocytochemical markers. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry stained multipolar, bipolar, and bitufted neurons. Stain for cytochrome oxidase (CO) was found in pyramidal and nonpyramidal cell types. Immunocytochemical techniques revealed several nonpyramidal neurons that contain somatostatin (Som) or substance P (SP). This study complements previous analyses of the neuronal components described in the LEC and adds further information about the distribution of selected neurochemicals within this cortex.",
