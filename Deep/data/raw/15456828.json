     "PG": "8542-50",
     "AB": "Although the vesicular protein synaptotagmin I contains two Ca2+-binding domains (C2A and C2B), Ca2+ binding to the C2B domain is more important for triggering synchronous neurotransmitter release. We have used point mutagenesis to determine the functional contributions of the five negatively charged aspartate (Asp) residues that constitute the Ca2+-binding sites in the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I. Transfecting wild-type synaptotagmin I DNA into cultured hippocampal neurons from synaptotagmin I knock-out mice rescued Ca2+-dependent synchronous transmitter release and reduced a slower, asynchronous component of release, indicating that synaptotagmin I suppresses asynchronous release. Mutating either the second or third Asp residues of the C2B domain potently inhibited the ability of synaptotagmin I to rescue synchronous release but did not change its ability to suppress asynchronous release. Synaptotagmin I with mutations in the first or fourth Asp residues of the C2B domain partially rescued synchronous release and partially suppressed asynchronous release, whereas neutralizing the fifth Asp residue had no effect on the ability of synaptotagmin I to rescue transmitter release. Thus, we conclude that the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I regulates neurotransmitter release in at least two ways. Synchronous release absolutely requires binding of Ca2+ to the second and third Asp residues in this domain. For the suppression of asynchronous release, Ca2+ binding to the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I apparently is not necessary because mutation of the second Asp residue inhibits Ca2+ binding, yet still allows this protein to suppress asynchronous release.",
