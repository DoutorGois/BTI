     "AB": "A quantitative morphometric study of brain development has been made in growth-retarded fetal sheep. Intrauterine growth retardation was induced by removal of endometrial caruncles in the ewe prior to conception thereby reducing the size of the placenta in a subsequent pregnancy. Total brain and cerebellar weights were reduced by 21% (P less than 0.002) and the cerebrum by 20% (P less than 0.05) in the growth-retarded fetuses at 139 +/- 1 day (term = 146 days) compared with age matched control fetuses. Measurements of mean neuronal diameters were made on Purkinje cells, cerebellar granule cells, cortical cells in the motor and visual areas and hippocampal pyramidal cells; none were significantly different from control values. In growth-retarded fetuses compared with controls, there was a significant reduction in the thickness of the motor and visual cortices and the numerical density of neurones was significantly higher in these areas. In the cerebellar vermis, the number of Purkinje cells per unit surface area of Purkinje cell layer was higher, the numerical density of granule cells was significantly higher concomitant with a reduction in the area of the inner granular layer, and the area of the molecular layer was also reduced. In the hippocampal formation, the numerical density of pyramidal neurones was higher and the width of the stratum moleculare (dentate gyrus) was reduced. Migration of pyramidal neurones from the germinal layer to stratum pyramidale was not affected. These findings indicate that intrauterine growth retardation does not markedly affect cell size or neuronal migration (in the hippocampus) but does cause a significant reduction in the growth of the neuropil in the cerebellum, motor and visual cortices and the hippocampal formation.",
