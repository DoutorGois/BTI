     "AB": "Alzheimers disease is characterized by cognitive deficits, impaired long-term potentiation of learning and memory. A progressive reduction in cholinergic neurons in some areas of the brain such as cortex and hippocampus is related to the deficits in memory and cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the current project a new series of phthalimide derivatives were synthesized. Phthalic anhydride was reacted with 4-aminobenzoic acid in the presence of triethylamine under reflux condition. Then, the obtained acidic derivative was utilized for preparation of final compounds via an amidation reaction through a carbodiimde coupling reaction. Anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of synthesized derivatives was assessed by Ellmans test. Compound 4g in this series exhibited the highest inhibitory potency (IC50 = 1.1 +/- 0.25 microM) compared to donepezil (IC50 = 0.41 +/- 0.12 microM) as reference drug.",
