     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of Buyanghuanwu decoction (BYHWD) in inducing nerve proliferation in rats with sequelae of ischemic stroke. METHODS: A rat model of ischemic stroke sequelae was established by means of craniectomy in which the right common carotid artery was ligated with 4-0 silk thread followed by cauterization of the right middle cerebral artery. Programmed electric shock was administered 24 h after the onset of ischemic stroke for 2 h daily for 20 consecutive days. The rats in sham operation group were not subjected to ligation of the right common carotid artery or right middle cerebral artery occlusion. The rats in the treatment groups were given oral BYHWD for 15 consecutive days. All the rats received repeated intraperitoneal injections of the cell proliferation-specific marker 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and the intake of BrdU in the cerebral tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The number of BrdU-immunoreactive cells in the cerebral tissues of BYHWD-treated rats was significantly greater than that in the untreated model group. CONCLUSION: BYHWD can promote nerve proliferation in rats with ischemic stroke sequelae.",
