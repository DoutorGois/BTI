     "AB": "Studies in humans and rats suggest that intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) permanently resets the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. HPA axis reprogramming may involve persistently altered expression of the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (hpGR), an important regulator of HPA axis reactivity. Persistent alteration of gene expression, long after the inciting event, is thought to be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms that affect mRNA and mRNA variant expression. GR mRNA variants in both humans and rats include eleven 5'-end variants and GRalpha, the predominant 3'-end variant. The 3'-end variants associated with glucocorticoid resistance in humans (GRbeta, GRgamma, GRA, and GRP) have not been reported in rats. We hypothesized that in the rat hippocampus IUGR would decrease total GR mRNA, increase GRbeta, GRgamma, GRA, and GRP, and affect epigenetics of the GR gene at birth (D0) and at 21 days of life (D21). IUGR increased hpGR and exon 1.7 hpGR mRNA in males at D0 and D21, associated with increased trimethyl H3/K4 at exon 1.7 at both time points. IUGR also increased hpGRgamma in males at D0 and D21, associated with increased acetyl H3/K9 at exon 3 at both time points. hpGRA increased in female IUGR rats at D0 and D21. In addition, our data support the existence of hpGRbeta and hpGRP in the rat. IUGR has sex-specific, persistent effects on GR expression and its histone code. We speculate that postnatal changes in hippocampal GR variant and total mRNA expression may underlie IUGR-associated HPA axis reprogramming.",
