     "AB": "The influence of adrenalin and bilateral adrenal desympathization on the seizure activity of the brain caused by dorsal hippocampal electric stimulation was studied in adult cats. It is shown that within some days of adrenal bilateral desympathization the threshold of hippocampal epileptogenic stimulation fells and the duration of the seizure action grows. Intravenous injection of adrenalin causes an increase in the effectiveness of the hippocampal epileptogenic stimulation. Injection of small doses of adrenalin into the mesencephalic reticular formation causes suppression of the evoked seizure activity: the threshold of hippocampal epileptogenic stimulation increases and duration of seizure discharges reduces. It is assumed that one of the main factors limiting the seizure activity of the brain is the enrichment of the circulating blood with adrenalin.",
