     "AB": "Increased oxidative stress and energy metabolism deficit have been regarded as an important underlying cause for neuronal damage induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In this study, we investigated the oxidative mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol, a potent polyphenol antioxidant found in grapes, on structural and biochemical abnormalities in rats subjected to global cerebral ischemia. Experimental model of transient global cerebral ischemia was induced in Wistar rats by the four vessel occlusion method for 10 min and followed by different periods of reperfusion. Nissl and fluoro jade C stained indicated extensive neuronal death at 7 days after I/R. These findings were preceded by a rapid increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), lipid peroxidation, as well as by a decrease in Na(+)K(+)-ATPase activity and disrupted antioxidant defenses (enzymatic and non-enzymatic) in hippocampus and cortex. Administrating resveratrol 7 days prior to ischemia by intraperitoneal injections (30 mg/kg) significantly attenuated neuronal death in both studied structures, as well as decreased the generation of ROS, lipid peroxidation and NO content. Furthermore, resveratrol brought antioxidant and Na(+)K(+)-ATPase activity in cortex and hippocampus back to normal levels. These results support that resveratrol could be used as a preventive, or therapeutic, agent in global cerebral ischemia and suggest that scavenging of ROS contributes, at least in part, to resveratrol-induced neuroprotection.",
