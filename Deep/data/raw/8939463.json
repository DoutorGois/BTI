     "AB": "NMDA increases the release of [14C]acetylcholine and [3H]spermidine or of [14C]GABA and [3H]dopamine from rat striatal slices. The pharmacology of these responses suggests that release of dopamine and GABA, acetylcholine, and spermidine is mediated, respectively, by three distinct NMDA receptor subtypes. IC50 values of compounds for the inhibition of dopamine and GABA release were closely matched, suggesting mediation by the same subtype. This receptor was generally more sensitive to all NMDA antagonists tested relative to that controlling acetylcholine or spermidine release (channel blockers, glycine antagonists, competitive antagonists and polyamine antagonists). The receptors controlling acetylcholine and spermidine release were characterised by lower antagonist sensitivity in general, and that controlling spermidine release was further defined by a marked insensitivity to ifenprodil, eliprodil, magnesium, dextromethorphan, dextrorphan, memantine, desipramine and polyamine spider toxins. In binding studies in which the displacement of 2 nM [3H]MK801 was studied in membranes prepared from a number of brain regions (in the presence of saturating concentrations of glutamate, glycine and spermidine) small regional differences in IC50 values were observed for a number of channel blockers, but no compound generated biphasic displacement curves that would allow masking of a particular subtype and it was not possible to detect binding components that were insensitive to memantine, dextrorphan dextromethorphan or desipramine. Ifenprodil produced biphasic displacement curves in the 1-day-old rat cortex and midbrain (with IC50 values of approximately 2 and 70 microM) and both ifenprodil and eliprodil displaced a small proportion (18%) of [3H]MK-801 with high affinity in the adult rat spinal cord. Displacement of [3H]MK801 by these compounds in all other adult brain regions (cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, pons, medulla, cerebellum) was monophasic and of low affinity. In general the subtype selectivity suggested by the release studies was not mirrored in the binding experiments, probably because of excessive heterogeneity of sites in the membrane preparations and to the subtype selectivity of [3H]MK801 itself.",
