     "AB": "Memantine, used as a drug for treatment of spasticity and other extrapyramidal disorders as well as dementia, was shown to prevent brain damage caused by the glutamate (N-methyl-D-aspartate, NMDA) receptor agonist, quinolinic acid. Studies were focused on the hippocampal formation which is known to be highly vulnerable to quinolinate. Pretreatment of animals with memantine added to the food led to a reliable protection of hippocampal neurons when the drug was administered chronically for a period of 10 days prior to quinolinate exposure (i.c.v. injected). Additional i.p. administration of memantine (simultaneously with quinolinic acid or up to 24 h later) did not substantially add to the protective potency of the memantine diet. Our findings indicate that memantine may have beneficial effects in the treatment of brain disorders which are mediated by excitotoxic effects of glutamate.",
