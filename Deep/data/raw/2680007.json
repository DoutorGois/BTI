     "AB": "We review the evidence for altered gene expression in Alzheimer's disease brain and identify alternative molecular approaches for isolating additional novel markers. One marker, pADHC-9, was isolated from a human hippocampal cDNA library by differential screening with AD and control cDNA probes. This clone hybridizes to a 2 Kb RNA which is increased 2 fold in AD hippocampus. The deduced amino acid sequence of pADHC-9 codes for a 52 kDAL protein similar to a testicular sulfated glycoprotein secreted by rat Sertoli cells. The normal function of this protein in brain and whether that function is altered in Alzheimer's disease is unknown.",
