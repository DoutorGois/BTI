     "AB": "Recent work has shown that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) increase in response to seizure activity and can contribute significantly to the expression and progression of partial seizures. Using the kindling model of temporal lobe seizures, we evaluated the ability of local hippocampal injections of mGluR1 antisense or mGluR3 antisense oligonucleotides to suppress receptor expression and alter hippocampal kindling. Daily antisense injections in the hippocampus resulted in a significant decrease in mGluR1 or mGluR2/3 immunoreactivity. Rats injected with mGluR3 antisense showed a brief suppression of afterdischarge duration when compared to matched rats injected with a nonsense-oligonucleotide. Rats injected with a mGluR1 antisense oligonucleotide had a dramatic suppression of the rate of seizure progression with no significant effect on afterdischarge duration. Suppression of mGluR1 synthesis by local antisense inhibition may provide a new therapeutic approach for the control of epileptogenesis.",
