     "AB": "Specific serotonin binding (5-HT1, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2 subtypes) and membrane anisotropy were measured at 2 h intervals over a 24 h period in the hippocampus and cortex of Wistar WU rats, housed under a 12 h light-dark cycle, with lights on at 07.00. All experiments were performed both in March and December. In the hippocampus significant circadian rhythms could be ascertained for 5-HT1 binding sites in March and December while for 5-HT1A (subtype of 5-HT1) binding sites the circadian rhythm was only significant in March. The membrane anisotropy also showed significant variations only in March. Circadian rhythms were also found in the cortex for 5-HT1 (December) and 5-HT2 (March and December) binding sites as well as for the membrane anisotropy (December). A correlation was found between membrane anisotropy and 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 binding sites in hippocampus and cortex, respectively. A circadian rhythmicity was also observed for serotonin release as measured by in vivo voltammetry in both brain areas. The results obtained on the diurnal variations of serotonin receptor subtypes and serotonin release and the probable inverse relationship of these two parameters may be relevant in understanding the coupling of pre- and postsynaptic activity.",
