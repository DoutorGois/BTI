Deficits in the ability to learn a conditioned, hippocampally mediated, forced alternation behavior, which were caused by a bilateral transection of the fornix-fimbria pathway, were ameliorated in the septal transplant recipients. The successful performance of the task was correlated to the density index of acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampal section.",
