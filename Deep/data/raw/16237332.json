     "AB": "Ca2+ influx through the N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptor leads to activation and postsynaptic accumulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. NR1 and NR2B subunits of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor serve as high-affinity Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II docking sites in dendritic spines on autophosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. By comparative Western blot analysis, we show a reduction of NR1 and phosphorylated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease brains. We also found a significant correlation between phosphorylated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and NR1 levels. Our study extends the view that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor deficiency underlies memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease, and that this process likely involves insufficient activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.",
