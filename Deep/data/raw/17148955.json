     "AB": "To investigate strain differences and genetic effects on different aspects of neurogenesis, we compared young adult spontaneously hypertensive/hyperactive rats (SHR) and stroke-prone SHR (SHRSP) with the genetic control WKY strain. In both hypertensive/hyperactive strains, the number of newly generated neurons and the number of lineage-determined cells as detected by doublecortin (DCX) immunoreactivity were significantly increased. SHRSP had significantly more DCX-positive cells than the other groups. Whereas cell proliferation as measured by Ki67 expression was increased in SHR, we found no difference between SHRSP and WKY. In summary, we found increased net neurogenesis in both hypertensive/hyperactive strains. However, this phenotype was based on different mechanisms in the course of neuronal development: cell proliferation in SHR and cell survival in SHRSP. In addition, we found that within strains the number of DCX-positive cells was not predictive of the net number of new neurons and that the increase in neurogenesis was not significantly correlated with blood pressure in SHR and WKY. However, in both SHR and SHRSP, cell proliferation showed an association with blood pressure recordings.",
