     "AB": "The dorsal vagal complex (DVC) of the brainstem is the major reflex center of autonomic nervous system. Several neuroplasticity effectors have been identified in the DVC of adult rat, such as PSA-NCAM, GAP-43, BDNF and its receptor TrkB; moreover, acute vagal stimulation was found to induce c-fos and to down-regulate western-blot-assayed tissular concentration of PSA-NCAM. Adult neurogenesis was first shown in rat DVC by BrdU incorporation combined with phenotypic labelling in situ; new neurons are generated in equal proportions with new astrocytes and at a lower rate than in olfactory bulb or hippocampus. Intrinsic proliferative cells were then detected within the DVC of adult rat by means of Ki-67 immunohistochemistry and western-blot of D-cyclins. The presence of neural stem cells within DVC was directly demonstrated by applying the in vitro neurosphere assay on microdissected adult DVC explants; DVC-derived neurospheres display lower proliferation rate and neurogenic potential than forebrain ones. Vagotomy in adult promotes massive and transient increase of neurogenic and microglial proliferations within DVC, the kinetics and location of which were analyzed by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry and cyclin D western blot. These mechanisms shed light on so far unknown plasticity potential in DVC, which brings novel cues about physiological adaptations of autonomic reflexes in adult mammals.",
