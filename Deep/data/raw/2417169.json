     "AB": "Injections of the neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, into rostral raphe nuclei in rats reduced serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in hippocampus to 35-50% of normal levels but only reduced 5-HT synthesis and catabolism by 20-35%. The small reduction in 5-HT metabolism as compared to depletion of 5-HT suggests that 5-HT turnover was increased in nerve terminals that survived the neurotoxin lesion. Transplantation of rat fetal raphe cells into the 5-HT-denervated hippocampus restored 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels and 5-HT synthesis to 125-150% of normal. This demonstrates that transplantation of fetal raphe tissue can restore metabolism to normal levels in the 5-HT denervated hippocampus.",
