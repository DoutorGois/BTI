     "AB": "The system of differential equations describing the plasticity of the hippocampal pyramidal neuron CA3, developed before, was analyzed. The system was divided into two groups according to magnitudes of the biochemical reaction constants. The first group with large values of the constants was transformed into quasi stationary algebraic equations. This allowed one to transform the system of 32 differential equations to a system containing only 4 differential equations, which can be used for modeling of learning processes in various parts of the brain.",
