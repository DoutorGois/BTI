     "AB": "Microglia-mediated inflammation is a major pathological mechanism contributing to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target. Chunghyuldan (CHD; Qingxue-dan in Chinese and Daio-Orengedokuto in Japanese) possesses wide-ranging biological effects, including anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-stroke, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities that could affect neurological functions. In this study, we examined the effects of CHD in in-vitro and in-vivo models of AD induced by the oligomeric form of amyloid-beta (Abeta oligomer), which acts directly on microglia-mediated neuroinflammation to result in neuronal damage and cognitive impairment. CHD at 0.1-100 mug.mL(-1) significantly protected PC12 cells and rat primary hippocampal cells from Abeta oligomer1-42 toxicity. In addition, CHD at 1-10 mug.mL(-1) inhibited Abeta oligomer1-42 induced production of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1beta in microglial cells. In an in-vivo AD model, administration of CHD (50 mg.(kg body mass)(-1), for 5 days, per oral) inhibited the activation of astrocytes and microglia in the dentate gyrus and neuronal damage in the CA1 of the ipsilateral hippocampus. Moreover, CHD ameliorated cognitive impairment induced by Abeta oligomer1-42 toxicity. These results demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of CHD through inhibition of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in in-vitro and in-vivo AD-like models induced by Abeta oligomer1-42 toxicity.",
