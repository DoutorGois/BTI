     "AB": "The present study attempted to evaluate the efficacy of enriched housing conditions in promoting behavioral recovery following subicular lesion. Rats with bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of ventral subiculum were exposed to either enriched housing conditions or standard housing for 6 h daily for 10 days. The performance of the lesioned rats reared in standard housing conditions was severely impaired in both 8-arm radial maze and water maze tasks. Lesioned rats exposed to enriched housing showed behavioral recovery in the 8-arm radial maze but not in the water maze. Our study suggests the possibility that recovery may be based on the functional demand of spatial tasks and may require more appropriate environmental stimulation.",
