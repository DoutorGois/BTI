     "AB": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a recently identified member of the secretin/vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) family. There are at least two types of receptor for PACAP: type I (PACAPR), which specifically binds PACAP; and type II (VIP/PACAPR), which binds both PACAP and VIP. The localization of PACAPR in the rat brain was determined by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. We raised antisera against a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain which is found in all subtypes of PACAPR in order to localize PACAPR-like immunoreactivity (PACAPR-LI) in the rat brain. In general, the distribution of PACAPR-LI correlated well with the distribution of PACAPR transcripts. Particularly strong PACAPR mRNA expression was detected in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, cerebellum and hypothalamus and moderate labeling was detected in other scattered regions. At the cellular level, PACAPR-LI appeared to be concentrated predominantly in neuronal perikarya and dendrites. At the ultrastructural level, strong immunostaining for the PACAPR was found in plasma membranes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasmic matrix, and at synapses. This study provides the basis for a better understanding of the functions of PACAP in the rat brain.",
