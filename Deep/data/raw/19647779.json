     "AB": "Silymarin (SM), the active complex of milk thistle, is a lipophilic fruit extract and is composed of several isomer flavonolignans. Flavonoids are antioxidants found molecules capable of intercepting reactive oxygen species (ROS). The oxidative stress (OS) is caused by imbalance between antioxidant defenses and production of ROS causing oxidative damage to macromolecules. Brain is susceptible to oxidative stress and it is associated with age-related brain dysfunction. This study evaluated the effect of SM on biochemical parameters that evaluate OS in aged and young rat brain. For measures of OS were used measures of total oxyradical scavenging capacity (ACAP) through the concentration of ROS by fluorescence, lipid peroxidation (LPO), via FOX and TBARS, proteins oxidation by Western blot (WB). Rats were treated with SM at doses of 200 and 400mg/kg/day (SM200 and SM400). The LPO analyzed through FOX was increased in the hippocampus of aged animals treated with SM400, but in the cortex of young and aged, the highest dose of SM decreased LPO analyzed through TBARS. Both doses have seemed most effective in the reduction of oxidized proteins in aged brain. These results suggest that SM may contribute to the prevention of aged-related and pathological degenerative processes in the brain.",
