     "AB": "Neural activity persisting for one to hundreds of seconds has been postulated to be a substrate of memory. This review article illustrates examples of such activity in limbic system structures including the hippocampus, postsubiculum, and the anterodorsal thalamus. These neuronal responses include better known correlates with the spatial position as well as with head direction of the animal relative to its environment as well as other lesser known examples. Since head direction responses are greater when the animal is actively moving than when passively rotated, it has been proposed that there might be a general mechanism where the behavioral state of the animal can provide modulatory gating of such persistent signals. This would regulate the relative influence of these signals on downstream structures. Neural network attractor models of the head direction cell system are presented to demonstrate how these responses might originate, as well as the dynamics by which they are updated during movements.",
