     "AB": "Intelligent behavior demands not only multiple forms of spatial representation, but also coordination among the brain regions mediating those representations. Retrosplenial cortex is densely interconnected with the majority of cortical and subcortical brain structures that register an animal's position in multiple internal and external spatial frames of reference. This unique anatomy suggests that it functions to integrate distinct forms of spatial information and provides an interface for transformations between them. Evidence for this was found in rats traversing two different routes placed at different environmental locations. Retrosplenial ensembles robustly encoded conjunctions of progress through the current route, position in the larger environment and the left versus right turning behavior of the animal. Thus, the retrosplenial cortex has the requisite dynamics to serve as an intermediary between brain regions generating different forms of spatial mapping, a result that is consistent with navigational and episodic memory impairments following damage to this region in humans.",
