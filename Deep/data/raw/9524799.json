     "AB": "We examined a 65-year-old patient with clinicopathological features that met the criteria of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), particularly frontal lobe degeneration (FLD). He came from a family with concentrated occurrence of dementia symptoms in the presenium. Neuropathological examination disclosed brain atrophy locally pronounced on the frontotemporal lobes with characteristic neuronal loss, microvacuolation and astrocytic gliosis. There were no pathological hallmarks such as senile plaques, Pick bodies (PBs), achromatic cells and neurofibrillary tangles. Precise separation of FTD from Pick disease (PD) and motor neuron disease with dementia (MNDD) has not yet been established, and they are included in one spectrum. Antibodies against paired helical filament tau protein demonstrated immunopositive cytoskeletal structures within the neurons as well as the glial cells in the brain of the present case. They were selectively stained with tau 199/202 but not tau 396, which were provided newly to recognize phosphorylation at Ser 199/202 or Ser 396 in tau, respectively. We investigated tau pathology in the present case in comparison to 8 cases with PD that were clinicopathologically confirmed. Neither tau 199/202 nor tau 396 stained the CNS structures in PD cases with few PBs, while both stained evidently those as well as PBs in PD cases associated with many PBs; so that the present case could be distinguished from PD on the basis of the immunoreactivity to site-specific phosphorylated tau. Our result suggests that FTD, especially familial FLD type might involve unique tau pathology, no matter whether FLD is a distinct entity from PD, or a variant form in the wide FTD spectrum including PD and MNDD and other related disorders.",
