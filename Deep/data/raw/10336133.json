     "AB": "The effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine or glutamate treatment on mechanically induced intercellular calcium waves were studied in gap junction-coupled astroglial cells using rat astroglial-neuronal primary cultures from hippocampus. Imaging software was developed to study amplitude, velocity and extent of wave propagation. Velocity software was designed to find the cell contours automatically and to calculate travelled distance and time-delay of the calcium wave as it propagates from the stimulated cell to all other cells. Propagation analyses were performed to calculate the area of wave propagation. Mechanical stimulation of a single astroglial cell induced an intercellular calcium wave spreading from cell to cell in the astroglial syncytium. When registering the appearances of calcium signals in individual cells along the wave path upon re-stimulation of the same cell, 44.7% of the cells responded with similar calcium signal appearances the second time as the first time. A second wave from the opposite direction resulted in similar calcium signal appearances in 27.3% of the studied cells. Both amplitude and velocity of the calcium signal decreased most prominently in the first part and showed a later flattening out. Treatment with 5-hydroxytryptamine or glutamate for 20-30 s before mechanical stimulation increased the velocity of the calcium waves. 5-Hydroxytryptamine treatment for varying times decreased the propagation area of the calcium waves. In contrast, glutamate treatment increased the propagation area.",
