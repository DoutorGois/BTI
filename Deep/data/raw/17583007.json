     "AB": "Two lines of rats, selected according to the excitability of nervous system to the action of an electric current, served as the model objects to study the changes of heterochromatin characteristics in neurons of hippocampus (area CA3) 24 hours, 2 weeks, 2 and 6 months after exposure to prolonged emotional painful stress. It was shown that exposure to stress caused changes in the area, occupied by heterochromatin, only in rats with low-excitability: it was decreased 24 hours, 2 weeks and 2 months following the stress, while it was increased after 6 months as compared to control values. Thus, it was demonstrated for the first time that long-term modifications of heterochromatin structural characteristics of neurons in hippocampus (area CA3) could depend on genetically determined functional state of the nervous system.",
