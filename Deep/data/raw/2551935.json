     "AB": "Regional variations in capillary density, glucose utilization rate, and activities of the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase and the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase were compared in the rat brain. The distributions of capillaries and enzymes were studied by means of histochemical staining techniques, and glucose metabolism was measured by means of [14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiography. Analysis of 18 gray and five white matter regions revealed a positive correlation between capillary density and glucose utilization rate. A negative correlation was found between capillary density and lactate dehydrogenase among gray matter structures. Analysis of capillaries and enzymes was also performed within laminated histological fields: hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and olfactory cortex. In general, this revealed reciprocal patterns of staining for lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase. Capillary density paralleled cytochrome oxidase activity. The zones of intense staining for lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase corresponded to the synaptic terminal fields of different input pathways. These findings demonstrate distinct distributions of a glycolytic and an oxidative enzyme within the brain which are at least partly associated with pathway specificity.",
