     "AB": "Nitric oxide is involved in memory and motor learning. We investigated possible influences of exercise on spatial memory and NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemical activity in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum. Fifteen albino Swiss mice between the 22nd and 55th post-natal days were exercised in the following modalities: voluntary (V), acrobatic (A), acrobatic/voluntary (AV) and forced (F) and compared to inactive group (I). After the exercise period, all subjects were tested in the water maze for 3 days. Animal brains were processed for NADPH-d histochemistry. Densitometry of the neuropil of the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum and morphometric analysis of NADPHd+ type I neurons of the striatum were done. Exercise groups presented higher levels of NADPH-d activity in the molecular and polymorphic layers of dentate gyrus and lacunosum molecular layer of CA1. The A group presented higher NADPH-d activity in the cerebellar granular layer than all other groups. Branching points and dendritic segment densities of NADPH-d type I neurons were higher in V, A and AV than in F and I groups. Exercise groups revealed best performances on water maze tests. Thus, different modalities of exercise increases in different proportions for the nitrergic activity in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum, and these changes seem to be beneficial to spatial memory.",
