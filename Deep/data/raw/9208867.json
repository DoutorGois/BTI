     "AB": "Glutamatergic transmission at a principal neuron-interneuron synapse was investigated by dual whole-cell patch-clamp recording in rat hippocampal slices combined with morphological analysis. Evoked EPSPs with rapid time course (half duration = 4 ms; 34 degrees C) were generated at multiple synaptic contacts established on the interneuron dendrites close to the soma. The underlying postsynaptic conductance change showed a submillisecond rise and decay, due to the precise timing of glutamate release and the rapid deactivation of the postsynaptic AMPA receptors. Simulations based on a compartmental model of the interneuron indicated that the rapid postsynaptic conductance change determines the shape and the somatodendritic integration of EPSPs, thus enabling interneurons to detect synchronous principal neuron activity.",
