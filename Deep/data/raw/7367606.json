     "AB": "Ultrasound examination of the infant brain has been performed in selected medical centers for many years. However, the equipment necessary for obtaining satisfactory visualization of the brain has only recently become commercially available. Currently, ultrasonography is an excellent, noninvasive, inexpensive, rapid, and safe imaging modality for the evaluation of hydrocephalus and other pathologic conditions of the neonatal brain. Ventricular size can often be evaluated in infants up to two or three years of age, but a detailed image of the brain parenchyma becomes more difficult to obtain in a term infant after the first two to three months of life. With the use of the water path and high resolution, real-time systems and with the delineation of structures by multiple projections, (axial, coronal, sagittal and occipital), complex abnormalities may be delineated.",
