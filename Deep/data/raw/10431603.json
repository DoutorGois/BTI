     "AB": "Our previous studies revealed that purified extracts (submicrosomal fractions) obtained from peripheral nerves predegenerated for 7-, 28-, and 35-days facilitated neurite outgrowth from the injured hippocampus. It is recently known that totally transected peripheral nerve exhibits biphasic neurite-promoting activity. The early phase lasts 7 days. The aim of the present study was to find whether extracts obtained from short-time predegenerated (1-6 days) peripheral nerves exert any neurotrophic effect and when this influence is maximal. Experiments were carried out on adult male Wistar rats. Sciatic nerves were totally transected and following 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 days their distal stumps were homogenized and centrifuged. Extracts were implanted into the hippocampus by means of autologous connective tissue chambers. Reference groups were treated with extracts from non-predegenerated nerves, NGF solution or fibrin (groups C, NGF and B + F, respectively). In all groups FITC-HRP was injected into the extracranial end of chamber six weeks following surgery. Histochemic technique showed AChE-positive fibres inside the chambers of all examined groups. Fluorescence microscopic examination revealed the labeled cells in all examined groups, however their number was different in each group. They were most numerous at the fourth day of predegeneration.",
