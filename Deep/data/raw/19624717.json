     "AB": "PURPOSE: Brain-type creatine kinase (CK-B) and ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase (UbCKmit) act as components of local phosphocreatine ATP shuttles that help in the compartmentalization and maintenance of pools of high-energy phosphate molecules in both neurons and glial cells. We investigated the role of these brain-type creatine kinases during extreme energy-demanding conditions in vivo (generalized tonic-clonic seizures) and in vitro. METHODS: The physiologic response of wild-types and mice lacking both CK-B and UbCKmit (CK--/--mice) to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures was measured using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and behavioral monitoring. In vitro intracellular Ca(2+) kinetics in hippocampal granule neurons were monitored upon single and repetitive depolarizations. RESULTS: PTZ induced in only a few CK--/-- mice PTZ seizure-like behavior, but in all wild-types a full-blown seizure. EEG analysis showed that preseizure jerking was associated with high-amplitude discharges. Wild-type EEG recordings showed continuous runs of rhythmic 4-6 Hz activity, whereas no rhythmic EEG activities were observed in the few CK--/-- mice that developed a behavioral seizure. All other CK--/-- mice displayed a sudden postictal depression without any development of a generalized seizure. Hippocampal granule neurons of CK--/-- mice displayed a higher Ca(2+) removal speed following repetitive KCl-induced depolarizations. DISCUSSION: Deficiency for creatine kinase is affecting brain energy metabolism and will likely contribute to the disturbance of seizure development. Because CK--/-- hippocampal neurons exhibited an increase in Ca(2+) removal rate of elevated intracellular levels, we conclude that altered Ca(2+) clearance in CK--/-- neurons could play a role in the abnormal EEG and seizure activity.",
