     "AB": "Topiramate is a structurally novel neurotherapeutic agent with a unique combination of pharmacological properties and currently is available in most world markets for treating several seizure disorders. Because its pharmacological profile was suggestive of possible activity as a neuroprotectant, topiramate was evaluated and found to be active in several animal models of stroke or neuropathic pain. This prompted an evaluation of topiramate as a possible neurotrophic agent. In this study, topiramate enhanced the recovery of facial nerve function after injury when administered orally at therapeutically relevant doses, and significantly increased neurite outgrowth in cell cultures derived from fetal rat cortical and hippocampal tissues.",
