     "PG": "1048-57",
     "AB": "Heterozygous CB1 receptor knockout mice were used to examine the effect of reduced CB1 receptor density on G-protein activation in membranes prepared from four brain regions: cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum/globus pallidus (striatum/GP) and cingulate cortex. Results showed that CB1 receptor levels were approximately 50% lower in heterozygous mice in all regions examined. However, maximal stimulation of [(35)S]guanosine-5'-(gamma-O-thio) triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding by the high efficacy agonist WIN 55,212-2 was reduced by only 20-25% in most brain regions, with the exception of striatum/GP where the decrease in stimulation was as predicted (approximately 50%). Furthermore, although the efficacies of the cannabinoid partial agonists, methanandamide and (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, were similarly lower in heterozygous mice, their relative efficacies compared with WIN 55,212-2 were generally unchanged. Saturation analysis of net WIN 55,212-2-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding showed that decreased stimulation by WIN 55,212-2 in striatum/GP of heterozygous mice was caused by a decrease in the apparent affinity of net-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding. The apparent maximal number of binding sites (B(max)) values of net WIN 55,212-2-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding were unchanged in cerebellum and striatum/GP of heterozygous mice, but decreased in cingulate cortex, with a similar trend in hippocampus. Moreover, in every region except cingulate cortex, the maximal number of net-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding sites per receptor was significantly increased in heterozygous mice. These results indicate region-dependent increases in the apparent efficiency of CB1 receptor-mediated G-protein activation in heterozygous CB1 knockout mice.",
