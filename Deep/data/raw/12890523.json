     "AB": "The enzyme 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 alpha-HSD) is involved in the generation of neuroactive steroids through ring-A-reduction of hormonal precursors. We examined the developmental regulation of, gender differences in, and effects of hormonal manipulations on the expression of 3 alpha-HSD in the rat hippocampus. High levels of 3 alpha-HSD mRNA were found on postnatal day 7, coinciding with the stress hyporesponsive period in the rat. Gender differences in 3 alpha-HSD expression were documented during puberty, but not in adulthood. Adrenalectomy and gonadectomy, and supplementation with individual steroid hormones influenced 3 alpha-HSD expression in a gender-specific mode. We also demonstrate that the manifestation of behavioral and endocrine consequences of early life stress depends on the individual's gender and gonadal status. Males are liable to aftereffects of neonatal maternal deprivation, regardless of their adult gonadal status. In females, however, anxiogenic aftereffects of neonatal stress become apparent only after gonadectomy. These data suggest that (i) transient increase of neurosteroid biosynthesis may contribute to stress hyporesponsiveness during early infancy; (ii) gonadal steroids regulate 3 alpha-HSD expression in the hippocampus in a sex-specific mode; (iii) physiological sex steroid secretions in females may mask behavioral consequences of adverse early life events, and (iv) concomitant treatment with the neurosteroid THP counteracts behavioral and endocrine dysregulation induced by neonatal stress in both genders.",
