     "AB": "Immunization of humans and APP-tg mice with full-length beta-amyloid (Abeta) results in reduced cerebral Abeta levels. However, due to adverse events in the AN1792 trial, alternative vaccines are required. We investigated dendrimeric Abeta1-15 (dAbeta1-15), which is composed of 16 copies of Abeta1-15 peptide on a branched lysine core and thus, includes an Abeta-specific B cell epitope but lacks the reported T cell epitope. Immunization by subcutaneous, transcutaneous, and intranasal routes of B6D2F1 wildtype mice led to anti-Abeta antibody production. Antibody isotypes were mainly IgG1 for subcutaneous or transcutaneous immunization and IgG2b for intranasal immunization, suggestive of a Th2-biased response. All Abeta antibodies preferentially recognized an epitope in Abeta1-7. Intranasal immunization of J20 APP-tg mice resulted in a robust humoral immune response with a corresponding significant reduction in cerebral plaque burden. Splenocyte proliferation against Abeta peptide was minimal indicating the lack of an Abeta-specific cellular immune response. Anti-Abeta antibodies bound monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar Abeta. Our data suggest that dAbeta1-15 may be an effective and potentially safer immunogen for Alzheimer's disease (AD) vaccination.",
