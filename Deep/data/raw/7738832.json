     "AB": "1. Whole-cell tight-seal records of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were made from inhibitory cells in the CA3 region of thin hippocampal slices. We tested the hypothesis that excitatory synaptic connections made on inhibitory cells involve few transmitter release sites. 2. EPSCs impinging on inhibitory cells had a time to peak of 0.4-3.8 ms and an amplitude of 8-90 pA at a holding potential of -60 mV. They were suppressed by the excitatory amino acid antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV). 3. Addition of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and Co2+ to the external solution reduced the frequency of EPSCs from 0.90 to 0.25 s-1 (n = 24 cells). In the majority of cells EPSC amplitude distributions were not significantly changed. 4. Increasing Ca2+ and reducing Mg2+ in the external solution, in order to enhance the probability of transmitter release, did not change EPSC amplitude distributions. In contrast, amplitude histograms for IPSCs recorded from pyramidal cells were shifted to higher mean values in this solution. 5. EPSCs were elicited in inhibitory cells by electrical stimulation via a glass pipette placed near to pyramidal cells in stratum pyramidale. EPSCs elicited by weak stimuli had similar amplitude distributions to excitatory synaptic events recorded in the presence of TTX and Co2+. 6. These findings suggest excitatory synaptic connections made with CA3 inhibitory cells involve few or possibly just one transmitter release site.",
