     "AB": "Altering the expression of Tomosyn-1 (Tomo-1), a soluble, R-SNARE domain-containing protein, significantly affects behavior in mice, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans Yet, the mechanisms that modulate Tomo-1 expression and its regulatory activity remain poorly defined. Here, we found that Tomo-1 expression levels influence postsynaptic spine density. Tomo-1 overexpression increased dendritic spine density, whereas Tomo-1 knockdown (KD) decreased spine density. These findings identified a novel action of Tomo-1 on dendritic spines, which is unique because it occurs independently of Tomo-1's C-terminal R-SNARE domain. We also demonstrated that the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is known to influence synaptic strength, dynamically regulates Tomo-1 protein levels. Immunoprecipitated and affinity-purified Tomo-1 from cultured rat hippocampal neurons was ubiquitinated, and the levels of ubiquitinated Tomo-1 dramatically increased upon pharmacological proteasome blockade. Moreover, Tomo-1 ubiquitination appeared to be mediated through an interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1, as immunoprecipitation of Tomo-1 from neurons co-precipitated HRD1, and this interaction increases upon proteasome inhibition. Further, in vitro reactions indicated direct, HRD1 concentration-dependent Tomo-1 ubiquitination. We also noted that the UPS regulates both Tomo-1 expression and functional output, as HRD1 KD in hippocampal neurons increased Tomo-1 protein level and dendritic spine density. Notably, the effect of HRD1 KD on spine density was mitigated by additional KD of Tomo-1, indicating a direct HRD1/Tomo-1 effector relationship. In summary, our results indicate that the UPS is likely to participate in tuning synaptic efficacy and spine dynamics by precise regulation of neuronal Tomo-1 levels.",
