     "AB": "Investigation of sensory reactions of the neurones of the dentate fascia was performed in unanaesthetized rabbits. Spontaneous activity usually consisted of long aperiodic high-frequency bursts with silent periods between them. Multimodal convergence was observed in 76% of records. Responses to sensory stimuli constituted three nearly equal groups: 1 -- tonic inhibitory reactions; 2--phasic (equal to stimulus duration) activatory responses; 3--simple \"specific\" responses of on-type, sometimes with secondary phasic components. In one microelectrode track, perpendicular to the double lamina of granular cells, all neurones usually responded in the same fashion.",
