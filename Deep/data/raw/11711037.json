     "AB": "The possible cyclosporin A application for rheumatoid arthritis that develops preferentially in middle-aged women raises concerns about adverse effects of cyclosporin A, including neurotoxicity in patients with climacterium. The present study was aimed at elucidating the effect of cyclosporin A on the convulsive activity and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neural activity of the hippocampus in ovariectomized rats, as a menopause/climacterium model. Ovariectomy markedly aggravated the effect of repeated administration of cyclosporin A (40 mg/kg, once a day for 5 or 6 days), convulsions and reduction of the basal GABA levels and aminooxyacetic acid-evoked GABA accumulation. These aggravations were blocked by estradiol replacement. The present findings demonstrated that ovariectomy increased the susceptibility to cyclosporin A-induced convulsions by accelerating an inhibitory action of cyclosporin A on GABA neural activity in the hippocampus, this being blocked by estrogen replacement. Menopause/climacterium is, therefore, included in the risk factors for cyclosporin A-induced neurotoxicity and this risk is lowered by estrogen replacement therapy.",
