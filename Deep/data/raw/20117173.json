     "AB": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the rat P3-like potential reflects \"attention processes\" rather than \"arousal level\". After controlling for arousal levels, event-related potentials (ERPs) of the rat were recorded at the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampal CA1 during active and passive oddball paradigms. The arousal level of the passive group was equivalent to that of the active group, while the amplitude of the P3-like potential during the active paradigm was greater than that during the passive paradigm for both sites. These results provide evidence that the rat P3-like component reflects \"attention processes\", which is also the case for the human P3 component. Rats can provide a useful model for investigation of the neural mechanisms of the P3 in humans.",
