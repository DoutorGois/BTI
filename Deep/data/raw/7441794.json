     "AB": "Field potential recordings of acoustic and photic-evoked responses were obtained from 15 brain sites of freely behaving unanesthetized rats previously implanted stereotaxically with permanent electrodes. Several dosages of morphine (1, 5, 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg) were examined. The activities recorded from all the structures in this study, except the cochlear nucleus (CoN), were affected by morphine. Different sensitivities to morphine threshold were observed between structures, and several structures exhibited dose-related patterns (ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), caudate nuucleus (CN), central gray (CG), hippocampus (Hipp), and lateral septum (Spt)). Several brain sites, after the initial dose of morphine, did not recruit more responses to subsequent doses of the drug, ie, exhibited all-or-none responses (pineal body (PB), medial thalamus (MTh), anterior hypothalamus (AH), mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF), and the dorsal raphe (DR)). In some structures, morphine induced increases in the response amplitudes, while in other sites decreases in response amplitudes were elicited. Biphasic responses, ie, increases in response amplitude after low doses of the drug and decreases in response amplitude after higher dosages, were also observed (VMH, CN, DR, CG, and MRF). The acoustic-evoked responses were affected by morphine more than the photic responses. The present observations indicated that 1) morphine exerts effects in many parts of the central nervous system (CNS); 2) some structures are more sensitive to morphine than others; 3) only a few structures exhibit dose-related patterns and, thus, may represent sites of direct morphine action; 4) some structures exhibit all-or-none responses; and 5) morphine depressed activity in some structures and increased activity in others, ie, morphine elicited different effects in different structures.",
