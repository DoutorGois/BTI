     "AB": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD) basal forebrain cholinergic neurons appear to be targeted primarily in early stages of the disease. Scopolamine (muscarinic receptor antagonist) has been used for decades to induce working and reference memory impairment in rodents. In this study, we evaluated the protective effect of kolaviron, a biflavonoid complex isolated from Garcinia kola seeds extract against scopolamine-induced memory impairment/oxidative stress. Rats were pretreated with kolaviron (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg p.o.) for 3 consecutive days, scopolamine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 1 h post-treatment on day 3. Five minutes post-scopolamine injection, memory function was assessed using the Y-maze or Morris water maze tests (MWM) in rats. The rats were sacrificed and brains isolated on the 8th day after the MWM test for estimation of acetylcholinesterase activity and nitrosative/oxidative stress status. Scopolamine injection induced deficit (P < 0.05) in percentage alternation behaviour in the Y-maze test indicating memory impairment which was ameliorated by kolaviron in a dose-dependent manner. Also, pre-training treatment with kolaviron significantly improved spatial learning evidenced in the session-dependent and more efficient localization of the hidden platform in the MWM test. Moreover, scopolamine injection induced significant increase in lipid peroxidation (prefrontal cortex), nitrite generation (striatum and hippocampus) and a decrease in glutathione (prefrontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus) and superoxide dismutase (striatum and hippocampus) level which was attenuated by kolaviron pre-treatment. These findings showed that kolaviron possesses cognition enhancing effect through enhancement of antioxidant defense and cholinergic systems.",
