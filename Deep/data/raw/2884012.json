     "AB": "Intracellular recordings were made from pyramidal CA1-neurones of the hippocampal slice preparation. Bath application of a wide variety of neuroleptics was found to depress the slow afterhyperpolarization, which is mediated in these neurons by a calcium-dependent potassium conductance occurring following a burst of spikes. The depression of this conductance took place in the presence of calcium spikes of normal amplitude and duration, and except in the case of trifluoperazine, without alteration in resting membrane potential or input resistance.",
