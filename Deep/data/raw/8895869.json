     "AB": "In adult rat hippocampus, simultaneous intracellular recordings from 989 pairs of CA1 pyramidal cells revealed nine monosynaptic, excitatory connections. Six of these pairs were sufficiently stable for electrophysiological analysis. Mean excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude recorded at a postsynaptic membrane potential between -67 and -70 mV was 0.7 +/- 0.5 mV (0.17-1.5 mV), mean 10-90% rise time was 2.7 +/- 0.9 ms (1.5-3.8 ms) and mean width at half-amplitude was 16.8 +/- 4.1 ms (11.6-25 ms). Cells were labelled with biocytin and identified histologically. For one pair that was fully reconstructed morphologically, excitatory postsynaptic potential average amplitude was 1.5 mV, 10-90% rise time 2.8 ms and width at half-amplitude 11.6 ms (at -67 mV). In this pair, correlated light and electron microscopy revealed that the presynaptic axon formed two synaptic contacts with third-order basal dendrites of the postsynaptic pyramid, one with a dendritic spine, the other with a dendritic shaft. In the four pairs tested, postsynaptic depolarization increased excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude and duration. In two, D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (50 microM) reduced the amplitude and duration of the excitatory postsynaptic potential. The remainder of the excitatory postsynaptic potential now increased with postsynaptic hyperpolarization and was abolished by 20 microM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (n = 1). Paired-pulse depression was evident in the four excitatory postsynaptic potentials tested. This depression decreased with increasing inter-spike interval. These results provide the first combined electrophysiological and morphological illustration of synaptic contacts between pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and confirm that connections between CA1 pyramidal neurons are mediated by both N-methyl-D-aspartate and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate/kainate receptors.",
