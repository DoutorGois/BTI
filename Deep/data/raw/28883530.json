     "AB": "Many studies have revealed the cognitive decline induced by microwave radiation. However, the systematic study on dose-dependent, frequency-dependent and accumulative effects of microwave exposure at different frequencies was lacking. Here, we studied the relationship between the effects and the power and frequency of microwave and analyzed the accumulative effects of two different frequency microwaves with the same average power density. After microwave radiation, declines in spatial learning and memory and fluctuations of brain electric activities were found in the 10 mW/cm(2) single frequency exposure groups and accumulative exposure groups. Meanwhile, morphological evidences in hippocampus also supported the cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, the decrease of Nissl contents in neurons indicated protein-based metabolic disorders in neurons. By detecting the key functional proteins of cholinergic transmitter metabolism, cytokines, energy metabolism and oxidative stress in the hippocampus, we found that microwave could lead to multiple metabolic disorders. Our results showed that microwave-induced cognitive decline was largely determined by its power rather than frequency. Injury effects were also found in accumulative exposure groups. We particularly concerned about the safety dose, injury effects and accumulative effects of microwaves, which might be very valuable in the future.",
