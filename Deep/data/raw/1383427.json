     "AB": "The present study summarizes the results of an in vitro and in vivo comparison of the apparent 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid dialysis performance of three types of membrane frequently used in intracerebral microdialysis experiments. The dialysis fiber types examined were a regenerated cellulose Cuprophan (GF), a proprietary polycarbonate ether (CMA), and a polyacrylonitrile/sodium methallylsulfonate copolymer (HOSPAL). The experiments unexpectedly revealed that the HOSPAL membrane-equipped probes displayed clearly aberrant 5-HT diffusion dynamics compared with GF and CMA probes, demonstrable not only in vitro, but also in in vivo experiments. In vitro, the GF and CMA membrane-equipped probes exhibited maximum relative recovery for 5-HT already in the first 20-min sample, whereas the 5-HT recovery of HOSPAL probes increased in a very slow and protracted manner over a period of a little less than 2 h. The GF and CMA probes further displayed an immediate washout of 5-HT when the probes were subsequently transferred to artificial CSF only-containing medium (no 5-HT), whereas approximately 2 h was required to yield near-total extinction of dialysate 5-HT with the standard HOSPAL probes. In vivo, the rat ventral hippocampal dialysate 5-HT output responses to K+ (100 mM) infusion, to Ca2+ omission, and to systemic 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin injection were all markedly retarded and blunted when HOSPAL instead of GF membrane-equipped probes were used. However, the 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid extraction in vitro and in vivo were comparable using either of the membrane types.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
