     "AB": "Recent experimental and theoretical studies have found that active dendritic ionic currents can compensate for the effects of electrotonic attenuation. In particular, temporal summation, the percentage increase in peak somatic voltage responses invoked by a synaptic input train, is independent of location of the synaptic input in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons under normal conditions. This independence, known as normalization of temporal summation, is destroyed when the hyperpolarization-activated current, Ih, is blocked [Magee JC (1999a), Nature Neurosci. 2: 508-514]. Using a compartmental model derived from morphological recordings of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, we examined the hypothesis that Ih was primarily responsible for normalization of temporal summation. We concluded that this hypothesis was incomplete. With a model that included Ih, the persistent Na(+) current (INaP), and the transient A-type K+ current (IA), however, we observed normalization of temporal summation across a wide range of synaptic input frequencies, in keeping with experimental observations.",
