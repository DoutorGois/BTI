     "AB": "To determine the combined effect of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) on learning and spatial memory, we developed a rat model of CCH by permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (2-vessel occlusion (2VO)) in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rats injected with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ). Furthermore, we examined the effect of cinepazide maleate (CM) on cognitive deficits and brain damage in this rat model. Rats were maintained on HFD for 6 weeks and then injected with 35 mg/kg STZ to induce T2D. Sham or 2VO surgery was performed in non-diabetic or diabetic (DM) rats to obtain four groups: blank, DM, CCH, and DM-CCH groups. Cognitive function was tested by the Morris water maze (MWM) test. To determine the effects of the vasodilator cinepazide maleate (CM) on cognitive deficits and brain damage, DM-CCH rats were administered with 10 mg/kg CM or saline daily for 14 d. Neuronal damage in DM-CCH rats was associated with increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), but decreased expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Moreover, the levels of all these proteins were significantly alleviated by CM treatment. These results suggest that T2D exacerbated CCH-induced brain damage and cognitive impairment, and CM ameliorated these effects.",
