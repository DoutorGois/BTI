     "AB": "We evaluated recent proposals that structures in the medial temporal lobe (MTL)--in particular, perirhinal cortex--support not just memory but certain kinds of perceptual abilities as well. Specifically, it has been suggested that the perirhinal cortex supports the perceptual abilities needed to accomplish visual discrimination performance when the stimuli have complex features and overlapping elements. However, the tasks that have been studied are quite challenging. Stimulus features must be held in working memory while attention shifts among the several parts of the display. When working memory capacity is exceeded, performance must depend on retrieval from long-term memory. Five patients with limited hippocampal lesions and one patient with large MTL lesions were asked to identify the unique object among twin pairs of objects that had a high degree of feature overlap and perceptual similarity. The patient groups performed similarly to controls when there were few objects and features in the displays, but exhibited abrupt declines in performance when the displays contained more objects and more features. Notably, the impairment was observed in memory-impaired patients with hippocampal lesions, not only in association with large MTL lesions that included perirhinal cortex. The pattern of performance suggested that patients encountered difficulty because working memory capacity was exceeded in the more difficult conditions such that performance needed to depend at least in part on long-term memory. Furthermore, when the burden on working memory was removed entirely, the patient with large MTL lesions performed as well as controls. Accordingly, we suggest that deficits on difficult discrimination tasks reported for patients with MTL lesions are due to impaired memory rather than impaired perception.",
