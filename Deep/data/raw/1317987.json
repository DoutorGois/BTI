     "AB": "Effects of ACTH on the content of 5-HT in the hippocampus, midbrain-pons, and spinal cord and the concentration of blood glucose in rats by spectrofluorometric assay and glucose oxidase method were studied. ACTH ip 10 IU.kg-1 or 20 IU.kg-1 significantly increased the content of 5-HT in the hippocampus, midbrain-pons and spinal cord and blood glucose level, both in a dose-dependent manner; para-chloroaphetamine, p-Cpa 4 mg icv markedly reduced the 5-HT in these brain regions and spinal cord and the blood glucose level (P less than 0.01); the level of 5-HT and blood glucose were not significantly altered after icv p-Cpa+ip ACTH; adrenalectomy+ip ACTH markedly increased the 5-HT content in the brain regions and spinal cord, but the blood glucose was decreased (P less than 0.01); and 5-HT was markedly decreased by sc alloxan tetrahydrate+ip ACTH, but blood glucose did not decrease (P greater than 0.05). Thus, ACTH may influence the blood glucose level through central nervous system 5-HT, and the change of 5-HT may be related to the insulin (secretion).",
