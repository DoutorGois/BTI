     "AB": "Women undergoing the natural menopause can experience progressive cognitive dysfunction, particularly in the form of memory impairment. However, the mechanisms underlying memory impairments in the menopause remain to be elucidated. There is increasing evidence that oxidative damage caused by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production may correlate with ageassociated cognitive impairment. The nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) family is important in the generation of ROS in the brain. It has been hypothesized that the accumulation of ROS, derived from NOX, may be involved in menopauseassociated learning and memory impairments. The present study investigated whether NOXderived ROS generation affected the learning and memory ability in 3month and 16monthold female rats. The results of a morris water maze assessment revealed that there were significant learning and memory impairments in the 16monthold female rats. Furthermore, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), level of malondialdehyde (MDA), production of ROS and expression levels of NOX2, p47phox, Rasrelated C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) and protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha) were investigated in the cortex and hippocampus of 3month and 16month old female rats. The results demonstrated that the activity of SOD was significantly decreased, whereas the levels of MDA, production of ROS and expression levels of NOX2, p47phox, RAC1 and PKCalpha were significantly increased in the 16month old female rats. These results suggested that NOXmediated oxidative stress may be important in menopauseassociated learning and memory impairments.",
