     "AB": "The effects of 20-min transient, global, forebrain ischaemia and cardiac arrest on extracellular concentrations of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and their respective metabolites, homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were measured in vivo by dialysis of rat striatum and hippocampus. During the ischaemic period, striatal DA content increased (250-fold basal concentrations) with parallel but much less marked increases of both striatal and hippocampal 5-HT content (eight- to 10-fold). Baseline values were restored during reperfusion. Subsequent increases of DA and 5-HT levels on cardiac arrest were comparable after both sham operation and ischaemia. Significant decreases of HVA and 5-HIAA levels were observed following ischaemia or cardiac arrest. The differential effects of ischaemia on DA and 5-HT suggest selective alterations in disposition or metabolism of the two transmitters and that dopaminergic neurones may be more vulnerable to ischaemic insults.",
