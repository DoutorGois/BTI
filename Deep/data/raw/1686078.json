     "AB": "Activation of metabotropic quisqualate receptors by trans-ACPD (trans-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid) caused a reduction in the amplitude of the synaptic response elicited by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral projection and recorded intracellularly from area CA1 in slices of rat hippocampus. Pharmacological agents were used to isolate components of the response mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, non-NMDA receptors, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Each of these components was reduced during the trans-ACPD application. These results indicate that one subtype of glutamate receptor may be able to decrease the synaptic efficacy of other subtypes and may provide an important means for balancing the synaptic enhancement processes often studied in the hippocampus.",
