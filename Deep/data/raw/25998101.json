     "AB": "Menopause is associated with cognitive decline, and previous parity can increase or delay the trajectory of cognitive aging. Furthermore, parity enables the hippocampus to respond to estrogens in middle age. The present study investigated how previous parity and estrogens influence cognition, neurogenesis, and neuronal activation in response to memory retrieval in the hippocampus of middle-aged females. Multiparous and nulliparous rats were ovariectomized (OVX) or received sham surgery and were treated with vehicle, 17beta-estradiol, 17alpha-estradiol, or estrone. Rats were trained on the spatial working and reference memory versions of the Morris water maze. Multiparous rats had a significantly greater density of immature neurons in the hippocampus, enhanced acquisition of working memory, but poorer reference memory compared with nulliparous rats. Furthermore, OVX increased, while treatment with estrogens reduced, the density of immature neurons, regardless of parity. OVX improved reference memory only in nulliparous rats. Thus, motherhood has long-lasting effects on the neuroplasticity and function of the hippocampus. These findings have wide-ranging implications for the treatment of age-associated decline in women.",
