     "AB": "Stressful experiences, such as an unsatisfactory mother-infant relationship after delivery, can induce depressive disorders, and it is well-known that stressors impair memory function. The hippocampus plays a crucial role in memory processes. In the present study, we determined whether a depressed-like state induced by repeated separation of pups affects the memory capability of the maternal rats. We also determined the effects of repeated separation from pups on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and serotonin expression in the brains of maternal rats. In the present results, the immobility time in the forced swim test was increased and the climbing time was decreased in the mothers separated from their pups. The latency in the step-down avoidance task was increased in the mothers separated from their pups. Also, the expressions of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and tryptophan hydroxylase in the dorsal raphe were decreased in the mothers separated from their pups. The number of Ki-67-positive cells was decreased, while the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was increased in the mothers separated from their pups. Based on the present results, it is suggested that separation of pups might induce a depressed-like state in the maternal rats with reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in the hippocampus, resulting in memory impairment of maternal rats.",
