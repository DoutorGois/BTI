     "AB": "G-protein alpha-subunits (Galphao, Galphai, Galphas, Galphaq) and adenylyl cyclase (AC) I and II isoforms were quantified in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex from 22 cases staged for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies according to Braak and Braak. Hippocampal Galphai levels declined significantly with neurofibrillary staging, whereas AC I levels in this region increased. Significant amyloid stage-related reductions of Galphai were seen in both the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. The hippocampus also showed a significant reduction of Galphao with amyloid staging. It is concluded that levels of inhibitory G-protein subunits Galphao, and in particular Galphai, decrease in parallel to the extent of AD pathology.",
