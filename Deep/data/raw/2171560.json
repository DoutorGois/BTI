     "AB": "Specific binding to sigma sites has been demonstrated and characterized in vitro using [3H]d-N-allylnormetazocine ([3H]d-NANM) and [3H]haloperidol ([3H]HAL) as ligands. As an extension of these experiments, we examined the regional in vivo specific binding of [3H]d-NANM and [3H]HAL in the mouse brain. Specific in vivo sigma binding was seen with both ligands; average estimates of specific binding across brain regions were 54 per cent and 56 per cent of total brain radioactivity, using [3H]d-NANM and [3H]HAL, respectively. Both ligands showed high levels of specific binding in the cerebellum, medulla-pons and midbrain, and lowest levels in the hippocampus. Estimated average [3H]d-NANM binding to phencyclidine (PCP) receptors across seven brain regions was only 13 per cent of total brain radioactivity, and showed a more uniform regional distribution than sigma binding. While the distributions of in vivo specific binding of [3H]d-NANM and [3H]HAL to sigma sites were comparable to findings obtained in vitro, the present estimates of in vivo [3H]d-NANM binding to PCP sites did not resemble the distribution of PCP receptors found in vitro. The results suggest that radiolabelled d-NANM and HAL may be useful for imaging sigma binding sites in vivo.",
