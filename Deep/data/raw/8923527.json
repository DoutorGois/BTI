     "AB": "The commissural and associational projections to the rat dentate gyrus are believed to be anatomically homologous fiber systems. They are often referred to as the so-called commissural/ associational system of the dentate gyrus. However, whereas characteristic laminar termination patterns within the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus have been described for the different cells of origin of the associational projection, the axons of the different cell types of commissural neurons have long been believed to terminate exclusively within the inner molecular layer. Only recently, a previously unknown commissural projection to the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus was described and the question was raised whether the commissural fibers could exhibit a heterogeneity similar to that of the associational projections. Using the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, which labels individual axons and their collaterals, we have studied the termination pattern of commissural axons in the dentate gyrus of the septal hippocampus. At least four different commissural fiber types could be revealed on the basis of their laminar termination pattern: fibers to the inner molecular layer (type 1), fibers to the outer molecular layer (type 2), fibers terminating throughout the molecular layer (type 3), and fibers terminating in both the granule cell layer and the molecular layer (type 4). These observations demonstrate a previously underestimated heterogeneity of the commissural projection. In addition, there is a great deal of parallelism between the different commissural and associational fibers, pointing to a coordinated action of the two systems in the two hippocampi.",
