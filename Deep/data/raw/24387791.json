     "AB": "The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), being a member of the hematopoietic growth factor family, is also critically involved in controlling proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. Treatment with G-CSF has been shown to result in substantial neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects in various experimental models of acute and chronic diseases of the central nervous system. Although G-CSF has been tested in a clinical study for treatment of acute ischemic stroke, there is only fragmentary data on the distribution of this cytokine and its receptor in the human brain. Therefore, the present study was focused on the immunohistochemical analysis of the protein expression of G-CSF and its receptor (G-CSF R) in the adult human brain. Since G-CSF has been shown not only to exert neuroprotective effects in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but also to be a candidate for clinical treatment, we have also placed an emphasis on the regulation of these molecules in this neurodegenerative disease. One major finding is that both G-CSF and G-CSF R were ubiquitously but not uniformly expressed in neurons throughout the CNS. Protein expression of G-CSF and G-CSF R was not restricted to neurons but was also detectable in astrocytes, ependymal cells, and choroid plexus cells. However, the distribution of G-CSF and G-CSF R did not substantially differ between AD brains and control, even in the hippocampus, where early neurodegenerative changes typically occur.",
