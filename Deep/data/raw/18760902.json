     "AB": "Amado and Cavalheiro [Amado, D., Cavalheiro, E.A., 1998. Hormonal and gestational parameters in female rats submitted to the pilocarpine model of epilepsy. Epilepsy Res. 32, 266-274], studying the establishment of the pilocarpine epilepsy model in female rats observed that the estrous cycle was dramatically altered during the three periods of this experimental model. This work was delineated to study the function of sexual hormones in the development of the epilepsy model induced by pilocarpine in ovariectomized rats. Experimental groups were: (a) control animals during estrus phase of the estrous cycle (E) and ovariectomized female rats (OVX) treated with saline instead of pilocarpine in the same volume, (b) experimental animals, that developed status epilepticus (SE) and were studied during the chronic phase of this model: intact chronic rats (CHRON) and ovariectomized chronic rats (OVX+CHRON) and (c) ovariectomized chronic rats, that were submitted to hormonal replacement therapy treated with: medroxyprogesterone (OVX+CHRON+MPA); 17beta-estradiol (OVX+CHRON+E2), or both (OVX+CHRON+E2+MPA). All ovariectomized animals showed genital atrophy 4 days after the surgical procedure. Moreover, all animals that developed SE and survived showed spontaneous recurrent seizures during the chronic phase. Concerning to seizure frequency, animals receiving medroxyprogesterone associated with 17beta-estradiol showed decreased seizures' number. However, animals that received only medroxyprogesterone therapy also showed reduction in the number of seizures. In addition, hormonal treatment was also able to stabilize the mossy fibers sprouting process, showing the importance of these hormones in the development of the epilepsy in female rats.",
