     "AB": "High frequency (HF)-induced and norepinephrine (NE)-induced long-term potentiation have been hypothesized to utilize common mechanisms of induction and expression in the dentate gyrus. In vitro data tend to support this hypothesis, but few studies have been done in vivo. The present study records perforant path-evoked potentials simultaneously on two micropipettes, one filled with saline and the other with the beta-antagonist, timolol. Stimulation of the paragigantocellularis nucleus (PGi) was used as a method of producing NE release in the dentate gyrus, and thus, to assess the efficacy of beta-receptor blockade on the timolol pipette. Beta-blockade by timolol attenuated PGi-induced spike potentiation. HF-induced potentiation of the excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) slope was also blocked by timolol, but HF-induced spike amplitude potentiation was unaffected. These results are consistent with an earlier report examining HF-long-term potentiation (LTP) following 6-OHDA-induced NE depletion, which showed that the EPSP slope LTP depended, for its full expression, on NE, but potentiation of the population spike amplitude component of HF-induced LTP did not. In the present study, PGi-induced potentiation of spike amplitude on the saline pipette was normal after HF-induced saturation of spike amplitude potentiation, suggesting that the mechanisms for expression of spike potentiation, as well as induction of spike potentiation, are separate for HF and NE stimulation.",
