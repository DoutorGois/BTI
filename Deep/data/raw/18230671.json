     "AB": "The protein synthesis-dependent form of hippocampal long-term potentiation (late-LTP) is thought to underlie memory. Its induction requires a distinct stimulation strength, and the common opinion is that only repeated tetani result in late-LTP whereas as single tetanus only reveals a transient early-LTP. Properties of LTP induction were compared to learning processes where repetition is often the prerequisite for a long-lasting memory. However, also single events can lead to manifested memory. If LTP subserves processes of learning, similar results should be detectable for LTP. Here we show that a single tetanus is sufficient to induce late-LTP requiring dopaminergic co-transmission during induction.",
