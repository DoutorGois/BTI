     "AB": "Neuronal calcium sensors (NCS) are important constituents in the intracellular signaling pathways. A novel human gene, NCS-1, was identified in the present study. Among the 16 human tissues examined, NCS-1 is expressed most abundantly in the brain. Among the brain regions, the expression level of NCS-1 in cerebral cortex is the highest, which is about six times higher than the average level of the whole brain and a hundred times higher than the spinal cord. In the 12 different anatomical regions of human brain, the expression level of NCS-1 is very high in the temporal lobe, occipital pole, frontal lobe, thalamus, amygdala and hippocampus; moderate in cerebellum, putamen, caudate nucleus; low in the medulla, substantia nigra and the lowest in corpus callosum. Our results suggest that NCS-1 in human brain might be involved in a variety of brain functions such as sensory processing, motor control, emotional control, learning and memory.",
