     "AB": "1. The neuroprotective effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) against transient forebrain ischemia following 7 days of reperfusion was studied in male Wistar rats after four-vessel occlusion for 20 min. 2. NeuN, a neuronal specific nuclear protein was used for immunohistochemical detection of surviving pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, as well as counterstaining with hematoxylin in the same sections for detection of neurons that underwent delayed neuronal death and for glial nuclei staining. GFAP immunohistochemistry was used for detection of astrocytes in the studied area of CA1 region. 3. In the group of rats pretreated 7 days with Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761), following 20 min of ischemia and 7 days of reperfusion without EGb 761, increased number of NeuN immunoreactive cells were counted in the most vulnerable CA1 pyramidal layer of hippocampus. On the other hand, the group of rats with 7 days of EGb 761 pretreatment following 20 min of ischemia and 7 days of reperfusion with EGb 761 showed decreased number of surviving NeuN immunoreactive CA1 pyramidal cells in comparison with the first above-mentioned experimental group. 4. Increased number of reactive astrocytes immunolabeled for GFAP (Glial fibrilary acidic protein) was observed in both experimental groups in the stratum oriens and stratum lacunosum and moleculare. 5. Twenty minutes of ischemia is lethal for most population of CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Our results showed that prophylactic oral administration of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) in the dose 40 mg/kg/day during the 7 days protects the most vulnerable CA1 pyramidal cells against 20 min of ischemia.",
