     "AB": "Explants of the hippocampus of newborn rats were studied neurohistologically and with electron microscope within 5--35 days of explantation. Two zones are found in the culture of the hippocampus: a zone of explant, and a zone of outgrowth. Neurons, glial cells and a network of their fibres are compactly arranged in the center of the former, whereas, the latter involves a layer of migrated glial cells. The explant is surrounded by glia limiting cells. Three types of neurons are identified in the long living culture of the hippocampus: pyramidal, polymorphic and granule cells. Numerous nerve endings observed in the hippocampic explant can be recognized as axodendritic, axosomatic and glomerular synapses. The availability of several types of neurons, a variety of synapses and their complication during outgrowth of the culture are suggestive of a formation in the hippocampic explant of a functional reflex activity.",
