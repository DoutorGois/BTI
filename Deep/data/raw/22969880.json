     "AB": "The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of steady and fluctuant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity on neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus of juvenile mice. Steady inhibition of AChE activity was induced by an intramuscular injection of huperizine A (HupA) sustained-release microspheres. Fluctuant inhibition of AChE activity was induced by an intragastric administration of HupA tablets. Six days after cessation of steady AChE inhibition, there was a significant increase in the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF). In contrast, fluctuant AChE inhibition had no effect on BDNF and NGF levels. Additionally, neither steady nor fluctuant inhibition of AChE activity altered the choline acetyltransferase activity or spatial learning in juvenile mice. These findings indicate that steady and fluctuant methods of inhibition of AChE have different effects on the levels of BDNF and NGF in the hippocampus. In addition, the effects of AChE inhibitors may not improve learning in normal juvenile animals.",
