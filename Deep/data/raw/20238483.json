     "AB": "The pathogenesis of sepsis is characterized by an overwhelming systemic inflammatory response that can lead to multiple organ failure. Considering that we have recently demonstrated that mitochondrial respiratory chain and creatine kinase (CK) are altered in the brain of rats after cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) and that a combination of N-acetylcysteine/deferoxamine (NAC/DFX), taurine and RC-3095 were shown to be an effective treatment of sepsis, we investigated whether the alterations of these enzymes may be reversed by these drugs. The results demonstrated that CLP inhibited complexes I and II, and that all the treatments were able to reverse this inhibition in all brain areas studied in the present work. On the other hand, complexes III and IV were not affected by sepsis neither by any of the treatments. An increase in CK activity in brain of rats 12 h after CLP was also verified; the administration of NAC/DFX and taurine reversed the increase in CK activity in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and striatum. On the other hand, RC-3095 significantly decreased CK activity, when compared to sham group in all brain areas studied. This is a preliminary study which showed beneficial effects of the treatments we proposed.",
