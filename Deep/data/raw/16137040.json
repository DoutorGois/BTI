     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To detect the expression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNA in the cortex and hippocampus of rat over different postischemic recirculation periods, and to explore the mechanism of increase in ODC activity after transient cerebral ischemia. METHODS: A 10-min transient cerebral ischemia was produced in anesthetized rat by ameliorated four-vessel occlusion, and the expression of ODC mRNA was measured using comparative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the cortex and hippocampus of rats sacrificed at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after the ischemia. The variations were studied. RESULTS: There was no expression of ODC mRNA in the cortex and hippocampus of rats in nonischemic control groups, and there was expression of ODC mRNA in the cortex and hippocampus of rats in the ischemic experimental groups, with a significant increase between 2 h and 6 h after the ischemia (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Increased expression of ODC mRNA could contribute to the increase in ODC activity after transient cerebral ischemia.",
