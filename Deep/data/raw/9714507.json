     "AB": "The interaction of the anticonvulsant valproate with AMPA glutamate receptors in human post mortem hippocampus was investigated. At concentrations of > or = 100 microM valproate decreased binding of 40 nM [3H]AMPA to 45+/-56% of control level (CA 1). Clinically effective brain concentrations for valproate are estimated at 100-200 microM. Our results thus provide evidence that the anticonvulsant effects of valproate may partially be caused by interaction with AMPA receptors.",
