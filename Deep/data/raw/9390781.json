     "AB": "The effects of aging on activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors were studied in the CA1 field of hippocampal slices from young (2-4 months old) and aged (25-32 months old) Sprague-Dawley rats with the use of ex vivo extra- and intracellular electrophysiological recording techniques. No significant age-related changes of the unitary NMDA-receptor mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), recorded from the pyramidal cells after stimulation of the stratum radiatum in a magnesium-free medium and isolated in the presence of the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, were found. Simultaneously, the magnitude of synaptic plasticity which involved NMDA receptor activation was not altered. No significant age-related modifications in the mechanisms controlling glutamate release and of postsynaptic NMDA receptor responsiveness were revealed. Considering the 30-40% decrease in NMDA binding sites in the aged hippocampus, our results suggest the occurrence of compensatory mechanisms which are discussed.",
