     "AB": "Using quantitative immunohistochemistry, neuronal expression of alpha-subunit of the transcriptional factor HIF-1 in hippocampus and neocortex of rats in response to pathogenic psychoemotional (model of posttraumatic stress disorder, PTSD) and hypoxic (severe hypobaric hypoxia, 180 Torr, 3 h), as well as to neuroprotective exposures to hypoxic pre- and postconditioning has been studied. Elongated overexpression of HIF-1alpha in hippocampus and neocortex of rats in response to the psychoemotional stress in PTSD paradigm, but not hypoxic stress, has been observed. Hypoxic pre- and postconditioning with mild hypobaric hypoxia (360 Torr, 2 h, 3 trials spaced at 24 h), those induced adaptation to the psychoemotional stress, abolished the elongated HIF-1alpha overexpression. Hypoxic postconditioning which improved structure and functional rehabilitation following severe hypoxic stress up-regulated HIF-1alpha expression in the brain neurons of rats survived severe hypoxia. The findings indicate that transcription factor HIF-1 is particularly involved in the processes of adaptation/ maladaptation to the action of injurious stresses, but its role depends upon the nature of stressor.",
