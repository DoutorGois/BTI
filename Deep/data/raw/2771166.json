     "AB": "Adult rats received a partial and unilateral transection of the fimbria. They received then intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of 5 microliters of Tris, half of them containing 2.5 ng of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). They were injected twice a week for 4 weeks. At the end of this period, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was measured in the hippocampus. ChAT activity, which was decreased by the fimbria transection, was higher (by about 20%) in medial hippocampus of the bFGF group compared with the Tris group. In addition, bFGF enhanced the lesion-induced astroglial reaction by changing the morphology of the astrocytes and increasing the apparent number of these reactive astrocytes.",
