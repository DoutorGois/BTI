     "AB": "Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is usually accompanied by memory deficits due to damage to the hippocampal system. In most studies, however, the influence of hippocampal atrophy (HA) is confounded with other variables, such as: type of initial precipitating injury and pathological substrate, effect of lesion (HA) lateralization, history of febrile seizures, status epilepticus, age of seizure onset, duration of epilepsy, seizure frequency, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). To investigate the relationship between memory deficits and these variables, we studied 20 patients with MTLE and signs of HA on MRI and 15 MTLE patients with normal high-resolution MRI. The findings indicated that (1) HA, earlier onset of seizures, longer duration of epilepsy, higher seizure frequency, and AEDs (polytherapy) are associated with memory deficits; and (2) there is a close relationship between deficits of verbal memory and left HA, but not between visual memory and right HA.",
