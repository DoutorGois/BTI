     "AB": "AIM: To determine whether ONO-1078 (pranlukast), a potent leukotriene receptor antagonist, has neuroprotective effect on focal cerebral ischemia in the rat. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 30 min of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and followed by 24 h reperfusion. ONO-1078 (0.003-1.0 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline 1 mL/kg) was ip injected 30 min before MCA occlusion and 2 h after reperfusion. The neurological score, infarct volume, neuron density (in cortex, hippocampus, and striatum), brain edema, and albumin exudation around the vessels were determined 24 h after reperfusion. RESULTS: ONO-1078 slightly improved the neurological deficiency, and dramatically decreased infarct volume and neuron loss which showed a bell shaped dose response effect with highest effect at doses of 0.01-0.3 mg/kg. Enlargement of the ischemic hemisphere and albumin exudation were inhibited at doses of 0.01-1.0 mg/kg. CONCLUSION: ONO-1078 has the protective effect on focal cerebral ischemia in rats, which is partially attributed to the inhibition of brain edema. This may represent a novel approach to the treatment of acute cerebral ischemia with cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists.",
