     "AB": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180 g) and 28-day-old Single Comb White Leghorn Cockerels (300 g) were orally dosed with deoxynivalenol (DON) at 2.5 mg kg-1 body weight. In the first experiment, whole brains were collected at 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the toxin treatment and analyzed for brain biogenic monoamines by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Although several interesting trends were observed, DON did not influence whole brain concentrations of monoamine neurotransmitters or their metabolites in either species, at any time. In a second experiment, brains were collected 24 hours postdosing, dissected into 5 brain regions (pons and medulla oblongata, cerebellum, hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebral cortex), and analyzed. DON treatment resulted in significantly elevated concentrations of serotonin (HT) and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (HIAA) in all brain regions of the rat. However, this was not seen in poultry, where DON treatment resulted in a decrease in norepinephrine (NE) in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, and a decrease in dopamine (DA) in the pons and medulla oblongata region. These results suggest that DON influences brain biogenic amine metabolism, and that there may be intraspecies differences in the central effects of this mycotoxin.",
