By modifying the protocol for transfection mediated by the commercial reagent DOTAP, we were able to achieve a transfection efficiency of about 3%. Expression of various transfected gene products was sustained for several weeks in culture, the neurons developed normally and the transfected gene products were targeted to the appropriate subcellular compartment.",
