     "AB": "Accumulating evidence indicates that the mitochondrial cell-death pathway, which involves the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, participates in neuronal cell death after transient cerebral ischemia. However, the upstream events, that induce cytochrome c release after transient global ischemia are not fully understood. Bad is a pro-apoptotic member of the bcl-2 gene family that promotes apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting functions of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. We investigated the effects of transient (15 min) global ischemia on the intracellular localization of Bad and the interaction of Bad with calcineurin, Akt or Bcl-xL in the vulnerable CA1 and resistant CA3/dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that the amount of Bad in mitochondria significantly increased after ischemia. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed decreased interactions of Bad with Akt and calcineurin in the cytosol and increased binding with Bcl-xL in the mitochondrial fraction of hippocampal CA1, but not in the CA3/dentate gyrus region. Further, we examined the effect of recombinant Bad on the cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. Treatment with both recombinant Bad and calcium, but not with recombinant Bad alone, induced cytochrome c release. These results suggest that changes in localization and complex formation by Bad are, at least in part, involved in the vulnerability of cells after transient global ischemia.",
