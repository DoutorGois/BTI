     "AB": "Accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the brain is hypothesized to be a causal event leading to dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta vaccination removes Abeta deposits from the brain. Abeta immunotherapy, however, may cause T cell- and/or Fc-receptor-mediated brain inflammation and relocate parenchymal Abeta deposits to blood vessels leading to cerebral hemorrhages. Because catalytic antibodies do not form stable immune complexes and Abeta fragments produced by catalytic antibodies are less likely to form aggregates, Abeta-specific catalytic antibodies may have safer therapeutic profiles than reversibly-binding anti-Abeta antibodies. Additionally, catalytic antibodies may remove Abeta more efficiently than binding antibodies because a single catalytic antibody can hydrolyze thousands of Abeta molecules. We previously isolated Abeta-specific catalytic antibody, IgVL5D3, with strong Abeta-hydrolyzing activity. Here, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of brain-targeted IgVL5D3 gene delivery via recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV9) in an AD mouse model. One single injection of rAAV9-IgVL5D3 into the right ventricle of AD model mice yielded widespread, high expression of IgVL5D3 in the unilateral hemisphere. IgVL5D3 expression was readily detectable in the contralateral hemisphere but to a much lesser extent. IgVL5D3 expression was also confirmed in the cerebrospinal fluid. Prophylactic and therapeutic injection of rAAV9-IgVL5D3 reduced Abeta load in the ipsilateral hippocampus of AD model mice. No evidence of hemorrhages, increased vascular amyloid deposits, increased proinflammatory cytokines, or infiltrating T-cells in the brains was found in the experimental animals. AAV9-mediated anti-Abeta catalytic antibody brain delivery can be prophylactic and therapeutic options for AD.",
