     "AB": "A thorough knowledge of the intrinsic circuit properties of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the temporal dynamics these circuits support is essential for understanding how information is exchanged between the hippocampus and neocortex. Using intracellular and extracellular recordings in the anesthetized rat and anatomical reconstruction of single cells, we found that EC5 and EC2 principal neurons form large axonal networks mainly within their layers, interconnected by the more vertically organized axon trees of EC3 pyramidal cells. Principal cells showed layer-specific unique membrane properties and contributed differentially to theta and gamma oscillations. EC2 principal cells were most strongly phase modulated by EC theta. The multiple gamma oscillators, present in the various EC layers, were temporally coordinated by the phase of theta waves. Putative interneurons in all EC layers fired relatively synchronously within the theta cycle, coinciding with the maximum power of gamma oscillation. The special wiring architecture and unique membrane properties of EC neurons may underlie their behaviorally distinct firing patterns in the waking animal.",
