     "AB": "Individual mouse strains differ significantly in terms of behavior and cognitive function. Strain-specific variation of metabolic protein levels in the hippocampus among various commonly used mouse strains, however, has not been investigated yet. A proteomic approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with mass spectrometry [high capacity ion trap (HCT)] has been chosen to address this question by determining strain-dependent levels of metabolic proteins in hippocampal tissue of four inbred and one outbred mouse strain. Statistical analysis of protein spots on 2-DE gels of the individual strains (n=10) revealed significant strain-dependent differences in densities of 39 spots. Subsequent HCT analysis led to the identification of 22 different metabolic proteins presenting with differential protein levels among the five mouse strains investigated. Among those are proteins concerned with the metabolism of amino acid, nucleic acid, carbohydrate and energy. Moreover, proteins known to play a pivotal role in the processes of learning and memory, such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II alpha chain, were found to present with significant inter-strain variability, which is also in agreement with our previous reports. Strain-specific protein levels of metabolic proteins in the mouse hippocampus may provide some insight into the molecular underpinnings and genetic determination of strain-dependent neuronal function. Furthermore, data presented herein emphasize the significance of the genetic background for the analysis of metabolic pathways in the hippocampus in wild-type mice as well as in gene-targeting experiments.",
