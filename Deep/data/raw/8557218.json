     "AB": "The effect of systemic administration of pramiracetam on neuronal type nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and NOS mRNA expression were studied in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex in rats. A dose of 300 mg/kg (i.p.) of this nootropic produced an approximately 20% increase in NOS activity in rat brain cortical homogenates but not in hippocampal homogenates; no significant changes were observed in NOS mRNA expression in the cortex and hippocampus. A lower dose of pramiracetam (100 mg/kg i.p.) was ineffective on NOS mRNA expression and enzyme activity. Interestingly, administration of pramiracetam (300 mg/kg i.p.) in rats pretreated (24 h before) with lithium chloride (LiCl) (3 mEq/kg i.p.) yielded a 40% increase in cortical NOS activity. However, in LiCl-pretreated rats this nootropic failed to affect cortical NOS mRNA expression; LiCl (3 mEq/kg i.p.) given alone produced no effect. In conclusion, the present data demonstrate that pramiracetam given alone or in combination with LiCl increases NOS activity in brain cortical homogenates of rats and this may contribute to the mechanisms underlying learning and memory improvement produced by this nootropic.",
