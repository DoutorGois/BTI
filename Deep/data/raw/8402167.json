     "AB": "The expression of the gene for nerve growth factor (NGF) was examined in the central nervous system of adult and fetal monkeys. In adults, the highest level of NGF mRNA was found in the hippocampus and relatively high levels were observed in the cerebral cortices and thalamus. NGF mRNA was also detected in the cerebellum and the caudate nucleus. In the spinal cord, there was no evidence of the mRNA. The levels of NGF mRNA were closely correlated with those of NGF. At embryonic day 140 (E140), levels of NGF mRNA in the visual cortex and cerebellum were three times higher than those at the adult stage. Our previous study on the ontogeny of NGF (Hayashi, M. et al., Neuroscience, 36 (1990) 683-689) showed that the level of NGF in the visual cortex at E140 is the same as that at adult stage. Thus, at the fetal stage, NGF may be actively transported from the cerebral cortex to other regions of the brain, such as the basal forebrain area. By contrast, the levels of NGF and NGF mRNA in the cerebellum were almost the same at the adult and fetal stages, suggesting that NGF, which is synthesized in the cerebellum, may be taken up locally by cerebellar cells.",
