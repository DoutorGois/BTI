     "AB": "The effects of 1 h/day restraint in plastic tubes for 24 days on the levels of serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), tryptophan (TP), and noradrenaline (NA) in six regions of rat brain 20 h after the last restraint period were investigated. The levels of 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and NA but not TP increased in several regions. The effects of 1 h of immobilization on both control and chronically restrained rats were also studied. Immobilization per se did not alter brain 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and TP levels, but decreased NA in the pons plus medulla oblongata and hypothalamus. However, immobilization after chronic restraint decreased 5-HT, increased 5-HIAA, and decreased NA in most brain regions in comparison with values for the chronically restrained rats. We suggest that chronic restraint leads to compensatory increases of brain 5-HT and NA synthesis and sensitizes both monoaminergic systems to an additional acute stress. These changes may affect coping with stress demands.",
