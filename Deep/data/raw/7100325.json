     "AB": "In post-mortem material with pronounced primary epilepsy-independent pathomorphic findings of Ammon's formation, the correlation with symptomatic epilepsy and the typical psychic disturbance phenomena was studied. While a connection between the lesion and the epileptic disease could be confirmed with a certain probability, this remains problematic with respect to impairments of memory, orientation capacity, working-up of experiences and drive and reaction capacity. Although in all examined subjects clinical deficiency phenomena of one type or the other were present, additional lesions, especially of nuclear regions which are associated with AF and cortical structures will certainly also be responsible.",
