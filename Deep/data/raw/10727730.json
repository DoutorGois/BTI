     "AB": "Most of the neurogenesis take place during the embryonic stage; the genes expressed predominantly in this stage may play important roles in the control of development of the central nervous system. Using a differential display method, we identified the novel rat gene, brain development-related molecule 2 (Bdm2), that is expressed more abundantly in the embryonic brain than in the adult brain. Full-length Bdm2 cDNA consists of 1842 base pairs (bp) and contains an open reading frame of 1260 bp. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that Bdm2 was strongly expressed in the late embryonic brain and was still detected at lower levels in an early postnatal period; in adults, Bdm2 mRNA was decreased to an undetectable level in brain, though the expression of this mRNA was revealed in other tissues. Level of Bdm2 mRNA was maintained during neuronal differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma cell P19, but decreased during the differentiation to glial and unidentified non-neuronal cells. In situ hybridization study demonstrated the wide distribution of Bdm2 mRNA in the embryonic brain; in the adult brain, the hybridization signals became more restricted to the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cerebellum, and neocortex, almost coinciding with the regions where nascent and immature neurons are present. Thus, it appears likely that Bdm2 encodes a protein that is involved in both the regulation of growth of undifferentiated neural cells and the terminal differentiation of neuronal cells.",
