     "AB": "BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel antiepileptic drug, zonisamide (ZNS), on the basilar artery and hippocampus in a rabbit subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) model. METHODS: Three groups of New Zealand white rabbits were used: a sham (non-SAH) group, an SAH + saline group, and SAH + drug treatment group that received ZNS. In the treatment group, the subjects were given ZNS for 3 days after the SAH. Hippocampal sections were evaluated for neural tissue degeneration. Basilar artery lumen areas and arterial wall thickness were also measured in all groups. RESULTS: The mean luminal area of the SAH + ZNS was significantly greater than the SAH + saline group. In addition, the arterial wall thickness of SAH + ZNS group was significantly thinner than the SAH + saline group. The neuronal degeneration scores of the hippocampal CA1 regions in the SAH + ZNS group were significantly lower than the SAH + saline treatment animals. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ZNS has a vasodilatatory effect on the basilar artery and a neuronal protective effect in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in a rabbit SAH model.",
