     "AB": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that is associated with depression. Also, depression is common in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Translocator protein (18kDa) (TSPO) and allopregnanolone play an important role in the depression treatment. However, few studies have evaluated TSPO and allopregnanolone in the treatment of depression in T2DM. AC-5216, a ligand for TSPO, produces anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects in animal models. The present study aimed to explore antidepressant-like effects of AC-5216 on diabetic rats. Following the development of diabetic model induced by high fat diet (HFD) feeding and streptozotocin (STZ), AC-5216 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, i.g.) elicited the antidepressant-like effects in behavioral tests while these activities were blocked by TSPO antagonist PK11195 (3 mg/kg, i.p.). The levels of allopregnanolone in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were increased by AC-5216 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, i.g.), which was antagonized by PK11195 (3 mg/kg, i.p.). The increased plasma glucose (PG) and decreased insulin (INS) in HFD-STZ rats were reversed by AC-5216 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, i.g.). This study indicates that the antidepressant-like effects of AC-5216 on HFD-STZ rats, suggesting that TSPO may represent a novel therapeutic target for depression in T2DM.",
