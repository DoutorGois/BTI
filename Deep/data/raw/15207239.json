     "AB": "We studied a mouse model of the haploinsufficiency form of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS), an inheritable disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CREB binding protein (CBP) and characterized by mental retardation and skeletal abnormalities. In these mice, chromatin acetylation, some forms of long-term memory, and the late phase of hippocampal long-term potentiation (L-LTP) were impaired. We ameliorated the L-LTP deficit in two ways: (1) by enhancing the expression of CREB-dependent genes, and (2) by inhibiting histone deacetyltransferase activity (HDAC), the molecular counterpart of the histone acetylation function of CBP. Inhibition of HDAC also reversed the memory defect observed in fear conditioning. These findings suggest that some of the cognitive and physiological deficits observed on RTS are not simply due to the reduction of CBP during development but may also result from the continued requirement throughout life for both the CREB co-activation and the histone acetylation function of CBP.",
