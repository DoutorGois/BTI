     "AB": "In order to study the protective effects on motor and cognitive function by inhibiting IL-1beta as delayed as 24h after global ischemia, we designed behavioral testing protocol and histology detection after 10 min transient global ischemia followed by IL-1beta or its antibody intracerebroventricular injection. We found benefit of IL-1beta antibody treatment 24h after ischemia in cognitive function recovery. But no obvious amelioration in motor function was found. Further we detected cell morphology and survival by histology staining and proved IL-1beta antibody could reduce ischemia induced cell morphological changes and cell loss in hippocampus, which related with cognitive function. Present results indicate intervening IL-1beta pathway could be helpful in cognitive function recovery even as late as 24h after ischemia happens.",
