     "AB": "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a major lipid carrier protein. In humans, ApoE is expressed in three polymorphic isoforms, which are encoded by three different alleles APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. In the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, each one of these three allelic isoforms is found in several \"isoelectric\" protein isoforms (qPI), i.e. protein isoforms resulting from PTMs altering the net charge (q) of the polypeptide. AD is a complex disease in which multiple causes and several risk factors affect the onset and disease outcome. A major risk factor for AD is ApoE4; therefore, it is important to characterize the different ApoE qPIs. We have implemented a detergent-based method for isolation and quantitation of protein isoforms, and we found differences in the solubility of protein isoforms depending on the type of solvent used. In this manuscript, we describe these methods and applied them to young human-ApoE targeted replacement mice. Our results indicate that there are no significant differences in the hippocampus proteome of these mice as a function of the APOE genotype.",
