     "AB": "Changes in the expression of immediate early gene c-fos by noxious mechanical stimulation to the mandibular incisor pulp of rats were immunohistochemically examined in the hippocampus (Ammon's horn and dentate gyrus) and the retrohippocampus (subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum and entorhinal cortex). The highest control levels were found in subiculum, CA1, dentate and deep medial entorhinal cortex. Lower, but substantial levels were present in the other areas. Whereas weak dentinal stimulation caused increases in c-fos expression in some regions which were not statistically significant, strong tooth pulp stimulation caused a bilateral decrease in c-fos expression in every region except contralateral subiculum. These decreases reached statistical significance in superficial layer parasubiculum bilaterally (p<0.01), bilateral CA1 and ipsilateral side of superficial layer of medial entorhinal cortex (p<0.05). We suggest that inhibitory circuitry in hippocampal formation regions may be activated by peripheral noxious somatosensory inputs and this change in activity is accompanied by a change in the expression of the immediate early gene, c-fos.",
