     "AB": "Sex differences in the function of the hippocampus have been observed in numerous mammalian species. However, the magnitude, extent, and specificity of these differences are unclear because they can depend on factors including age, methodology, and environment. This Review will discuss seminal studies examining sex differences in hippocampal memory, neuronal morphology, synaptic plasticity, and cell signaling in humans and rodents. We also describe possible organizational and activational effects of sex steroid hormones during early development, puberty, and adulthood that may lead to sex differences observed in the hippocampus. We conclude by discussing the implications of sex differences in hippocampal function for mental health. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",
