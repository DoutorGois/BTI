     "AB": "This study was to determine the protective effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3PUFAs) on MK-801-induced cognitive impairment in schizophrenia (SZ) rats and the underlying mechanism. A rat model of schizophrenia was induced by MK-801. The cognitive function of rats was assessed using a Morris water maze. The number of hippocampal neurons was measured by Nissl staining. The expression of CREB, p-CREB, BDNF, TrkB, p-TrkB, AKT, p-AKT, ERK, and p-ERK in the hippocampus of rats was detected by Western blotting. The results showed that omega-3PUFAs attenuated MK-801-induced cognitive impairment and hippocampal neurons loss, reversed the injury of the CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway induced by MK-801, and antagonized MK-801-induced down-regulation of p-AKT and p-ERK in the hippocampus of rats. In conclusion, omega-3PUFAs enhances the CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway by activating ERK and AKT, thereby increasing the synaptic plasticity and decreasing neuron loss, and antagonizing MK-801-induced cognitive impairment in schizophrenic rats.",
