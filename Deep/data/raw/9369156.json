     "AB": "Embryonic rat hippocampal neurons were cultured in a serum-free defined medium (MEM/N3) either directly on poly-D-lysine (PDL) or on a confluent monolayer of postnatal cortical astrocytes, C6 glioma cells, or Rat2 fibroblasts. Neurons on PDL were grown in MEM/N3 or in MEM/N3 conditioned for 24 h by astrocytes or C6 cells. Membrane capacitance (Cm) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-, glycine-, kainate-, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced currents were quantified using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Cm as well as the amplitude and the density of these currents in neurons cultured on astrocytes were significantly greater than those in neurons grown on PDL after 24 and 48 h. C6 cells mimicked astrocytes in promoting Cm and GABA-, glycine-, and NMDA-evoked, but not kainate-evoked, currents. Cm and currents in neurons grown on Rat2 cells were comparable to those in neurons on PDL. Astrocytes maintained in culture for 3 months were noticeably less effective than freshly prepared ones just grown to confluence. Suppression of spontaneous cytoplasmic Ca2+ (Ca[c]2+) elevations in astrocytes by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ehane-N, N, N, N-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) loaded intracellularly blocked the observed modulatory effects. Medium conditioned by either astrocytes or C6 cells mimicked the effects of direct coculture of neurons on these cells in promoting Cm and amino acid-evoked currents. Inclusion of antagonists at GABA and glutamate receptors in coculture experiments blocked the observed effects. Thus, diffusible substances synthesized and/ or secreted by astrocytes in a Ca(c)2+-dependent manner can regulate neuronal growth and aminoacid receptor function, and these effects may involve neuronal GABA and glutamate receptors.",
