     "AB": "Acetylcholine (ACh) levels were determined in the brain of rats killed by decapitation or focussed microwave radiation during drug-induced convulsions. During metrazol or strychnine-induced convulsions a diffuse decrease in ACh levels was found in rats killed by decapitation. When the rats were killed by radiation and the brain was only divided into three large regions, strychnine caused no changes in ACh levels; metrazol caused a decrease in the cerebral cortex and lower brainstem. When discrete brain regions were investigated in rats killed by radiation, metrazol-induced convulsions were associated with a decrease in ACh level in all regions dissected and strychnine-induced convulsions with a decrease in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus only. Picrotoxin-induced convulsions were associated with a decrease in ACh level in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain and medulla-pons, those induced by bicuculline with an increase in ACh level in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, midbrain and medulla-pons, by dimefline with an increase in the frontal cortex, midbrain and medulla-pons and a decrease in the caudate nucleus. The experiments show that each type of convulsant affects ACh levels in discrete brain regions in a different way.",
