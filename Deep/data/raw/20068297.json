     "AB": "PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), which is identified as the gene transactivated by the tumor suppressor PTEN, has been found to be one of the causative genes in Parkinson's disease (PD). In order to understand PD, rodent models containing affected Pink1 such as loss-of-function mutations have been exploited. Recently, natural antisense RNA of PINK1 has been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of the PINK1 locus. However, no antisense RNAs of Pink1 except for human have been reported so far. Therefore, in the present study, while searching for the Pink1 antisense RNAs in mouse, we found that the antisense RNAs are transcribed from a mouse genomic region corresponding to the human region from which the antisense RNAs are produced. Further, we investigated the localization of the antisense RNAs in mouse brain using in situ hybridization; this demonstrated that the antisense RNAs were localized in the regions of brain where the Pink1 mRNA was found. In addition, the mRNA and antisense RNAs were found more densely in the hippocampus than in the other brain regions in newborn and 1-week-old mice, while those RNAs were found uniformly in the mouse brain regions of embryo day (E) 14, E17, and 8-weeks-old.",
