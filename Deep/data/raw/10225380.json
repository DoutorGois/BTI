     "AB": "Pregnant rats were infused with phentermine plus dexfenfluramine from days 3 through 17 of gestation. Control rats were either pair-fed or were fed ad libitum. There were no effects of prenatal drug treatment on number of offspring, their birth weights, or on their motor coordination assessed at 11 days of age. Mothers and pups were sacrificed 21 days postpartum. Drug-treated mothers, but not their pups, showed a reduced density of serotonergic axons in the hippocampus compared with controls. 25% of the pups from the prenatal drug group showed mitral valve thickening.",
