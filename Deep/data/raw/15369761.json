     "AB": "The serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptor is an important member of the superfamily of seven transmembrane domain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). We report here that guanine nucleotide sensitivity of agonist binding to hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors is dependent on the concentration of Mg2+. Our results show that agonist binding to 5-HT1A receptors is relatively insensitive to guanine nucleotides in the absence of Mg2+. In contrast to this, the specific antagonist binding is insensitive to guanine nucleotides, even in the presence of Mg2+. These results point out the requirement of an optimal concentration of Mg2+ which could be used in assays toward determining guanine nucleotide sensitivity of ligand binding to GPCRs such as the 5-HT1A receptor. Our results provide novel insight into the requirement and concentration dependence of Mg2+ in relation to guanine nucleotide sensitivity for the 5-HT1A receptor in particular, and GPCRs in general.",
