     "AB": "White matter oligodendrocytes have been shown to actively regulate extracellular glutamate levels in the CNS. Such function has yet not been examined in satellite oligodendrocytes of gray matter. Similar to those in white matter, satellite oligodendrocytes are involved in myelination. In addition, they modulate the activity of surrounding neurons. This study examined whether satellite oligodendrocytes express PACAP and glutamate transporter proteins and whether this expression is influenced by global ischemia. We demonstrated expression of PACAP27 and PACAP38 in a major fraction of satellite oligodendrocytes in normal neocortex and hippocampus of human brain tissues obtained post-mortem. All three glutamate transporters EAAT1, EAAT2 and EAAT3 were expressed in satellite oligodendrocytes from these tissues. Thus, satellite oligodendrocytes may participate in the perineuronal glutamate homeostasis. Following transient global ischemia, the total number of satellite oligodendrocytes expressing PACAP or glutamate transporter proteins was significantly decreased in cerebral neocortex and hippocampus. However, alterations of PACAP and glutamate transporter protein expression were region and time specific. In satellite oligodendrocytes of CA1 an early strong reduction of PACAP and glutamate transporter expression was observed. This contrasted with late reduction of PACAP27, PACAP38 and glutamate transporters EAAT1, EAAT2 and EAAT3 in satellite oligodendrocytes of neocortex. Further studies should clarify whether these alterations in protein expression are primary or secondary to neuronal cell death.",
