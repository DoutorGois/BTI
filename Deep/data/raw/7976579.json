     "AB": "The effects of glycerol and mannitol, as well as urea, on delayed neuronal death (DND) in the gerbil hippocampus were investigated. 20% solution of glycerol, mannitol and urea were prepared, and 6.5 ml/kg of each agent, or saline, was administered to male Mongolian gerbils intraperitoneally 30 min before ischemia. The animals were subjected to transient forebrain ischemia for 5 min. Seven days after the ischemic insult, the brains were fixed and stained for histopathological analysis. The number of normal neurons (neuronal density, ND) in a 1 mm linear length of hippocampal CA1 region was counted. ND of sham-operated group (n = 6) was 275.3 +/- 16.7 (mean +/- SD). ND in the saline-treated group (n = 6) was 14.8 +/- 5.0. ND of groups treated with glycerol (n = 6), mannitol (n = 6) and urea (n = 4) was 68.2 +/- 56.7 (p < 0.01), 52.8 +/- 54.4 (p < 0.01) and 12.0 +/- 2.5 (NS), respectively. The present study demonstrates that glycerol and mannitol have some protective effects against DND in the gerbil hippocampus, whereas urea has no effect.",
