     "AB": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a ceramide derivative serving not only as a regulator of immune properties but also as a modulator of brain functions. To better understand the mechanism underlying the effects of S1P on brain functions, we investigated the potential impact of S1P receptor (S1PR) activation on NMDA receptor subunits. We used acute rat hippocampal slices as a model system, and determined the effects of the active phosphorylated S1P analog, fingolimod (FTY720P) on various NMDA receptors. Treatment with FTY720P significantly increased phosphorylation of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors at Tyr1472. This effect appears rather specific, as treatment with FTY720P did not modify GluN2B-Tyr1336, GluN2B-Ser1480, GluN2A-Tyr1325 or GluN1-Ser897 phosphorylation. Pre-treatment of hippocampal slices with the compounds W146 and PP1 indicated that FTY720P-induced GluN2B phosphorylation at Tyr1472 epitopes was dependent on activation of S1PR subunit 1 (S1PR1) and Src/Fyn kinase, respectively. Cell surface biotinylation experiments indicated that FTY720P-induced GluN2B phosphorylation at Tyr1472 was also associated with increased levels of GluN1 and GluN2B subunits on membrane surface, whereas no change was observed for GluN2A subunits. We finally demonstrate that FTY720P is inclined to favor Tau and Fyn accumulation on plasma membranes. These results suggest that activation of S1PR1 by FTY720P enhances GluN2B receptor phosphorylation in rat hippocampal slices, resulting in increased levels of GluN1 and GluN2B receptor subunits in neuronal membranes through a mechanism probably involving Fyn and Tau.",
