     "AB": "The present study was conducted for two purposes: the first was to evaluate whether activation of cholinergic receptors of the entorhinal cortex in vitro (complete deafferentation) with carbachol (100 microM) was capable of producing theta (theta)-like slow activity. The second purpose was to determine whether carbachol-induced slow waveforms were mediated by muscarinic or nicotinic receptors. We demonstrated that carbachol was capable of producing theta-like slow activity. This activity was not altered by nicotinic antagonists, (+)-tubocurarine and hexametonium. Atropine and scopolamine, in contrast, completely blocked in vitro induced slow waves, indicating entorhinal muscarinic receptors to be actively involved in the mechanism generating cholinergic theta rhythm.",
