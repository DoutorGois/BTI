     "AB": "The dentate gyrus (DG) of the normal rat brain contains activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) which is widely distributed in the cytoplasm of neurons and astrocytes. Treatment with nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L: -arginine methyl ester (L: -NAME) caused a decrease in ADNP expression in granule cells which persisted 3 days post-treatment. However, treatment with neuronal-specific NOS inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), or soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, ODQ, did not change ADNP expression in the DG. We have previously shown that kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure increases neuronal NOS in neurons and inducible NOS in glia cells and suppresses ADNP in the hippocampus (Cosgrave et al., Neurobiol Dis 30(3):281-292, 2008). In the DG, L: -NAME treatment prior to KA causes ADNP synthesis in granule cells by 3 h which was later restricted to the subgranular zone by 3 days. 7-NI and ODQ had no effect. Double immunostaining for neuronal marker NeuN and ADNP revealed a significant decrease of both ADNP(+) neurons and of total neuron numbers (NeuN(+)) in the hilus of animals having KA-induced seizure that had been pretreated with L: -NAME implying that NO and ADNP may act together to protect hilar neurons. Overall, these observations suggest that NO regulates ADNP in the DG under both basal and pathophysiological conditions.",
