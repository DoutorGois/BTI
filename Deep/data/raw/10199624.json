     "AB": "Recently, five members of the somatostatin receptor family have been cloned. However, little is known about their cellular and subcellular localization in the central nervous system. Using specific anti-peptide antisera, we observed somatostatin receptor 3-like immunoreactivity in many brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala and cerebellum. In all of these regions (except for the cerebellar cortex), somatostatin receptor 3-like immunoreactivity was selectively targeted to 4-8-microm-long rod-shaped profiles which did not co-localize with axonal or dendritic markers. One immunoreactive profile was always associated with one neuronal cell body. This staining pattern was resistant to colchicine treatment and showed a closely overlapping distribution with somatostatin receptor 3 messenger RNA, suggesting that the receptor protein is not transported over long distances. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that somatostatin receptor 3-like immunoreactivity is localized to the plasma membrane of neuronal cilia which extended into an intercellular pocket and showed a 9+0 filament pattern in their basal body and proximal segments. Thus, somatostatin receptor 3 demonstrates a unique example of a G-protein-coupled receptor not localized to \"classical\" pre- or postsynaptic sites, but selectively targeted to neuronal cilia. The presence of the somatostatin receptor 3 receptor on neuronal cilia suggests that these presumably non-motile cilia may not merely represent developmental remnants, but rather function as chemical sensors of the immediate milieu.",
