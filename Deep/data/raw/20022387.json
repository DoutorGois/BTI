     "AB": "In this study we showed that in vivo bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge elevated IL-1beta level in the rodent hippocampus. Antagonists of P2X receptors inhibited LPS-induced IL-1beta level with a pharmacological profile similar to that of P2X(7)R and their inhibitory effect was attenuated in the absence of P2X(7)R. In wild-type mice, LPS overexpressed mRNA encoding P2X(4) and P2X(7) receptors in the hippocampus and caused also a remarkable increase in the levels of IL-1beta in the serum. The hippocampal increase of IL-1beta has substantially alleviated when contamination of circulating blood cells was excluded by transcardial perfusion, indicating the peripheral origin of hippocampal IL-1beta elevation. These results point to the key role of the endogenous activation of peripheral P2X(7)R in the level of IL-1beta in rodent hippocampus under systemic bacterial endotoxin challenge.",
