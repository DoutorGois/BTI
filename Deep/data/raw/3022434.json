     "AB": "Ultrastructural distribution of actin in dendrites, dendritic spines and presynaptic boutons of the hippocampal area CA3 of the guinea pig was investigated using decoration and immunocytochemical methods. The distribution of actin was non-homogeneous in all the parts of neurons. The highest concentration of this contractile protein was revealed in the spine cytoplasm. Here actin forms a dense cytoskeleton meshwork and is present also in postsynaptic densities. An intimate interaction between the spine actin cytoskeleton and the postsynaptic actin densities has been revealed. This feature may indicate the involvement of actin cytoskeleton in the organization and maintenance of dimensions, location and geometry of active zones.",
