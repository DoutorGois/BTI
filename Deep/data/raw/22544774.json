     "AB": "Older literature on infantile autism accompanied by mental retardation, focussed on epilepsy, cerebral palsy and microcephaly. Multiple adversity was needed to delay growth sufficiently to pruning of connection between Hippocampus and Singulum in its centre, SMA and inhibitory cells in Cerebellum in the synaptogenesis in infancy. Temporary macrocephaly was observed. Today, macrocephaly dominates the discussion. One single adversity, deficient \"brain food\", seemingly retards growth sufficiently to cause excess pruning with absent activity in inhibitory Purkinje cells in Cerebellum, the SMA and A DEFICIENT, LACKING DELAYED RESPONSE FUNCTION. The brain needs time to adapt, but the Delayed Response Task is lost. Microcephaly predominates at puberty. We wanted to understand cerebellar reactions more fully.",
