     "AB": "Tangential neuronal migration occurs along different axes from the axis demarcated by radial glia and it is thought to have evolved as a mechanism to increase the diversity of cell types in brain areas, which in turn resulted in increased complexity of functional networks. In the telencephalon of amniotes, different embryonic tangential pathways have been characterized. However, little is known about the exact routes of migrations in basal vertebrates. Cartilaginous fishes occupy a key phylogenetic position to assess the ancestral condition of vertebrate brain organization. In order to identify putative subpallial-derived tangential migratory pathways in the telencephalon of sharks, we performed a detailed analysis of the distribution pattern of GAD and Dlx2, two reliable markers of tangentially migrating interneurons of subpallial origin in the developing forebrain. We propose the existence of five tangential routes directed toward different telencephalic regions. We conclude that four of the five routes might have emerged in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates. We have paid special attention to the characterization of the proposed migratory pathway directed towards the olfactory bulbs. Our results suggest that it may be equivalent to the \"rostral migratory stream\" of mammals and led us to propose a hypothesis about its evolution. The analysis of the final destinations of two other streams allowed us to identify the putative dorsal and medial pallium of sharks, the regions from which the neocortex and hippocampus might have, respectively, evolved. Derived features were also reported and served to explain some distinctive traits in the morphology of the telencephalon of cartilaginous fishes.",
