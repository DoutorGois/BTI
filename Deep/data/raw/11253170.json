     "AB": "The influence of different, nitric oxide-containing ruthenium complexes on the evoked potentials recorded from the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus in vitro has been investigated. Of the compounds tested, only trans-[(NO)(P(OEt)3)(NH3)4Ru](PF6)3 (1-2.5 mM) exerted a strong facilitatory action on the population spike, the EPSP, and the spontaneous activity. Its activity probably depends upon its ability to release NO following reduction. The phosphito ligand is important both in terms of adjusting the reduction potential of the complex to be biologically accessible and in labilizing the coordinated NO. The effects of this compound could not be reversed by perfusion. Scavenging NO in slices preincubated with oxyhemoglobin prior to the addition of this compound eliminated its neurophysiological effects. The control molecules trans-[(P(OEt)3)2(NH3)4Ru](PF6)2, trans-[(H2O)(P(OEt)3) (NH3)4Ru](PF6)3, and [(NO)(NH3)5Ru]Cl3, which are structurally similar, but unable to generate NO, were ineffective. NaNO2 suppressed neuronal firing. Attempts to induce Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) at the time of maximal effect of trans-[(NO)(P(OEt)3)(NH3)4Ru](PF6)3 were unsuccessful, suggesting that the mechanism of amplification induced by trans-[(NO)(P(OEt)3)(NH3)4Ru](PF6)3 and LTP may share common pathways.",
