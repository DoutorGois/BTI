     "AB": "This report examines the inductive mechanisms involved in long-term heterosynaptic depression (LTD) in the dentate gyrus of anaesthetized rats. Associative and non-associative stimulus protocols were implemented, using the ipsilateral medial and lateral perforant path inputs to the dentate gyrus as the test pathways. In all experiments, the medial perforant path (MPP) received the conditioning stimuli which consisted of eight stimulus trains of 2 s duration, spaced 1 minute apart. Within each train the stimuli occurred as a burst of 5 pulses at 100 Hz, repeated at 200 ms intervals. The lateral perforant path (LPP) served as the test pathway in all of the initial experiments. In the associative condition, it received single pulses equally spaced between the medial path bursts. In the non-associative condition, no lateral path stimuli were given during the medial path trains. In both conditions, the application of the conditioning stimuli resulted in a long-term potentiation (LTP) of the medial path evoked responses (P less than 0.001), while the lateral path responses showed LTD (P less than 0.001). A two-way analyses of variance revealed there to be no difference between the two paradigms in the expression of LTP or LTD in naive pathways or in their ability to depress a potentiated pathway (P greater than 0.05) An occlusion test also showed there to be no further decreases in synaptic efficacy with the associative paradigm after the lateral path synapses were saturated with non-associative LTD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
