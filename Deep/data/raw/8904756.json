     "AB": "Pyramidal neurones of the entorhinal cortex and of hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3 were acutely isolated from juvenile rats. The effect of lowering the concentration of extracellular potassium ions ([K+]o) on fast transient A-currents (IA) was studied using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Upon lowering [K+]o from 5.4 to 0 mM amplitudes of IA in all pyramidal neurones were reduced only at test potentials positive to -20 mV, but were increased at potentials below -20 mV. Omission of magnesium ions from the intracellular perfusate resulted in an increase of IA in external K+-free solution at any potential tested. Moreover, when [K+]o was reduced steady-state activation and inactivation curves of IA were shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction.",
