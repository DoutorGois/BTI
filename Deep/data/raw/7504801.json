     "AB": "A synthetic truncated beta-amyloid peptide, beta 22-35, was shown to have a cytotoxic effect on cultured neurons from the rat hippocampus in serum-free medium. The peptide formed aggregates and typical amyloid fibrils resembling those of the beta-amyloid protein (AP) in neutral buffer solution and showed characteristic staining with Congo red and thioflavin-S. The neurotoxicity of beta 22-35 was suppressed by addition of calf serum, dibutyryl cAMP or insulin to culture medium, but not by addition of NGF or substance P. beta 22-35 had no effect on the glial cells. These results suggest that the AP can induce neurotoxicity in the hippocampal cells in vitro and the toxicity may involve a disorder in the intracellular signal transduction.",
