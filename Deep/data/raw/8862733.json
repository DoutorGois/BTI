     "AB": "To examine whether zinc deficiency would increase the toxicity of dietary aluminum, weanling, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed purified diets containing either 2 or 30 mg Zn/kg diet, with or without 500 mg Al/kg diet for 28 d. Individually pair-fed rats were fed the 30 mg Zn/kg diet with or without added aluminum to control for inanition secondary to zinc deficiency. Rats fed the 2 micrograms Zn/kg diet showed evidence of zinc deficiency, including anorexia, growth retardation, and depressed concentrations of zinc in tibias and livers. Zinc deficiency did not significantly increase the concentrations of aluminum in the tibias, livers, kidneys, or regions of the brain examined (cerebrum, cerebellum, midbrain, and hippocampus). Inclusion of aluminum in the diet did not alter aluminum concentrations in the various tissues. Under the conditions of this study, zinc deficiency did not result in greater sensitivity to dietary aluminum exposure.",
