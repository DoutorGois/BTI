     "AB": "Thrombin has been reported to inhibit neurite outgrowth from neuroblastoma cells grown in serum-containing medium after switching to serum-free medium. A test of the serum and substrate-dependence of this inhibition became possible with the development of Neurobasal/B27 serum-free medium. Inhibition of sprouting of Nb2a neuroblastoma cells by thrombin occurred from the substrate where it was bound to material adsorbed from serum. Neuritogenesis of primary hippocampal neurons was unaffected by exogenous thrombin on polylysine substrates with or without serum treatment. However, sprouting of hippocampal neurons was stimulated by treating the substrate with hirudin, a highly specific thrombin inhibitor. This suggests that hippocampal neurons are not directly responsive to added thrombin, perhaps because they produce their own thrombin.",
