     "AB": "Age-associated changes of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the brain were evaluated in 19 beagle dogs aged from 8-month- to 16-year-old. A significant correlation of the volume of lateral ventricle space was observed in the dogs with age advanced, however, no correlation was found between hippocampus size and the aging. The hypo-intensity areas on T2-weighted MRI were detected in globus pallidus and substantia nigra with a significant correlation of both intensity ratios to lateral ventricle with age advanced. These areas were coincided with the accumulation of iron in the slice of the brain with Perls' staining. In addition, hyper-intensity area, suggesting perivascular demyelination with fluid-filled space, was also observed in white matter surrounding the lateral ventricle on T2-weighted MRI. These results suggested that age-associated changes of T2-weighted MRI were developed in the dog brain, especially in globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and white matter surrounding lateral ventricle, like as those reported in the human brain.",
