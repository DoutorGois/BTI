     "AB": "The serotonin 5-HT(7) receptor has been linked to various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, anxiety and depression, and is antagonized by antipsychotics such as risperidone, clozapine and lurasidone. In this study, we examined whether inhibiting the 5-HT(7) receptor could reverse behavioral abnormalities in mice lacking pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), an experimental mouse model for psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. The selective 5-HT(7) antagonist SB-269970 effectively suppressed abnormal jumping behavior in PACAP-deficient mice. SB-269970 tended to alleviate the higher immobility in the forced swim test in PACAP-deficient mice, although SB-269970 reduced the immobility also in wild-type mice. In addition, we found that mutant mice had impaired performance in the Y-maze test, which was reversed by SB-269970. In the mutant mouse brain, 5-HT(7) protein expression did not differ from wild-type mice. In primary embryonic hippocampal neurons, the 5-HT(7) agonist AS19 increased neurite length and number. Furthermore, SB-269970 significantly inhibited the increase in neurite extension mediated by the 5-HT(1A/7) agonist 8-OH-DPAT. These results indicate that 5-HT(7) receptor blockade ameliorates psychomotor and cognitive deficits in PACAP-deficient mice, providing additional evidence that the 5-HT(7) receptor is a rational target for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.",
