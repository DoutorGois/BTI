     "AB": "The 3 time carbon monoxide (CO) exposures potentiated the delayed neuronal death (DND) in comparison with that induced by single CO exposure. Deterioration of DND induced by CO exposures was observed when normal body temperature was maintained during the exposures, since CO exposure fell the body temperature to about 34 degrees C. Pretreatment with noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (30 nmol/mouse), ameliorated DND induced by successive CO exposures under the maintenance of normal body temperature. These results suggest that the mice exposed successively to CO under the maintenance of normal body temperature is a useful hypoxic model.",
