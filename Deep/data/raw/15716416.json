     "AB": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of epilepsy, affecting approximately 1-2% of the population. Seizure events resulting from TLE are characterized by aberrant hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting and plastic responses that affect brain function. Seizure susceptibility is modulated by the enzyme tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the normal physiological role of which includes promotion of synaptic reorganization in the mossy fiber pathway by initiating a proteolytic cascade that cleaves extracellular matrix components and influences neurite extension. tPA is concentrated at and selectively secreted from growth cones during excitatory events. However, the mechanisms underlying tPA release during seizure-induced synaptogenesis are not well understood. We examine here potential roles for the signaling enzyme phospholipase D1 (PLD1), which promotes regulated exocytosis in non-CNS cell types, and which we previously demonstrated increases in expression in hippocampal neurons during seizure-induced mossy fiber sprouting. We now show that overexpression of wild-type PLD1 in cultured neurons promotes tPA release and tPA-dependent neurite extension, whereas overexpression of an inactive PLD1 allele or pharmacological inhibition of PLD1 inhibits tPA release. Similarly, viral delivery of wild-type PLD1 into the hippocampus facilitates tPA secretion and mossy fiber sprouting in a seizure-inducing model, whereas the inactive PLD1 allele inhibits tPA release and elicits blunted and abnormal mossy fiber extension similar to that observed for tPA-/- mice. Together, these findings secretion and thus mossy fiber extension in the setting of elevated suggest that PLD1 functions endogenously to regulate tPA-/- neuronal stimulation, such as that seen in TLE.",
