     "AB": "Both evoked and spontaneous seizures have been reported to increase neurogenesis in animal models. Less is known about whether neurogenesis and markers thereof are aberrantly expressed in human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis. In the present study we measured protein levels of multiple neurogenesis marker genes using Western blotting. Tissue homogenates from sclerotic hippocampus surgically resected from patients with pharmacoresistantTLE (n = 7) were compared to hippocampal samples from a group of age- and gender-matched autopsy controls (n = 6). Expression of the mature neuron marker NeuN was significantly lower in TLE samples compared to controls. In contrast, levels of neurogenesis-associated genes including TUC-4, doublecortin, Neu-roD and Numb, were all similarly expressed in TLE and control hippocampus samples. The present study suggests hippocampal expression levels of proteins associated with neurogenesis are not notably different in human TLE, implying the sclerotic hippocampus may retain neurogenic potential.",
