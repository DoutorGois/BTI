     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the time course of the responses of neurons and astrocytes in rat hippocampus (HI) to kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures in various regions. METHODS: By means immunohistochemical staining for anti-Fos protein and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the regional distribution of reactive neurons and astrocytes in the HI was observed at different time points after a unilateral stereotaxic microinjection of KA into the lateral ventricle of rats to cause limbic and generalized convulsive seizures. RESULTS: The injection of KA triggered limbic motor seizures including immobilization, staring, facial and jaw clonus ect. followed by recurrent generalized convulsive seizures. After KA-induced seizures, the GFAP-positive astrocytes and Fos-positive neurons were markedly increased in the HI. The increase of GFAP immunoreactivity was observed 30 min after the seizure onset, reaching the maximum at 1 h; the increase of Fos immunoreactivity was detected at 1 h after the onset, peaking at 2 h. CONCLUSION: The neurons and astrocytes in rat HI are highly active during seizures and the reactive astrocytes might play an important role in epileptogenesis.",
