     "AB": "Enkephalin-induced excitation in the hippocampus has been attributed to the attenuation of inhibitory input as well as to augmentation of excitatory input to pyramidal neurons. We have further examined these possible mechanisms of enkephalin action, as well as the possibility that enkephalins may be affecting intrinsic membrane properties, by recording intracellularly from CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells in the guinea pig hippocampal brain slice preparation. It was observed that the inhibitory synaptic potential was significantly decreased in the presence of leucine enkephalin and D-alanine, D-leucine-enkephalin (DADL), whereas the excitatory synaptic potential, revealed by block of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) by bicuculline, was unaltered. In addition, the response of pyramidal cells to pressure-applied GABA was unaffected by enkephalin, as were the voltage-dependent membrane conductances. The increase in excitability which was observed in both field potential and intracellular recordings to drop application of DADL must, then, be due to a purely presynaptic block of inhibitory interneurons in both the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus.",
