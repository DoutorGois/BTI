     "AB": "The entorhinal cortex (EC) is a major gateway for sensory information into the hippocampal formation. The information flow from layer II and III of the medial EC to the hippocampus is regulated in a frequency dependent manner. Spread of low Mg2+-induced epileptiform activity from EC to hippocampus differs in slices obtained from normal and kindled rats, and in adult versus juvenile rats. In slices from normal rats, low Mg2+-induced epileptiform activity in the EC had only moderate effects on the areas CA3 and CA1, apparently gated by powerful inhibition in the dentate gyrus. In slices from kindled rats, and from juvenile rats, there is facilitated propagation of the seizure-like events and late recurrent discharges through the EC-hippocampal slice. Temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with selective lesions in layer III of the medial EC. Such loss of layer III cells of the medial EC during epilepsy may contribute to the disturbance of frequency dependent information flow from the EC to the hippocampus, and, therefore, to the cognitive impairments associated with these disorders.",
