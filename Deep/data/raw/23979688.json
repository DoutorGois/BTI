     "AB": "Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) has angiogenesis-regulating and neuro-protective effects, but its effects on vascular dementia (VaD) are unknown. In this study, 30 adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to five groups: normal, sham-operation, VaD alone (bilateral carotid artery occlusion), VaD plus saline (control), and VaD plus HSYA. One week after operation, the HSYA group received one daily tail-vein injection of 0.6 mg/100 g HSYA for two weeks. Five weeks after operation, the spatial memory of all five groups was evaluated by the water maze task, and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus was assessed by the long-term potentiation (LTP) method. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and N-methyl-Daspartic acid receptor 1 (NR1) expression in the hippocampus was detected via Western blot. We found that, compared with the group with VaD alone, the group with HSYA had a reduced escape latency in the water maze (P < 0.05), and the LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus was enhanced (P < 0.05). Western blot in the late-phase VaD group showed slight up-regulation of VEGF and downregulation of NR1 in the hippocampus, while HSYA significantly up-regulated both VEGF and NR1. These results suggested that HSYA promotes angiogenesis and increases synaptic plasticity, thus improving spatial learning and memory in the rat model of VaD.",
