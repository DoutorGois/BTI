     "AB": "Self-stimulation (SS) rewarding experience induced structural changes have been demonstrated in the hippocampal and motor cortical pyramidal neurons. In the present study, we have evaluated whether these changes are accompanied by neurochemical alterations in the hippocampus and motor cortex in SS experienced rats. Self-stimulation experience was provided one hour daily over a period of 10 days through stereotaxically implanted bipolar stainless steel electrodes, bilaterally in lateral hypothalamus and substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area. Self-stimulation experience resulted in a significant (P < 0.001) increase in the levels of noradrenaline, dopamine, glutamate and AChE activity but not 5-hydroxytryptamine and GABA levels in hippocampus and motor cortex. Such alterations in the levels of neurotransmitters may enhance the cognitive functions in the SS experienced rats.",
