     "AB": "A histochemical procedure was established for the microphotometric determination of hexokinase (HK) in sections of the rat hippocampus, which served as an exemplary brain region. For this quantitative procedure, slides were coated with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) as an auxiliary enzyme and sections were mounted onto this enzyme film. The sections were then incubated with the following adapted incubation medium: 5 mM D-glucose, 1.5 mM NADP, 7.5 mM ATP, 4 mM nitroblue tetrazolium chloride, 10 mM NaN3, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM phenazine methosulfate, 1 U/ml G6PDH, 22% polyvinyl alcohol in 0.05 M Hepes buffer; the final pH was 7.5. A linear response of the reaction was observed in the initial 10 min of reaction (kinetic and end-point measurements). The relationship between HK activity and section thickness was linear up to 5 microns. The need for such thin sections is discussed in relation to the limited penetration of the auxiliary enzyme into the section. It is concluded that the quantitative demonstration of HK in brain sections could be a valuable tool for studying the local metabolic entrance of glucose in the glycolytic pathway.",
