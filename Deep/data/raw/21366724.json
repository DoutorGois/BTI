     "AB": "The role of histamine neurons in schizophrenia and psychostimulant abuse remains unclear. Behavioural sensitization to psychostimulants is a cardinal feature of these disorders. Here, we have explored the ability of imetit and ciproxifan (CPX), a reference H(3)-receptor agonist and inverse agonist, respectively, to modulate locomotor sensitization induced in mice by methamphetamine (MET). Mice received saline, CPX (3 mg/kg) or imetit (3 mg/kg) 2 h before MET (2 mg/kg), once daily for 12 days, and were killed after a 2-day wash out. Imetit had no effect, but CPX induced a decrease of MET-induced locomotor activity, which became significant at Day 5, and even more at Day 10. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used in the sensitized mice to quantify brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor subunit 1 (NR1) mRNAs, two factors that are altered in both schizophrenia and drug abuse. Imetit and CPX used alone had no effect on any marker. Sensitization by MET decreased BDNF mRNAs by 40% in the hippocampus. This decrease was reversed by CPX. Sensitization by MET also induced strong decreases of NR1 mRNAs in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum, but not hypothalamus. These decreases were also reversed by CPX. The strong modulator effect of CPX in mice sensitized to MET may result from its modulator effect on NR1 mRNAs in the cerebral cortex and striatum. The reversal by CPX of BDNF and NR1 mRNAs in the hippocampus of sensitized animals further strengthens the interest of H(3)-receptor inverse agonists for the long-term treatment of cognitive deficits of patients with schizophrenia.",
