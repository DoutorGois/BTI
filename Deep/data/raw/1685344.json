     "AB": "High affinity transport of excitatory amino acids such as L-glutamate into astrocytes is necessary for the termination of its excitatory signal and the prevention of its excitotoxic effects. The removal of glutamate from the synaptic cleft is carried out by both sodium- and chloride-dependent systems. Both sodium-dependent D-[3H]aspartate and chloride-dependent L-[3H]glutamate binding were found to increase in the dentate gyrus molecular layer of rats following an entorhinal lesion. The increased binding reached a maximum at 5 and 7 days postlesion and returned to normal by 12 days postlesion. No changes in binding were observed at long time points postlesion. This increased ability to transport glutamate may be a compensatory response to protect the remaining neurons from the excitotoxic conditions that accompany neuronal degeneration.",
