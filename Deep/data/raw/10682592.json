But on the non-platform test day, a much longer length of swimming in the quadrant in which the hidden platform was located previously, although no difference was found for the total distance between them; (3) the immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acid protein and the average density of its products in hippocampus of both the low and high dose Mn-exposed groups, especially of the high dose one, was significantly higher than that of the control group.",
