     "AB": "The identity of the glucose transporters (GLUT) expressed in neurons in situ has yet to be fully established. In the present study we have isolated the GLUT3 (RGT3) cDNA and produced anti RGT3 polyclonal antibody allowing us to investigate the cellular localization and tissue distributions of RGT3 mRNA and protein in the central nervous system of the rat by the methods of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Here we demonstrate the direct evidence that RGT3 is present in neurons in adult rat brain. In situ hybridization showed the expression of RGT3 mRNA mostly in the regions of hippocampus, cerebral cortex, striatum, and the granule cell layer of the cerebellum, indicating that RGT3 mRNA is predominantly expressed within neurons. Immunohistochemistry showed that RGT3 protein is widely distributed in the rat brain, and concentrated on the plasma membrane of neurons. Double labeling studies with anti-RGT3, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neuron specific enolase (NSE) antibodies revealed the specific expression of RGT3 protein in neurons. Thus, RGT3 is indicated to be a neuron specific glucose transporter isoform (NSGT), and suggested to play a functionally significant role in rat central neurons.",
