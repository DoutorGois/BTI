     "AB": "We investigated the hypothesis that the cholinergic system is involved in the process of amygdala kindling. Electrical kindling of the amygdala was associated with an increase in the concentration of acetylcholine in the kindled amygdala and the ipsilateral hippocampus but was not associated with any alteration of choline acetyltransferase activity. Destruction of cholinergic neurons in the lateral preoptic area significantly decreased the activity of choline acetylase in the ipsilateral amygdala, but had no effect on the duration of time to kindling. We interpret these findings as indicating that the cholinergic system is affected by the kindling process, but does not seem to be crucial to the phenomenon.",
