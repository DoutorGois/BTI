     "AB": "CGG repeats in the 5'UTR of Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) RNA mediate RNA localization and translation in granules. Large expansions of CGG repeats (> 200 repeats) in FMR1, referred to as full mutations, are associated with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Smaller expansions (55-200 repeats), referred to as premutations, are associated with fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). TMPyP4 is a porphyrin ring compound that destabilizes CGG repeat RNA secondary structure. Here we show that exogenous CGG repeat RNA by itself, lacking the FMRP ORF, microinjected into hippocampal neurons is localized in RNA granules and inhibits translation of ARC RNA, which is localized in the same granules. TMPyP4 rescues translation of ARC RNA in granules. We also show that in human premutation fibroblasts with endogenous CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene, translation of ARC RNA is inhibited and calcium homeostasis is disrupted and both phenotypes are rescued by TMPyP4. Inhibition of granule translation by expanded CGG repeats and rescue of granule translation by TMPy4, represent potential pathogenic mechanism and therapeutic strategy, respectively, for FXTAS and FXPOI.",
