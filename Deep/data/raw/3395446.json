     "AB": "Hippocampal lesions in rats lead to an impairment of performance in spatial delayed conditional discriminations. The effect of such lesions on nonspatial tasks is controversial. In monkeys, both the hippocampus and the amygdala are involved in nonspatial delayed conditional discriminations. The effect of amygdaloid lesions in rats on this type of task has not been studied. To clarify the role of hippocampus and amygdala in a cue-relevant/space-irrelevant delayed conditional discrimination, rats were trained on a delayed match-to-sample task with visual and tactile cues as discriminative stimuli. Rats were then given one of five lesions: control, complete fimbria-fornix, partial fimbria-fornix, complete amygdala, or partial amygdala. Amygdaloid lesions, partial or complete, did not impair choice accuracy. Fimbria-fornix lesions did impair choice accuracy, and the magnitude and duration of the impairment was a function of the size of the lesion. Partial fimbria-fornix lesions produced a slight impairment that disappeared with continued testing. Complete fimbria-fornix lesions produced chance performance throughout postoperative testing. These results indicate that the fimbria-fornix, but not the amygdala, is involved in nonspatial delayed match-to-sample.",
