     "AB": "The construction of a chamber for extracellular recording from submerged CNS tissue is described. Its operation is illustrated using hippocampal slices prepared from rat brains. The total volume of perfusing medium is less than 0.4 ml, and a drug solution can be uniformly distributed throughout this volume in less than 1 min. Drug-laden medium can also be rapidly replaced with fresh medium. The perfusing medium is continuously stirred with a jet of 95% O2-5% CO2, maintaining submerged slices viable for many hours. The system has exceptional advantages for investigating synaptic pharmacology of scarce and expensive drugs.",
