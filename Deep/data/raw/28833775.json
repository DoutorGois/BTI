     "AB": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an endogenous gut hormone and a key regulator in maintaining glucose homeostasis by stimulating insulin secretion. Its natural cleavage product GLP-1 (9-36), used to be considered a \"bio-inactive\" metabolite mainly because of its lack of insulinotropic effects and low affinity for GLP-1 receptors, possesses unique properties such as anti-oxidant and cardiovascular protection. Little is known about the role of GLP-1 (9-36) in central nervous system. Here we report that chronic, systemic application of GLP-1 (9-36) in adult mice facilitated both the induction and maintenance phases of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a major form of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, spatial learning and memory, as assessed by the Morris water maze test, was not altered by GLP-1 (9-36) administration. At the molecular level, GLP-1 (9-36) reduced protein levels of the potassium channel Kv4.2 in hippocampus, which is linked to elevated dendritic membrane excitability. Moreover, GLP-1(9-36) treatment inhibited phosphorylation of mRNA translational factor eEF2, which is associated with increased capacity for de novo protein synthesis. Finally, we showed that the LTP-enhancing effects by GLP-1 (9-36) treatment in vivo were blunted by application of exendin(9-39)amide [EX(9-39)], the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) antagonist, suggesting its role as a GLP-1R agonist. These findings demonstrate that GLP-1 (9-36), which was considered a \"bio-inactive\" peptide, clearly exerts physiological effects on neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for learning and memory.",
