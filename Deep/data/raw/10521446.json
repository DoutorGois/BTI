     "AB": "Growth factor receptors provide a major mechanism for the activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Src, and this kinase in turn up-regulates the activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in CA1 hippocampal neurons (1). Unexpectedly, applications of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB to cultured and isolated CA1 hippocampal neurons depressed NMDA-evoked currents. The PDGF-induced depression was blocked by a PDGF-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, by a selective inhibitor of phospholipase C-gamma, and by blocking the intracellular release of Ca(2+). Inhibitors of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) also eliminated the PDGF-induced depression, whereas a phosphodiesterase inhibitor enhanced it. The NMDA receptor-mediated component of excitatory synaptic currents was also inhibited by PDGF, and this inhibition was prevented by co-application of a PKA inhibitor. Src inhibitors also prevented this depression. In recordings from inside-out patches, the catalytic fragment of PKA did not itself alter NMDA single channel activity, but it blocked the up-regulation of these channels by a Src activator peptide. Thus, PDGF receptors depress NMDA channels through a Ca(2+)- and PKA-dependent inhibition of their modulation by c-Src.",
