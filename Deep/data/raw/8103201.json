     "AB": "Developmental alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-stimulated[3H]norepinephrine release from rat brain cortical and hippocampal slices were studied. NMDA (10-1000 microM) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in [3H]norepinephrine efflux; maximal responses (% released) in the cortex were: (1.53 +/- 0.12, 3.68 +/- 0.20, 2.94 +/- 0.20, 4.60 +/- 0.28 and 5.28 +/- 0.33) and the hippocampal responses were: (1.90 +/- 0.18, 3.84 +/- 0.23, 3.60 +/- 0.28, 5.16 +/- 0.38 and 5.81 +/- 0.45) at varying postnatal ages (1, 7, 14, 21 and 90 days) respectively. Cortical tissue from 7-day-old pups exhibited a transient increase in maximal efflux and a decrease in EC50. These results indicated that developmental alterations in the NMDA receptor appear to be translated into differences in NMDA stimulated [3H]norepinephrine release.",
