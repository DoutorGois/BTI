     "AB": "It has been reported that inflammatory processes are associated with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the treatment of AD using anti-inflammatory agents slows the progress of AD. Marine algae have been utilized in food products as well as in medicine products for a variety of purposes. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of methanol extracts of Ulva conglobata (U. conglobata), a marine algae, on glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in the murine hippocampal HT22 cell line and the anti-inflammatory effects on interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced microglial activation in BV2 cells. U. conglobata methanol extracts significantly attenuated the neurotoxicity induced by glutamate in HT22 cells and inhibited nitric oxide production induced by IFN-gamma in BV2 cells. U. conglobata methanol extract treatments were also examined and it was found that they almost completely suppressed the expression of the proinflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). These results suggest that U. conglobata possesses therapeutic potential for combating neurodegenerative diseases associated with neuroinflammation.",
