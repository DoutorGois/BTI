     "AB": "This paper reviews data which illustrate that histamine has prominent actions on the electrophysiology of mammalian central neurons. Extracellular recordings reveal that this amine can either excite or depress neuronal activity in different regions of the brain. The excitations are associated with activation of H1 histamine receptors, whereas depressions are associated with occupancy of H2 receptors. Intracellular experiments have revealed multiple actions of histamine on membrane potential and conductance as well as on amplitude and frequency of postsynaptic potentials. In addition, we present preliminary data from rat cerebral cortex and hippocampal slices which suggest a modulatory role for histamine on gamma-aminobutyric acid mediated neurotransmission in the areas of the brain.",
