     "AB": "Lesions in the midbrain median but not in the dorsal raphe nucleus significantly decreased the serotonin (5-HT) content of the hippocampus (61%), medial preoptic area (49%), suprachiasmatic nucleus (70%) and anterior hypothalamic area (60%). Electrolytic lesions restricted to either the median or dorsal raphe nucleus produced significant reductions in the 5-HT concentration of the caudate-putamen, anterolateral hypothalamic area (45%) and arcuate nucleus (48--58%). The fall in caudate-putamen 5-HT level was significantly greater after the dorsal (66%) than after the median (24%) raphe lesion. Neither lesion significantly affected the 5-HT content of the posterolateral hypothalamic area, the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus or the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus. Thus, like their differential projections to the caudate-putamen and hippocampus, the mesencephalic dorsal and median raphe nuclei appear to innervate different preoptico-hypothalamic nuclei and areas. Whereas the median raphe nucleus seems to be the primary source of 5-HT fibers to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, anterior hypothalamic area and medial preoptic area, the 5-HT inputs to the anterolateral hypothalamic area and arcuate nucleus appear to derive from both the dorsal and median raphe nuclei.",
