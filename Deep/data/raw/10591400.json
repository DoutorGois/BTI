     "AB": "\"Kindling\" is a phenomenon of epileptogenesis, which has been widely used as an experimental model of temporal lobe epilepsy. At the present work we investigated the contribution of NMDA receptors in the Pentylenetetrazol-induced \"kindling\" model in the mouse brain, by using quantitative autoradiography and the radioactive ligands [3H]MK801 and [3H]L-glutamate (NMDA-sensitive component). One week after establishment of kindling, a small but significant increase in [3H]MK801 as well as NMDA-sensitive [3H]glutamate binding was seen, being restricted to the molecular layer (ML) of the dentate gyrus (DG) and the CA3 region of the hippocampus. These binding augmentations persisted one month after establishment of kindling. A significant increase of NMDA receptor binding was also observed in the cortex-somatosensory and temporal one week after acquisition of the kindled state. The upregulation of NMDA receptors seen in DG and CA3 region of the hippocampus could be associated with the kindling process of this model especially with its maintenance phase, since it persists at long term, is area-specific and consistent with electrophysiological data. The increase of NMDA receptors seen in the cortex of the kindled animals could underlie the hyperexcitability detected by electrophysiological studies in this area.",
