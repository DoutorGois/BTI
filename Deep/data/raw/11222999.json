     "AB": "The localization of caspase-1 protein, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-converting enzyme, was immunohistochemically examined in the hippocampal CA-1 subfield by a transient occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries in Mongolian gerbils. Immunoreactivities for caspase-1 were found in microglias, astrocytes, endothelial cells of capillaries and some non-pyramidal neurons. Immunopositive microglias increased in number from 3 days until 7 days from the transient ischemia, and astrocytes also increased in number from 3 days until 28 days. At the electron microscopic level, caspase-1 immunoreaction endproducts were associated with Golgi apparatus in glial cells, endothelial cells of blood vessels and non-pyramidal neurons. The delayed neuronal death of CA-1 pyramidal cells was significantly protected by the treatment of specific caspase-1 inhibitor (Ac-WEHD-CHO) or broad caspase family inhibitor (z-VAD-FMK). Cell death was protected in a dose dependent manner by the former by 43-57%, and by the latter by 66-91% when injected at 1 and 10 microg, respectively. On the other hand, the protective effect of specific caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DMQD-CHO) was less significant at higher dose (10 microg) by 33% (P<0.05), and not detectable at lower dose (1 microg) by 13% (P=0.27). Furthermore, a significant decrease of microglias and astrocytes was found in the CA-1 as well as the reduction of IL-1beta and caspase-1 immunoreactivities by the treatment of Ac-WEHD-CHO. Extravasation of serum albumin was also extremely reduced by this treatment. These findings suggest that the inhibition of caspase-1 activity ameliorates the ischemic injury by inhibiting the activity of IL-1beta.",
