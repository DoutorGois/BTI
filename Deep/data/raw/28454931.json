     "AB": "Memory deficit is the most visible symptom of cerebral ischemia that is associated with loss of pyramidal cells in CA1 region of the hippocampus. Oxidative stress and inflammation may be involved in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage. Minocycline, a semi-synthetic tetracycline derived antibiotic, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. We evaluated the neuroprotective effect of minocycline on memory deficit induced by cerebral I/R in rat. I/R was induced by occlusion of common carotid arteries for 20min. Minocycline (40mg/kg, i.p.) was administered once daily for 7days after I/R. Learning and memory were assessed using the Morris water maze test. Nissl staining was used to evaluate the viability of CA1 pyramidal cells. The effects of minocycline on the microglial activation was also investigated by Iba1 (Ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1) immunostaining. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) in the hippocampus were measured by thiobarbituric acid reaction substances method and ELISA, respectively. Minocycline reduced the increase in escape latency time and in swimming path length induced by cerebral I/R. Furthermore, the ischemia-induced reduction in time spent in the target quadrant during the probe trial was increased by treatment with minocycline. Histopathological results indicated that minocycline prevented pyramidal cells death and microglial activation induced by I/R. Minocycline also reduced the levels of MDA and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus in rats subjected to I/R. Minocycline has neuroprotective effects on memory deficit induced by cerebral I/R in rat, probably via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.",
