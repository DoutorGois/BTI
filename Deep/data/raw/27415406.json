     "AB": "The compositions and contents of carotenoids in in-season and anti-season tomatoes were compared by HPLC method. In-season and anti-season tomatoes differed not only in the contents of all-trans-lycopene and beta-carotene but also in the contents of cis-isomers, implying environmental factors affected not only the accumulation of the all-trans-carotenoids but also their cis-isomers. Meanwhile, the protection of in-season and anti-season tomato extracts against d-galactose induced cognition deficits and oxidative damage in mice were studied. The water-soluble extracts of both season tomatoes showed little protecting effects on the impairment in mice induced by D-gal, while the fat-soluble extracts significantly attenuated d-gal-induced cognitive impairment, and prevented the oxidative damage in mice, but no remarkable difference was observed between the two season tomatoes at the same dose levels, indicating anti-season tomatoes showed similar in vivo protection against d-galactose induced cognition deficits and oxidative damage as that of in-season tomatoes.",
