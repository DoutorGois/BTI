     "AB": "Hooded rats with bilateral lesions of the anterior part of the hippocampal formation (HIP), anterior region of the posterior parietal cortex (APC), or posterior region of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) were compared with controls for their exploration of 5 objects in an open field, habituation of locomotion and object investigation, and response to spatial and nonspatial change. First, all groups displayed habituation of both locomotor and exploratory activity. Second, controls selectively reexplored displaced objects, and APC-lesioned rats reexplored all objects, whereas PPC- and HIP-lesioned rats failed to react to the spatial change. Third, a novel object induced reexploration in all groups. The results are consistent with the roles of the HIP and PPC in spatial information processing. Moreover, the APC and PPC are involved in attentional effortful processing and visuospatial information processing necessary for spatial representation, respectively.",
