     "AB": "The effect of sibutramine and dexfenfluramine on 5-HT re-uptake sites, labelled with [(3)H]paroxetine, have been determined in various rat brain regions. In addition, the ability of fluoxetine and sibutramine to protect against the changes in [(3)H]paroxetine binding produced by dexfenfluramine was examined. Sibutramine (9 mg/kg, p.o.) and dexfenfluramine (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) were administered twice daily (before 09.00 h and after 16.00 h) for four days, followed by a 14 day drug-free period. In the protection studies, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and sibutramine (9 mg/kg, p.o.) were given 1 h prior to dexfenfluramine (10 mg/kg, p.o.) using the same dosing regimen as described above. Sibutramine (9 mg/kg, p.o.; three times its ED(50) to inhibit food intake at 2 h) had no significant effect on the number or affinity of 5-HT re-uptake sites the brain regions studied. In contrast, dexfenfluramine at an equivalent dose (3 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly decreased the number of 5-HT re-uptake sites in frontal cortex (by 35%), hippocampus (by 47%) and hypothalamus (by 27%). This effect was dose-dependent with marked decreases (by 58-84%) in the number of sites following 10 mg/kg, p.o. These effects were not associated with changes in binding affinity. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) completely blocked the effect of dexfenfluramine (10 mg/kg, p.o.) without having any significant effect alone. Sibutramine (9 mg/kg, p.o.) also blocked the effects of dexfenfluramine, although the reversal was only partial in frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Thus sibutramine, unlike dexfenfluramine, does not alter brain 5-HT re-uptake sites. Furthermore, sibutramine and fluoxetine protect against the deficits in 5-HT re-uptake sites produced by dexfenfluramine. These data provide further evidence that sibutramine is a 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor and it does not have neurotoxic potential.",
