     "AB": "Long-term memory formation requires gene expression after acquisition of new information. The first step in the regulation of gene expression is the participation of transcription factors (TFs) such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-small ka, CyrillicB), which are present before the neuronal activity induced by training. It was proposed that the activation of these types of TFs allows a second step in gene regulation by induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs) whose protein products are, in turn, TFs. Between these IEGs, zif268 has been found to play a critical role in long-term memory formation and reprocessing after retrieval. Here we found in mice hippocampus that, on one hand, NF-small ka, CyrillicB was activated 45 min after training in a novel object recognition (NOR) task and that inhibiting NF-small ka, CyrillicB immediately after training by intrahippocampal administration of NF-small ka, CyrillicB Decoy DNA impaired NOR memory consolidation. On the other hand, Zif268 protein expression was induced 45 min after NOR training and the administration of DNA antisense to its mRNA post-training impaired recognition memory. Finally, we found that the inhibition of NF-small ka, CyrillicB by NF-small ka, CyrillicB Decoy DNA reduced significantly the training-induced Zif268 increment, indicating that NF-small ka, CyrillicB is involved in the regulation of Zif268 expression. Thus, the present results support the involvement of NF-small ka, CyrillicB activity-dependent Zif268 expression in the hippocampus during recognition memory consolidation.",
