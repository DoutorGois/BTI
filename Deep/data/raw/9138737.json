     "AB": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered tolerant to U-50,488H by twice-daily injections of the drug (25 mg/kg, i.p.) for 4 days. In tolerant rats, the binding of [3H]MK-801 was increased in pons and medulla and corpus striatum but decreased in midbrain and hippocampus and was due to changes in Bmax values. In U-50,488H-abstinent rats, the binding of [3H]MK-801 was increased in pons and medulla and hippocampus, and decreased in midbrain and amygdala. In hippocampus, the Bmax of [3H]MK-801 was increased but the Kd was decreased whereas in amygdala and pons and medulla, the changes were due to alterations in the Bmax values. Previous studies have shown that NMDA receptor antagonists block the tolerance to the analgesic action of U-50,488H in rodents. The present studies demonstrate differential changes in the NMDA receptors of brain regions of U-50,488H-tolerant and -abstinent rats.",
