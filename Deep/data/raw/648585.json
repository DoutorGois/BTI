     "AB": "The actions of benzodiazepines and pentobarbitone on GABA-mediated recurrent inhibition of hippocampal pyramidal neurons were investigated in the immobilized unanaesthetized cat. Extracellular action potentials of single neurons were recorded in regions CA1 or CA2 with 4 M NaCl-containing glass micropipettes. Bicuculline (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) reduced the period of inhibition induced by stimulation of the fimbria and the septum, but fludiazepam and diazepam (0.3--1.0 mg/kg i.v.) and pentobarbitone (15--30 mg/kg i.v.) prolonged the inhibition. The prolongation produced by these compounds was antagonized by the administration of bicuculline (0.3 mg/kg i.v.). The results suggest that these two classes of compounds potentiate GABA-mediated recurrent inhibition in hippocampal neurons in a similar way.",
