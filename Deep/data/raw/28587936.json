     "AB": "BACKGROUND: In addition to its role as a circulating hormone, oxytocin can also act as a neurotransmitter and a neuromodulator within the brain. In this study, we investigated the intra-hippocampal effect of oxytocin on an experimental seizure model induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in rats. We also used atosiban (oxytocin antagonist), diazepam and flumazenil (gamma-aminobutyric acid or GABA-benzodiazepine receptor agonist and antagonist, respectively) to clarify the involved mechanism. METHOD: In ketamine-xylazine anesthetized rats, the right and left sides of the dorsal hippocampus (CA1) were implanted with two guide cannulas. Epileptic behaviors were induced by intraperitoneal (ip) injection of PTZ (60mg/kg), and the latency time to onset of first myoclonic jerk, and the duration of epileptic seizures were determined for 30min. RESULTS: Intra-hippocampal microinjections of oxytocin at doses of 10 and 20ng/site, diazepam (100 and 200ng/site) and co-administration of their ineffective doses significantly (p<0.01) increased the onset of first myoclonic jerk and decreased duration of epileptic seizure. Antiepileptic effects of oxytocin (20ng/site) were inhibited by atosiban (20 and 40ng/site) and flumazenil (100 and 200ng/site) pretreatments. On the other hand, prior administration of flumazenil (100 and 200ng/site) and atosiban (20 and 40ng/site) prevented the antiepileptic effects induced by diazepam (100 and 200ng/site). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study showed that at the level of the hippocampus oxytocin suppressed the severity of epileptic behaviors. A hippocampal GABA-benzodiazepine receptor mechanism may be involved in antiepileptic effect of oxytocin.",
