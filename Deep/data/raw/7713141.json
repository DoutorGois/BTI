     "AB": "We examined the effects of rolipram, a cyclic AMP-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, on cerebral ischemia-induced neuronal damage in Mongolian gerbils. Transient forebrain ischemia was induced by 3-min occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries. Rolipram, at a dose of 0.3 or 3 mg/kg, was injected i.p. 30 min before ischemia. Histopathological observations showed that neuronal damage to the hippocampal CA1 subfield, which was seen 7 days after ischemia in vehicle-treated animals, was reduced in animals treated with the higher dose of rolipram.",
