     "AB": "Recently, the authors isolated a novel gene of the HSP110 family, ischemia responsive protein 94 kDa (irp94), and demonstrated the expression of this gene after transient forebrain ischemia. In the current study, the authors investigated the expression profiles of all HSP110 family members including hsp110/105 and osp94/apg-1, after transient forebrain ischemia using rat four-vessel occlusion model. Among three members of the HSP110 family, induction of hsp110/105 was the most prominent after ischemia. hsp110/105 mRNA expression was clearly enhanced from 4 to 24 hours after a 6-minute or longer ischemic period. First, hsp110/105 mRNA expression was induced in the dentate gyrus, and later in the pyramidal layer. HSP110/105 protein expression also was enhanced by a 6-minute or longer period of ischemia. Profiles of HSP110/105 expression after ischemia were similar to those of inducible HSP70. After transient forebrain ischemia for 10 minutes, HSP110/105 protein was induced in the dentate gyrus and the CA3 pyramidal layer, but not in the CA1 pyramidal neurons. However, 6 minutes of ischemia induced the HSP110/105 protein, as well as the HSP70 protein, in the CA1 region. CA1 pyramidal neurons expressing HSP110/105 acquired tolerance against subsequent severe ischemia. In conclusion, HSP110/105 showed the most prominent induction after ischemia among the three HSP110 gene family members. Colocalization of HSP110/105 and HSP70 in the CA1 neurons that acquired tolerance suggested that induced HSP110/105 might contribute to ischemic tolerance together with HSP70.",
