     "AB": "Adult multipotent neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs) have the capacity to self-renew and generate functional differentiated cells (e.g. neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes) within discrete tissue-specific germinal niches, such as the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Due to their intrinsic plasticity NPCs can be considered an essential part of the cellular mechanism(s) by which the central nervous system (CNS) tries to repair itself after an injury and, as a consequence, they also represents an attractive therapeutic tool for the treatment of neurological disorders. Here we will discuss not only the role of NPC-based transplantation therapies in multiple sclerosis (MS) but also recent data suggesting that endogenous NPCs, while contributing to CNS repair in MS, may also become the target of the disease itself.",
