     "AB": "The effect of hippocampal seizures in rats was assessed in two spatial memory tasks: The reference memory task was a simultaneous two-choice discrimination in a T-maze. The working memory task was a delayed conditional discrimination in a radial arm maze. In each task the hippocampus of each rat was stimulated to seizure after the presentation of the information to be remembered. In the reference memory task, hippocampal seizures did not impair acquisition, whether the stimulation was given immediately after or 4 hr after the presentation of the stimuli to be remembered. In the working memory task, hippocampal seizures did impair performance in a group of the same rats. These results support the distinction between a trial-dependent working memory system that requires hippocampal function and a trial-independent memory system that does not depend on hippocampal function.",
