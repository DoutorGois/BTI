     "AB": "In 2 studies, a method of linear morphometry was applied to regulatory developmental neurotoxicity studies in the rat. The first study involved the development of the brain during postnatal days (PNDs) 7-63, and the second involved the effects of 8 mg/kg i.p. trimethyltin chloride (TMT) to rats at PND 8, with morphometry performed at PNDs 12 and 24. The results of the TMT linear morphometry were compared with those from stereologic counting of neurons in the cerebral cortex, piriform cortex, and hippocampus. Stereology produces more meaningful data than simple linear morphometry for use in the regulatory assessment of the developmental neurotoxicity potential of compounds.",
