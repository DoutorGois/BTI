     "AB": "A two-stage model of memory trace formation in the hippocampus considers exploratory behavior associated with theta activity and consumatory behaviors or immobility associated with the occurrence of synchronous pyramidal cell discharges. Threshold, frequency and extent of CA3 bursts differ between differently performing strains of mice and are subject to subcortical modulation. Mechanisms for such actions are described: interference with potassium and other cation channels through second messengers and a direct action of histamine on the NMDA receptor channel. Furthermore long-lasting potentiations of synaptic transmission and excitability following brief exposures of hippocampal slices to histamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin are mediated by cyclic AMP and presumably protein kinase A.",
