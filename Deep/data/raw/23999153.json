     "AB": "Chemical synapses are important components of the large-scaled neural network in the hippocampus of the mammalian brain, and a change in their weight is thought to be in charge of learning and memory. Thus, the realization of artificial chemical synapses is of crucial importance in achieving artificial neural networks emulating the brain's functionalities to some extent. This kind of research is often referred to as neuromorphic engineering. In this study, we report short-term memory behaviours of electrochemical capacitors (ECs) utilizing TiO2 mixed ionic-electronic conductor and various reactive electrode materials e.g. Ti, Ni, and Cr. By experiments, it turned out that the potentiation behaviours did not represent unlimited growth of synaptic weight. Instead, the behaviours exhibited limited synaptic weight growth that can be understood by means of an empirical equation similar to the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rule, employing a sliding threshold. The observed potentiation behaviours were analysed using the empirical equation and the differences between the different ECs were parameterized.",
