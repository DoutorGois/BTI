     "AB": "Endosulfine (EDSF) belongs to a highly conserved cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (ARPP) family and was first isolated from ovine brain as a possible endogenous ligand for sulfonylurea receptors. To explore its involvement in brain functions, we investigated regional distribution of alpha-EDSF gene expression in the rat brain, and its regulation under physiological and pathological conditions. The majority of alpha-EDSF gene was expressed in the pyramidal neurons, which represent the principal excitatory neurons in various brain regions. Down-regulation of alpha-EDSF mRNA was detected in the rat hippocampus during long-term memory consolidation following a spatial learning experience, whereas swimming-related stress caused persistent up-regulation of alpha-EDSF gene expression in several brain regions. These changes, however, were absent from brains of diabetic rats that were subjected to the same behavioral treatments. Intracerebroventricular injection of streptozocin with a toxic dose induced severe learning deficits and brain structure alteration accompanied by a massive increase of alpha-EDSF mRNA in the somatosensory cortex. These results suggest that alpha-EDSF gene expression is differentially regulated by distinct brain processes involving excitatory neuronal activities.",
