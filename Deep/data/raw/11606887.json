     "AB": "Extrastriatal D2 dopamine receptors represent an important target of research into the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of psychiatric disorders. The high affinity radioligand [11C]FLB 457 makes possible the measurement of low concentrations of D2 receptors in extrastriatal regions using positron emission tomography (PET). The aim of this study was to assess the test/retest variability and reliability of [11C]FLB 457 binding using a reference tissue model. Eight healthy male subjects (aged 20-33 years) underwent two [11C]FLB 457 PET examinations. Radioactivity in the cerebellum was used as the reference. The binding potentials (BPs) for five cortical regions of interest (ROIs) were calculated using the reference tissue model. The BP was also calculated for each pixel in the form of parametric images. Reproducibility was assessed both for the ROI method and for the parametric images. The test/retest reproducibility for [11C]FLB 457 binding was good, with a mean variability ranging from 4.5% for the thalamus to 15.5% for the hippocampus. The parametric images also demonstrated good reproducibility. These results support the suitability of using [11C]FLB 457 for the quantitative evaluation of extrastriatal D2 receptors and for protocols requiring repeated measurements in the same individual.",
