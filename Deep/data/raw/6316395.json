     "AB": "The long term behavioural and biochemical effects of chronic chlordiazepoxide treatment during the period of neuronal maturation in the rat have been investigated. The administration to lactating mothers of chlordiazepoxide at very low doses (0.22 and 2.6 mg/kg) in their drinking water affects both behavioural and biochemical parameters in offspring at 60 days of age and undrugged since weaning. A deficit in the acquisition of the conditioned avoidance response in treated rats was observed, although no significant difference in spontaneous locomotor activity between control and treated rats was found. 3H-Flunitrazepam binding sites in cerebral cortex and hippocampus were decreased by the treatment, whereas no change was detected in cerebellum. Moreover, 3H-muscimol binding sites increased in hippocampus with no changes in cerebral cortex and cerebellum. According to the different regional distribution of benzodiazepine type 1 and type 2 receptors, we suggest that type 2 receptors are selectively affected by the treatment, and that the GABAergic receptor system is also permanently altered by administration of chlordiazepoxide during early postnatal life.",
