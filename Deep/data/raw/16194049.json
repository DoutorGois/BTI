     "AB": "As carbenoxolone, a semisynthetic derivative of glycyrrhizinic acid, has a free radical scavenging property, thus the effects of carbenoxolone during ischemia-reperfusion was evaluated on an animal model of ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rat hind limb and hippocampus. Peripheral and central ischemia were induced by free-flap surgery in skeletal muscle and four-vessel-occulation (4VO) of rat, respectively. Carbenoxolone (50-200 mg/kg) and normal saline (10 ml/ kg) were administered intraperitoneally. In peripherlal ischemia, during preischemia, ischemia and reperfusion conditions the electromyographic (EMG) potentials in the muscles were recorded. The malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured by the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test after reperfusion in peripheral and central ischemia. In peripheral ischemia, the average peak-to-peak amplitude during ischemic-reperfusion was found to be significantly larger in carbenoxolone group (100-200mg/kg) in comparison to control group. The MDA levels were recovered significantly upon carbenoxolone (100-200 mg/kg) therapy in the skeletal muscle and hippocampus of ischemic rats. These results suggest that carbenoxolone can salvage the skeletal muscle and hippocampus from acute ischemia-reperfusion injury.",
