     "AB": "The mechanisms by which long-term changes in synaptic efficacy (e.g., long-term potentiation) are maintained are not well understood. There is evidence that reorganization of the neuronal actin cytoskeleton is important for consolidation of long-term potentiation. In non-neuronal cells, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and p70 S6 kinase have been shown to regulate actin polymerization. We have investigated the subcellular localization of these enzymes in cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons and their possible role in hippocampal long-term potentiation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed enrichment of both enzymes in the growth cones and filopodia of extending neurites, whereas p70 S6 kinase was also present at the soma. Antibodies to the phosphorylated form of p70 S6 kinase confirmed its activity in these locations. Interestingly, both enzymes displayed strong colocalization with F-actin in discrete regions of developing neurites. In hippocampal slices, the maintenance of long-term potentiation was attenuated by either rapamycin or 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-1-benzopyran-4-one, inhibitors of p70 S6 kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, respectively. Our findings provide evidence for a novel biochemical pathway involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase and p70 S6 kinase that is important for the maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation, possibly via regulation of actin dynamics.",
