     "AB": "Although the antiepileptic effects of the ketogenic diet (KD) are well documented, the mechanisms underlying this action remain obscure. Nitric oxide (NO) has long been thought to play a role in regulating seizures. However, the effects of the KD on endogenous NO production have not been characterized. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effect of the KD on endogenous NO production, as well as the precise role of NO in kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures, in male ICR mice. We first found that preadministration of the KD for 4 weeks increased endogenous NO generation in the hippocampus. We also demonstrated that the increase in NO induced by the KD resulted from increased neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) activity and exerted an antiepileptic effect on KA-induced seizures, based on the results of experiments using NOS-knockout mice and two NOS inhibitors, N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and 7-nitroindazole (7-NI). These data suggest that the antiepileptic effects of the KD might be mediated, at least in part, by increased NO levels in the hippocampus.",
