     "AB": "The effect of chronic administration of morphine to rats on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors labeled with [3H]MK-801, a non-competitive antagonist, was determined in brain regions and spinal cord. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered tolerant to and physically dependent on morphine by subcutaneous implantation of 6 morphine pellets during a 7-day period. Each pellet contained 75 mg of morphine free base. Animals serving as controls were similarly implanted with placebo pellets. This procedure resulted in the development of a high degree of tolerance and physical dependence on morphine. Two sets of rats were used. In one, the pellets were left intact at the time of sacrifice (tolerant) and in the other the pellets were removed 16 h prior to sacrificing (abstinent). The binding constants, Bmax and Kd values of [3H]MK-801 were determined in cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, corpus striatum, midbrain and spinal cord. In the absence of glycine and glutamate, [3H]MK-801 bound to tissue membranes at a single high affinity site. The Bmax and Kd values of [3H]MK-801 were not altered in any of the tissues of the morphine abstinent rats. The Bmax value of [3H]MK-801 was significantly decreased in cerebral cortex of morphine tolerant rats as compared to their placebo controls but the Kd values did not change. In other brain regions and spinal cord of morphine tolerant rats and their placebo controls, the Bmax and Kd values of [3H]MK 801 did not differ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
