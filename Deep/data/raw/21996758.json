     "AB": "Epidemiological studies have indicated associations between day-to-day particulate air pollution and increased risks of various adverse health outcomes. Although an association between exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) and the development of pulmonary inflammation has been reported, there are limited reports on the neurotoxic effects of DEPs, particularly those of nanoparticle-rich diesel exhaust (NRDE). In this minireview, we highlighted the effects of NRDE which was generated in the National Institute for Environmental Studies, on hippocampus-dependent spatial learning ability and the expression of memory-function-related genes, neurotrophins, and proinflammatory cytokines in a mouse model.",
