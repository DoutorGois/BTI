     "AB": "Angiotensin II binding activity of rat brain particles was examined using [125I]-angiotensin II (0.1-0.3 nM) in the presence and absence of excess unlabelled angiotensin II. Certain features of the binding suggested that physiological receptors were involved. The binding activity was temperature dependent and was increased 3-fold by the addition of 0.5 M EDTA. The binding appeared specific as judged by inhibition with angiotensin II agonists and antagonists. The \"specific\" binding was saturable, two-thirds reversible and occurred with high affinity. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of the \"specific\" binding was 0.9 nM. Subcellular fractionation studies indicated that over 90% of the binding was associated with particulate matter and was concentrated in the crude microsomal fraction. Binding was localized to the midbrain, thalamus, septum, hypothalamus and medulla; Very low levels of binding were found in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum; The lateral septum had the highest binding activity of all the tissues examined. Subdivision of the medulla showed that the highest binding activity was associated with the area postrema and medullary regions ventral to this organ.",
