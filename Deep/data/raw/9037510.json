     "AB": "We examined whether mild brain hypothermia during pretreatment with sublethal 2-min ischemia affected the tolerance to subsequent lethal 5-min ischemia. The neuronal densities in the hippocampal CA1 sector of gerbils preconditioned at mild brain hypothermia (32% of normal) were significantly lower than those in gerbils preconditioned at brain normothermia (70% of normal). 72-kDa heat-shock protein immunoreactivity in the CA1 sector preconditioned at mild hypothermia was reduced. These results suggests that mild brain hypothermia during pretreatment with sublethal ischemia reduces the tolerance to subsequent lethal ischemia.",
