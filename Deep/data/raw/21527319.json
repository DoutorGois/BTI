     "AB": "Deficit in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus frequently occurs during normal aging. Although the protein level and calcium permeability of AMPARs alter with aging, the alteration of AMPARs and their regulatory proteins during aging are far from understanding. Dynamics of GluR2 subunit are dependent on the function of protein interacting with Calpha kinase 1 (PICK1), PKCalpha and calcineurin (CaN). Here, we firstly show that the expression of PICK1 and CaN B decreased significantly in the hippocampus of old rats compared to that of young and adult rats. The decrease was accompanied by a reduction of GluR2 and PKCalpha and an increase in CaN A. Next, we found that in young and adult rats, the distribution of PICK1 and GluR2 diffused in the cytoplasm of hippocampal neurons, but closely around perinuclear in the hippocampal neurons of old rats. These results suggest that the expression of GluR2, PICK1, PKCalpha and CaN B significant decreased in the hippocampus and these alterations may lead to altered distribution of GluR2 and PICK1 during aging.",
