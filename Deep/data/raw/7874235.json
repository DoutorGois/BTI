     "AB": "The ability of the perforant path/dentate granule cell synapse of the hippocampal formation to establish and maintain enhanced levels of synaptic transmission in response to tetanization (long-term potentiation, LTP) was investigated in freely moving rats at 15, 30, and 90 days of age. Measures of 1) the slope of the population excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), and 2) the population spike amplitude (PSA) obtained before, and at several times following tetanization, were used to evaluate the magnitude and duration of LTP as a function of age. Significant enhancement of both EPSP slope and PSA measures was obtained from animals of all three ages in response to perforant path tetanization. The initial degree of enhancement was essentially the same across the age groups, ranging from +27% to +38% of pretetanization levels for EPSP slope measures and +60% to +75% of pretetanization levels for PSA measures, obtained 15 min after tetanization. The duration of this enhancement obtained from animals of the preweaning group was significantly longer than that obtained from either 30- or 90-day-old animals. Enhanced measures of both EPSP slope and PSA decayed to baseline levels in these older animals 18 to 24 h after tetanization, while animals tetanized at 15 days of age maintained potentiated levels of both measures for a period of 5 days following tetanization. Tetanization of 15-day-old animals resulted in a significant reduction in the latency to EPSP onset without affecting the time-based relationships among the other measured parameters, which included latency of the population spike onset, population spike minimum, and population spike offset.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
