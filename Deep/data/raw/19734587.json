     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the application of power spectral entropy (PSE) in epileptic rats induced by penicillin, and to exploreits its value in predicting epileptic seizures. METHODS: Eighteen SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: a normal group, a control group and an epileptic group. Acute chemical models were made using penicillin microinjection in the right hippocampus of rats. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats received continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring by deep department electrode. Changes of PSE of EEG signal in the epileptic group were analysed in the whole seizure process and compared with those in the normal group and the control group. RESULTS: In the whole seizure process of the rats induced by penicillin, PSE began to decline during the pre-ictal period and dropped sharply during the ictal period. PSE in the pre-ictal and ictal period declined apparently comparing with that in the non-ictal period. PSE in the epileptic group had significant differences during the ictal and pre-ictal period compared with that in the normal group and the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Changes of PSE reveal the changes of the complex ictal EEG signals, and may be useful to predict epileptic seizures.",
