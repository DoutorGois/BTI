     "PG": "329-34",
     "AB": "We previously demonstrated that repeated electroconvulsive shock (ECS) treatment enhanced serotonin (5-HT)(1A)- and 5-HT(3)-receptor-mediated responses in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. The electrophysiological studies were performed to elucidate the effects of ECS treatment on depolarization, which was an additional response induced by 5-HT, and the second messenger system involved in this depolarization of hippocampal CA1 neurons. Both application of 5-HT (100 microM) induced depolarization of the membrane potential in the presence of 5-HT(1A)-receptor antagonists. This depolarization was mimicked by 5-HT(4)-receptor agonists, RS 67506 (1-30 microM) and RS 67333 (0.1-30 microM), in a concentration-dependent manner. 5-HT- and RS 67333-induced depolarization was attenuated by concomitant application of RS 39604, a 5-HT(4)-receptor antagonist. H-89, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, inhibited 5-HT-, RS 67506-, and RS 67333-induced depolarizations, while forskolin (10 microM), an activator of adenylate cyclase, induced depolarization. Furthermore, RS 67333-induced depolarization was not significantly different between hippocampal slices prepared from rats administered ECS once a day for 14 days and those from sham-treated rats. These findings suggest that 5-HT(4)-receptor-mediated depolarization is caused via the cAMP-PKA system. In addition, repeated ECS-treatment did not modify 5-HT(4)-receptor functions in contrast to 5-HT(1A)- and 5-HT(3)-receptor functions.",
