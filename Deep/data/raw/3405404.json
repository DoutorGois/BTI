     "AB": "Verbal memory testing was conducted during electrical stimulation of the human hippocampus in 12 epilepsy surgery candidates with unilateral temporal lobe seizure onset. Performance was assessed during baseline, left hippocampal stimulation and right hippocampal stimulation. Verbal intrusion errors were greater during electrical stimulation of the hippocampus contralateral to the seizure focus. These findings suggest that verbal intrusions are related to memory deficits, and that patients with cerebral disease who intrude words from an earlier portion of a learning test are likely to have bilateral cerebral dysfunction.",
