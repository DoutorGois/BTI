     "AB": "At 4 days after the implantation of two subcutaneous 75 mg morphine pellets in the back skin, rats were morphine-dependent. In the three layers studied in the occipital cortex we found that the values of the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist [3H]bromoxidine binding increased with respect to animals implanted with placebo pellets. Typical behavioral and physiological symptoms of the abstinence syndrome appeared 30 minutes after administration of naloxone, [3H]bromoxidine binding values being similar to those obtained in animals implanted with placebo pellets. The pattern of response of the [3H]bromoxidine binding was similar in the hippocampus and the superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus of the mesencephalon, but the differences were not statistically significant in these areas. This paper concludes that exist brain regional differences in the alpha 2-adrenoceptors response under morphine-treatment and possibly under naloxone-induced morphine abstinence syndrome.",
