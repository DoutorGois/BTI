     "AB": "Fibrillogenesis was induced in rats by injection of a fragment of neurotoxic protein, beta-amyloid protein precursor, into the cerebral ventricle. Copper, iron, and zinc concentrations and relative activities of genes of copper-transporting protein and extracellular and intracellular cuproenzymes were evaluated in different brain compartments of these animals. Copper and zinc concentrations decreased significantly in different compartments of the brain of rats with experimental fibrillogenesis, while iron content did not change. According to the data of RT-PCR analysis, activities of genes of copper-transporting protein and extracellular coenzyme decreased. The expression of intracellular cuproenzyme genes and the content of SOD1 protein did not change, SOD1 activity in the cytosol decreased, and active SOD1 was detected in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The relationship between fibrillogenesis and copper metabolism is discussed.",
