     "AB": "The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of senescence on the binding characteristics of muscarinic receptors by using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) and [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) as ligands in young (3 months), middle-age (10 months) and old (24 months) male Fischer 344 rats. Muscarinic receptor density was found to decrease significantly with aging in certain brain regions, depending on the ligand employed. Moreover, the relative proportions of M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes was not significantly altered by aging, except in the aged striatum. Furthermore, the dissociation kinetics of [3H]NMS in the cerebral cortex and their allosteric modulation by gallamine were only slightly influenced by age.",
