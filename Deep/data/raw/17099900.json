     "AB": "Neuropeptide S (NPS) and its receptor (NPSR) constitute a novel neuropeptide system that is involved in regulating arousal and anxiety. The NPS precursor mRNA is highly expressed in a previously undescribed group of neurons located between the locus coeruleus (LC) and Barrington's nucleus. We report here that the majority of NPS-expressing neurons in the LC area and the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus are glutamatergic neurons, whereas many NPS-positive neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus coexpress corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). In addition, we describe a comprehensive map of NPSR mRNA expression in the rat brain. High levels of expression are found in areas involved in olfactory processing, including the anterior olfactory nucleus, the endopiriform nucleus, and the piriform cortex. NPSR mRNA is expressed in several regions mediating anxiety responses, including the amygdaloid complex and the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. NPSR mRNA is also found in multiple key regions of sleep neurocircuitries, such as the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the preoptic region. In addition, NPSR mRNA is strongly expressed in major output and input regions of hippocampus, including the parahippocampal regions, the lateral entorhinal cortex, and the retrosplenial agranular cortex. Multiple hypothalamic nuclei, including the dorsomedial and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and the posterior arcuate nucleus, express high levels of NPSR mRNA, indicating that NPS may regulate energy homeostasis. These data suggest that the NPS system may play a key role in modulating a variety of physiological functions, especially arousal, anxiety, learning and memory, and energy balance.",
