     "AB": "Mints (munc18-interacting proteins) are novel multimodular adapter proteins in membrane transport and organization. Mint1, a neuronal isoform, is involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Its potential effects on development of ischemic damage to neurons have not yet been evaluated. The authors examined changes in mint1 and other synaptic proteins by immunohistochemistry after transient global ischemia in mouse hippocampus. In sham-ischemic mice, immunoreactivity for mint1 was rich in fibers projecting from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and in the mossy fibers linking the granule cells of the dentate gyrus to CA3 pyramidal neurons. Munc18-1, a binding partner of mint1, was distributed uniformly throughout the hippocampus, and synaptophysin 2, a synaptic vesicle protein, was localized mainly in mossy fibers. After transient global ischemia, mint1 immunoreactivity in mossy fibers was dramatically decreased at 1 day of reperfusion but actually showed enhancement at 3 days. However, munc18-1 and synaptophysin 2 were substantially expressed in the same region throughout the reperfusion period. These findings suggest that mint1 participates in neuronal transmission along the excitatory pathway linking the entorhinal cortex to CA3 in the hippocampus. Because mint1 was transiently decreased in the mossy fiber projection after ischemia, functional impairment of neuronal transmission in the projection from the dentate gyrus to CA3 pyramidal neurons might be involved in delayed neuronal death.",
