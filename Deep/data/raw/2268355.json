     "AB": "Hepoxilin A3 was previously shown to display neuromodulatory actions on rat hippocampal CA1 neurons, with hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, an increase in the amplitude and duration of the post-spike train after hyperpolarization and an increase in the inhibitory post synaptic potential. The present report describes new biochemical evidence of a presynaptic action of hepoxilin A3 in rat hippocampal slices prelabeled with [3H]-norepinephrine. Hepoxilin A3 on its own had a marginal effect on the release of label, but blocked release which was induced by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). Prostaglandin E2 also behaved in a similar way. These results demonstrate that hepoxilins modulate neurotransmission in the mammalian CNS through both pre- and postsynaptic actions.",
