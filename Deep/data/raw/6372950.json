Responses were revealed mainly in the inferior colliculus. With whole head sectioning and subsequent gentle freeze-drying, excellent structural preservation was achieved. With the use of double-tritiated deoxyglucose, Ultrofilm 3H and vacuum-contact exposure, a mean spatial resolution of 43 micron Full Width Half Maximum was achieved.",
