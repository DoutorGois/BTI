     "AB": "Freshly dissected fetal basal forebrain tissue rich in cholinergic neurons was either dissociated into a cell suspension and injected into the cholinergically denervated hippocampus of adult rats, or stored in a preservative medium at 4 degrees C. Five days later the stored tissue was dissociated into a cell suspension and injected in the denervated hippocampus in another group of animals. Six weeks later the grafts were evaluated with acetylcholinesterase histochemistry for the assessment of graft survival, graft tissue volume and extent of reinnervation of the denervated hippocampus. All grafts in both the freshly dissociated and the 'stored' group survived. The stored grafts were on the average 1/5 in volume but had an appropriate and extensive laminated reinnervation pattern within the denervated hippocampus. This method of storing cells for extended periods prior to grafting allows for experimental manipulation of fetal tissue as well as long distance transportation prior to intracerebral grafting.",
