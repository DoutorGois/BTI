     "AB": "The effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) on previously induced hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) were examined. Acute experiments were performed on 33 adult, male rabbits. Field potentials in the dentate gyrus were elicited by single shocks to the perforant path, and LTP was induced by tetanic stimulation to the pathway without induction of seizure discharge. At a CBZ serum level of about 5 micrograms/ml (value +/- SD = 5.40 +/- 1.28 micrograms/ml), the previously induced LTP in population spikes (PSs) and population excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) was facilitated. At a CBZ serum level of about 15 micrograms/ml (value +/- SD = 14.28 +/- 1.29 micrograms/ml), the LTP in PS alone was decreased. The effects of carbamazepine on synaptic inhibition were examined by the paired-pulse test. The inhibition was enhanced with induction of LTP. After administration of CBZ, at a CBZ serum level of about 5 micrograms/ml the inhibition was further enhanced, while it was attenuated at a CBZ serum level of about 15 micrograms/ml. These results suggest that CBZ has a facilitative effect on previously induced LTP.",
