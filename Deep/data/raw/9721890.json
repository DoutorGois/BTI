The primary epilepsies account for two thirds of all childhood epilepsies and are presumed to be genetically determined. In the remaining one third of cases, a neuropathologic lesion can be identified. This paper summarizes the etiologies of the symptomatic epilepsies. They are classified according to the pathologic processes; malformative, metabolic, neoplastic and phakomatoses, hypoxic-ischemic, infectious, and of unknown pathologic process.",
