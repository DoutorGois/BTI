     "AB": "Morphological evidence of apoptosis in transient forebrain ischemia is controversial. We therefore investigated the time sequence of apoptosis-related antigens by immunohistochemistry and correlated it with emerging nuclear patterns of cell death in a model of transient forebrain ischemia in CA1 pyramidal cells of the rat hippocampus. The earliest ischemic changes were found on day 2 and 3, reflected by an upregulation of phospho-c-Jun in a proportion of morphologically intact CA1 neurons, which matched the number of neurons that succumbed to ischemia at later time points. At day 3 and later 3 ischemic cell death morphologies became apparent: pyknosis, apoptosis-like cell death and necrosis-like cell death, which were confirmed by electron microscopy. Activated caspase-3 was present in the vast majority of cells with apoptosis-like morphology as well as in a small subset of cells undergoing necrosis; its expression peaked on days 3 to 4. Silver staining for nucleoli, which are a substrate for caspase-3, revealed a profound loss of nucleoli in cells with apoptosis-like morphology, whereas cells with necrosis-like morphology showed intact nucleoli. Overall, cells with apoptosis-like morphology and/or caspase-3 expression represented a minor fraction (<10%) of ischemic neurons, while the vast majority followed a necrosis-like pathway. Our studies suggest that CA1 pyramidal cell death following transient forebrain ischemia may be initiated through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway activation, which then either follows an apoptosis-like cell death pathway or leads to secondary necrosis.",
