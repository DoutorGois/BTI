     "AB": "Calcium is an important second messenger which plays a role in the regulation of neuronal excitability and in many forms of synaptic plasticity. In kindling epileptogenesis, a model of focal epilepsy, calcium plays an important role. The in situ patch-clamp technique was used to record calcium currents in slices obtained from kindled rats and controls. We found that low-voltage-activated calcium currents, probably of dendritic origin, were larger after kindling (80%). The transient high-voltage-activated calcium currents were also enhanced after kindling (50% higher). The increase of the current is accompanied by a decrease in the time constant of inactivation. The change was still present six weeks after the kindling stimulations were stopped. These data demonstrate that low-voltage-activated calcium currents are involved in epileptogenesis. Their enhancement in the dendrites will boost synaptic depolarization and result in enhanced calcium influx, which is critically dependent on the specific activation pattern.",
