     "AB": "Mental health disorders(MHD) in chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) have been widely studied. However, the underlying role of inflammatory cytokines and their associated signaling pathways have not been investigated. Here, we report the potential role of cytokines and associated signaling pathways in CP/CPPS patients with MHD and in a CP/CPPS animal model. CP/CPPS patients (n = 810) and control subjects (n = 992) were enrolled in this case-control multicenter study, and serum cytokine levels were measured. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received multiple intracutaneous injections of an immuno-agent along with a pertussis-diphtheria-tetanus triple vaccine for autoimmune CP/CPPS development. The results revealed that, in CP/CPPS patients with significant MHD, elevated IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-13, and TNF-alpha serum levels were observed. The above five cytokines in CP/CPPS rats were significantly elevated in prostate tissue (p < 0.05), and IL-1beta levels were elevated in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. In behavioral tests, CP/CPPS rats showed anxiety- and depression-like symptoms, and impaired spatial and associative memory performance (p < 0.05). In the CP/CPPS group, ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels were increased in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens, and decreased in the hippocampus, but not caudate nucleus. Thus, prostate-derived cytokines, especially IL-1beta, cross the blood brain barrier and may lead to enhanced ERK1/2 signaling in several brain areas, possibly underlying induction of CP/CPPS-related MHD.",
