     "AB": "Electrophysiological properties of intracellularly recorded CA1 pyramidal cells from normal and staggerer mice were compared by using hippocampal slices maintained in vitro. In staggerer mice, the passive membrane properties of these neurons as well as their synaptic potentials elicited by stratum radiatum stimulation were very similar to those observed in normal mice. In control and mutant mice and in standard Krebs solution, CA1 pyramidal cells mainly fired tetrodoxin (TTX)-sensitive fast spikes but could also generate slow spikes. In both groups, replacement of calcium (Ca) by barium (Ba) or introduction of TEA in the bathing medium prolonged the repolarization of the fast spikes and suppressed the brief spike afterhyperpolarization which normally followed them, thus suggesting that both events involve fast potassium conductances. Furthermore, in both groups of animals, TEA and Ba enhanced the slow spikes and induced the appearance of prolonged depolarizations. These slow events were TTX-resistant and were abolished by the Ca channel blockers cadmium or cobalt, thus suggesting that they are Ca-dependent. On the whole, the present results indicate that the staggerer mutation which yields marked abnormalities in the bioelectrical properties of cerebellar Purkinje cells has no such effect on CA1 pyramidal cells.",
