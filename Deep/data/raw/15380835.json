     "AB": "Adolescent rats and humans exhibit physiological, behavioral, and cognitive differences compared to their adult counterparts. These differences are apparent also in reactions to psychoactive drugs, such as ethanol. Recent studies have shown that though less sensitive to several behavioral indices of intoxication by ethanol, adolescent rats are more sensitive to the cognition-impairing effects of ethanol. Ethanol's effects, in the present experiment, were assessed in terms of a fear conditioning test not previously used in comparison of adult and adolescent Sprague-Dawley albino rats. Separate groups of both ages were given intraperitoneal (i.p.) ethanol before or after tone-shock conditioning. This task features a hippocampus-independent component, learned freezing to a tone, and a hippocampus-dependent component, learned freezing to context. Post-training ethanol had no effect on retention in either age, but pre-acquisition ethanol impaired adult learning more than adolescent learning, as indexed by the expression of fear at the test. Blood alcohol was equivalent in adolescents and adults at a dose that produced cognitive discrepancies. Unlike other reports, these experiments demonstrate that adolescents may not be more sensitive to ethanol's effects in all cases of learning.",
