     "AB": "In this work, we studied a novel chimeric peptide, M242, galanin(1-13)-[D-Trp(32)]-neuropeptide Y(25-36)amide, and examined its properties in comparison with its parent peptide, M32, galanin(1-13)-neuropeptide Y(25-36)amide, a previously known high-affinity ligand for galanin receptors, and galanin itself. Binding assays performed in Bowes cells known to express human galanin receptor type 1 (hGalR1) and in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human galanin receptor type 2 (hGalR2) revealed that all three ligands had comparable affinities: at hGalR1<1 nM and at hGalR2<10 nM. However, in rat hippocampal membranes M242 had a 24-fold lower affinity than galanin (9.4 vs. 0.4 nM) and 134-fold lower affinity than M32 (9.4 vs. 0.07 nM). In the same tissue, we also examined the effects of these peptides on adenylate cyclase activity. M32 showed a weak antagonistic behaviour but M242 acted as a potent biphasic regulator of adenylate cyclase. In conclusion, we present and characterise a new peptide M242, which could be a useful tool in studies of galaninergic signalling.",
