     "AB": "Activation of cyclic AMP dependent kinase is believed to mediate slow onset, long-term potentiation (LTP) in central neurons. Cyclic-AMP activates a cascade of molecular events leading to phosphorylation of the nuclear cAMP responsive element binding protein (pCREB). Whereas a variety of stimuli lead to activation of CREB, the molecular processes downstream of CREB, which may be relevant to neuronal plasticity, are yet largely unknown. We have recently found that following exposure to estradiol, pCREB mediates the large increase in dendritic spine density in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We now extend these observations to include other stimuli, such as bicuculline, that cause the formation of new dendritic spines. Such stimuli share with estradiol the same mechanism of action in that both require activity-dependent CREB phosphorylation. Our observations suggest that CREB phosphorylation is a necessary, but perhaps not sufficient, step in the process leading to the generation of new dendritic spines and perhaps to functional plasticity as well.",
