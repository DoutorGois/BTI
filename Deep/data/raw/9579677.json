     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a popular model of the synaptic plasticity which may be engaged by the biological processes underlying learning and memory. Most available studies of LTP have concentrated on the analysis of LTP occurring in 'early' components of the hippocampal circuit (for example, dentate gyrus and area CA1). We examine here, for the first time, LTP as it occurs in the massive, unidirectional projection from CA1 to the subiculum in vivo. We show that this projection sustains high-frequency stimulus-induced LTP (10 trains of 20 stimuli at 200 Hz; intertrain interval 2 s; LTP 181 +/- 9% at 30 min post-LTP induction). In addition, input-output (I/O) curves show a leftward shift for all stimulation values.",
