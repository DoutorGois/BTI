     "AB": "Chromatin modifying enzymes DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), histone deacetylase (HDAC) 2 and CREB binding protein (CBP) play a crucial role in memory, particularly during consolidation process which declines with advancing age. However, the expression of these enzymes and their effect on memory consolidation during aging are not clearly understood. In the present study, novel object recognition test was used to assess the memory consolidation followed by expression analysis of DNMTs, HDAC2 and CBP in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of young, adult and old male mice. Object recognition memory was reduced in old as compared to young and adult. DNMT1 protein expression was high in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of young male mice, but declined gradually with age. On the other hand, HDAC2 mRNA and protein expression increased in the hippocampus of old male mice as compared to young and adult. Alteration in the expression of these enzymes is correlated with reduced recognition memory in old.",
