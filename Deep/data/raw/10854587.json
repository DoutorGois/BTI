     "AB": "We investigated the effects of acidosis on the hypoxic neuronal damage using gerbil hippocampal slices. Acidosis has delayed the onset of harmful hypoxic depolarization, resulting in a decrease in the total hypoxic period and the hypoxic depolarization. This effect has been considered to be protective. However, the synaptic recovery after reoxygenation was attenuated when acidosis (pH: 6.2-6.9) was sustained. Conversely, the synaptic recovery was potentiated when the acidosis was restored to the physiological milieu during the reoxygenation period. These results suggest that acidosis plays a protective effect against the hypoxic neuronal damage only when rapid appreciable pH recovery is achieved during reoxygenation.",
