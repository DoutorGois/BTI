     "AB": "The behavioural effects of tetanus toxin, injected into the rostral hippocampus, have been studied in rats. A single dose (1000 mouse minimum lethal doses; n = 10) of the toxin produced tail rigidity, hunched back and sound- and touch-evoked stimuli, 48 hr after the injection in all rats treated and these culminated in generalized convulsions 5-7 days later. Seizures were also observed 4 days after the injection of 2000 MLDs (n = 10), whereas a dose of 500 MLDs (n = 10) was ineffective. Similarly, dose- and time-dependent lethal effects were observed. In comparison to the contralateral (untreated) hippocampus, tetanus toxin (1000 MLDs; n = 3) produced a statistically significantly reduction in the number of cells in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of the injected side, 7 and 10 days after the injection. No changes were observed in other sectors (CA2 and CA3 areas) of the hippocampus. In conclusion, the present experiments have shown that the focal injection of tetanus toxin into the hippocampus produced dose- and time-dependent behavioural stimulation and lethal effects in rats.",
