     "AB": "In order to substantiate the hypothesis of a cholinergic matrix for neuritic plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the relationship between the loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and formation of neuritic plaques in the cerebral cortex was studied in 5 cases of neuropathologically verified AD. Quantitative evaluation of the number of neuritic plaques in the cerebral cortex as calculated from 6 areas showed a strong correlation with the loss of neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM). This finding indicates that changes in cortical cholinergic innervation which arise from the neurons of the NbM are an important feature in the pathogenesis of neuritic plaques.",
