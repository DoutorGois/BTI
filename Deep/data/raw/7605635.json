     "AB": "Granule cells in the guinea pig dentate gyrus release kappa opioid neuropeptides, dynorphins, from dendrites as well as from axon terminals. We have found that both L- and N-type calcium channel antagonists inhibited dendritic dynorphin release. In contrast, N-type but not L-type calcium channel antagonists inhibited axonal dynorphin release. Neither L- nor N-type channel antagonists directly altered the effects of kappa opioid receptor activation. By inhibiting dynorphin release, L-type channel antagonists also facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation of the perforant path-granule cell synapse. These studies establish that a single cell type can release a transmitter from two different cellular domains and provide new distinction between axonal and dendritic transmitter release mechanisms.",
