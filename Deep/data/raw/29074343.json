     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Sevoflurane has been shown to stimulate or depress memory in adult rats; however, the cellular mechanism of this bidirectional effect has not been fully investigated. METHODS: We used an intra-hippocampal microinfusion of U0126 to suppress ERK activation. Male SD rats were randomly assigned to four groups: Sham, 0.11%SEV, 0.3%SEV and 0.3%+U0126. They received bilateral injections of U0126 or saline. Rats were anesthetized, and Inhibitory Avoidance (IA) training was performed immediately after anesthesia. The memory retention latency was observed 24h later. In another experiment, the hippocampus was removed 45min after IA training to assess ARC expression, the synapsin 1 protein levels and the phosphorylation level of ERK. RESULTS: Treatment with 0.11%SEV led to rapid phosphorylation of ERK, while 0.3%SEV inhibited phosphorylation; the latter change was reversed by the microinfusion of U0126 in the hippocampus. The memory latency result had similar tendencies. The local infusion of U0126 abolished the 0.3%SEV-induced memory impairment and ERK inhibition. Selective upregulations of ARC and synapsin 1 proteins were observed in the 0.3%SEV group compared with the 0.11%SEV group. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that different doses of sevoflurane trigger synaptic plasticity-related cytoskeleton proteins through the ERK signaling pathway. This novel modulation by inhalational agents may help to reduce their side-effects on memory function.",
