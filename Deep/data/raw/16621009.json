     "AB": "Two-vessel occlusion, a frequently used model of global cerebral ischemia in rats, results in a dysfunction predominantly within the CA1 field of the hippocampus; it induces many processes with different time-scales. However, the great divergence in the results of the studies reported in the literature suggests valuable differences in response to hypoperfusion-induced ischemia among the laboratory rats used in these studies. In the present work, the acute effects of two-carotid occlusion-induced global ischemia (2VO) on the CA3 stimulation-evoked population spike activity in the CA1 region of Wistar rats from different suppliers (Charles-River and Harlan) were compared. In the acute electrophysiological experiments, the hippocampal CA1 responses revealed that the Charles-River rats immediately compensated the 2VO much better than did the Harlan rats. However, 3 days later, no difference could be observed between the CA1 activities of these rats. The presented data show that the Wistar rats from different vendors represent an important source of variability in the results of acute experiments on the hippocampal ischemia. These observations draw attention to the importance of the careful choice of the laboratory rats (both strains and breeds) used in such experiments.",
