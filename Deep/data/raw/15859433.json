     "AB": "In order to probe into the biological effects of mercury in typical mercury contaminated area and try to apply the expression of immediately early gene c-fos in brain to early predict the neurotoxicity of mercury in typical polluted areas, the expression of c-FOS protein in rat hippocampus is observed using immunocytochemical methods. The results show the mercury pollutes rice induced significantly the expression of c-FOS protein in hippccampus;the antagonisis between selenium and mercury on the exposure process. It is suggested that c-fos can be used as an effective index of detecting and assessing neurotoxicology of mercury polluted areas.",
