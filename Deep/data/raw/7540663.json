     "AB": "The effects of a novel prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) inhibitor, (S)-2-[[(S)-2-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl]carbonyl]-N-(phenylmethyl) - 1-pyrrolidinecarboxamide (JTP-4819), on the PEP activity in the brain and on the contents of substance P (SP)- and arginine-vasopressin (AVP)-like immunoreactivity (LI) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of young and aged rats were investigated using enzyme immunoassay. JTP-4819 exhibited a concentration-dependent in vitro inhibitory action on PEP activity in the brains of both young and aged rats, with IC50 values of approximately 0.7 and 0.8 nM, respectively. A single dose of JTP-4819 (3 mg/kg, p.o.) increased the SPLI content in the cerebral cortex but not the hippocampus of aged rats (23-24 months old). In addition, repeated administration of JTP-4819 (1 mg/kg, p.o., for 21 days) increased the SPLI content in the cerebral cortex and restored the SPLI content in the hippocampus, which had decreased with aging. In contrast, single (1 mg/kg, p.o.) and repeated (1 mg/kg, p.o., for 21 days) administration of JTP-4819 only tended to increase the AVPLI content of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex in aged rats, respectively. These results indicate that JTP-4819 increases the cerebral and hippocampal SPLI content in aged rats by inhibiting the action of PEP.",
