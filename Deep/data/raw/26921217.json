     "AB": "BACKGROUND: During the brain growth spurt, anesthetic drugs can cause cellular and behavioral changes in the developing brain. The aim of this study was to determine the neuroprotective effect of erythropoietin after isoflurane anesthesia in rat pups. METHODS: A total of 42, 7-day-old Wistar rats were divided into three groups. Control group (GC; n = 14): Rats breathed 100% oxygen for 6 h; Isoflurane group (GI; n = 14): Rats were exposed to 1.5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen for 6 h; Isoflurane + erythropoietin group (GIE; n = 14): 1000 IU.kg(-1) (intraperitoneal; IP) Erythropoietin was administered after isoflurane anesthesia. Each group was divided into two groups for pathology and learning and memory tests. Silver, caspase-3, and fluoro-jade C staining were used for detecting apoptotic cells in frontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, and amygdala. Morris water maze was used to evaluate learning and memory. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in apoptotic cell count after isoflurane anesthesia in the frontal cortex when compared with control group (29.0 +/- 9.27 vs 3.28 +/- 0.75 [P = 0.002], 20.85 +/- 10.94 vs 2.0 +/- 0.81 [P = 0.002] and 24.57 +/- 10.4 vs 5.14 +/- 0.69 [P = 0.024] with silver, caspase-3, and fluoro-jade C staining, respectively). The apoptotic cell count in the frontal cortex was significantly higher in GIE than GC with caspase-3 staining (9.14 +/- 3.13 vs 2.0 +/- 0.81, P = 0.002). The apoptotic cell count in GIE was significantly reduced in the frontal cortex when compared with GI (4.0 +/- 0.81 vs 29.0 +/- 9.27 [P = 0.002], 9.14 +/- 3.13 vs 20.85 +/- 10.94 [P = 0.04] and 4.0 +/- 1.63 vs 24.57 +/- 10.4 [P = 0.012] with silver, caspase-3, and fluoro-jade C staining, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A total of 1000 IU.kg(-1) IP erythropoietin diminished isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis. Further experimental studies have to be planned to reveal the optimal dose and timing of erythropoietin before adaptation to clinical practice.",
