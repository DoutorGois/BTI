     "AB": "Pyrethroid insecticide modulation of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) is proposed to underlie their effects on neuronal excitability. However, some in vitro evidence indicates that target sites other than VGSCs could contribute to pyrethroid disruption of neuronal activity. VGSC-independent, pyrethroid-induced changes in neurotransmitter release were examined to investigate the possibility that target sites other than VGSCs contribute to pyrethroid effects. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings, deltamethrin and permethrin effects on glutamate-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) from pyramidal neurons in mixed hippocampal cultures were examined. In the presence of the VGSC antagonist tetrodotoxin, the type I pyrethroid permethrin (10 microM) increased the average frequency of mEPSCs from a basal level of 1.0+/-0.4 to 3.5+/-0.6 Hz, with peak frequency of 9.9+/-1.5 Hz (n=6). Permethrin did not affect the distribution of current amplitudes, indicating that permethrin increased the probability of glutamate release at the presynaptic terminal without effects on postsynaptic responses. Removal of calcium from the extracellular solution following the induction of the permethrin-mediated effect decreased mEPSC frequency (6.8+/-1.8 Hz, n=3) to near control levels (1.9+/-0.8 Hz for control versus 2.5+/-0.6 Hz for permethrin minus Ca(2+), respectively). However, the N- and P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel antagonist omega-conotoxin MVIIC had no effect on the permethrin-dependent increase in mEPSC frequency. In contrast to permethrin, the type II pyrethroid deltamethrin (10 microM) failed to affect mEPSC frequency. These results indicate that permethrin causes a calcium-dependent increase in glutamate release from hippocampal neurons that is independent of effects on voltage-gated sodium or N- or P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels. The data indicate that permethrin increases mEPSC frequency via an alteration in intracellular calcium dynamics at the presynaptic terminal.",
