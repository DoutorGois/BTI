     "AB": "Effect of 3-sulfamoylmethyl-1,2-benzisoxazole (AD-810) on kindled seizures in the neocortex, hippocampus and amygdala was studied in comparison with that of clinically proved antiepileptics, and the differences in kindled seizure development in the three areas were also studied. The amygdala more rapidly developed a generalized seizure (kindled seizure) than the hippocampus and the neocortex. Although more days of stimulation were needed, the neocortex also developed a kindled seizure similar to limbic kindled seizures. Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, dipropylacetate and diazepam showed a depressant effect on the neocortical kindled seizures. Phenytoin showed a depressant effect only when it was administered intravenously. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine depressed the hippocampal kindled seizures, while phenytoin and diazepam had little effect. Phenobarbital and diazepam caused marked depression on the amygdaloid kindled seizures, but the effect of phenytoin, carbamazepine and dipropylacetate on them was weak or negligible. AD-810 showed a depressant effect on neocortical and hippocampal kindled seizures, but not on amygdaloid ones. The profile of AD-810 is similar to that seen with carbamazepine.",
