     "AB": "The effects of angiotensin II (ANG II) microinjected unilaterally (left or right) and bilaterally (left and right) at a dose of 0.5 microg (0.5 nmol) into the CA1 hippocampal area of male Sprague Dowley rats on learning and memory (shuttle box) were studied. Bilateral microinjections of ANG II improved learning, i.e. increased the number of avoidances during the two training days as compared to the respective controls microinjected with saline. ANG II facilitated learning and memory, especially when microinjected into the left CA1 hippocampal area as compared to the respective controls microinjected with saline. Left-side microinjection of ANG II increased the number of avoidances on the first and second training day as compared to the right-side microinjection of ANG II. These findings suggest asymmetric effects of ANG II on cognitive processes in hippocampus.",
