There were five assumptions involved; (a) that the very large population of neurons in the brain could be effectively sampled in a limited set of experiments; (b) that a middle kind of electrodes could direct themselves to a sufficiently stable single unit population to permit extended conditioning experiments: (c) that averaging could be used to eliminate the effects of all unwanted variables that were not correlated with the main auditory signals: (d) that latency mapping would permit the tracing of a signal even through the multiple-channeled pathways of the brain (and would help us to identify switching points; (e) that a middle kind of conditioning (not Pavlovian entirely nor Slinner experiment with the clear CS of a Pavlovian one...",
