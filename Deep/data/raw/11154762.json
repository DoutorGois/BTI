     "AB": "UNLABELLED: Evidence from cell culture and animal experiments suggests a neuroprotective and neurotrophic function of erythropoietin (EPO). We have quantitated the distribution of EPO mRNA expression in the developing human central nervous system (CNS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Up to seven biopsies from different areas of the CNS of four preterm fetuses (gestational age 23-37 weeks) were obtained at routine postmortem examinations. EPO mRNA was quantitated by competitive PCR in samples from the CNS, the kidneys, and the liver where the EPO gene is predominantly expressed at this gestational age. RESULTS: EPO mRNA was most abundant in one sample from the cerebellum (0.29 amol/microg total RNA [amol=10(-18)mol]) and two from the pituitary gland (0.23 amol/microg total RNA), but levels varied considerably. EPO mRNA in the cortex cerebri (median 0.12 amol/microg total RNA; n=4) dominated over the expression in the corpora amygdala (median 0.05 amol/microg total RNA; n=4), the hippocampus (median 0.03 amol/microg total RNA; n=4), or the basal ganglia (median 0.01 amol/microg total RNA; n=3). Only little EPO mRNA (<0.01 and 0.06 amol/microg total RNA) was found in the spinal cord. EPO mRNA levels in the cerebellum, pituitary gland, or the cerebral cortex were within the same range as in the liver (0.03-1.67 amol/microg total RNA; n=4), or the kidneys (0.06-0.79 amol/microg total RNA; n=4). CONCLUSION: We found the EPO gene expressed throughout the fetal human CNS. Our data provide the basis to discuss a function for EPO in the brain of humans as well.",
