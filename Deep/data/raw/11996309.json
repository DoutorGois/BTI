     "PG": "232-40",
     "AB": "Rats with neurotoxic lesions of the perirhinal cortex (n = 9) were compared with sham controls (n = 14) on a working memory task in the radial arm maze. Rats were trained under varying levels of proactive interference and with different retention intervals. Finally, performance was assessed when the maze was switched to a novel room. None of these manipulations differentially impaired rats with perirhinal lesions. Rats were next trained on delayed matching-to-place in the water maze. Even with retention delays of 30 min, there was no evidence of a deficit. Although interactions between the perirhinal cortex and hippocampus may be important for integrating object-place information, the perirhinal cortex is often not necessary for tasks that selectively tax allocentric spatial memory.",
