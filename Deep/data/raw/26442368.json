     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the expression of discs large homolog 4 (DLG4) protein in hippocampus, amygdala and frontal cortex of rats and evaluate postsynaptic density in heroin dependence. METHODS: The rat heroin dependent model was established by increasing intraperitoneal injection of heroin. DLG4 proteins in hippocampus, amygdala and frontal cortex of heroin dependent 9, 18, 36 days rats were detected with immunohistochemical staining and compared with that in the control group. RESULTS: DLG4 proteins in hippocampus, amygdala and frontal cortex were gradually reduced with extension of heroin dependent time. CONCLUSION: Heroin dependence can affect postsynaptic density of hippocampus, amygdala and frontal cortex. The changes become more apparent with extension of heroin dependence time.",
