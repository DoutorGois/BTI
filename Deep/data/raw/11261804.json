     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Our autopsy studies show possible links between classical Alzheimer pathology and decreased expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. For further elucidation we are now using in vitro models. We report preliminary evidence for the impact of beta-amyloid on nicotinic receptor expression in hippocampal dissociation culture. METHODS: Cultures (E18 rats) were grown in a serum-free medium and incubated at 8 days in vitro for 3 days with 1 microM Abeta1-42. Expression of alpha4, alpha7, and beta2 nicotinic receptor subunit protein was assessed immunohistochemically and rated semiquantitatively. RESULTS: Abeta1-42 incubation resulted in a massive reduction of alpha4 protein-expressing neurons, this effect was less pronounced for the alpha7 and beta2 subunit protein. CONCLUSION: These findings provide first evidence for a direct impact of classical Alzheimer pathology features on nicotinic receptor expression in vitro. Our model will be useful for testing the potential of drugs to stop or reverse these effects.",
