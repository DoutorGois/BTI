     "AB": "Combining immunocytochemistry with in situ hybridization of Alzheimer disease (AD) hippocampus demonstrated a 50% reduction in grain density for synaptophysin message over CA1 pyramidal neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) relative to near neighbor NFT-free neurons. This decrease was not global, but was selective since message grain density for the lysosomal protein, cathepsin D, increased 33% in these neurons (relative to NFT-free neurons). Poly A+ message grain density decreased by 25% in NFT neurons. Percent of the cell body containing NFT correlated -0.35 (p < 0.0001) with grain density for synaptophysin message. These data verify the concept of altered profiles of gene expression as a function of disease state within single cells and suggest that events associated with NFT formation may lead to altered expression of synaptic messages.",
