     "AB": "Transient global cerebral ischemia results in selective neuronal death in the vulnerable hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in a delayed manner. Hyperglycemia accelerates and exacerbates neuronal damage in this region. The object of this study was to determine whether hyperglycemia-enhanced damage is associated with increased production of superoxide anion after ischemia. The results showed that hyperglycemic ischemia caused a significant increase of superoxide production in the hippocampal CA1 neurons compared to normoglycemic animals after 18 h of recirculation, suggesting that enhanced superoxide anion production may mediate the hyperglycemia-accelerated and -enhanced neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 area after ischemia and reperfusion.",
