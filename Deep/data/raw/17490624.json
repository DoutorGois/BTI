     "AB": "Diabetes-associated depression may occur due to changes in the quality of life imposed by treatment, or may be a consequence of the biochemical changes accompanying the disease. We evaluated the oxidative stress from diabetic animals submitted to an experimental model of depression and the effects of clonazepam. Male Wistar rats were induced to diabetes with streptozotocin and submitted to forced swimming test. Clonazepam was administered 24, 5 and 1 h before test. The animals were sacrificed by decapitation, and plasma and erythrocytes were separated, as well as hippocampus, cortex and striatum. Reactive species of thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) and total antioxidant reactivity (TAR) as well as antioxidant enzyme activities catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were evaluated. Results showed a significant increase of TBARS and a significant decrease of TAR in plasma from diabetic animals, which was altered by clonazepam. There were no effects of CAT and SOD activities in erythrocytes from tested animals. The results observed in hippocampus showed a significant increase of TBARS from diabetic rats, altered by clonazepam, and no one alteration was verified in TAR. The significant increase of TBARS and the significant decrease of TAR in cortex from diabetic rats were not altered by clonazepam administration. There were no alterations of TBARS and TAR in striatum from tested animals. Besides, clonazepam reverses the immobility in diabetic rats. Considering the action of clonazepam, it is suggested that it could be an alternative therapeutic for depression to diabetic patients, once it could give a protection against free radicals.",
