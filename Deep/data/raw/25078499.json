     "AB": "In this review, we summarize findings obtained in acute and chronic epilepsy models and in particular experiments that have revealed how neuronal networks in the limbic system-which is closely involved in the pathophysiogenesis of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE)-produce hypersynchronous discharges. MTLE is often associated with a typical pattern of brain damage known as mesial temporal sclerosis, and it is one of the most refractory forms of partial epilepsy in adults. Specifically, we will address the cellular and pharmacological features of abnormal electrographic events that, as in MTLE patients, can occur in in vivo and in vitro animal models; these include interictal and ictal discharges along with high-frequency oscillations. In addition, we will consider how different limbic structures made hyperexcitable by acute pharmacological manipulations interact during epileptiform discharge generation. We will also review the electrographic characteristics of two types of seizure onsets that are most commonly seen in human and experimental MTLE as well as in in vitro models of epileptiform synchronization. Finally, we will address the role played by neurosteroids in reducing epileptiform synchronization and in modulating epileptogenesis.",
