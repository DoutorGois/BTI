     "PG": "43-6",
     "AB": "Hippocampal alpha4betadelta GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)-R) are increased following progesterone withdrawal (PWD) in a rodent model of premenstrual anxiety. This alpha4betadelta receptor isoform uniquely responds to the GABA agonist gaboxadol (THIP) with a maximum current greater than that gated by GABA, and is potentiated more by pentobarbital than are other GABA(A)-R. We therefore investigated the anxiolytic effects of these drugs using the elevated plus maze. Gaboxadol (1.25 mg/kg) was markedly more anxiolytic in animals undergoing PWD than in controls. Pentobarbital (10 mg/kg) also produced a greater anxiolytic effect during PWD. These results suggest that the pharmacological properties of alpha4betadelta GABA(A)-R following PWD are evident behaviorally. Alterations in the alpha4betadelta GABA(A)-R population may have implications for the etiology and treatment of premenstrual syndrome.",
