     "AB": "Repeated positive fighting experience in daily agonistic interactions is accompanied by changes of brain neurotransmitter activity and genes' expression in male mice. This paper is focused on the analysis of ribosomal genes expression data as revealed by whole-transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq) in five brain regions of male mice with long repeated experience of aggression accompanied by wins (winners). Downregulation of most Rps, Rpl, Mrps, and Mrpl genes was found in the midbrain raphe nuclei and striatum and upregulation-in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of the winners. There were no changes in ribosomal gene expression in the ventral tegmental area. The data allow considering the alteration in ribosomal gene expression as an animal model of ribosomal dysfunction developed under positive fighting experience in male mice.",
