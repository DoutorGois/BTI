     "PG": "562-71",
     "AB": "Five somatostatin receptors (sst) have been cloned and mRNAs for the first four (sst1-4) are expressed in many brain regions. In the present work, we compared the distribution of the non-selective ligand [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 by autoradiography in 24 brain regions and pituitary in wild type, sst1- to sst4- or SRIF-gene invalidated (KO) mice. [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding was not significantly modified in sst1 KO mouse brain with the noticeable exception of the substantia nigra and only moderately decreased in pituitary. For sst2 KO mice, a general decrease (>75%) was observed in most regions, with the noticeable exception of the olfactory bulb and CA1 field of the hippocampus. SST3 KO brain displayed a decrease in binding in the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb only (-54%). For sst4 KO mice, [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding levels in the external plexiform (-35%) and glomerular (-39%) layers of the olfactory bulb as well as the hippocampus CA1 field (-68%) were significantly decreased. In SRIF KO mice, a significant increase in binding levels was observed in olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, frontal cortex upper layers, lateral septum, CA1 field, zona incerta and lateral hypothalamus, substantia nigra, periaqueductal grey and parabrachial nucleus. Competition with selective ligands (CH275, octreotide or L-779,976, L-796,778, L-803,087, and octreotide or L-817,778, for sst1-5 receptors, respectively) was in accordance with these findings. Moreover, octreotide was still able to compete on residual [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding sites in sst2 KO pituitary. It is concluded that most [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding sites in mouse brain and pituitary belong to the sst2 subtype but for the olfactory bulb (sst3 and sst4 receptors), the CA1 of the hippocampus (sst4 receptors) and the pituitary (sst5 and sst1 receptors) in which other subtypes are also expressed. The overall increase in [125I]-Tyr0-DTrp8-SRIF14 binding in SRIF KO mice indicates that SRIF receptors, mostly from the sst2 subtype, are regulated by the endogenous ligand(s).",
