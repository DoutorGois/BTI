     "AB": "Multiple neurodegenerative disorders with tau pathology are characterised by the loss of memory and cognitive decline that can be associated with other symptoms including olfactory alterations that are often regarded as an early symptom of the diseases. Here, we have investigated whether olfactory dysfunction is present in the P301S human tau transgenic mice and if it is associated to tau pathology. Progressive tauopathy and neurodegeneration were noticeable in the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex at early age in the P301S human tau transgenic mice and olfactory sensitivity for social or non-social odours was significantly impaired at 3 months of age, when the piriform cortex-dependent odour-cross habituation was also disrupted. The olfactory alterations in the P301S tau transgenic mouse line provide an in vivo system where to test the mechanism-based therapies for the common and yet untreatable tauopathies.",
