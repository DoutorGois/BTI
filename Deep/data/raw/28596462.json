     "AB": "Pure amnesia (amnesic syndrome) is an organic brain syndrome characterized by impairment in episodic memory, with either an anterograde or sometimes retrograde loss of memories. Although episodic memory is impaired, semantic memory, immediate memory, and procedural memory are preserved. The Papez circuit is a network of nerve fibers and nerve centers that starts and ends in the hippocampus travelling by way of the fornix, mammillary bodies, anterior thalamic nuclei, cingulate gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus. A lesion restricted to this circuit often produces pure amnesia. Regions concerned with the Yakovlev circuit also have an important role in memory. Clinical cases of pure amnesia caused by cerebrovascular disease presented following brain imaging and resulted from various different lesions. The cases identified were predominantly thalamic amnesia and hippocampal amnesia. Thalamic amnesia often resulted from an infarction in the territory of the thalamotuberal artery and paramedian thalamic artery although thalamic hemorrhage in medial portion of thalamus also produced pure amnesia. Hippocampal amnesia usually occurred following an infarction in the temporal branches of posterior cerebral artery. Cases of retrosplenial amnesia caused by subcortical hematoma and infarction in the retrosplenial region are also described. In addition, cases of pure amnesia resulting from an infarction in the fornix, mammillary body hemorrhage, and caudate hemorrhage are also shown.",
