     "AB": "The effect of lead exposure on intracellular calcium levels, membrane fluidity, lipid peroxidation, acetylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase activity and its accumulation in different regions of the brain were studied to understand the molecular mechanism of lead induced neurotoxicity. Lead treatment (20 mg/kg lead nitrate, intraperitoneally, once daily for 15 days) resulted in a significant accumulation of lead in all brain regions with the maximum being in the hippocampus. Levels of glutathione, lipid peroxidation, intracellular calcium and membrane fluidity, as well as the activity of the membrane bound enzymes, acetylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase, increased to a significant level in certain areas of the rat brain. The results suggest that lead exerts neurotoxic effects by altering certain membrane bound enzymes and may cause oxidative stress.",
