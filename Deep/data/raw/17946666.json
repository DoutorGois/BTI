     "AB": "Learning and memory rely on the strict regulation of communication between neurons in the hippocampus. The mossy fiber (MF) pathway connects the dentate gyrus to the auto-associative CA3 network, and the information it carries is controlled by a feedforward circuit combining disynaptic inhibition with monosynaptic excitation. Analysis of the MF associated circuit using a mapped clock oscillator (MCO) model reveals the circuit to be a highpass filter.",
