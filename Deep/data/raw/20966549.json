     "AB": "The role of amyloid-beta (Abeta in the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease remains controversial, to a large extent because of the lack of robust neurodegeneration in mouse models of AD. To address this question, we examined the effects of Abeta antibodies in the recently described monoaminergic (MAergic) axonal degeneration in AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice. To determine if Abeta accumulation is directly involved in degeneration of MAergic axons, we examined the effects of passive anti-Abeta antibody (7B6) administration on Abeta pathology and MAergic degeneration in AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Injections of monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7B6 into mice (6 to 9 months of age) resulted in a modest reduction of Abeta load in the brains of AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice. In addition, 7B6 treated AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice had significantly higher densities of MAergic axons in both cortex and in hippocampus as compared to untreated mutant mice. For example, 7B6 treated mice showed almost 2-fold greater densities of serotonergic (5-HT) axons in the cortex compared to saline treated mice. Similar findings were observed in the catecholaminergic (TH) axons. Our results demonstrate that lowering of Abeta levels via passive Abeta immunotherapy ameliorates ongoing degenerative processes, supporting a causal link between Abeta and neurodegeneration.",
