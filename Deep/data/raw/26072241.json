     "AB": "It has become clear that the hippocampus plays a critical role in the identification of new contexts and for the detection of changes in familiar contexts. The hippocampus accomplishes these goals through a continual process of comparing predicted features of a context or situation to those actually experienced. A mismatch between expected and experienced context expectations is thought to lead to the generation of a context prediction error (Mizumori, 2013) that functionally alerts connected brain areas to alter subsequent decision making and response selection. Little is understood about how hippocampal context analyses impact downstream decision processes. This issue is evaluated here first by comparing the nature of the information represented in hippocampus and decision-related midbrain-striatal structures, while rats perform a hippocampal-dependent spatial memory task in which rewards of different value are found at different locations. In contrast to place-specific and egocentric neural representations, neural representations of goal information are broadly distributed in hippocampal and decision neural circuitry, but they appear in different forms for different brain structures. It is suggested that further researching on how goal information processing occurs in hippocampus and decision neural circuitry may reveal insights into the nature of the interaction between memory and decision systems. The second part of this review describes neural pathways by which hippocampal context information might arrive within the decision circuit. The third section presents a hypothesis that the nature of the interactions between hippocampal and midbrain-striatal circuitry is regulated by the prefrontal cortex.",
