     "AB": "The migration, integration and differentiation of fetal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the ischemic brain have been studied. In our study the ischemic insult in FVB line mice was produced by occlusion of both carotid arteries during 20 min. A day after occlusion NPCs from GFP-transgenic 12.5 dpc embryos were suboccipitally transplanted to the ischemic brain. The migration and differentiation of GFP-positive NPCs in the recipient tissue were observed in different time points after their transplantation by immunohistochemical approaches using confocal scanning microscopy. It has been shown that GFP-positive NPCs survived, migrated and differentiated to the mature neurons and glial cells in CA1 area of hippocampus of ischemic animals.",
