     "AB": "We tested the hypotheses that supplemental intake of the diet supplement Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) could delay brain atrophy in double transgenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) / presenilin 1 (PS1), single transgenic APP and PS1 as well as wild type mice by volume MR image in vivo. One hundred and twelve mice (28 APP/PS1, 28 APP, 28 PS1 and 28 wild types) were studied. Half of each genotype group (n = 14 per group) was treated with CoQ10 2400 mg/kg/day, and the other half with placebo for 60 days. Magnetic resonance (MR) images were used to obtain the volumes of the hemispheres and hippocampi. APP / PS1, APP, PS1 and wild type mice treated with CoQ10 exhibited significantly less atrophy in hemisphere and hippocampus than those receiving placebo. The neuro-protective effect of the CoQ10 on hemispheric volume, and hippocampal volume was related to genotype; greater in APP/PS1 than APP and PS1 mice and less in wild type mice. Our result indicated that CoQ10 may have therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of MCI and AD.",
