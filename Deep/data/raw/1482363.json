     "AB": "Both an enhancement of Ca(2+)-independent kinase activity in the supernatant fraction and enhanced breakdown of type beta kinase C (PKC-beta) were observed in the hippocampus after induction of tetanus-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region of rat. The enhanced activity was inhibited by the PKC-specific inhibitor, PKC19-36. Both phenomena were also observed simultaneously in the in vitro model system in which hippocampal homogenate was treated with CaCl2, and both enhancements were inhibited by the addition of calpain inhibitors, leupeptin and benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Met-H. The results suggest that Ca(2+)-independent kinase activity enhanced in the supernatant fraction during LTP derives from the catalytic fragment of PKC-beta released by calpain.",
