     "AB": "Kininase activity, which inactivates kinins, was measured in seven regions of the rat brain (i.e., the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, striatum, midbrain, hippocampus, hypothalamus, medulla oblongata), and in the spinal cord with a bioassay method using bradykinin as the substrate. Specific kininase activities in the cerebellum and striatum were higher than those in the other five regions or the spinal cord. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, which was measured fluorometrically using Hip-His-Leu as substrate, showed high activity in the striatum and cerebellum. These findings suggest that the presence of high concentrations of peptidases plays a role in the degradation of kinins and/or other peptides in these areas.",
