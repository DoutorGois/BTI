     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy causes a continuum of long-lasting disabilities in the offspring, commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is possibly the most common behavioral problem in children with FASD and devising strategies that ameliorate this condition has great clinical relevance. Studies in rodent models of ADHD and FASD suggest that impairments in the cAMP signaling cascade contribute to the hyperactivity phenotype. In this work, we investigated whether the cAMP levels are affected in a long-lasting manner by ethanol exposure during the third trimester equivalent period of human gestation and whether the acute administration of the PDE1 inhibitor vinpocetine ameliorates the ethanol-induced hyperactivity. METHODS: From postnatal day (P) 2 to P8, Swiss mice either received ethanol (5g/kg i.p.) or saline every other day. At P30, the animals either received vinpocetine (20mg/kg or 10mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle 4h before being tested in the open field. After the test, frontal cerebral cortices and hippocampi were dissected and collected for assessment of cAMP levels. RESULTS: Early alcohol exposure significantly increased locomotor activity in the open field and reduced cAMP levels in the hippocampus. The acute treatment of ethanol-exposed animals with 20mg/kg of vinpocetine restored both their locomotor activity and cAMP levels to control levels. CONCLUSIONS: These data lend support to the idea that cAMP signaling system contribute to the hyperactivity induced by developmental alcohol exposure and provide evidence for the potential therapeutic use of vinpocetine in FASD.",
