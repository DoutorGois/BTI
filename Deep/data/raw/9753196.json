     "AB": "The bioactive lipid platelet-activating factor (PAF) accumulates in brain during injury, seizures and ischemia and may, in addition, be significant in AIDS dementia and in other neurodegenerative diseases. We have used plasma-type recombinant PAF acetylhydrolase (rPAF-AH) to test the hypothesis that PAF accumulation is involved in early events leading to neuronal apoptosis during excitotoxic neuronal injury. Neuronal cultures were labeled with FITC-12-dUTP (TUNEL technique) and propidium iodide, digitized using fluorescence microscopy and a chilled 3CCD color camera, and analyzed with 2D graphics analysis software. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (50 microM, 2 hr) induced a 2.5-fold increase in apoptosis of hippocampal neurons compared with controls when analyzed 24 hr after NMDA treatment. Hippocampal neurons receiving rPAF-AH (20 microg/ml) before, during, and after NMDA treatment demonstrated a concentration-dependent neuroprotective effect which resulted in 47% and 30% neuroprotection against 50 and 100 microM NMDA, respectively. The noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801(300 nM) completely inhibited apoptosis caused by NMDA. The neuroprotective effect of rPAF-AH against NMDA-induced apoptosis was confirmed using as additional criteria, histone release, electron microscopy, and DNA laddering. Neuroprotection elicited by rPAF-AH demonstrates that PAF is an injury mediator in NMDA-induced neuronal apoptosis and that the recombinant protein is potentially useful as a therapeutic approach.",
