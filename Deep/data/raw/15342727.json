     "AB": "Protein phosphorylation is crucial for regulating synaptic transmission. We describe a novel mechanism for the phosphorylation of the GABA(A) receptor, which mediates fast inhibition in the brain. A protein copurified and coimmunoprecipitated with the phosphorylated receptor alpha1 subunit; this receptor-associated protein was identified by purification and microsequencing as the key glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Molecular constructs demonstrated that GAPDH directly phosphorylates the long intracellular loop of GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit at identified serine and threonine residues. GAPDH and the alpha1 subunit were found to be colocalized at the neuronal plasma membrane. In keeping with the GAPDH/GABA(A) receptor molecular association, glycolytic ATP produced locally at plasma membranes was consumed for this alpha1 subunit phosphorylation, possibly within a single macrocomplex. The membrane-attached GAPDH is thus a dual-purpose enzyme, a glycolytic dehydrogenase, and a receptor-associated kinase. In acutely dissociated cortical neurons, the rundown of the GABA(A) responses was essentially attributable to a Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatase activity, which was sensitive to vanadate but insensitive to okadaic acid or fluoride. Rundown was significantly reduced by the addition of GAPDH or its reduced cofactor NADH and nearly abolished by the addition of its substrate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). The prevention of rundown by G3P was abolished by iodoacetamide, an inhibitor of the dehydrogenase activity of GAPDH, indicating that the GABA(A) responses are maintained by a glycolysis-dependent phosphorylation. Our results provide a molecular mechanism for the direct involvement of glycolysis in neurotransmission.",
