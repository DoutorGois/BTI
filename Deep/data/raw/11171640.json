     "AB": "The present study was designed to investigate the role of adenosine in the hypoxic depression of synaptic transmission in rat hippocampus. An in vivo model of hypoxic synaptic depression was developed in which the common carotid artery was occluded on one side in the urethane-anesthetized rat. Inspired oxygen levels were controlled through a tracheal cannula. Rats were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus for stimulation and recording of bilateral hippocampal field excitatory postsynaptic potentials. The percent inspired oxygen could be reduced to levels that produced a reversible and repeatable depression of evoked synaptic transmission restricted to the hippocampus ipsilateral to the occlusion. Further reduction in the level of inspired oxygen depressed synaptic transmission recorded from both hippocampi. The adenosine nonselective antagonist caffeine and the A(1) selective antagonist 8-cyclopentyltheophylline prevented the initial depression in synaptic transmission. We conclude that the initial depression of synaptic transmission observed in the rat hippocampus in vivo is due to endogenous adenosine acting at neuronal adenosine A(1) receptors.",
