     "AB": "At inhibitory synapses in the mature neocortex and hippocampus in vitro, spontaneous action-potential-dependent and -independent release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activates postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors but not pre- or postsynaptic GABA(B) receptors. Elevation of synaptic GABA levels with pharmacological agents or electrical stimulation can cause activation of GABA(B) receptors, but the physiological conditions under which such activation occurs need further elucidation. In rodent sensorimotor cortex, epinephrine produced a depression in the amplitude of evoked monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and a concomitant, adrenoceptor-mediated increase in the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs. Blockade of GABA(B) receptors prevented the depression of evoked IPSC amplitude by epinephrine but did not affect the increase in spontaneous IPSC frequency. These data show that adrenoceptor-mediated increases in spontaneous IPSCs can cause activation of presynaptic GABA(B) receptors and indirectly modulate impulse-related GABA release, presumably through elevation of synaptic GABA levels.",
