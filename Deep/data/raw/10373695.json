     "AB": "1. Intracellular and extracellular recordings from area CA3 of rat and mouse hippocampal slices revealed two distinct modes of synchronous network activity in response to continuous application of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonists. At low concentrations (e.g. 0.1-1 microM oxotremorine-M), 'burst-mode' activity comprised regular individual AMPA receptor-mediated depolarizing events, each generating several action potentials. At higher concentrations (5-50 microM), 'theta-mode' prevailed in which ordered clusters of depolarizing theta-frequency oscillations occurred. 2. Whilst theta-mode activity was abolished by the mAChR antagonist atropine (5 microM), the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonists tubocurarine (100 microM), mecamylamine (100-500 microM) and dihydro-beta-erythroidine (250 microM) converted this mode of activity to burst-mode. 3. Likewise, disruption of synaptically available ACh using inhibitors of choline uptake (hemicholinium-3; 20-50 microM) or vesicular ACh transport (vesamicol; 50 microM) converted theta-mode into burst-mode activity. 4. Hippocampal slices prepared 2-3 weeks after transection of the primary cholinergic efferent pathway from the medial septum exhibited reduced vesicular ACh transporter immunoreactivity but still supported nAChR-dependent theta-mode activity suggesting that ACh released from this pathway was not critical for the activation of these receptors. 5. In summary, ACh-mediated activation of nAChRs tailors the pattern of network activity into theta-frequency depolarizing episodes as opposed to synchronized individual events at much lower frequencies.",
