     "AB": "We have examined the various diverse morphologies of catecholamine axons in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease and aged control brain tissue were obtained by a rapid autopsy protocol (mean postmortem delay < 1 h). Tissue blocks from the superior frontal cortex (Brodmann area 9), the hippocampal gyrus, and the calcarine cortex (Brodmann area 17) were processed for identification of catecholamine axons using tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemistry. A total of 1275 tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive axons were randomly sampled from coded sections and classified into one of six distinct axon-type categories. The axon classification from patients with Alzheimer's disease significantly differed from those of an age-matched control population in the hippocampus. The Alzheimer's disease brains were decreased in the frequency of very long, thin, tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive axons (type 1) and had an increased frequency of shorter, tortuous, axons (type 3). These selective quantitative shifts in hippocampal catecholaminergic axon morphology are consistent with the hypothesis that sympathetic noradrenergic axons invade the hippocampus of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Multivariate modeling of the frequency sampling data found that the axon type classification scheme successfully predicted the presence of Alzheimer's disease. In particular, the use of quantitative neuroanatomical measures of the catecholaminergic system in human brain tissue was found to have errorless predictive ability with respect to late onset (> 75 years) Alzheimer's disease. In summary, the use of quantitative neuroanatomical measures of catecholamine axonal morphologies in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue identified a specific frequency shift which may represent hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth and this unique measure was found to have predictive utility with respect to Alzheimer's disease.",
