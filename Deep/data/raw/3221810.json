     "AB": "The selective vulnerability of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 hippocampal region in ischemic rat brain may be preceded by regional alterations of energy metabolism during early reperfusion. We measured ATP, phosphocreatine (PCr), and glucose in paramedian and lateral CA1 and in an area showing little postischemic cell loss, CA2. ATP levels in paramedian CA1 were depressed immediately after 30 min of ischemia (P less than or equal to 0.02) and remained abnormal after 2 hr of reperfusion (P less than or equal to 0.05). PCr was reduced substantially in both subdivisions of CA1 immediately after ischemia (P less than or equal to 0.04) but returned to normal levels after 2 hr. Glucose levels were depressed in paramedian CA1 and CA2 after ischemia (P less than or equal to 0.02) but corrected with reperfusion. We determined approximately P, the sum of ATP and PCr, in separate experiments investigating regional differences in consumption of high-energy phosphate metabolites during complete ischemia. The approximately P levels of rats subjected to 30 min of reversible ischemia followed by 2 hr of reperfusion showed a different pattern of regional differences from those seen in sham-ischemic animals (P less than or equal to 0.01), indicating a persistent depression of metabolic rate in CA1 during reperfusion. We conclude that regional depletion of high-energy phosphates and alteration of metabolic rate may contribute to the selective vulnerability of the CA1 region during brain ischemia.",
