     "AB": "The effect of recurrent seizures on the hippocampus has been controversial for many years. To determine the effect different seizure paradigms had on the structure of the dentate gyrus, we conducted histological studies on the dentate gyrus (DG) from three groups of rats: (1) those that had experienced 1500 intermittent kindled seizures; (2) those that had experienced a single episode of limbic status epilepticus (SE); and (3) control rats that had been implanted with electrodes. When compared to controls the DG of SE rats was overall slightly, but non-significantly, smaller, but the DG of rats with 1500 kindled seizures was significantly larger. The decrease of size following SE was attributable to a significant atrophy of the molecular layer. The increase in area associated with kindling was the result of an enlargement of the molecular layer and the hilus. Absolute neuronal counts showed a decrease in the hilus after SE but no change following kindling, but both groups had decreased neuronal densities in the hilus when compared to controls. The decreased density after SE was secondary to neuronal loss, but the decrease in neuronal density following kindling was the result of the expansion of the hilar neuropil without change in the number of neurons. This study extends our previous findings in Ammon's horn and indicates that SE induces significant neuronal loss, but numerous intermittent kindled seizures have no effect on neuronal numbers in the DG.",
