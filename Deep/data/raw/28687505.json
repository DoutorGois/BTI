     "AB": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xiaochaihutang (XCHT), as a classical herbal formula for the treatment of \"Shaoyang syndrome\" has been demonstrated to exert an antidepressant effect in multiple animal models of depression as shown in our previous studies. However, the effects of XCHT on social isolation (SI)-reared mice have not been investigated. This study aims to explore the effects of XCHT on depressive/anxiety-like behaviors of SI-reared mice, and its implicated mechanisms, including alterations in the monoaminergic system, neurogenesis and neurotrophin expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male C57 BL/6J mice (aged 4 weeks after weaning) were reared isolatedly for 8 weeks and XCHT (0.8, 2.3, 7.0g/kg) were given by gavage once a day. Forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), open field test (OFT), elevated-plus maze test (EPM) and intruder-induced aggression test were used to explore the effects of XCHT on depressive/anxiety-like behaviors of SI-reared mice after administration of XCHT for 6 weeks. HPLC-MS/MS was performed to quantify the levels of neurotransmitters in the hippocampus by in vivo microdialysis, while western immunoblotting was used to evaluate the action of XCHT on the synthesis, transport and degradation of monoamine neurotransmitters. Immunofluorescence was used to study the effects of XCHT on neurogenesis and neurotrophin expression, including Ki-67, DCX, BrdU and BDNF. RESULTS: Our results showed that administration of XCHT (0.8, 2.3 and 7.0g/kg) for 6 weeks significantly attenuated the increase in immobility time in TST and FST, improved the anxiety-like behaviors in OFT and EPM, and improved the aggressive behaviors of SI-reared mice. XCHT significantly elevated monoamine neurotransmitters levels and inhibited 5-HT turnover (5-HIAA/5-HT) in hippocampal microdialysates of SI-reared mice. In addition, we found XCHT enhanced monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis enzymes (TPH2 and TH) expressions, inhibited serotonin transporter (SERT) expression and decreased monoamine neurotransmitter degradation enzyme (MAOA) expression in the hippocampus of SI-reared mice for the first time. Moreover, XCHT significantly augmented hippocampal neurogenesis and BDNF expression in hippocampus of SI-reared mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed for the first time that XCHT improved depressive/anxiety-like behaviors of SI-reared mice by regulating the monoaminergic system, neurogenesis and neurotrophin expression. The findings indicate that XCHT may have a therapeutic application for early-life stress model of depression and in turn provide further evidence supporting XCHT a novel potential antidepressant from a distinct perspective.",
