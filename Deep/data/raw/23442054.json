     "AB": "In this paper we present the case of a left-sided speech dominant patient with right medial temporal sclerosis (RMTS) and pharmacoresistant epilepsy who showed improved verbal memory during intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) at his right hemisphere as compared with his own performance before the drug injection (baseline), as well as after right selective amygdalohippocampectomy. We suggest that the defective verbal memory shown by this patient is due to abnormal activity of his right hippocampus that interfered with the function of his left hippocampus. This hypothesis was demonstrated by the fact that disconnection of the two hippocampi, either by anesthetisation or by resection of the right hippocampus, disengaged the left hippocampus and, consequently improved its function. This paper main objective is twofold: first to contribute to the field of neuropsychology of epilepsy surgery by emphasising on postoperative memory outcomes in right medial temporal lobe epilepsy (RMTLE) patients, particularly those undergoing amygdalohippocampectomy, as the pattern of memory changes after resection of the right temporal lobe is less clear; second, by focusing on memory performance asymmetries during IAT, and comparatively considering them with neuropsychological memory performance, because of their possible prognostic-simulating value.",
