     "AB": "Recent evidence suggests that excessive activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs) contributes significantly to the pathophysiological consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI). To examine possible alterations in mAChRs after TBI, the affinity (Kd) and maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of mAChRs in hippocampus, neocortex, brain stem and cerebellum were determined by [3H]QNB binding. Three groups of rats were examined: 1 h post-TBI (n = 21), 24 h post-TBI (n = 21) and sham-injured rats (n = 21). Kd values were significantly higher in hippocampus and brain stem at 1 but not 24 h post-TBI compared with sham-injured controls (P < 0.05). Kd values did not significantly differ in neocortex and cerebellum at 1 or 24 h post-TBI compared with sham-injured controls. Bmax values did not significantly differ in any brain areas at 1 or 24 h post-TBI compared with sham-injured controls. These results show that TBI significantly decreases the affinity of mAChRs in hippocampus and brain stem at an early stage post-TBI, which may contribute to desensitization of mAChRs after TBI. The findings of no change in Bmax values are consistent with a transient elevation in ACh concentrations after TBI.",
