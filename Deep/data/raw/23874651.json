     "AB": "Persons infected with HIV-1 often develop neurologic disorders despite receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy. Although the underlying mechanism is largely undetermined, our previous RNA-seq-based study showed that the expression of many genes was altered in the central nervous system (CNS) of HIV-1 transgenic (HIV-1Tg) rats. Because nicotine, a natural agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, exhibits a neuroprotective effect, we presently tested the hypothesis that nicotine restores the expression of altered genes in the CNS of HIV-1Tg rats. Adult male HIV-1Tg and F344 control strain rats were injected with either nicotine (0.25 mg/kg) or saline subcutaneously twice a day for 17 days. Gene expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal hippocampus (HIP), and dorsal striatum (STR) was evaluated using the RNA deep sequencing technique. We found that about 20% of the altered genes in the HIV-1Tg rat were affected by nicotine in each brain region, with the expression of most restored. Analysis of the restored genes showed distinct pathways corrected by nicotine in different brain regions of HIV-1Tg rats. Specifically, the two most significantly restored pathways were Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and ephrin B signaling in the PFC, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) signaling and glutathione metabolism pathway in the HIP, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and calcium signaling in the STR. Together, our findings indicate that cholinergic modulators such as nicotine have beneficial effects on HIV-1-induced neurologic deficits.",
