     "AB": "The aim of the present work was to test the role of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) on both the short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) of the inhibitory avoidance task in rats using the inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, radicicol. Rats implanted with cannulae in the CA1 area of the dorsal hippocampus received a 0.5 microl infusion of radicicol (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20 microg/ml) or vehicle (water) at different times after training and were tested for STM (1.5 or 3 h) and LTM (24 h). Additionally, one group received radicicol 10 min prior to the test for LTM. Radicicol depressed both STM and LTM when infused before and immediately after training and had no effect on either form of memory when infused 30 or 90 min after training. Radicicol also depressed the retrieval of LTM. Our results indicate that memory formation and retrieval in the hippocampus can involve PTK activity, but the present findings should be taken merely as a possible starting point for future investigations.",
