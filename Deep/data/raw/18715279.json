     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol abuse among adolescents is a major health and developmental problem. The 2-[(14)C]deoxyglucose (2-DG) technique allows for the in vivo quantification of local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) as a measure of functional neuronal activity. METHODS: Local cerebral glucose utilization rates were examined after acute ethanol administration within selected brain regions of adolescent alcohol-preferring (P) and -nonpreferring (NP) rats. Postnatal day 45 male P and NP rats were injected with saline or 1.0 g/kg ethanol, i.p., 10 minutes prior to an intravenous bolus of [(14)C]-2-deoxyglucose (125 microCi/kg). Image densities were determined using quantitative autoradiography and LCGU values calculated. RESULTS: Acute ethanol injection significantly decreased LCGU rates in select brain regions including the olfactory tubercles, the frontal cortex (Fr), and subregions of the posterior hippocampus (pCA1 and pCA3). Acute ethanol had no significant effects on LCGU rates in any region of the adolescent NP rats. Significant basal LCGU rate differences were apparent between the rat lines in a nearly global fashion with adolescent P rats having much higher basal LCGU rates compared with adolescent NP rats. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the adolescent P and NP rats are less sensitive to the effects of acute ethanol than their adult counterparts. The adolescent P rat is relatively more sensitive to the initial effects of acute ethanol in select brain regions as compared with the adolescent NP rat. Additionally, the innate hyper-excited state of the adolescent P central nervous system is a likely factor in the development of their high alcohol drinking behaviors.",
