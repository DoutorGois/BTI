     "AB": "Membrane proteomics is challenging because the desirable strong detergents are incompatible with downstream analysis. Recently, we demonstrated efficient removal of SDS by the filter aided sample preparation method (FASP). Here we combine FASP with our previously described small-scale membrane enrichment protocol. Analysis of a single mouse hippocampus enables identification of more than 1000 membrane proteins in a single LC-MS/MS run without protein or peptide prefractionation. To extend proteome coverage, we developed a simple anion exchange fractionation method in a StageTip format. When separating peptides into six fractions, a duplicate analysis resulted in identification of 4206 proteins of which 64% were membrane proteins. This data set covers 83% of glutamate and GABA receptor subunits identified in hippocampus in the Allen Brain Atlas and adds further isoforms. The combined method provides a streamlined protocol for rapid and sensitive membrane proteome mapping. We also provide a generic protocol for combining FASP with StageTip-based ion exchange fractionation, which is generally applicable to proteome analysis.",
