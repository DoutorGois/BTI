     "AB": "Recent studies indicate that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be implicated in the clinical action of antidepressant drugs. Repeated (2-3 weeks) administration of antidepressant drugs increases BDNF gene expression. The onset of this response as well as concomitant effects on the corresponding BDNF protein is however, unclear. The present study investigated the effects of acute and chronic administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (10mg/kg p.o.), upon regional rat brain levels of BDNF mRNA and protein expression. To improve the clinical significance of the study, fluoxetine was administered orally and mRNA and protein levels were determined ex vivo using the techniques of in situ hybridisation histochemistry and immunocytochemistry respectively. Direct measurement of BDNF protein was also carried out using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Four days of once daily oral administration of fluoxetine induced decreases in BDNF mRNA (hippocampus, medial habenular and paraventricular thalamic nuclei). Whilst 7 days of treatment showed a non-significant increase in BDNF mRNA, there were marked and region-specific increases following 14 days of treatment. BDNF protein levels remained unaltered until 21 days of fluoxetine treatment, when the numbers of BDNF immunoreactive cells were increased, reaching significance in the pyramidal cell layer of CA1 and CA3 regions of Ammon's horn (CA1 and CA3) but not in the other sub-regions of the hippocampus. Indicative of the highly regional change within the hippocampus, the ELISA method failed to demonstrate significant up-regulation at 21 days, measuring levels of BDNF protein in the whole hippocampus. In contrast to the detected time dependent and biphasic response of the BDNF gene, activity-regulated, cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc) mRNA showed a gradual increase during the 14-day course of treatment. The results presented here show that BDNF is expressed differentially depending on length of fluoxetine administration, which could contribute in explaining the slow onset of antidepressant activity observed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.",
