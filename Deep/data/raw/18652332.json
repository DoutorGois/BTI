     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe therapeutic effects and mechanisms at different acupoint groups for treatment of the depression rat. METHODS: Fifty Wistar rats were randomly divided into a normal group, a model group, a body acupoint group, a scalp acupoint group and a Fluoxetine hydrochloride group, 10 cases in each group. Depression rat model was established by using chronic unpredictable mild stress stimulation combined with lonely breeding for 21 days. EA (2 Hz, 1 mA, 20 min) was given at \"Taichong\" (LR 3), \"Neiguan\" (PC 6) and \"Zusanli\" (ST 36) in the body point group and \"Baihui\" (GV 20), \"Yintang\" (EX-HN 3), \"Sishencong\" (EX-HN 1) in the head point group, once daily, and Fluoxetine hydrochloride was given to the Fluoxetine hydrochloride group by intragastric administration, 2 mg/kg, once daily, for 21 days. Body weight of the rat was recorded, and the sucrose-intake test and forced swimming test were conducted one day before the experiment and on the 7th, 14th and 21st day of the experiment, and the open field test was conducted one day before the experiment and on the 21st day. p-CREB expression in the hippocampus of the rats were observed on the 22nd day. RESULTS: As compared with the model group, in the head point group and the Fluoxetine group, the crossing and rearing movement times, the relative volume of sucrose-intake and p-CREB expression in the hippocampus increased significantly, and the duration of immovability in forced swimming test shortened significantly (P<0.05). The relative volume of sucrose-intake increased and the duration of immovability in forced swimming test in the body point group significantly shortened (P<0.05), but the crossing and rearing movement times and p-CREB expression in the hippocampus did not insignificantly increase (P>0.05), with no significant differences among the treatment groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: EA at the head acupoints can improve behavioral activities and increase positive neuron number of p-CREB in the hippocampus of the depression rat, and selection of acupoints is of important role in treatment of depression.",
