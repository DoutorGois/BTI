     "AB": "The indusium griseum (IG), a thin layer of gray matter in contact with the dorsal surface of the corpus callosum and the lateral gray matter of the cingulate gyrus, has a common origin with hippocampus and shows similar organization with the dentate gyrus. Although some studies have examined the effect of methamphetamine (METH), an addictive and an illegal psychostimulant on this structure, quantitative effects and possible mechanism of actions of METH in this area are lacking. By applying two different protocols of equivalent METH administration (i.e., a high dose of 1 x 30 mg/kg and a lower and repeated injection dose of 3 x 10 mg/kg) and using a specific silver staining method in mice, we demonstrate that this drug produces degeneration in IG with both protocols, without affecting the dopaminergic system. Moreover, we observed quantitative increases in labeling of GFAP and Iba-1, markers of astro- and microgliosis, respectively, which suggest astrogliosis and microgliosis. Thus, our study provides morphological and semi-quantitative evidence that METH induces neurodegeneration in IG and that this damage is associated with astrogliosis and microgliosis in this area.",
