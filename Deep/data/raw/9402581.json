     "AB": "THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS four major advances in epilepsy surgery, especially the most frequently performed surgery, temporal lobectomy, as follows: 1) the ability to preoperatively identify (using magnetic resonance imaging) the pathological condition of hippocampal sclerosis (a key component to the syndrome of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, 2) the ability to identify preoperatively which temporal lobe candidates are at risk for postoperative memory problems, 3) the standardization of temporal lobectomy with respect to how much hippocampus should be resected, 4) a validation of the novel surgical technique of multiple subpial transections. This technique allows surgeons to attack foci within nondispensible cortex and therefore enlarges the applicability of surgical treatment to otherwise inoperable patients and potentially improves outcome.",
