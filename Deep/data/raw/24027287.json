     "AB": "Sickness behaviors, such as fatigue, mood alterations, and cognitive dysfunction, which result from changes in central neurotransmission, are prevalent in systemic inflammatory diseases and greatly impact patient quality of life. Although, microglia (resident cerebral immune cells) and cytokines (e.g., TNFalpha) are associated with changes in central neurotransmission, the link between peripheral organ inflammation, circulating cytokine signaling, and microglial activation remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate, using cerebral intravital microscopy, that in response to liver inflammation, there is increased monocyte specific rolling and adhesion along cerebral endothelial cells (CECs). Peripheral TNFalpha-TNFR1 signaling and the adhesion molecule P-selectin are central mediators of these monocyte-CEC adhesive interactions which were found to be closely associated with microglial activation, decreased central neural excitability and sickness behavior development. Similar monocyte-CEC adhesive interactions were also observed in another mouse model of peripheral organ inflammation (i.e., 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis). Our observations provide a clear link between peripheral organ inflammation and cerebral changes that impact behavior, which can potentially allow for novel therapeutic interventions in patients with systemic inflammatory diseases.",
