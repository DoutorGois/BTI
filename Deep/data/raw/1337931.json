     "AB": "Several mRNAs which encode for isoforms of the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-transport ATPase (PMCA) are present in adult rat brain. Using in situ hybridization with antisense oligonucleotide probes we found complex patterns of specific hybridization for three isoforms (PMCA1-3). Each rat brain region studied exhibited a distinct pattern of expression of isoforms. PMCA1 mRNA, which is widely distributed in rat tissues, was highest in CA1 pyramidal cells of hippocampus and very low in hypothalamic nuclei, cerebellum and choroid plexus. PMCA2 mRNA was highest in Purkinje cells of cerebellum and low in caudate-putamen, hypothalamic nuclei, habenula and choroid plexus. The highest levels of PMCA3 mRNA were found in habenula and choroid plexus. The PMCA1-3 isoforms appeared to be expressed primarily in neurons since hybridization was detected neither in white matter nor in regions rich in astrocytes. In different regions, different levels of expression of each PMCA mRNA may underlie specialized requirements for calcium homeostasis in specific neurons.",
