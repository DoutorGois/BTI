     "AB": "The conductance characteristics of gamma-aminobutyric acid-activated single channel currents from cultured hippocampal neurons were examined using patch clamp techniques. GABA-activated currents had amplitudes which were linearly correlated to the membrane potentials over a range of -80 to +70 mV and an open time and burst time of 2.2 and 4.3 ms, respectively. The conductance of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-activated channels was 19 pS. These data demonstrate that cultured hippocampal neurons have channel conductances which have characteristics different from those of adult neurons.",
