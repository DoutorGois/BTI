     "AB": "We have designed and constructed an automated device for the production of ultra-high specific activity (11)C-labeled compounds via [(11)C]CH(3)I synthesized by the single pass I(2) method. The optimum condition for the production of [(11)C]CH(3)I was determined to be 630 degrees C for oven-1 (reaction column), 50 degrees C for oven-2 (iodine column) and 50 ml/min for the He gas flow rate, and gave the maximum conversion ratio of [(11)C]CH(3)I, 44%. [(11)C]Ro15-4513, known as an inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, was produced under optimized conditions. An i.v. injectable [(11)C]Ro15-4513 solution of 1500 +/- 490 MBq (n = 6) with specific activity 4700 +/- 2500 GBq/micromol and a radiochemical purity of 98.2 +/- 2% was obtained automatically within 25 minutes (from EOB) by irradiating nitrogen gas containing 5% H(2) with 18 MeV protons (14.2 MeV on target) at 20 microA for 20 minutes. The highest specific activity of 9700 GBq/micromol (at EOS) could be achieved, although the radiochemical purity was 92.4%. By the use of the ultra-high specific activity [(11)C]Ro15-4513, the super high affinity binding sites in the rat brain hippocampus could be clearly visualized even at the extremely low concentration of 0.66 pM Ro15-4513 by in vitro autoradiography.",
