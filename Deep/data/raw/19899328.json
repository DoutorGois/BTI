In order to brain injury 42 wistar rats were submitted and divided in 7 groups. Nitric oxide synthase activities were assayed at different times after injury. Present results showed that a significant increase of iNOS and cNOS activity 8 h after lesion. In conclusion, both isoformes of NOS increase at different time after brain injury.",
