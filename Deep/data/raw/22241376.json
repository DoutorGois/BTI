     "AB": "Spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations (LFF) in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal have been shown to reflect cerebral spontaneous neural activity. The objective of this study was to explore brain functional changes in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by measuring the amplitude of the BOLD signals. Eighteen amnestic MCI patients and 20 healthy elderly individuals underwent the fMRI scan. The amplitude of LFF (ALFF) was calculated using REST software. MCI patients showed decreased ALFF in the right hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, left lateral temporal cortex and right ventral medial prefrontal cortex and increased ALFF in the left temporal-parietal joint (TPJ) and inferior parietal lobule. The ALFF value in the right hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex was positively correlated with the scores of Mini-Mental State Exam. Reduced medial temporal lobe activity may implicate the underlying memory impairment mechanisms in MCI. Increased TPJ and inferior parietal lobule activity may indicate the compensatory mechanism in MCI patients. These findings suggest that ALFF analysis could provide a useful tool in the fMRI study of MCI.",
