     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To detect the expression of miR-16 in the hippocampus of a rat depression model induced by maternal deprivation, and to explore whether miR-16 is involved in the pathological process of maternal deprivation-induced depression. METHODS: Newborn SD rats were randomly divided into a maternal deprivation group (n=17) and a control group (n=17). Rats in the maternal deprivation group experienced maternal deprivation for 6 h per day from 1st to 14th postnatal day, while rats in the control group rats received no treatment. When the rats were 13 weeks old, depression-like behaviors were assessed by forced swimming test and sucrose consumption test, and the expression of hippocampal miR-16 in rats was detected by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Maternal-deprived rats exhibited significantly longer passive floating time and lower sucrose preference rate than rats in the control group (P<0.05). Maternal-deprivation rats expressed higher level of miR-16 in the hippocampus than rats in the control group, and the expression level of miR-16 was significantly associated with the passive floating time (r=0.65, P<0.05) and the sucrose preference rate (r=-0.59, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Maternal deprivation can induce depressive behaviors in rats and increase the expression of miR-16 in the hippocampus in rats. MiR-16 may be involved in the pathological mechanism of the maternal deprivation-induced depression.",
