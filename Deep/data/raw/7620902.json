     "AB": "Aging increases the vulnerability of brain tissue to anoxia and ischemia. We investigated whether age-related alterations in energy metabolism underlie this increased vulnerability. Energy metabolism was manipulated in hippocampal slices from Fischer 344 rats of ages 6-9 (young adult), 16-19 (middle-aged adult), and 26-29 (aged adult) months by altering glucose concentrations or by using lactate instead of glucose as the metabolic substrate. Extracellular K+ activity (K+o) and synaptic excitability were monitored in stratum pyramidale of hippocampal subfield CA1. Aging diminished how well increasing concentrations of glucose delayed onset of anoxic depolarization and improved postanoxic recovery of K+o homeostasis and synaptic transmission. Hippocampal slices from all age groups responded to anoxia similarly when lactate was present instead of glucose. Also, no age-related differences were seen in normoxic ATP and phosphocreatine levels. These results suggest that an age-related decline in the glycolytic capacity of brain cells contributes to earlier onset of anoxic depolarization and poorer recovery of ion homeostasis and synaptic transmission in aging brain tissue.",
