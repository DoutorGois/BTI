     "AB": "Aluminum (Al), a neurotoxic agent, has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by cholinergic dysfunction in the central nervous system. In this study, we evaluated the effect of long-term exposure to aluminum on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the central nervous system in different brain regions, in synaptosomes of the cerebral cortex and in erythrocytes. The animals were loaded by gavage with AlCl(3) 50 mg/kg/day, 5 days per week, totalizing 60 administrations. Rats were divided into four groups: (1) control (C); (2) 50 mg/kg of citrate solution (Ci); (3) 50 mg/kg of Al plus citrate (Al + Ci), and (4) 50 mg/kg of Al (Al). AChE activity in striatum was increased by 15% for Ci, 19% for Al + Ci and 30% for Al, when compared to control (P < 0.05). The activity in hypothalamus increased 23% for Ci, 26% for Al + Ci and 28% for Al, when compared to control (P < 0.05). AChE activity in cerebellum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex was decreased by 11%, 23% and 21% respectively, for Al, when compared to the respective controls (P < 0.05). AChE activity in synaptosomes was increased by 14% for Al, when compared to control (P < 0.05). Erythrocyte AChE activity was increased by 17% for Al + Ci and 11% for Al, when compared to control (P < 0.05). These results indicate that Al affects at the same way AChE activity in the central nervous system and erythrocyte. AChE activity in erythrocytes may be considered a marker of easy access of the central cholinergic status.",
