     "AB": "The human tissue kallikrein gene, in the form of naked DNA (CMV-cHK) or an adenoviral vector (Ad.CMV-cHK), was directly delivered by intracerebroventricular injection into spontaneously hypertensive rats. Control rats received the same amount of vector DNA (pcDNA3) or adenoviral vector (Ad.CMV-LacZ) carrying the lacZ gene. A single injection of the human tissue kallikrein gene caused a rapid and prolonged blood pressure-lowering effect that began 1 day post injection and the effect lasted for more than 7 days. The expression of human tissue kallikrein and its mRNA was identified in the cortex, cerebellum, brain stem, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Cellular localization of beta-galactosidase was detected by X-gal staining in the thalamus, hypothalamus and third ventricle in rats injected with Ad.CMV-LacZ. This suggests that the tissue kallikrein-kinin system may function in the central control of blood pressure homeostasis.",
