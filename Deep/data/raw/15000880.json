     "AB": "AIM: To investigate the mechanism of brain interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in reserpine-induced behavioral depression in rats. METHODS: Porsult swim test was used in the measurement of depressive behavior and ELISA was used in measurement of brain IL-1 beta. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal injection of reserpine (0, 4, 6, and 8 mg/kg, ip) increased floating time in the Porsult swim test in a dose-and time-dependent manner in rats. Intracerebroventricular injection (icv) of IL-1 beta receptor antagonist (IL-1ra, 6 mg/kg) blocked the increment of floating time in Porsult swim test at 48 and 72 h after reserpine injection, but not at 1 and 24 h after injection. Brain IL-1 beta increased after reserpine treatment in posterior cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. The increase of IL-1 beta concentration starts at 24 hours after injection of reserpine and reached the peak at 48 h. CONCLUSION: Reserpine induced behavioral depression partially via brain interleukin-1 beta generation.",
