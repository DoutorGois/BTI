     "AB": "A 55 year-old woman whose mitral valve had been replaced 16 years previously with a Starr-Edwards cloth-covered ball valve was admitted to our hospital, complaining of memory disturbance and bilateral pretibial edema. Her CT scan findings showed a low density area in the left anterior and temporal lobes, hippocampus, and insula. A right coronary angiogram demonstrated total obstruction at the midportion. In addition to these cerebral and myocardial infarctions due to cloth-wear of the Starr-Edwards ball valve, her laboratory data indicated intravascular hemolysis. Her malfunctioning Starr-Edwards valve was successfully replaced with a Bjork-Shiley valve. An aggressive attitude toward urgent replacement is suggested in cases of suspected cloth-wear.",
