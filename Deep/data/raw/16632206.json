     "AB": "The impact of early emotional experience on the development of serotonergic and dopaminergic fiber innervation of the nucleus accumbens, hippocampal formation and the amygdala was quantitatively investigated in the precocious rodent Octodon degus. Two animal groups were compared: 1) degus which were repeatedly separated from their parents during the first three postnatal weeks, after weaning they were individually reared in chronic social isolation and 2) controls which were reared undisturbed with their families. In the deprived animals 5-hydroxytryptamine-immunoreactive fiber densities were increased in the core region of the nucleus accumbens (up to 126%), in the central nucleus of the amygdala (up to 112%) and in the outer subregion of the dentate gyrus stratum moleculare (up to 149%), whereas decreased fiber densities were detected in the dentate subgranular layer (down to 86%) and in the stratum lacunosum of the hippocampal cornu ammonis region 1 (down to 86%). Tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fiber densities were increased in the core (up to 115%) and shell region (up to 113%) of the nucleus accumbens of deprived animals, whereas decreased fiber densities (down to 84%) were observed in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. In the stratum granulosum and subgranular layer the fiber densities increased up to 168% and 127% respectively. In summary, these results indicate that the postnatal establishment of the monoaminergic innervation of limbic areas is modulated in response to early emotional experience, and that this environmental morphological adaptation is highly region specific.",
