     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Obesity has been identified as a risk factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of obesity on neuroinflammation and cerebral glucose metabolism using PET in a mouse model of beta-amyloidosis and determine the relationship between these PET imaging biomarkers, pathogenic changes, and functional outcomes. METHODS: Three-month-old C57BL/J6 mice were fed either a standard (control group) or high-fat diet (obese group) for 3 months and intracerebroventricularly infused with vehicle or human beta amyloid 1-42 (Abeta42). We assessed obesity-induced abnormalities in peripheral metabolic indices including adiposity, fasting glucose, and glucose tolerance. Brain glucose metabolism was assessed by (18)F-FDG PET, and glial activation was assessed using the translocator protein (TSPO) ligand (11)C-PBR-28. TSPO expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of brain sections obtained from scanned mice. The association between inflammatory state and (11)C-PBR-28 PET signals was characterized by examination of the cytokine expression profile in both the serum and hippocampus by antibody array. Learning and memory performance was assessed in the object recognition task, and anxiety-related behavior was assessed in the elevated plus maze. RESULTS: Obesity combined with Abeta infusion promoted neuroinflammation and cerebral hypermetabolism, and these signals were significant predictors of learning and memory performance in the object recognition task. In vivo TSPO signals were associated with inflammatory markers including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL5, TIMP-1, G-CSF, sICAM-1, and IL-1ra. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo cerebral metabolism and TSPO signals indicate that obesity can accelerate amyloid-induced inflammation and associated cognitive decline.",
