     "PG": "217-22",
     "AB": "Microdialysis experiments performed in the dorsal hippocampus of freely moving rats showed that L-(E)-4-(3-phosphono-2-propenyl)piperazine-2-carboxylic acid (L-CPPene) is 10 times as potent as D-CPPene in inhibiting potassium-induced increases in extracellular levels of aspartate and glutamate. In control experiments, two 100 mM KCl stimuli (S1 and S2) applied for 10 min each (separated by a 40-min recovery period) produced substantial (300-500%) increases in the extracellular levels of aspartate, glutamate, taurine, and GABA and a 50% decrease in the glutamine level. S2/S1 ratios in the control groups were 0.67 (aspartate), 0.78 (glutamate), 0.83 (GABA), and 0.85 (taurine). In the experimental groups, D- or L-CPPene was applied via the probe during the second potassium stimulus (S2). L-CPPene (25 or 250 microM) produced selective suppression of potassium-induced increases of extracellular glutamate (S2/S1 ratio: 0.25) and aspartate (S2/S1 ratio: 0.20) levels, whereas 250 microM D-CPPene was required to inhibit the extracellular aspartate and glutamate increases. Neither enantiomer of CPPene affected the potassium-induced increases of GABA and taurine or the decrease in extracellular glutamine concentration. An additional study comparing the anticonvulsant potencies of D- and L-CPPene was performed using audiogenic DBA/2 mice. The anticonvulsant potency of D-CPPene, as assessed against sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice, was an order of magnitude higher than that of L-CPPene [ED50 clonic phase (intraperitoneal, 45 min): 1.64 mumol/kg and 16.8 mumol/kg, respectively]. We attribute the anticonvulsant action of D-CPPene to its antagonist action at the NMDA receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
