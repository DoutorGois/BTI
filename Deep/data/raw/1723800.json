     "AB": "Midbrain raphe serotonin (5-HT) neurons can influence the pituitary-adrenal axis. The midbrain raphe nuclei also contain a number of non-5-HT neurons, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons which can modulate 5-HT neuronal activity. We investigated the effects of intraraphe injections of the GABAA agonist, muscimol, on serum adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone concentrations. Rats were infused with muscimol (0, 25, 50, and 100 ng in 0.5 microliters saline) into the median raphe nucleus (MR). The animals were killed 30 min later, and trunk blood was collected for measurement of serum concentrations of ACTH and corticosterone by radioimmunoassay. Muscimol dose dependently increased plasma concentrations of these two pituitary-adrenal hormones. In order to determine the role of MR 5-HT neurons in these effects, separate groups of implanted animals were infused with either the serotonergic neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) or ascorbic acid vehicle into the MR. Two weeks later, the animals were infused with muscimol (100 ng in 0.5 microliters) and sacrificed as above. Treatment with 5,7-DHT, which markedly reduced hippocampal concentrations of 5-HT (-83%) and 5-HIAA (-73%), did not block intra-MR muscimol-induced elevations in ACTH and corticosterone. Thus, 5-HT neurons within the MR apparently do not mediate the increased activity of the pituitary-adrenal axis produced by stimulation of MR GABAA receptors.",
