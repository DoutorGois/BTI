     "AB": "Effects of ovariectomy (OVX) on performance of the memory tasks, Object Recognition (OR) and Object Placement (OP), and on dendritic spine density in pyramidal neurons in layer II/III of the prefrontal cortex and the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus were determined. OVX was associated with a significant decline in performance of the memory tasks as compared to intact rats beginning at 1 week post OVX for OR and 4 weeks post OVX for OP. Golgi impregnation at 7 weeks post OVX showed significantly lower spine densities (17-53%) in the pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex and the CA1, but not the CA3, region of the hippocampus in OVX compared to intact rats. These results suggest that cognitive impairments observed in OVX rats may be associated with morphological changes in brain areas mediating memory.",
