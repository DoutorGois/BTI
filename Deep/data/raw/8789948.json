     "AB": "Multiple epsilon subunits are major determinants of the NMDA receptor channel diversity. Based on their functional properties in vitro and distributions, we have proposed that the epsilon 1 and epsilon 2 subunits play a role in synaptic plasticity. To investigate the physiological significance of the NMDA receptor channel diversity, we generated mutant mice defective in the epsilon 2 subunit. These mice showed no suckling response and died shortly after birth but could survive by hand feeding. The mutation hindered the formation of the whisker-related neuronal barrelette structure and the clustering of primary sensory afferent terminals in the brainstem trigeminal nucleus. In the hippocampus of the mutant mice, synaptic NMDA responses and longterm depression were abolished. These results suggest that the epsilon 2 subunit plays an essential role in both neuronal pattern formation and synaptic plasticity.",
