     "AB": "The Ts65Dn mouse is the best-studied animal model for Down syndrome. In the experiments described here, NMDA-mediated or mGluR-mediated LTD was induced in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices from Ts65Dn and euploid control mice by bath application of 20 microM NMDA for 3 min and 50 microM DHPG for 5 min, respectively. We found that Ts65Dn mice display exaggerated NMDA-induced, but not mGluR-induced, LTD in the CA1 region of the hippocampus compared with euploid control animals. In addition, this abnormal level of LTD can be pharmacologically rescued by the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine.",
