     "AB": "The synthetic Liver X receptor (LXR) activator T0901317 has been reported to exert neuroprotective effect in Alzheimer's disease, but the relationship between LXR activation and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) remains uncertain. This study investigated the effect of T0901317 on membrane cholesterol levels, BACE1 expression and activity. We found that T0901317 decreased membrane cholesterol levels, reduced BACE1 expression and activity as well as beta-secretase cleaved C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF) levels in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, the expression of ATP-binding membrane cassette transport protein A1 (ABCA1) enhanced. Additionally, inhibition of ABCA1 abrogated the effects of T0901317 on membrane cholesterol levels and beta-secretase activity. Moreover, addition of LXR antagonist reversed the effect of T0901317 on ABCA1 mRNA expression, membrane cholesterol levels and beta-secretase activity. Our results suggest that activation of LXR may decrease BACE1 expression and activity through a pathway associated with ABCA1-mediated reduction in membrane cholesterol levels.",
