     "AB": "The hippocampal formation forms a cognitive circuit that is critical for learning and memory. Cholinergic input to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors plays an important role in the normal development of principal neurons within the hippocampal formation. However, the ability of nicotinic receptors to stimulate principal neurons across all regions of the developing hippocampal formation has not been determined. We show here that heteromeric nicotinic receptors mediate direct inward current and depolarization responses in principal neurons across the hippocampal formation of the young postnatal mouse. These responses were found in principal neurons of the CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus, subiculum and entorhinal cortex layer VI, and varied in magnitude across region with the greatest responses occurring in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex. Despite this regional variation in the magnitude of passive responses, heteromeric nicotinic receptor stimulation increased the excitability of active principal neurons by a similar amount in all regions. Pharmacological experiments found this similar excitability response to be regulated by small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels, which exhibited regional differences in their influence on neuron activity that offset the observed regional differences in passive nicotinic responses. These findings demonstrate that SK channels play a role to coordinate the magnitude of heteromeric nicotinic excitability responses across the hippocampal formation at a time when nicotinic signaling drives the development of this cognitive brain region. This coordinated input may contribute to the normal development, synchrony and maturation of the hippocampal formation learning and memory network.",
