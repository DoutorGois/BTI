     "AB": "Brain iron homeostasis is maintained by a balance of both iron uptake and release, and accumulating evidence has revealed that brain iron concentrations increase with aging. Hepcidin, an iron regulatory hormone produced by hepatocytes in response to inflammatory stimuli, iron, and hypoxia, has been shown to be the long-sought hormone responsible for the regulation of body iron balance and recycling in mammals. In this study, we report that hepcidin is widely expressed in the murine brain. In cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum, hepcidin mRNA levels increased with aging. Injection of hepcidin into the lateral cerebral ventricle resulted in decreased Fpn1 protein levels in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Additionally, treatment of primary cultured neurons with hepcidin caused decreased neuronal iron release and Fpn1 protein levels. Together, our data provide further evidence that hepcidin may be involved in the regulation of brain iron metabolism.",
