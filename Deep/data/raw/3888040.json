     "AB": "Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and classical periventricular leukomalacia complex are considered the two most common forms of perinatal anoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, recently, a third entity, the periventricular leukomalacia complex (PLC) was described and was seen in 31 percent of 61 premature infants coming to autopsy from the University of Connecticut Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NBIC) and in several other centers. Periventricular leukomalacia complex consists of necrotizing lesions of the periventricular white and grey matter, hippocampus and subiculum, cerebellum and basis pontis. The clinical course of PLC is similar to that of IVH, but it is important to differentiate PLC as the widespread nature of these lesions may lead to a poor neurological outcome.",
