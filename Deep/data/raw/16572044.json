     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Proanthocyanidin (PA) is a naturally occurring antioxidant from grape seed extract. The present study aims at assessing the neuroprotective effects of grape seed proanthocyanidin (GSPE) on the cerebral cortex (CC), cerebellum (CB), and hippocampus (HC) in the adult rat brain. MATERIAL/METHODS: GSPE was orally administered at 25, 50, and 75 mg per kg body weight daily and for a total period of 9 weeks. Antioxidant enzymes (AOEs), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) were analyzed along with malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl content (PCC) as markers of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein oxidation (PO). The cholinergic system was studied by analyzing choline acetyl tranferase (ChAT) and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activites along with acetylcholine content (ACh). RESULTS: The results obtained revealed an increased SOD activity in the 75-mg PA-supplemented animals, with a substantial decrease in MDA and PCC. The cholinergic neurotransmittary system analysis showed increased ChAT activity indicative of increased Ach content in the supplemented animals and the increase was more in the 75-mg PA group with a concomitant and moderate decrease in AChE activity. Regional changes were more with reference to HC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that PA intake in moderately low quantity is effective in up-regulating the antioxidant defense mechanism by attenuating LPO and PO. Changes in the cholinergic system, however, indicate an increase in the ACh concentration with a moderate reduction in AChE activity, suggesting further that PA may have a potent role in enhancing cognition in older rats.",
