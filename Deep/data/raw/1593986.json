     "AB": "Several studies have examined behavioral sequelae of acute or chronic pre- or postnatal hypoxia. However, few of these tested a large battery of behavioral functions, particularly those following relatively mild, intermittent hypoxia. Also, in few studies were the hypoxic pups cross-fostered or the experimenter blinded as to experimental group. In addition, in almost no studies were concomitant hypoxic-induced brain biochemicals measured. The present study tested the hypotheses that mild, intermittent antenatal hypoxia can lead to long-term alterations in neurobehavioral development, as well as neurochemical changes.",
