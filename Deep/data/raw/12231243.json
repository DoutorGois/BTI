     "AB": "Several sources of evidence indicate that the inferior colliculus also integrates acoustic information of an aversive nature besides its well-known role as a relay station for auditory pathways. Gradual increases of the electrical stimulation of this structure cause in a hierarchical manner alertness, freezing and escape behaviors. Independent groups of animals implanted with bipolar electrodes into the inferior colliculus received electrical stimulation at one of these aversive thresholds. Control animals were submitted to the same procedure but no current was applied. Next, analysis of Fos protein expression was used to map brain areas activated by the inferior colliculus stimulation at each aversive threshold and in the controls. Whereas alertness elicited by stimulation of the inferior colliculus did not cause any significant labeling in any structure studied in relation to the respective control, electrical stimulation applied at the freezing threshold increased Fos-like immunoreactivity in the central amygdaloid nucleus and entorhinal cortex. In contrast, escape response enhanced Fos-like immunoreactivity in the nucleus cuneiform and the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter of the mesencephalon. This evidence supports the notion that freezing and escape behaviors induced by electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus activate different neural circuitries in the brain. Both defensive behaviors caused significant expression of c-fos in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and basolateral amygdaloid nucleus. This indistinct pattern of c-fos distribution may indicate a more general role for these structures in the modulation of fear-related behaviors. Therefore, the present data bring support to the notion that amygdala, dorsal hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, dorsal periaqueductal gray matter and cuneiform nucleus altogether play a role in the integration of aversive states generated at the level of the inferior colliculus.",
