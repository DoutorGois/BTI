     "AB": "Heme oxygenase (HO) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the degradation of heme to produce bile pigments and carbon monoxide. The HO-1 isozyme is induced by a variety of agents such as heat, heme, and hydrogen peroxide. Evidence suggests that the bile pigments serve as antioxidants in cells with compromised defense mechanisms. Because hypoxia-ischemia (HI) increases the level of oxygen free radicals, the induction of HO-1 expression in the brain during ischemia could modulate the response to oxidative stress. To study the possible involvement of HO-1 in neonatal hypoxia-induced ischemic tolerance, we examined the brains of newborn rat pups exposed to 8% O2 (for 2.5 to 3 hours), and the brain of chronically hypoxic rat pups with congenital cardiac defects (Wistar Kyoto; WKY/ NCr). Heme oxygenase-1 immunostaining did not change after either acute or chronic hypoxia, suggesting that HO-1 is not a good candidate for explaining hypoxia preconditioning in newborn rat brain. To study the role of HO-1 in neonatal HI, 1-week-old rats were subjected to right carotid coagulation and exposure to 8% O2/92% N2 for 2.5 hours. Whereas HO enzymatic activity was unchanged in ipsilateral cortex and subcortical regions compared with the contralateral hemisphere or control brains, immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis showed increased HO-1 staining in ipsilateral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum at 12 to 24 hours up to 7 days after HI. Double fluorescence immunostaining showed that HO-1 was expressed mostly in ED-1 positive macrophages. Because activated brain macrophages have been associated with the release of several cytotoxic molecules, the presence of HO-1 positive brain macrophages may determine the tissue vulnerability after HI injury.",
