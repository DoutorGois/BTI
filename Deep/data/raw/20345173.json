     "AB": "A method for the identification and quantitation of 10 brain steroids and their 2 sulfate and 9 glucuronide conjugates in mouse brain tissues was developed and validated. The method includes the extraction of homogenized brain by solid-phase extraction and the analysis of the extracts by capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The main advantage of the method is that steroid conjugates in brain can be analyzed as intact compounds, without derivatization, hydrolysis, or complex sample preparation procedures; thus, the true identity of the conjugates can be confirmed with tandem mass spectrometric detection. The method was validated to show its linearity (r > 0.998) and precision (<9%). The limits of detection in solution were from 6 to 80 pmol/L for steroid glucuronides, from 13 to 32 pmol/L for steroid sulfates, and from 26 pmol/L to 2.2 nmol/L for native steroids. The recovery of internal standards was 95% for d3-testosterone glucuronide and 69% for d4-allopregnanolone from spiked mouse hippocampus. Brain tissue samples from mouse hippocampus and hypothalamus were analyzed using the new method. Several steroids and glucuronides were identified and quantified from the mouse brain at concentration levels of 0.2-58 ng/g. The concentrations of steroid glucuronides were significant compared to those of their aglycons, indicating that glucuronidation might be an important metabolic pathway for some steroids in the mouse brain. The method developed in this study provides for the first time direct quantitative determination of steroids and their glucuronides and sulfates in brain without hydrolysis and, therefore, creates the possibility to study in detail the role of steroid glucuronidation and sulfation in the brain.",
