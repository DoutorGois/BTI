     "AB": "The effects of agents which affect the action of nitric oxide (NO) were studied intracellularly on the ischemia-induced changes in membrane potential of single CA1 pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampal slice preparations. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, (+/-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5, 250 microM) or Co2 (2 mM) restored the membrane potential in more than 80% of the neurons. In about 60% of the neurons, the membrane potential was partially recovered as a result of exposure to the NO synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine (100 microM). The NO scavengers, carboxy-2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (carboxy-PTIO, 300 microM) and hemoglobin (10 microM) restored the membrane potential in all neurons examined. Superoxide dismutase (50 U/ml) protected about 75% of the neurons from irreversible membrane dysfunction. It is concluded that the release of NO induced by experimental ischemia may result in the irreversible membrane dysfunction, and that a NO scavenger, carboxy-PTIO, prevents the ischemic changes in membrane potential. With respect to ischemic brain damage, the neuroprotection provided by carboxy-PTIO may have clinical relevance in the management of a variety of neurological conditions.",
