     "AB": "Administration to mice of the neurotoxicant MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) decreased striatal dopamine and, to a lesser extent, hippocampal noradrenaline levels when measured 2 weeks after the last dose of MPTP. Reserpine and tetrabenazine, inhibitors of catecholamine vesicular transporter, potentiated the catecholamine depletions produced by MPTP in the hippocampus and striatum, respectively. These results are compatible with our hypothesis that sequestration of the toxic MPTP metabolite MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium) in the catecholamine storage vesicle retards the catecholaminergic toxicity of MPTP.",
