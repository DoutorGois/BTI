     "AB": "The so-called Schmallenberg virus (SBV), first detected in a German town of the same name in October 2011, is a novel emerging orthobunyavirus in Europe causing malformations and severe economic loss in ruminants. This report describes lesions in 40 sheep, 2 goats, and 16 cattle naturally infected with SBV as determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The most common macroscopic changes were arthrogryposis, vertebral malformations, brachygnathia inferior, and malformations of the central nervous system, including hydranencephaly, porencephaly, hydrocephalus, cerebellar hypoplasia, and micromyelia. Histologic lesions included lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis in some cases, glial nodules mainly in the mesencephalon and hippocampus of lambs and goats, and neuronal degeneration and necrosis mainly in the brain stem of calves. Micromyelia was characterized by a loss of gray and white matter, with few neurons remaining in the ventral horn in calves. The skeletal muscles had myofibrillar hypoplasia in lambs and calves. The lesions of SBV-associated abortion and perinatal death are similar to those attributed to Akabane virus and other viruses in the Simbu group of bunyaviruses.",
