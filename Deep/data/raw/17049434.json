     "AB": "We used a multiple channel, single unit recording technique to investigate the neural activity in different corticolimbic and basal ganglia regions in freely moving rats before and during generalized amygdala kindled seizures. Neural activity was recorded simultaneously in the sensorimotor cortex (Ctx), hippocampus, amygdala, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). We observed massive synchronized activity among neurons of different brain regions during seizure episodes. Neurons in the kindled amygdala led other regions in synchronized firing, revealed by time lags of neurons in other regions in crosscorrelogram analysis. While there was no obvious time lag between Ctx and SNr, the STN and hippocampus did lag behind the Ctx and SNr in correlated firing. Activity in the amygdala and SNr contralateral to the kindling stimulation site lagged behind their ipsilateral counterparts. However, no time lag was found between the kindling and contralateral sides of Ctx, hippocampus and STN. Our data confirm that the amygdala is an epileptic focus that emits ictal discharges to other brain regions. The observed temporal pattern indicates that ictal discharges from the amygdala arrive first at Ctx and SNr, and then spread to the hippocampus and STN. The simultaneous activation of both sides of the Ctx suggests that the neocortex participates in kindled seizures as a unisonant entity to provoke the clonic motor seizures. Early activation of the SNr (before the STN and hippocampus) points to an important role of the SNr in amygdala kindled seizures and supports the view that different SNr manipulations may be effective ways to control seizures.",
