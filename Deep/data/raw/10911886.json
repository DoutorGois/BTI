     "AB": "Recent anterograde and retrograde studies in the rat have provided detailed information on the origin and termination of the interconnections between the amygdaloid complex and the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal areas (including areas 35 and 36 of the perirhinal cortex and the postrhinal cortex). The most substantial inputs to the amygdala originate in the rostral half of the entorhinal cortex, the temporal end of the CA1 subfield and subiculum, and areas 35 and 36 of the perirhinal cortex. The amygdaloid nuclei receiving the heaviest inputs are the lateral, basal, accessory basal, and central nuclei as well as the amygdalohippocampal area. The heaviest projections from the amygdala to the hippocampal formation and the parahippocampal areas originate in the lateral, basal, accessory basal, and posterior cortical nuclei. These pathways terminate in the rostral half of the entorhinal cortex, the temporal end of the CA3 and CA1 subfields or the subiculum, the parasubiculum, areas 35 and 36 of the perirhinal cortex, and the postrhinal cortex. The connectional data are summarized and the underlying principles of organization of these projections are discussed.",
