     "AB": "We examined the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity in gerbil hippocampal CA1 neurons after 5-min ischemia by a histochemical method in the presence or absence of exogenous cytochrome c. In the CA1 neurons, COX activity without exogenous cytochrome c decreased from 1 h after ischemia, but was restored by the addition of exogenous cytochrome c in the following 6 h after ischemia. These results suggest that it is not COX activity but endogenous cytochrome c that is changed in the early phase after ischemia, and that COX activity begins to decrease 9 h after ischemia. We examined caspase-3 in the CA1 region by immunoblotting, as caspase-3 is known to take part in the cell-death cascade downstream from cytochrome c. Although pro-caspase-3 was strongly detected, active caspase-3 was not detected before and until 84 h after 5-min ischemia. Our data suggested that delayed neuronal death is likely to progress via cytochrome c-release but not via caspase-3 activation.",
