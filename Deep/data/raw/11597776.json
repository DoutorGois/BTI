     "AB": "Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) has been implicated in pathological changes in inflammatory and apoptotic processes in various cell types including neurons. Here we report the delayed induction of p38 MAPKs in the brain of mice following kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure. The immunoreactivities of p38alpha and p38beta MAPKs were markedly increased in the brain 4 days after KA administration, especially in the areas undergoing selective neuronal loss. In particular, p38beta was dramatically increased in reactive astrocytes of CA3 and CA1 regions of hippocampus with its enriched localization in the nucleus of astrocytes. The induction of p38beta was sustained for more than 10 days after KA-treatment. Pre-administration of the selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), which suppressed the delayed neuronal death as well as astrogliosis in hippocampus of seizure-experienced animals, dramatically repressed the delayed induction of p38beta MAPK in astrocytes. The repression was reversed by the co-injection with L-arginine (L-arg), a substrate for NOS, which coincided with the aggravation of neuronal death. Together, these data suggested a role of p38 MAPK signal pathway in delayed neuronal death and/or in reactive gliosis in mice with KA-induced seizure.",
