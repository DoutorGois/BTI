The maximum NSE concentration was measured in the frontal and occipital brain cortex, hippocampus, limbic cortex and hypothalamus (12-14 micrograms/mg of water-soluble protein), the minimum level was observed in the brain stem structures (3-6 micrograms/mg). The maximum NNE content was determined in thalamus (34 micrograms/mg). The data can prove useful for the study of enolase isoform distribution in the brain of neurological and psychiatric patients.",
