     "AB": "Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonists increase the excitability of hippocampal CAl pyramidal neurons via depression of the postspike afterhyperpolarization. In adult rats, this is mediated by both mGluR1 and -5, but the signal transduction processes involved are unknown. In this study, we investigated whether altered levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins are involved in the depression of the slow-duration afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) by the Group I mGluR agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) in CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slices. Preincubation with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors lavendustin A or genistein, or the Src-specific inhibitor 3-(4-chlorophenyl) 1-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-amine (PP2), did not inhibit the DHPG-mediated depression of the sAHP. However, preincubation with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate reduced the effects of DHPG. This effect of orthovanadate was prevented by simultaneous inhibition of tyrosine kinases with lavendustin A. Selective activation of either mGluR1 or -5 by application of DHPG plus either the mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) or the mGluR1 antagonist (S)-(+)-alpha-amino-4-carboxy-2-methylbenzeneacetic acid (LY367385) demonstrated that the effect of inhibiting tyrosine phosphatases is not specific to either subtype of mGluR. These results suggest that the depression of the sAHP induced by activation of mGluR1 and -5 is gated by a balance between tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.",
