     "AB": "In rats and primates, (+/-)3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) produces both long-lasting damage to serotonergic axons and memory impairment. Our objective was to determine effects of neurotoxic dose of MDMA on long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal area CA1 in Dark-Agouti (DA) rats. One week after neurotoxic MDMA treatment in vivo (12.5mg/kg i.p., once a week, per three weeks), serotonergic deficit was evident in hippocampal slices as 56.3% reduction in 5-HT content (p=0.04) and as 68.4% reduction in the effect of endogenous 5-HT release on synaptic neurotransmission (p<0.01). In hippocampal slices from the same animals, LTP was on average 46% greater than that observed in sham-treated controls (42.9 +/- 3.5%; n=12 vs. 29.2 +/- 3.2%; n=12; p<0.01). Non-neurotoxic dose of MDMA (12.5 mg/kg, i.p., one time) did not change LTP one week after the treatment, suggesting correlation between serotonergic deficit and enhanced synaptic plasticity. We conclude that MDMA-induced impairment of learning and memory is not a consequence of hippocampal LTP inhibition.",
