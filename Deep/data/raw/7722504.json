     "AB": "The effect of three metabolic inhibitors--iodoacetate, potassium cyanide, and potassium arsenate--on neuronal viability was studied in primary rat cortical and hippocampal CA1 neuronal cultures. Iodoacetate (0.1 mM) applied for 5 min to 8-day-old cultures resulted in delayed neuronal death within 3-24 h in cortical and hippocampal CA1 neurons. Neuronal degeneration was preceded by transient inhibition of energy metabolism to approximately 40% and a permanent inhibition of protein synthesis to approximately 50%. The inhibition of protein synthesis and the neuronal death were prevented by the free radical scavenger vitamin E but not by the glutamate antagonist MK-801. Removal of calcium during iodoacetate exposure could not protect against toxicity, and there was no increase of intracellular calcium concentration during and shortly after iodoacetate treatment. Cyanide and arsenate produced only partial neuronal degeneration, even at a dose of 10 mM. These observations demonstrate that brief exposure of neurons to low concentrations of iodoacetate produces a delayed type of neuronal death that is not mediated by either calcium or glutamate. The therapeutic effect of vitamin E points to a free-radical mediated injury and suggests that this type of pathology may also be involved in delayed neuronal death after transient energy depletion in vivo.",
