     "AB": "Tinnitus is the perception of phantom sound without an external auditory stimulus. Using neuroimaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography, electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), many studies have demonstrated that abnormal functions of the central nervous system are closely associated with tinnitus. In our previous research, we reported using resting-state fMRI that several brain regions, including the rectus gyrus, cingulate gyrus, thalamus, hippocampus, caudate, inferior temporal gyrus, cerebellar hemisphere, and medial superior frontal gyrus, were associated with tinnitus distress and loudness. To reconfirm these results and probe target regions for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), we investigated the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) between younger tinnitus patients (<60 years old) and the age-matched controls using single-photon emission computed tomography and easy Z-score imaging system. Compared with that of controls, the rCBF of tinnitus patients was significantly lower in the bilateral medial superior frontal gyri, left middle occipital gyrus and significantly higher in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and vermis, bilateral middle temporal gyri, right fusiform gyrus. No clear differences were observed between tinnitus patients with normal and impaired hearing. Regardless of the assessment modality, similar brain regions were identified as characteristic in tinnitus patients. These regions are potentially involved in the pathophysiology of chronic subjective tinnitus.",
