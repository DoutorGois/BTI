     "AB": "We have identified alterations in the responses of muscarinic and metabotropic receptors in rat hippocampus that persist for at least 15 days after central fluid percussion injury. This study compares the effect of lateral fluid percussion and central fluid percussion on these responses. Moderate injury was obtained by displacement and deformation of the brain within the closed cranial cavity using a fluid percussion device positioned either centrally or laterally. Carbachol and (+/-)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (trans-ACPD)-stimulated polyphosphoinositide (PPI) hydrolysis was assayed in hippocampus from injured and sham-injured controls at 15 days following injury. At 15 days after central fluid percussion traumatic brain injury (TBI), the response to carbachol was enhanced by 30% and the response to trans-ACPD was enhanced by 75% compared to sham-injured animals. At 15 days after lateral fluid percussion TBI the response to trans-ACPD was enhanced by 40% both ipsilateral and contralateral to the side of injury. In contrast, the response to carbachol was enhanced by 29% contralateral to the side of injury but was diminished by 12% ipsilateral to the side of injury. Cresyl violet staining shows no hippocampal cell death after central fluid percussion injury or on the side contralateral to lateral fluid percussion injury but on the ipsilateral side cell death was identified in hippocampal area CA3. Thus, abnormal hippocampal cell signaling through the phosphoinositide pathway occurs in the absence of cell death and may contribute to cognitive impairment.",
