Bath applications of the three synthetic compounds resulted in concentration-dependent and reversible increases in single-unit activity. Comparison of equieffective concentrations yielded the following potency rank order: BDNL greater than CCK8 greater than compound II greater than compound I. There was a close correlation (r = .96, slope = 0.98) between the excitatory activities of the analogs and their potencies in displacing radiolabelled CCK8 from CCK-B receptors on rat brain membranes.",
