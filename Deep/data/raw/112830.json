In the various regions of hippocampus different intensities of GABA-fluorescence were demonstrable: A maximum of intensity being present in the area dentata and in the CA 3 region; it is very low in the CA 1 and CA 4 region. 3. The fluorescence of GABA was found to be localized around the pyramidal neurons and the dentate granule cells, respectively.",
