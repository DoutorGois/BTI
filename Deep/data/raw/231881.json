     "AB": "This report describes the ultratopochemical localization of the thiamine pyrophosphatase in the pyramidal cells of the CA3 region of Wistar rat hippocampus. Attention was focussed on the occurrence of the enzyme out of the Golgi field. Thiamine pyrophosphatase was demonstrated in dendrites and - to a lesser extent - in axons. TTPase containing synapses were rather seldom and belonged to the axo-dendritic type. A hypothetic model concerning the transport and the distribution of the enzyme within the cell is presented.",
