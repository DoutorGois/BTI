     "AB": "In the present study the localization of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP)-expressing cell bodies and PACAP projections were mapped in the adult rat brain and spinal cord by using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization histochemistry. A widespread occurrence of PACAP-containing cell bodies was found, with the greatest accumulation in several hypothalamic nuclei and in several brainstem nuclei, especially the habenular nuclei, the pontine nucleus, the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB), and the vagal complex. PACAP was also present in cell bodies in the olfactory areas, in neocortical areas, in the hippocampus, in the vestibulo- and cochlear nuclei, in cell bodies of the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, in the subfornical organ, and in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. An intense accumulation of PACAP-immunoreactive (-IR) nerve fibers was observed throughout the hypothalamus, in the amydaloid and extended amygdaloid complex, in the anterior and paraventricular thalamic nuclei, in the intergeniculate leaflet, in the pretectum, and in several brainstem nuclei, such as the parabrachial nucleus, the sensory trigeminal nucleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. PACAP-IR nerve fibers were also found in the area postrema, the posterior pituitary and the choroid plexus, and the dorsal and ventral horn of the spinal cord. The widespread distribution of PACAP in the brain and spinal cord suggests that PACAP is involved in the control of many autonomic and sensory functions as well as higher cortical processes.",
