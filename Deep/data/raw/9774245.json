     "AB": "The role of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu receptors) in mechanisms of long-term potentiation was investigated by analysis of excitatory postsynaptic field potentials of the CA1 region in rat hippocampal slices. The application of the group II agonists (2S,1'S,2'S)-2-(carboxycyclopropyl) glycine (L-CCG-I) and (2S,1'R,2'R,3'R)-2-(2',3'-dicarboxycyclopropyl) glycine (DCG IV) resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of long term potentiation in the concentration range 3-50 microM. In contrast to the effects of group II agonists on long-term potentiation, the group II antagonists (RS)-alpha-methyl-3-carboxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycine (M3C4HPG) and (RS)-alpha-methylserine-O-phosphate monophenyl ester (MSOPPE) elicited a dose-dependent enhancement of long-term potentiation (50-100 microM or 20-50 microM, respectively). We conclude that group II mGlu receptors are not essential for the induction of long-term potentiation; however, they may be involved in feedback mechanisms in long-term potentiation.",
