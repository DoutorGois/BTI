     "AB": "The LD50s and ED50s for inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in whole mouse brain by DFP (diisopropylfluorophosphate), sarin (methylphosphonofluoridic acid 1-methyl ethyl ester), soman (methylphosphonofluoridic acid 1,2,2-trimethyl propyl ester), and tabun (dimethylphosphoramidocyanidic acid ethyl ester) were compared after iv administration. The LD50s of DFP, sarin, soman, and tabun in ICR (Institute for Cancer Research) mice were 3.40, 0.109, 0.042, and 0.287 mg/kg, respectively. The recovery of AChE activity in whole mouse brain after sub-LD50 doses of these agents was slow and did not reach control values by 14 d after iv administration. AChE activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in whole mouse brain, as well as in six brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, striatum, midbrain, medulla-pons, and cerebellum). None of these brain areas appeared to be particularly sensitive to AChE inhibition. The ED50s for DFP, sarin, soman, and tabun for inhibition of AChE in whole mouse brain were approximately 19, 38, 69, and 66% of their respective LD50s. Because of the differential potencies between lethality and inhibition of AChE, it is concluded that the lethality of these agents is due to more factors than simply the inhibition of AChE within the brain.",
