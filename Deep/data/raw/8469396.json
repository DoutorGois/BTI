     "AB": "The permeability-surface area product (PA) of [1-14C]palmitate at the blood-retina (BRB) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) was determined after short carotid perfusion in male Sprague-Dawley rats at 4, 14 and 28 months of age. For the retina, optic nerve and tract, lateral geniculate body, visual and parietal cortex, there was no significant difference among mean PAs in any age group. For superior colliculus, frontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus and olfactory bulb, a slight but significant increase of PA values was observed between young (4-month-old) and senescent (28-month-old) rats. Our results indicate that aging does not affect influx into retina and other structures of rat visual system of the palmitate, a metabolic substrate for which carrier-mediated transport across the BRB and BBB has not been demonstrated.",
