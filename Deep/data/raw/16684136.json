     "AB": "Hippocampal neuropathology is a recognised feature of the brain in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), but similar studies are lacking in another model of hypertension, the mineralocorticoid-salt-treated rat. The present study aimed to compare changes in hippocampal parameters in 16-week-old male SHR (blood pressure approximately 190 mmHg) and their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto controls, with those of male Sprague-Dawley rats receiving (i) 10 mg deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) every other day during 3 weeks and drinking 1% NaCl solution (blood pressure approximately 160 mmHg) and normotensive controls treated with (ii) DOCA and drinking water, (iii) drinking water only or (iv) 1% NaCl only. In these experimental groups, we determined: (i) cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG) using the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-labelling technique; (ii) the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive astrocytes under the CA1, CA3 and DG; (iii) the number of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) positive astrocytes as a marker of potential neuronal damage; and (iv) the number of neurones in the hilus of the DG, taken as representative of neuronal density in other hippocampal subfields. Changes were remarkably similar in both models, indicating a decreased cell proliferation in DG, an increased number of astrocytes immunopositive for GFAP and ApoE and a reduced number of hilar neurones. Although hypertension may be a leading factor for these abnormalities, endocrine mechanisms may be involved, because hypothalamic-pituitary function, mineralocorticoid receptors and sensitivity to mineralocorticoid treatment are stimulated in SHR, whereas high exogenous mineralocorticoid levels circulate in DOCA-treated rats. Thus, in addition to the deleterious effects of hypertension, endocrine factors may contribute to the abnormalities of hippocampus in SHR and DOCA-treated rats.",
