     "AB": "The therapeutic efficacy of mood stabilizers may involve the regulation of gene expression mediated by transcription factor activation. In this study, we investigated AP-1 and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) DNA-binding activity in the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats fed a control diet, a lithium diet for 7 wk, or 6 wk of lithium, followed by withdrawal for 7 d. Subsequently, animals were exposed to restraint stress or no stress and the DNA-binding activities assessed at 2, 8 and 24 h post-stress. AP-1 activity was increased in both brain regions by lithium, an effect that persisted with lithium discontinuation. Restraint stress induced AP-1 activity in the frontal cortex of the control group. This stress-induced effect on AP-1 activity was attenuated in lithium-treated and lithium-withdrawn animals. AP-1 DNA binding was also induced by stress in the hippocampus of control animals and the activity diminished over time in the lithium and lithium-withdrawn groups. CREB activity also increased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the lithium-treated group. Stress increased CREB activity in the frontal cortex of the controls, and was slightly attenuated with lithium treatment. CREB activity in the hippocampus was insensitive to stress. The proteins involved in the AP-1 and CREB transcription complexes were also characterized. Our findings of increased AP-1 and CREB binding after lithium are consistent with lithium's inhibitory effect on glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, which has been show to negatively regulate AP-1 and CREB transcriptional activity.",
