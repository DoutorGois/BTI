Although recent work has begun to address the significance of mossy fiber reorganization, the specific and overall functional consequences of these network changes remain poorly understood. New studies are beginning to provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Advances in our understanding of the causes and effects of mossy fiber reorganization are likely to provide insight into the pathophysiology of temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as the larger issue of network remodeling following nervous system injury.",
