     "AB": "Calmodulin is a calcium-binding protein that is highly abundant in the brain, where it is involved in many essential functions. The protein is mainly expressed by neuronal cells. Calmodulin is encoded by three different genes in mammals, all of them producing an identical protein. Alterations in the expression of either calmodulin genes or protein have been reported in the rodent brain by several authors in different experimental situations. However, no mention has been made to date of possible alterations in calmodulin expression in glial cells in response to certain stimuli. In the present study, we found an increase in the expression of calmodulin in reactive microglial cells in the mouse hippocampus 24 h after an intraperitoneal administration of a convulsant dose of kainic acid. The results show that a high expression of calmodulin can be added to the list of changes described to occur in microglial cells when they become reactive microglia in response to certain kinds of stimuli, in contrast to the non-detectable level of expression of this protein observed in the resting microglial cells. It is difficult to explain such an increase due to the great number of processes in which calmodulin is involved, but the great level of calmodulin observed in the reactive microglial cells shows that calmodulin immunolabelling can be used to reveal these kinds of cells.",
