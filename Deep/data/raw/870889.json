     "AB": "The effect of injection of serotonin (5-HT), dissolved in 2 mul of bidistilled water, into hippocampus was studied in rabbits with chronically implanted electrodes and cannulas. Bioelectric activity of gyrus cinguli, amygdaloid nucleus, and dorsal hippocampus was recorded. 5-HT (10--20 mug) inhibited the electrical activity of the structures investigated, and this inhibition was accompanied by a suppression of locomotor activity or sleep.",
