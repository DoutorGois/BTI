     "AB": "Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes are expressed in the brain; however, their role in hippocampus-dependent and cortex-dependent cognitive functions remains to be fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to comparatively investigate the effects of piroxicam, a selective COX-I inhibitor, and celecoxib, a selective COXII inhibitor, on cognitive functions in an AlCl3induced neurotoxicity mouse model to understand the specific role of each COX enzyme in the hippocampus and cortex. The AlCl3 (250 mg/kg) was administered to the mice in drinking water and the drugs were administered in feed for 30 days. Assessments of memory, including a Morris water maze, social behavior and nesting behavior were performed in control and treated mice. The RNA expression of the COX enzymes were analyzed using reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. An exvivo 2,2Diphenyl1picrylhydrazyl assay was performed in the hippocampus and cortex. Following 30 days of treatment with thedrugs, the mice in the celecoxib and piroxicamtreated groups exhibited enhanced learning (6.84 +/- 0.76 and 9.20 +/- 1.08, respectively), compared with the AlCl3induced neurotoxicity group (21.14 +/- 0.76) on the fifth day of the Morris water maze test. Celecoxib treatment improved social affiliation in the AlCl3induced neurotoxicity group, the results of which were superior to piroxicam. Piroxicam led to better improvement in nesting score in the AlCl3induced neurotoxicity group. Both drugs decreased the expression levels of COXI and COXII in the hippocampus and cortex, and rescued oxidative stress levels. These findings suggested that each drug distinctly affected cognitive functions, highlighting the distinctive roles of COX-I and COX-II in learning and memory.",
