     "AB": "We studied whether eugenol provides neuroprotection against delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region following a 5 min occlusion of the common carotid arteries bilaterally under either free-regulating temperature (TF) or maintained temperature (TM, 37 degrees C) conditions in gerbils. Right after occlusion of the carotid arteries, we injected eugenol intraperitoneally at concentrations of either 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg. There was significant preservation of neuronal cells in the CA1 region in the eugenol-treated groups 7 days after the ischemic insult in the TF condition, with respective survival values of 26, 43, and 68%. In the TM condition, however, significant neuroprotection was only seen with eugenol concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/kg (32% and 52%, respectively). When the rectal temperature was maintained at 38 degrees C for 30 min after occlusion of the carotid arteries, no reduction in CA1 damage was observed with any dose of eugenol. These results suggest that eugenol may provide neuroprotection against ischemic damage by its hypothermic action.",
