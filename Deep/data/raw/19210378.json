     "AB": "Abstract The concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the activity of sodium-fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase was measured in 29 microdissected brain areas of homozygous Brattleboro rats and their Long-Evans control rats. In ten of the investigated brain areas a decreased cAMP level was measured in Brattleboro rats. It was particularly decreased in the supraoptic nucleus, cingulate and parietal cortex, hippocampus, habenula and organum vasculosum laminae terminalis. Significantly lower cAMP levels were also found in the periventricular nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, area postrema and locus coeruleus. An increased cAMP concentration was detected only in the subcommissural organ of Brattleboro rats. In most brain areas, where cAMP was decreased, sodium fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was significantly increased (supraoptic nucleus, parietal cortex, periventricular nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, locus coeruleus) or unchanged (hippocampus, habenula, organum vasculosum laminae terminalis). The coincidence of alterations in cAMP concentration and adenylate cyclase activity in brain areas of Brattleboro rats with relatively dense vasopressinergic innervation and/or vasopressin receptor population in control rats, suggests an influence of brain vasopressin on the cAMP-adenylate cyclase second messenger system.",
