     "AB": "Mathematical models of the excitatory synapse are providing valuable information about the synaptic response. The effects of several synaptic components on EPSC variability have been tested by computer simulation. Our model, based on Brownian diffusion of glutamate in the synaptic cleft, is basically the same we have used in previous papers but parameters have been upgraded according to the new experimental findings. The presence of filaments into the synaptic cleft and the number and the ratio of AMPA and NMDA receptors have been the main parameters upgraded. A different way of computing the binding probability of glutamate molecules to receptors by means of geometrical considerations has been also used. The obtained results were more precise and they suggested that the new elements can play a significant role in the stochastic variability of the synaptic response. Nevertheless, new problems arise concerning the value of the lower limit of the binding probability.",
