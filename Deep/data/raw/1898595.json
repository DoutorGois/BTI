     "AB": "Differentiating neurons initially extend neurites that are the precursors of axons and dendrites. The temporal pattern of neurite outgrowth has been studied extensively, but mostly qualitative analyses have been used to study this phenomenon. We have examined neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons in primary cultures using a polyclonal antibody against microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and a novel monoclonal antibody against the phosphorylated form of high neurofilament subunit (NF-H). These antibodies serve as markers for dendrites and axons, respectively. The neurite staining patterns were quantified during the first 10 days in culture and the analysis revealed that primary processes undergo three phases of differentiation: (i) in the first 24 h, the majority of primary neurites express MAP2 only and a small percentage express both MAP2 and NF-H; (ii) between 24 and 48 h, NF-H expression increases and it is coexpressed with MAP2 in many neurites as they begin to lengthen; and (iii) between 48 h and 4 days, MAP2 and NF-H protein expression occurs in separate populations of neurites. While most of the earliest forming primary neurites appear to be dendritic (MAP2 only), the coexpression of dendritic and axonal protein markers in a group of early forming processes suggests that these neurites may not be predetermined to become a dendrite or an axon. Our data also indicate that NF-H is detectable early in primary neurite development and that, based on in vivo localization and morphology of cultured neurites, the phosphorylated form of NF-H is concentrated in axons.",
