     "AB": "Memory impairments of passive avoidance response were observed in 38 Wistar rats with bilateral fornix-fimbria transection. After fornix-fimbria lesions the degree of performance decreased from 65.3% to 13.6% (P < 0.01). Autotransplantation of superior cervical ganglion (SCG) into bilateral dorsal hippocampi improved memory function to a considerable extent. In the end of the behavioral experiments, implanted rats were sacrificed for histofluorescence study of grafts and measurement of norepinephrine (NA) content in the hippocampus. These experiments showed that the hippocampal NA content in implanted rats was considerably higher than that in untransplanted fornix-fimbria transected rats and consequently suggested that improvement of memory function was to some extent due to supplement of monoamine transmitter by the transplanted SCG.",
