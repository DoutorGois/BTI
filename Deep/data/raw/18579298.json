     "AB": "In this study, neural stem cells (NSCs) were obtained from the hippocampus using the serum-free culturing. NSCs labeled with 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) were transplanted into transected rat basal forebrain followed by the injection of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) into the lateral ventricle. Nestin staining and double-labeling immunohistochemistry were used to detect cell survival and neuronal differentiation of the BrdU labeled cells in the basal forebrain and it was observed that labeled NSCs differentiated into neurons and astrocytes in the basal forebrain. Immunohistochemical detection of p75(NGFR) indicated that the number of cholinergic neurons of the combination groups treated by NSCs, BDNF, and NSCs groups had more significant improvement than that of the injured groups in medial septum (MS) and vertical diagonal branch (VDB). Learning and memory abilities were also measured by Y-maze test and the results support that BDNF can enhance the treatment effects of NSCs transplanted into brain lesion model.",
