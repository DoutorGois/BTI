     "AB": "The ultrastructural features of the serotoninergic innervation of the rat dentate gyrus in normal adults and in animals receiving raphe nuclear area transplants was investigated using an antibody to serotonin (5-HT). Neonatal rats received a lesion of the fimbria-fornix and entorhinal cortex. Three days later, a portion of embryonic (E-16-18) raphe nuclear area was transplanted to the entorhinal cavity and the animals were allowed to survive for 60 days. Animals were processed for the immunocytochemical localization of 5-HT using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. Light microscopic observation showed that 5-HT-containing fibers from transplanted raphe neurons densely innervated the hilar and molecular zones of the dentate gyrus. Electron microscopic analysis showed that 5-HT immunoreactivity was contained only in axons and axon varicosities. There were no differences in the ultrastructural characteristics of axons and axon terminals between normal animals and those which had received raphe transplants. A mixture of both conventional synaptic junctions and non-synaptic axonal swellings were found in both groups.",
