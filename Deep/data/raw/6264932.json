     "AB": "Neuronal activity, recorded in the dorsal hippocampus (CA3) during classical conditioning, was studied in rats receiving mild post-trial stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation. Hippocampal multi-unit activity increased in response to an auditory signal (conditioned stimulus) after pairing of the signal with a footshock (unconditioned stimulus), while the auditory signal alone, presented before conditioning, did not change the rate of hippocampal cell discharges. Trial-by-trial analysis of hippocampal multi-unit responses to the conditioned stimulus, both during acquisition and during a test of long-term retention, indicated that post-trial mesencephalic reticular stimulation hastened the onset of cellular conditioning and facilitated conversion to long-term storage. A study of evoked potentials recorded in the hippocampal formation to stimulation of the perforant path in awake rats, suggested that these effects could be mediated through a modulation of synaptic efficiency within hippocampal neuronal networks. These data are discussed in relation to the concept of neural perseveration in memory consolidation.",
