     "AB": "Aspartate, an excitatory amino acid, is known to be stored in synaptic vesicles and exocytosed from some neurons to perform aspartergic neurotransmission. Through in vitro reconstitution, we found that sialin, a lysosomal sialic acid exporter, is responsible for the vesicular storage of aspartate in hippocampal neurons and pinealocytes. Mutations found in Salla disease cause decreased aspartate transport activity without affecting sialic acid transport. Thus, sialin is a multifunctional transporter. It is possible that people with Salla disease lose the ability of aspartergic neurotransmission, and this could explain why Salla disease involves severe neurological defects.",
