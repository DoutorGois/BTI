The frameless stereotactic Viewing Wand System was used to provide real-time correlation of the operating field and computerized images in over 22 neurosurgical operations carried out for intractable epilepsy. The overall results of the surgery demonstrated favorable results, with class 1 + class 2 outcomes in 86.4% of the present series. Our experience shows that the Viewing Wand System is most helpful as an adjunctive navigational device in the microsurgical treatment of epilepsy.",
