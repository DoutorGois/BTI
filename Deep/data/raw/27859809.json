     "AB": "Mice lacking the intracellular glucocorticoid-regenerating enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) are protected from age-related spatial memory deficits. 11beta-HSD1 is expressed predominantly in the brain, liver and adipose tissue. Reduced glucocorticoid levels in the brain in the absence of 11beta-HSD1 may underlie the improved memory in aged 11beta-HSD1 deficient mice. However, the improved glucose tolerance, insulin sensitisation and cardioprotective lipid profile associated with reduced peripheral glucocorticoid regeneration may potentially contribute to the cognitive phenotype of aged 11beta-HSD1 deficient mice. In the present study, transgenic mice with forebrain-specific overexpression of 11beta-HSD1 (Tg) were intercrossed with global 11beta-HSD1 knockout mice (HSD1KO) to examine the influence of forebrain and peripheral 11beta-HSD1 activity on spatial memory in aged mice. Transgene-mediated delivery of 11beta-HSD1 to the hippocampus and cortex of aged HSD1KO mice reversed the improved spatial memory retention in the Y-maze but not spatial learning in the watermaze. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA levels in the hippocampus of aged HSD1KO mice were increased compared to aged wild-type mice. Rescue of forebrain 11beta-HSD1 reduced BDNF mRNA in aged HSD1KO mice to levels comparable to aged wild-type mice. These findings indicate that 11beta-HSD1 regenerated glucocorticoids in the forebrain and decreased levels of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus play a role in spatial memory deficits in aged wild-type mice, although 11beta-HSD1 activity in peripheral tissues may also contribute to spatial learning impairments in aged mice.",
