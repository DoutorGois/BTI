     "AB": "Mutations of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), a metalloenzyme catalyzing the conversion of superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), are linked to motor neuron degeneration. Transgenic mouse strains overexpressing wild-type human SOD1 (Tg-SOD1) were shown to have mitochondrial swelling, vacuolization, or learning and memory deficits and are widely used for biochemical, genetic, and cognitive studies; this, along with the advent of advanced proteomic methods, made us investigate protein expression in hippocampus. Hippocampal tissues of wild-type, hemizygous, and homozygous Tg-SOD1 mice were isolated and used for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight identification. We identified several synaptosomal, neuronal, antioxidant, and mitochondrial proteins in hippocampus, and expression levels of syntaxin-binding protein 1, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, synaptosomal-associated protein 25, dynamin-1, neurofilament triplet L protein, neurofilament triplet M protein, neuronal tropomodulin, and neuronal protein 25 were significantly decreased in Tg-SOD1. None of the antioxidant proteins were altered except mouse SOD1. Mitochondrial ATP synthase alpha/beta chain and elongation factor Tu were aberrant in Tg-SOD1. We conclude that derangement of neuronal and mitochondrial proteins may indicate synaptosomal and neuronal loss in Tg-SOD1 hippocampus, already reported in morphological terms. This observation is of relevance to understanding brain deficits in Down syndrome, as SOD1 is encoded on chromosome 21.",
