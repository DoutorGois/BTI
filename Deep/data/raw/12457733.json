     "AB": "Analysis of extracellular recordings of evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials and population spikes from rat hippocampal slices has previously revealed that repeated, brief exposures to high extracellular K(+) or to episodes of hypoxia induce a sustained (more than 3 h) hyperexcitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons accompanied with epileptiform activity which was dependent on activation of L-type Ca(2+) channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Using in vitro phosphorylation assay we have found the significant increase of Ca(2+)-independent activity of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in CA1 region of hippocampal slices 60 min after the high extracellular K(+) and 60-80 min after the hypoxic episodes. These data suggest possible involvement of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms of the maintenance phase of the observed epileptiform activity.",
