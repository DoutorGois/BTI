     "AB": "Electroconvulsive shock (ECS) may affect several neurotransmitter systems in brain, including the GABAergic inhibitory system. We used a quantitative PCR-based assay to evaluate mRNAs for five GABAa receptor subunits at 2 to 24 h after ECS. mRNAs for the alpha 1 and beta 2 subunits were significantly increased in cerebellum at 4 and 8 h after ECS, and returned to control levels at 24 h. No changes were observed in alpha 2, beta 3, gamma 1, or gamma 2 subunits, and no changes in any subunit evaluated were observed in cortex or hippocampus. These data corroborate prior results obtained for the alpha 1 subunit using Northern hybridization, and illustrate the utility of the PCR assay in quantitating low-abundance mRNAs.",
