     "AB": "The interactions between 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 8-hydroxy-2-(N,N-dipropylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), buspirone, 2-(4-(4-(2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazinyl)butyl)-1,2-benzisothiazol-3- (2H)one-1, 1-dioxide-hydrochloride (TVX Q 7821) and ketanserin, and putative 5-HT receptors were analyzed using both radioligand techniques and an in vitro hippocampal slice preparation. The potencies of the drugs were determined at 5-HT1A binding sites labelled by [3H]8-OH-DPAT in hippocampal membranes from the rat. The binding site had similar affinity for 5-HT, 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone and TVX Q 7821, whereas ketanserin was essentially inactive. Physiological effects of these drugs were also examined using an in vitro hippocampal slice preparation. With the exception of ketanserin, application of each drug to the bath modulated the amplitude of the field potential recorded in the pyramidal layer of CA1 evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. Application of micromolar concentrations of 5-HT produced an initial increase in the population spike followed by a return to near baseline levels within 5 min. By contrast, the amplitude of the population spike was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by micromolar concentrations of 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone and TVX Q 7821, beginning 5 min after application of drug. Ketanserin did not affect the amplitude of the population spike and it did not antagonize the effects of 5-HT, buspirone or TVX Q 7821. Neither buspirone nor 8-OH-DPAT altered the initial increase in population spike induced by 5-HT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
