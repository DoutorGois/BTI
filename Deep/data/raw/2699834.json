     "AB": "The release of ACh appears to be under the control of autoreceptors localized on cholinergic nerve terminals. Moreover, the process can be regulated by transmitters other than ACh or by modulators either through receptor-mediated or carrier-mediated mechanisms. In this chapter we report on our recent results concerning the regulation of the release of ACh by ACh itself, 5-HT and GABA in the rat hippocampus. In particular it will be shown: 1) that the release of the cholinergic transmitter can be inhibited through muscarinic receptors of the M3 subtype; 2) that 5-HT can interact with ACh by depressing ACh release through the activation of receptors of the 5-HT1B subtype; 3) that the release of ACh can be enhanced by GABA by a novel mechanism involving a selective penetration of the amino acid into the cholinergic terminals.",
