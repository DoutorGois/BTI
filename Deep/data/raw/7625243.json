     "AB": "We studied the effects of electro-acupuncture (EA) on C-FOS expression as well as on the histological changes in various regions of hippocampus in the gerbil acute global ischemia model. EA was administered at points of 'Feng-fu' and 'Jin-suo' with a frequency of 7 Hz and an intensity of 6 mA for 30 minutes. EA can substantially potentiate the induction of C-FOS protein like immunoreactivity (CFPLI) in neurons of various regions in hippocampus following transient global ischemia, especially in the CA1 subfield. At the same time EA can prevent most of the CA1 cells from delayed degeneration after ischemia. These results indicate that EA has the protective effect on neurons of hippocampus after cerebral ischemia and C-FOS may be involved in this process.",
