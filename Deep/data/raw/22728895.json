     "AB": "STOX1A is a transcription factor which is functionally and structurally similar to the forkhead box protein family. STOX1A has been shown to be associated with pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy associated disease, and to have potential implications in late onset Alzheimer's disease. However, the exact function of STOX1A and its target genes are still largely unknown. Therefore, in this study we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to shotgun cloning to discover novel STOX1A target genes. Our results show that CNTNAP2, a member of the neurexin family, is directly downregulated by STOX1A. Additionally, we show that CNTNAP2 expression is downregulated in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease patients where STOX1A expression has been shown to be upregulated. In conclusion, these results further indicate the potential involvement of STOX1A and its target genes in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.",
