     "AB": "Cognitive disturbances after traumatic brain injury (TBI) are frequent, even when neuroimaging shows no overt hemorrhagic or other abnormality. Sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) plays a key role in various forms of CNS injury, but its role in hippocampal dysfunction after mild to moderate TBI is unknown. To assess the hypothesis that postinjury SUR1 upregulation in the hippocampus is associated with a later disturbance in learning, we studied a rat model of cortical impact TBI calibrated to avoid primary and secondary hemorrhage in the underlying hippocampus. The transcription factor, specificity protein 1, which regulates expression of SUR1 and caspase-3, was activated in the hippocampus 15 minutes after injury. Upregulation of SUR1 protein and of Abcc8 (which encodes SUR1) messenger RNA was evident by 6 hours. To assess the role of SUR1, injured rats were administered vehicle or a low dose of the specific sulfonylurea inhibitor glibenclamide for 1 week. At 2 weeks, the increase in activated caspase-3 in the hilus of glibenclamide-treated rats was half of that in vehicle-treated rats. Testing for rapid learning in a Morris water maze at 4 weeks showed significantly better performance in glibenclamide-treated rats; performance inversely correlated with Fluoro-Jade staining for degenerated neurons in the hilus. We conclude that glibenclamide may have long-term protective effects on the hippocampus after mild-to-moderate TBI.",
