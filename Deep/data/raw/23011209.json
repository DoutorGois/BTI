     "AB": "Curcumin has neuroprotective effect and could enhance memory. However, the mechanisms underlying the protection of curcumin on aging-related memory decline are not well understood. In this study, high frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced long term potentiation (LTP) was evaluated by a cellular model of memory formation. A two-input stimulation paradigm was used to record the potentiation as well as synapse input specificity. The data suggested that an N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) -dependent LTP was inducible in adult hippocampal slices with a characteristic of synapse input specificity. It also indicated that aging resulted in a reduction in LTP but more importantly a loss of synaptic input specificity. The reason behind the above conclusions is that LTP induction is more dependent on the calcium channel. This is due to a switch of the dependence of LTP induction to voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) compared to NMDA receptors. Curcumin administration recovers input specificity by re-establishing NMDA receptor dependence of induction. In addition, curcumin administration ameliorated aging-related increase of brain thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and elevated aging-related decrease of glutathione in hippocampus. It is then concluded that curcumin modulates hippocampal redox status and restores aging-related loss of synapse input specificity of HFS-induced LTP by switching VDCC calcium source into NMDA receptor-dependent one.",
