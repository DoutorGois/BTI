     "AB": "To establish the mechanism of action of the antiepileptic and psychotropic effects of carbamazepine (CBZ), its effects on serotonin (5-HT) transmission, metabolism and re-uptake activity in the rat hippocampus were studied. After acute and chronic administrations of 25 mg/kg CBZ, the plasma concentration of CBZ was found to be within the therapeutic range, whereas both acute and chronic administrations of 50 and 100 mg/kg CBZ resulted in a supratherapeutic plasma concentration. Acute administration of the therapeutic dose of CBZ resulted in an increase in the hippocampal extracellular and total level of 5-HT, its metabolite, 5-hydroxydoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and its precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). The acute administration of 50 mg/kg CBZ resulted in an increase in the hippocampal levels of extracellular 5-HT and 5-HIAA as well as in the total levels of 5-HTP, whereas hippocampal levels of extracellular 5-HTP, total 5-HT and 5-HIAA remained unaffected. CBZ at a dose of 100 mg/kg decreased the levels of all of these substances. After chronic administration, 25 mg/kg/day CBZ increased hippocampal total levels of 5-HT, 5-HTP and 5-HIAA, whereas 100 mg/kg/day CBZ decreased all of these total levels. CBZ at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day decreased total levels of 5-HT, however neither total levels of 5-HIAA nor 5-HTP were affected. Both therapeutic and supratherapeutic plasma concentrations of CBZ inhibited 5-HTP accumulation, and did not affect 5-HT re-uptake activity in vitro. These results suggest that a therapeutic concentration of CBZ enhances 5-HT turnover and transmission, whereas a supratherapeutic concentration of CBZ inhibits 5-HT turnover and transmission without affecting 5-HT re-uptake activity. These effects of CBZ on serotonergic systems may be, at least partially, involved in the mechanisms of action of CBZ.",
