     "AB": "1. Mouse lines lacking prion protein (PrP(C)) have a puzzling phenotypic discrepancy. Some, but not all, developed late-onset ataxia due to Purkinje cell degeneration. 2. Here, we identified aberrant mRNA species in the brain of Ngsk Prnp0/0 ataxic, but not in nonataxic Zrch Prnp0/0 mouse line. These mRNAs were chimeric between the noncoding exons 1 and 2 of the PrP gene (Prnp) and the novel sequence encoding PrP-like protein (PrPLP), a putative membrane glycoprotein with 23% identity to PrP(C) in the primary amino acid structure. The chimeric mRNAs were generated from the disrupted Prnp locus of Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice lacking a part of the Prnp intron 2 and its splice acceptor signal. 3. In the brain of wild-type and Zrch Prnp0/0 mice, PrPLP mRNA was barely detectable. In contrast, in the brain of Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice, PrP/PrPLP chimeric mRNAs were expressed in neurons, at a particularly high level in hippocampus pyramidal cells and Purkinje cells under the control of the Prnp promoter. 4. In addition to the functional loss of PrP(C), ectopic PrPLP expression from the chimeric mRNAs could also be involved in the Purkinje cell degeneration in Ngsk Prnp0/0 mice.",
