     "AB": "In neurons exposed to glutamate, Ca(2)(+) influx triggers intracellular Zn(2)(+) release via an as yet unclear mechanism. As glutamate induces a Ca(2)(+)-dependent cytosolic acidification, the present work tested the relationships among intracellular Ca(2)(+) concentration ([Ca(2)(+)](i)), intracellular pH (pH(i) ), and [Zn(2)(+)](i). Cultured hippocampal neurons were exposed to glutamate and glycine (Glu/Gly), while [Zn(2)(+)](i), [Ca(2)(+)](i) and pH(i) were monitored using FluoZin-3, Fura2-FF, and 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, respectively. Glu/Gly applications decreased pH(i) to 6.1 and induced intracellular Zn(2)(+) release in a Ca(2)(+)-dependent manner, as expected. The pH(i) drop reduced the affinity of FluoZin-3 and Fura-2-FF for Zn(2)(+). The rate of Glu/Gly-induced [Zn(2)(+)](i) increase was not correlated with the rate of [Ca(2)(+)](i) increase. Instead, the extent of [Zn(2)(+)](i) elevations corresponded well to the rate of pH(i) drop. Namely, [Zn(2)(+)](i) increased more in more highly acidified neurons. Inhibiting the mechanisms responsible for the Ca(2)(+)-dependent pH(i) drop (plasmalemmal Ca(2)(+) pump and mitochondria) counteracted the Glu/Gly-induced intracellular Zn(2)(+) release. Alkaline pH (8.5) suppressed Glu/Gly-induced intracellular Zn(2)(+) release whereas acidic pH (6.0) enhanced it. A pH(i) drop to 6.0 (without any Ca(2)(+) influx or glutamate receptor activation) led to intracellular Zn(2)(+) release; the released Zn(2)(+) (free Zn(2)(+) plus Zn(2)(+)) bound to Fura-2FF and FluoZin-3) reached 1 muM.",
