     "AB": "In the present study we describe the morphological characteristics of dentate granule cells in intracerebral allografts of the rat fascia dentata. Blocks of hippocampal tissue containing the fascia dentata were taken from late embryonic and newborn rats and transplanted to the hippocampal region of other newborn and young adult rats. After survival periods of several months the recipient brains were fixed by perfusion and serially sectioned on a Vibratome. Some sections were stained with thionin to determine the localization and general histological organization of the transplants, while others were Golgi stained with a modification of the section Golgi technique. Well-impregnated transplant granule cells were gold-toned and deimpregnated thus allowing a correlated, light and electron microscopic analysis of identified neurons to be done. At the light microscopic level the morphology of the dentate granule cells in the transplants was very similar to Golgi-impregnated, gold-toned granule cells in the fascia dentata of normal rats (controls). A few irregular, more obliquely curved dendrites occurred, but basal dendrites passing into the hilar region were never observed. Following an initial spine-free segment granule cell dendrites were densely covered with spines. The axon, the mossy fiber, originated as usual from the basal pole of the cell body. In the electron microscope, both small and larger complex spines (v and w types) were seen to emerge from the gold-toned dendrites of the identified granule cells. The thin unmyelinated granule cell axons gave rise to giant mossy fiber boutons in the dentate hilus, but in addition numerous aberrant mossy fiber terminals were found innermost in the dentate molecular layer just above the granule cell layer. The results demonstrate that dentate granule cells that have gone through the major part of their differentiation after transplantation develop characteristic dendritic and axonal elements very similar to those of granule cells in the fascia dentata in situ. The minor changes observed correspond to the redistribution of intrinsic connections that results from the absence of major extrinsic afferents.",
