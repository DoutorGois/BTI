     "AB": "Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a synthetic endocrine disruptor which causes anxiety like behavior in rodents, though the underlying mechanism is not clearly understood. As excitatory-inhibitory synaptic proteins are the key regulators of anxiety, we have examined the effect of perinatal exposure to BPA on this behavior and the expression of excitatory (PSD95), inhibitory (gephyrin) and presynaptic density marker (synaptophysin) proteins in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 3 and 8 weeks postnatal male mice. In open field (OF) test, BPA exposure reduced the time spent, number of entries and distance travelled in the central zone as compared to control in 8 weeks mice. On the other hand, elevated plus maze (EPM) results showed decrease in time spent and number of entries to the open arms. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis showed significant downregulation of PSD95 and synaptophysin, but upregulation of gephyrin, leading to reduction in excitatory to inhibitory protein ratio and synaptic density in postnatal 3 and 8 weeks mice. Thus, our findings show that the anxiety like behavior due to perinatal exposure to BPA is associated with decrease in excitatory to inhibitory synaptic density in postnatal male mice.",
