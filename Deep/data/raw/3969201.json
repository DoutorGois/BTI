     "AB": "Seventeen patients had type I complex partial seizures (CPS) with three consecutive phases: initial motionless staring, oral-alimentary automatisms, and reactive quasipurposeful movements during impaired consciousness. Fifteen patients had stereoelectroencephalography. Focal or regional 8- to 20-Hz low-voltage epileptiform paroxysms in either hippocampus (10 patients), amygdala (1 patient), or both (1 patient) preceded initial motionless staring. Focal sphenoidal or nasopharyngeal ictal paroxysms preceded seizures in three other patients who underwent lobectomy. All 15 patients are seizure-free 2 to 11 years after temporal lobectomy. Type I CPS are most commonly of hippocampal origin.",
