     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the toxicological mechanism of SO2 on central neural system by electrophysiological method. METHODS: Male SD rats were housed in exposure chambers and treated at the concentration of 28 mg/m3 SO2 for 7 days (6h/d), while control rats were treated with filtered air in the same condition. Using glass micro-electrodes recording in vivo, the frequencies and numbers of spontaneous discharge in hippocampal CAI neurons were measured. Influences of the learning and memory functions were measured by setting up passive avoidance behavior reflex. RESULTS: SO2 decreased significantly the neurons spontaneous discharge frequency and prolonged the neurons spontaneous period in hippocampal CAl. SO2 significantly decreased the learning and memory function of rats. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that SO2 could be a neurotoxin. It could inhibit the hippocampal neurons excitability and affect the learning and memory function of rats.",
