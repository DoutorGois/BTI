Photography of the fluorescent hypothalamic cells was followed by incubation in an acetylthiocholine medium. Slides were re-photographed for acetylcholinesterase-induced reaction product. Nearly all posterior hypothalamic cell afferents to the dentate gyrus could be positively identified as containing acetylcholinesterase.",
