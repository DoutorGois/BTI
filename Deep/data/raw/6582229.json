     "AB": "We describe a simple procedure for the microassay of 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase in homogenates of rat brain. This enzyme converts dihydrotestosterone to 3 alpha-androstandiol. We have mapped the distribution of the enzymatic activity in 14 regions of the rat brain. The highest activities were observed in homogenates of olfactory bulb (51/nmol/mg protein/h) and olfactory tubercle (29 nmol/mg protein/h). Substantially lower values were seen in the other brain regions, including thalamus, caudate nucleus, frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and preoptic area (6-20 nmol/mg protein/h).",
