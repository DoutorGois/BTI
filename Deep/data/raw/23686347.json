     "AB": "Epilepsy prevails to be a neurological disorder in anticipation of safer drugs with enhanced anticonvulsant efficacy as presently available drugs fails to offer adequate control of epileptic seizures in about one-third of patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Trichosanthes tricuspidata methanolic extract (TTME) against epilepsy mediated oxidative stress in pilocarpine induced mice. Intraperitonial administration of pilocarpine (85 mg/kg) induced seizure in mice was assessed by behavior observations, which is significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by TTME (100 and 200 mg/kg; i.p) in a dose dependant manner, similar to diazepam. Seizure was accompanied by significant increase in lipid peroxidation and the hippocampal nitrite content in pilocarpine group when compared with control. Moreover, the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione levels were decreased in pilocarpine administered groups. TTME administration attenuated oxidative damage as evident by decreased lipid oxidative damage and nitrite-nitrate content and restored the level of enzymatic antioxidant defenses in hippocampus. Involvement of free radicals during epilepsy is further confirmed by histopathological analysis which showed the loss of neuronal cells in hippocampus CA1 and CA3 pyramidal region. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that TTME has anticonvulsant activity accompanied with the strong antioxidant potential plays a crucial role in reducing the oxidative stress produced by seizure.",
