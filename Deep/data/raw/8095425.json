     "AB": "Delayed damage to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells was observed in rats subjected to cerebral ischemia caused by 10 min of 4-vessel occlusion. Animals pretreated with alpha-fluoromethylhistidine, a suicide inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase, showed significantly more necrotic cells than did control animals. Mepyramine (H1-antagonist) and (R) alpha-methylhistamine (H3-agonist), but not zolantidine (H2-antagonist), significantly aggravated the delayed neuronal death. These results suggest that histaminergic neurons have a protective role, probably via H1-receptors, in the development of delayed neuronal death caused by cerebral ischemia.",
