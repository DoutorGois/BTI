     "AB": "Drebrin is localized in actin-rich regions of neuronal and non-neuronal cells. In mature neurons, its localization is strictly restricted to the postsynaptic sites. In order to understand the function of drebrin in cells, many studies have been performed to examine the effect of overexpression or knocking down of drebrin in various cell types, including neurons, myoblasts, kidney cells, and intestinal epithelial cells. In most cases alteration of cell shape and impairment or facilitation of actin-based activities of these cells were observed. Interestingly, overexpression of drebrin in matured neurons results in the alteration in dendritic spine morphology. Further studies have shown alteration in the localization of postsynaptic receptors and even changes in synaptic transmission caused by drebrin overexpression or depletion in neurons. These drebrin's effects are thought to come from drebrin's actin-cross-linking activity or competitive binding to actin against tropomyosin, fascin, and alpha-actinin. Furthermore, drebrin binds to various molecules, such as homer, EB3, and cell-cell junctional proteins, indicating that drebrin is a multifunctional cytoskeletal regulator.",
