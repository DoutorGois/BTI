     "AB": "The phenomenon of paradoxical sleep (PS) self-deprivation has been detected and described. The self-deprivation is acquired just as a classical conditioned reflex during enforced PS deprivation both by water tank procedure and by the animal's awakenings in response to sensory stimuli or direct electric stimulation of activating structures of the midbrain and diencephalon, following the transition of slow-wave sleep to PS. In this situation the transition of the brain from one physiological state to another is a conditioned signal, and sensory stimulation or brain stimulation, resulting in arousal reaction, serves as an unconditioned stimulus. It is suggested that the detection and analysis of PS self-deprivation are of a great importance, on the one hand, for correct understanding of the functional significance of this physiological brain state, and, on the other hand, for accurate analysis and assessment of the dissociative processes, observed during PS deprivation and postdeprivation period.",
