     "AB": "The actions of antimuscarinic agents (benztropine, trihexyphenidyl, and scopolamine) on the dynamics of acetylcholine (ACh) in central cholinergic neurons were examined in various rat brain areas. It was found that the pattern of changes in ACh turnover (TRACh) elicited by these drugs exhibited marked regional variations. After administration of the anticholinergic drugs, the TRACh in hippocampus and thalamus was increased, in cortex it was decreased, and in striatum it was unchanged. ACh concentration in the cortex and striatum was decreased while in hippocampus and thalamus ACh levels were unaltered. Further analysis of the cholinergic septo-hippocampal pathway using lesions of the fimbria-fornix and local drug injections into the septum argue against an in vivo action of these drugs on presynaptic or cell body muscarinic autoreceptors. Moreover, the data suggest that muscarinic receptor blockers cause an increased TRACh only in those areas where a feedback loop is operative, possibly by inhibiting a neuronal feedback loop involving at least one noncholinergic interneuron.",
