     "AB": "Group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu II) receptors subtype 2 and 3 (mGlu2 and mGlu3) are subtle regulators of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. In recent years, researchers have investigated the potential neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effects of compounds acting on mGlu II receptors. However, abnormal expression and function of mGlu2 and mGlu3 have been reported in temporal lobe epilepsy, a phenomena that may limit the therapeutic effectiveness of these potentially new antiepileptic drugs. Here, we investigated seizure-induced changes in mGlu2 and mGlu3 mRNA following pilocarpine-inducted status epilepticus (SE) and subsequent epileptogenesis. Relative changes in gene expression were assessed by comparative analysis of quantitative real-time PCR (qrtPCR) by the delta-delta CT method. Pilocarpine-treated and control rats were sacrificed at different periods (24 h, 10 days, one month and more than two months) following SE. Total RNA was isolated from microdissected dentate gyrus and processed for RT-PCR and qrtPCR using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an endogenous control gene. Analysis of relative quantification (RQ) ratios of mGlu2 and mGlu3 mRNA expression revealed a significant down-regulation of both targets at 24 h after SE. Gene expression partially recovered at 10 days following SE reaching control levels at one month after SE. Two month after SE, mGlu2 mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated to approximately 41% of control expression whereas mGlu3 mRNA was comparable to control levels. Our data indicate that mGlu2 and mGlu3 expression is dynamically down-regulated or selectively enhanced during critical periods of epileptogenesis. Seizure-induced differential dysregulation of mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors may affect the availability of these molecular targets for therapeutic compounds in epilepsy.",
