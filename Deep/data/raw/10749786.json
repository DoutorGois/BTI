     "AB": "We have examined whether activation of carotid artery chemoreceptors causes alerting in conscious rabbits. Injection of phenylbiguanide (a 5-hydroxytryptamine(3)-receptor agonist) into the common carotid artery of conscious rabbits increased the proportion of theta rhythm in the hippocampal EEG, commencing in the first 5-s epoch after the injection. Intravenous injection of phenylbiguanide also increased the proportion of theta rhythm in the hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG), but the onset of the change was not until the second 5-s epoch following injection. Injection of Ringer solution, either into the common carotid artery or into the marginal ear vein, did not affect the hippocampal EEG. Results suggest that phenylbiguanide-mediated activation of carotid and cardiopulmonary chemoreceptor afferents alerts the animal, as assessed by induction of theta rhythm in the hippocampal EEG. This alerting response presumably reflects the action of neural inputs that enter the brain with the carotid sinus nerve at the level of the medulla oblongata.",
