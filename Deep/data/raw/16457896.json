     "AB": "This study examined the relationship between hippocampal place fields and spatial working memory. Place cells were recorded while rats solved a spatial working memory task in light and dark testing conditions. Rats made significantly more errors when tested in darkness, and although place fields changed in multiple ways in darkness, only changes in place field specificity predicted the degree of impaired spatial memory. This finding suggests that more spatially distinct place fields may contribute to hippocampal-dependent mnemonic functions.",
