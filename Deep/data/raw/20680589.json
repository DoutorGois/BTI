     "AB": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-tandem mass spectrometric method (MALDI-MS/MS) has proven to be a reliable tool for direct measurement of the disposition of small molecules in animal tissue sections. As example, MALDI-MS/MS imaging system was employed for visualizing the spatial distribution of astemizole and its primary metabolite in rat brain tissues. Astemizole is a second-generation antihistamine, a block peripheral H1 receptor, which was introduced to provide comparable therapeutic benefit but was withdrawn in most countries due to toxicity risks. Astemizole was observed to be heterogeneously distributed to most parts of brain tissue slices including cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamic, thalamus, and ventricle regions while its major metabolite, desmethylastemizole, was only found around ventricle sites. We have shown that astemizole alone is likely to be responsible for the central nervous system (CNS) side effects when its exposures became elevated.",
