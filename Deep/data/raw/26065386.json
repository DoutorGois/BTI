     "AB": "Melatonin, N-aceyl-5-methoxytryptamine, is the main secretory product of the pineal gland and has neuroprotective effects on several brain injuries, including ischemic stroke. In the present study, we hypothesized that exogenous melatonin may decrease hypoglycemia-induced neuronal death through the prevention of superoxide generation. To test our hypothesis, hypoglycemia was induced by injecting human insulin (10 U/kg, i.p.) in rats. Melatonin injection was started immediately after hypoglycemia (10 mg/kg, i.p.). The first melatonin injection was performed at the end of a 30-min isoelectric EEG period. The second and third injections were administered at 1 and 3 h after the first injection. Reactive oxygen species generation, as detected by dihydroethidium staining, was significantly reduced by melatonin treatment. Neuronal injury was reduced by the treatment of melatonin in the hippocampal CA1 and dentate granule cells. Microglia activation was robust in the hippocampus after hypoglycemia, which was almost completely prevented by melatonin treatment. Hypoglycemia-induced cognitive impairment was also significantly prevented by melatonin treatment. The present study suggests that melatonin has therapeutic potential to prevent hypoglycemia-induced brain injury.",
