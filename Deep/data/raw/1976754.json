     "AB": "The present experiments show that somatostatin (SS)-like immunoreactive material is present in the hippocampus and that its release can be increased by K+ stimulation of rat hippocampal slices, suggesting that SS-like peptides may be of significance to neurotransmission in the hippocampus. Exogenous SS-28 and SS-14 enhanced the K(+)-evoked release of endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) from rat hippocampal slices, whereas amino-terminal fragments of SS-28 did not. The increased ACh release in the presence of either peptide appeared to be mediated by an interaction with SS receptors because cyclo-SS, a putative SS antagonist, abolished the effects of both SS-28 and SS-14. In addition, the increase in ACh release induced by SS-14 or SS-28 was antagonized by the calcium channel antagonists omega-conotoxin GVIA, nifedipine, and cinnarizine, implicating voltage-sensitive calcium channels in this effect. Moreover, the effect was sensitive to tetrodotoxin, suggesting an indirect action of the peptides at a site distal to cholinergic nerve terminals. Cysteamine, which has been reported to deplete SS content and to increase SS release in brain, augmented the basal and evoked release of ACh from hippocampal slices, without affecting SS-like content and release. Finally, neuropeptide Y, which is colocalized with SS in many neurons of the hippocampal formation, did not alter ACh release, nor did it facilitate the SS-induced increase. The results suggest that in the rat hippocampus, both SS-28 and SS-14 interact with SS receptors to regulate ACh release indirectly by a mechanism that involves alterations of calcium influx during depolarization.",
