     "AB": "One-hour immobilization stress increased levels of the major metabolite of brain noradrenaline (NA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl-ethyleneglycol sulfate (MHPG-SO4), in nine brain regions of rats. Diazepam at 5 mg/kg attenuated the stress-induced increases in MHPG-SO4 levels in the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebral cortex and locus coeruleus (LC) region, but not in the thalamus, pons plus medulla oblongata excluding the LC region and basal ganglia. The attenuating effects of the drug on stress-induced increases in metabolite levels in the above regions were completely antagonized by pretreatment with Ro 15-1788 at 5 or 10 mg/kg, a potent and specific benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor antagonist. When given alone, Ro 15-1788 did not affect the increases in MHPG-SO4 levels. Behavioral changes observed during immobilization stress such as vocalization and defecation, were also attenuated by diazepam at 5 mg/kg and this action of diazepam was antagonized by Ro 15-1788 at 10 mg/kg, which by itself had no effects on these behavioral measurements. These findings suggest: (1) that diazepam acts via BDZ receptors to attenuate stress-induced increases in NA turnover selectively in the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebral cortex and LC region and (2) that this decreased noradrenergic activity might be closely related to relief of distress-evoked hyperemotionality, i.e., fear and/or anxiety in animals.",
