     "AB": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is known as a successful treatment for severe depression. Despite great efforts, the biological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of ECT remain largely unclear. In this study, animals received a single, 10, or 20 applications of electroconvulsive seizure (ECS), and then cell proliferation and apoptosis were investigated in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus. We analyzed whether a series of ECSs could induce changes in the dentate gyrus in a dose-response fashion. A single-ECS seizure significantly increased cell proliferation in the SGZ by approximately 2.3-fold compared to sham treatment. After 10 ECSs, a significant increase in cell proliferation was observed in the SGZ by approximately 2.4-fold compared to sham treatment. Moreover, 10 ECSs induced a significant increase in cell proliferation by 1.3-fold compared to a single-ECS group. However, cell proliferation did not differ between the group with 20 ECSs and sham group. In addition, a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells was found in the group with 10 ECSs, whereas no significant change in it was found in either a single ECS or 20 ECSs group compared to sham treatment. These findings indicate that the optimal number of treatments and duration of stimulation requires investigation. Further studies are needed to elucidate the intracellular mechanisms underlying both effective and excessive ECT.",
