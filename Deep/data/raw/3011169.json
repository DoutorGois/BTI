     "AB": "The ability of adenosine and structurally-related compounds to inhibit epileptiform activity induced by bicuculline in the CA3 region of the hippocampal slice of the rat was examined. Bath application of all purinoceptor agonists tested reduced the frequency of generation of burst potentials. Analysis of dose-response curves yielded the following IC50 values: adenosine, 1.5 microM; 2-chloroadenosine, 0.144 microM; 5'-(N-ethyl)carboxamidoadenosine, 30.2 nM; L-phenylisopropyladenosine, 12.1 nM; cyclohexyladenosine, 7.9 nM. Theophylline (30 microM) increased the rate of bursting and antagonized the effect of exogenous adenosine. Dipyridamole (0.03-1 microM) reduced the occurrence of burst firing. In slices untreated with bicuculline, theophylline (30 microM) and adenosine deaminase (10 micrograms ml-1) induced bursting activity. These results demonstrate that purinoceptor agonists can suppress epileptiform activity in the hippocampus and suggest that adenosine may act as an endogenous anticonvulsant.",
