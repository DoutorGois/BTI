Identifying cortical inputs to the rat hippocampus that subserves allocentric spatial processes: a simple problem with a complex answer. Hippocampus 2000;10:466-74; Pearce JM. Animal learning and cognition: an introduction. UK: Psychology Press; 1997]. Experiment 1 demonstrates that while water maze retention relies primarily on cue-platform based associations, this strategy is not precise, as animals tend to focus at the side of the pool. In experiment 2, we demonstrate that vestibular rotation eliminates this inaccuracy. These experiments highlight the importance of both cue and vestibular information for accurate retention of the water maze.",
