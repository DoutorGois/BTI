     "AB": "To explore the intracellular pathways activated by vasopressin receptors, the effects of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and its analogues mediating glycine (Gly)-induced Cl(-) currents (I(Gly)) were examined in acutely dissociated rat hippocampal CA1 neurons using the whole-cell patch recording technique. AVP and its analogues inhibited I(Gly) in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory actions of AVP(4-9) (AVP metabolite) and NC-1900 (AVP(4-9) analogue) were reversed by a V(1) receptor antagonist, or pretreatment with 1,2-bis(2-amino-5-fluorophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N', N'-tetraacetic acid. In contrast, these blocking procedures had no effect on the 1-desamino-8-D-AVP (DDAVP; V(2) agonist) action. A V(2) receptor antagonist did not block the inhibitory action of AVP(4-9) or NC-1900, but blocked that of DDAVP. The inhibitory action of AVP was completely blocked by the co-application of the V(1) and V(2) antagonists. The inhibitory action of NC-1900 was not affected by perfusion with a Ca(2+)-free external solution, but was strongly blocked by thapsigargin. The intracellular application of heparin or anti-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP(3)) also blocked the NC-1900 action. Furthermore, Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM) inhibitors blocked the NC-1900 action, while a CaM-dependent kinase II inhibitor and PKC modulators had no effect. 2',5'-Dideoxyadenosine (an adenylate cyclase inhibitor), H-89, and Rp-cAMPS blocked the inhibitory actions of NC-1900 and DDAVP. These results suggest that the activation of the V(1) receptor in the hippocampal neurons induces the production of IP(3), which releases Ca(2+) from the IP(3)-sensitive Ca(2+) storage sites. The Ca(2+) binds to CaM, resulting in the activation of Ca(2+/)CaM-sensitive adenylate cyclases. The activation of protein kinase A through the adenylate cyclase inhibits I(Gly).",
