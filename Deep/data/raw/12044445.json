     "AB": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a neurosignaling molecule that appears to play a significant role in learning and memory. This molecule has also been implicated in neurotoxicity due to its oxidative properties. Previous experiments from our laboratories have demonstrated elevated hippocampal and cortical neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA levels in aged cognitively unimpaired and impaired Long-Evans rats, which could represent either increased neuronal NOS activity thereby leading to NO-mediated neurotoxicity, or a compensatory response by aged neurones to maintain physiological nitric oxide output. The current study measured the protein expression and activity levels of neuronal and inducible NOS in young adult (6 months) and aged (24-26 months) Long-Evans rats by means of western blotting and NOS activity assay. Aged animals were assigned as either cognitively unimpaired or aged with moderate cognitive impairments based on their performances in the Morris water maze behavioural task. Our results showed that hippocampal and cortical neuronal NOS expressions were significantly decreased in aged animals. These aged animals also exhibited increased hippocampal and cortical inducible NOS expressions. Between the two aged animal groups, cognitively impaired rats showed significantly lower hippocampal and cortical neuronal but higher hippocampal inducible NOS expressions. Young adult rats exhibited significantly higher hippocampal and cortical NOS activities than the aged animals. Aged animals with cognitive deficits showed significantly lower hippocampal NOS activity than cognitively unimpaired aged rats. Our data indicate that aging is associated with a decline in neuronal but elevated inducible NOS functioning in brain areas involved in learning and memory. These phenomena could contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in a sub-population of aged animals.",
