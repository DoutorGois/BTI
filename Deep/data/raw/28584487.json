     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The present study was aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of Decalepis hamiltonii (Dh) aqueous root extract and its compounds against age-related oxidative stress (OS) in the discrete regions of the rat brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar albino rats of 4- and 22-month-old were divided into control and six supplemented groups. The supplemented groups were orally administered with ellagic acid (EA), 4-hydroxyisophthalic acid (4-HIA), and Dh extract for 30 days. RESULTS: Age-related decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities was noticed. The hippocampus was found to be more vulnerable to OS as seen by the elevation in the OS markers. Supplementation of the Dh extract, EA, and 4-HIA was found to be effective in up-regulating the antioxidant status. However, the extent of up-regulation was more evident in Dh supplemented animals. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Dh extract and its compounds exhibit neuroprotective effects against age-related OS and can be used as a dietary therapeutic intervention for the treatment of neurological disorders.",
