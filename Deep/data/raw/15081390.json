     "AB": "We examined the effect of nitric oxide (NO) on the expression of phosphorylated cAMP response element binding (pCREB) protein and on the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), in the hippocampus of the adult rat, by administering 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) for 5 days, to block neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity. It was found that PSA-NCAM and pCREB immunoreactive cells were increased two-fold in the dentate gyrus by this treatment. In addition, the immunoreactivities of serotonin (5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine), known to be involved in neural plasticity, and of tryptophan hydroxylase immunoreactive-fibers in the dentate gyrus were both upregulated by 7-NI. Our results indicate that nNOS inhibition upregulates neural plasticity and increases 5-HT in the rat hippocampus, and suggest the existence of regulatory relationships between NO, neural plasticity and 5-HT.",
