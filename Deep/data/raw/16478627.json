     "AB": "In multiparous species such as the rat (in this case the albino Wistar strain), steroid influence during fetal growth is affected by the relative intrauterine position of male and female fetuses and is stronger when the potential effects of contiguity and caudal position are combined. The effect of intrauterine position on gonadal steroid levels in neonatal and adult animals was examined using radioimmunoassay techniques. Since the organizing effect of prenatal steroids may influence the postnatal GABA content, HPLC was used to determine the gabaergic content in several hypothalamic and limbic areas in the adult rat. The effects of intrauterine position on adaptive behavior were examined by recording exploratory behavior (using the corridor and hole board tests) and intraspecific aggression (induced by isolation). Female pups influenced by males during development produced more testosterone. In adult males, those that developed closer to the cervix (and with no influence from other fetuses) produced more testosterone and less estradiol. The same animals also produced more hypothalamic GABA and showed greater exploratory capacity. No significant differences were seen between any experimental groups with respect to aggression. These results show increased variability between males with respect to adult exploratory behavior, and in the neurochemical and endocrine systems involved, due to intrauterine position during development. The effect of this physiological phenomenon on the structure of rodent populations is discussed.",
