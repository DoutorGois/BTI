     "AB": "Cerebral glucose uptake is mediated by several members of the family of facilitated glucose transporters (protein nomenclature GLUT; gene nomenclature solute carrier family 2 Slc2a). Glucose uptake differs between the sexes and also varies with menstrual status in women and across the rodent oestrous cycle. The present study demonstrates the extent to which hormonal variation across the four stages of the rat oestrous cycle affects the mRNA abundance of four members of the GLUT family, including the most well characterised cerebral transporters Slc2a1 and Slc2a3, as well as the insulin-sensitive transporters Slc2a4 and Slc2a8 in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Slc2a1 varied significantly across the cycle in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and Slc2a3 and Slc2a4 also showed significant fluctuation in the hippocampus. Transporter expression significantly increased during pro-oestrus in both the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, ovarian hormones are critical for normal expression of GLUT mRNA, as demonstrated by reduced expression of Slc2a1, Slc2a3 and Sl2a8 in the hippocampus after ovariectomy. Collectively, the data reported in the present study demonstrate that glucose transporters are highly sensitive to hormonal variation and that this sensitivity is regionally distinct; thereby fluctuations likely have specific phenotypic implications.",
