     "AB": "The effects of adenosine A2 receptor antagonist (CP-66713) on long-term potentiation were studied using guinea pig hippocampal slices in a perfusion system. Tetanic stimulation of Schaffer collateral input which was applied during perfusion of CP-66713 (10 microM), did not induce long-term potentiation but rather long-term depression of evoked synaptic potentials (field EPSP), but induced long-term potentiation of the population spike in CA1 neurons. Thus, adenosine derivatives which accumulate in the synaptic cleft during the tetanic stimulation may be involved in induction of the long-term potentiation via A2 receptors at the synapse. The clear discrimination between long-term depression of the field EPSP and long-term potentiation of the population spike suggests EPSP-spike potentiation at the postsynaptic sites.",
