     "AB": "We sought to identify the brain circuitry that underlies the stimulatory role of nitric oxide (NO) role on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Specifically, we determined whether electrofootshocks (60 min) or the intravenous administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 microg/kg)-activated neurocircuitries that express either neuronal NO synthase (nNOS), a constitutive enzyme responsible for NO formation, or L-citrulline, an amino acid that is produced in equimolar amounts with NO. Shocks significantly increased the number of cells showing Fos immunoreactivity (ir) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus (LH), amygdaloid complex (AD) and thalamus (TH), and to a lesser extent, in the hippocampus (HP), caudate putamen (CP) and frontal cortex (FC). However, shocks did not alter the number of nNOS-positive cells nor increased citrulline signals in these brain regions. LPS significantly upregulated the number of cells with fos-like ir in the PVN, LH, AD, TH, HP, CP and FC, but only increased the number of cells positive for citrulline in the PVN, 87% of which co-expressed Fos. Thus, while shocks did not alter nNOS gene expression or citrulline levels in the brain regions studied, LPS significantly increased the number of PVN cells expressing citrulline without concomitant changes in other brain areas. Endotoxemia also upregulated significantly more PVN cells that co-expressed Fos and nNOS, compared to shocks. As NO stimulates the PVN circuitries that participate in shocks- and LPS-induced ACTH release, the lack of changes in nNOS or citrulline levels due to shocks suggests that, in this model, constitutively formed NO may modulate HPA axis activity in the absence of changes in its synthesis.",
