     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of dl-3n-butylphthalide (NBP) on the protein and mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in rats brain with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). METHODS: The model of permanent MCAO was established by using the suture method of Longa, with which the nylon suture was used to make rat middle cerebral artery (MCA) blocked. Sham-operated rats (n=20) were prepared in similar fashion, but without doing the closed occlusion of the MCA. Operated rats were randomizely divided into model control and NBP groups (n= 20 for each). By intragastric administration, sham-operated and model control group rats were given vegetable oil 2 mL twice daily for 3 days, and also NBP group rats were given NBP 25 mg/kg twice daily for 3 days. The infarct volume and neurological deficit scores were determined by tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and Longa's score separately. The protein and mRNA of VEGF and bFGF were detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. RESULTS: NBP markedly inhibited the neurological deficit and reduced the infarct volumes as compared to model control group (P < 0.05). NBP significantly upregulated VEGF and bFGF expression in both protein and mRNA levels in the peripheral infarct and hippocampus regions in contrast with sham-operated and model control groups (P < 0.05). In the infarct core, the protein and mRNA levels of VEGF and bFGF did not show significantly any difference (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: NBP can significantly reduce neurological deficit and infarction volume, and therefore may have protective effect for cerebral ischemia through upregulating the expression of VEGF and bFGF.",
