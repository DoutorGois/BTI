     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) on cultured hippocampal neuron and its intracellular mechanism. METHODS: The hippocampal neurons were dissociated from E18 rats and cultured in neurobasal medium, and then the cells were treated with proBDNF, preBDNF(propeptide of proBDNF) and proBDNF antiserum,respectively. Thirty minutes, 1 hour or 48 hours later, the cells were stained with Nissl solution, and the immunocytochemistry methods of ELK-p (Ets domain protein), ErK2(extracellular signal regulated kinase) and c-fos were performed. RESULTS: The expressions of ELK-p, ErK and c-fos were significantly upregulated in the cultured hippocampal neurons after they were treated with proBDNF protein,and the immuno-positive staining was also obvious in some nuclei. While the endogenous proBDNF was neutralized by proBDNF antiserum treatment, the expressions of ELK-p, ErK and c-fos were downregulated and many cells showed swelling and vasoculation. The immunoreactivity in preBDNF treated cells was similar to that in normal cultured cells. CONCLUSION: proBDNF plays an important role in sustaining the hippocampal neuron survival through upregulating the ELK and ErK pathways.",
