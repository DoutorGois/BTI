     "AB": "The high degree of variability observed in spike trains and membrane potentials of pyramidal neurons in vivo is thought to be a consequence of a balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs, which depends on the dynamics of the network. We simulated synaptic currents and ion channels in a reconstructed hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell and show here that a local balance can be achieved on a dendritic branch with a different mechanism, based on presynaptic depression of quantal release interacting with active dendritic conductances. This mechanism, which does not require synaptic inhibition, allows each dendritic branch to remain sensitive to correlated synaptic inputs, induces a high degree of variability in the output spike train, and can be combined with other balance mechanisms based on network dynamics. This hypothesis makes a testable prediction for the cause of the observed variability in the firing of hippocampal place cells.",
