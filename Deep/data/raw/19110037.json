     "AB": "We investigated the role of CB1 receptors in hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation mediated by polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) during contextual fear conditioning (CFC). The CB1 receptor agonist 3-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)-(-)-11-hydroxy-Delta(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol (HU-210) (0.1 mg/kg) was given immediately after training during the memory consolidation phase, and freezing behavior was measured 24 h after conditioning. Administration of HU-210 attenuated freezing behavior measured in CFC. Western blot analysis showed that CFC induced a decrease in the expression of NCAM-180, but did not change the level of NCAM-140 and increased PSA-NCAM expression measured 24 h after training in the rat hippocampus. HU-210 (0.1 mg/kg) injection did not affect the reduction in NCAM-180 levels induced by CFC, but it blocked the increase in PSA-NCAM expression. Since the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is known to be involved in memory consolidation and expresses a high level of PSA-NCAM protein, we measured the effects of CFC and HU-210 administration on PSA-NCAM-immunoreactive (IR) cells in the DG. CFC caused an increase in the number of PSA-NCAM-IR cells in the DG, but not K(i)-67- or doublecortin (DCX)-IR cells. This increase in PSA-NCAM-IR cells was abolished by HU-210 injection. Administration of the CB1 receptor antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3 -carboxamide (AM-251) (3 mg/kg immediately before HU-210) inhibited the effects of HU-210 on freezing behavior and PSA-NCAM expression in the DG. These results indicate that activation of CB1 receptors disturbs consolidation of fear memory in CFC, likely by affecting PSA-NCAM expression in the DG, which plays an important role in synaptic rearrangement during the formation of memory traces.",
