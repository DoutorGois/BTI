     "AB": "We studied the alterations in binding of cyclic AMP as an indicator of particulate cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase binding activity following transient cerebral ischemia in Mongolian gerbils and examined the effects of vinconate and pentobarbital against alterations in the binding. Animals were allowed to survive for 5 h and 7 days after 10 min of cerebral ischemia induced by bilateral occlusion of common carotid arteries. [3H]Cyclic AMP binding was significantly reduced in the hippocampus 5 h after ischemia, whereas the striatum showed no significant change in the binding. Seven days after ischemia, a severe reduction of [3H]cyclic AMP binding was noted in the dorsolateral striatum, hippocampal CA1 and CA3 sectors, and dentate gyrus. Intraperitoneal administration of vinconate (100 or 300 mg/kg) showed a significant elevation of [3H]cyclic AMP binding in the striatum, stratum pyramidale of hippocampal CA1 and CA3 sectors, and dentate gyrus 5 h after ischemia. By contrast, the intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) showed no significant alteration of [3H]cyclic AMP binding in most of these regions. However, vinconate and pentobarbital prevented a significant reduction of [3H]cyclic AMP binding in the dorsolateral striatum and stratum pyramidale of hippocampal CA3 sector 7 days after ischemia, although both drugs failed to prevent damage to the hippocampal CA1 sector. These results suggest that alteration in cyclic AMP binding may not be a major factor in causing ischemic neuronal damage.",
