     "AB": "The regulation of the thyroid gland by TSH is mediated by a heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor. Nonthyroid effects of TSH have been reported, and expression of its receptor has been described in adipocytes and lymphocytes. We have previously reported the existence of specific and saturable binding sites of TSH and specific TSH effects in primary cultured rat brain astroglial cells. We now report expression of the TSH receptor gene in these cells; the coding sequence of the corresponding complementary DNA is identical to that previously established in thyroid. Using specific antisense RNA probe, expression of this gene was detected in some isolated or clustered glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive primary cultured cells by in situ hybridization. With this technique, we further detected TSH receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in rat brain cryoslices in both neuronal cells and astrocytes. Its presence predominated in neuron-rich areas (pyriform and postcingulate cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamic nuclei) and was mostly colocalized with neuron-specific enolase. In astrocytes, this mRNA was detected in the ependymal cell layer and the subependymal zone, and several isolated cells were also found in the brain parenchyma. We also detected TSH receptor mRNA and protein in primary cultured human astrocytes. The protein was detected as well in both rat and human brain cryoslices. Together, these findings clearly demonstrate the expression of the TSH receptor gene in the brain in both neuronal cells and astrocytes.",
