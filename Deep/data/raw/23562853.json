     "AB": "AIM: Oxidative stress is considered one of the main events that lead to aging and neurodegeneration. Antioxidant treatments used to counteract oxidative damage have been associated with a wide variety of side effects or at the utmost to be ineffective. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antioxidant property of a natural mineral, the tribomechanically micronized zeolite (MZ). MAIN METHODS: Cell death and oxidative stress were assessed in retinoic acid differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, a neuronal-like cell line, after a pro-oxidant stimulus. In vivo evaluation of antioxidant activity and amyloidogenic processing of beta amyloid have been evaluated in a transgenic model of aging related neurodegeneration, the APPswePS1dE9 transgenic mice (tg mice) after a five-month long period of water supplementation with MZ. KEY FINDINGS: The study showed that 24h of cell pretreatment with MZ (1) protected the cells by radical oxygen species (ROS)-induced cell death and moreover (2) induced a reduction of the mitochondrial ROS production following a pro-oxidant stimulation. Looking for an antioxidant effect of MZ in vivo, we found (3) an increased activity of the endogenous antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the hippocampus of tg mice and (4) a reduction in amyloid levels and plaque load in MZ treated tg mice compared to control tg mice. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest MZ as a novel potential adjuvant in counteracting oxidative stress and plaque accumulation in the field of neurodegenerative diseases.",
