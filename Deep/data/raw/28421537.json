     "AB": "Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (Satb2) is a protein binding to the matrix attachment regions of DNA and important for gene regulation. Patients with SATB2 mutation usually suffer moderate to severe mental retardation. However, the mechanisms for the defects of intellectual activities in patients with SATB2 mutation are largely unclear. Here we established the heterozygous Satb2 mutant mice and Satb2 conditional knockout mice to mimic the patients with SATB2 mutation and figured out the role of Satb2 in mental activities. We found that the spatial memory and working memory were significantly damaged in the heterozygous Satb2 mutant mice, early postnatal Satb2-deficient mice (CaMKIIalpha-Cre(+)Satb2(fl/fl) mice), and adult Satb2 ablation mice (Satb2(fl/fl) mice injected with CaMKIIalpha-Cre virus). Functionally, late phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in these Satb2 mutant mice was greatly impaired. Morphologically, in CA1 neurons of CaMKIIalpha-Cre(+)Satb2(fl/fl) mice, we found decreased spine density of the basal dendrites and less branches of apical dendrites that extended into lacunar molecular layer. Mechanistically, expression levels of immediate early genes (IEGs) including Fos, FosB, and Egr1 were significantly decreased after Satb2 deletion. And, Satb2 could regulate expression of FosB by binding to the promoter of FosB directly. In general, our study uncovers that Satb2 plays an important role in spatial memory and working memory by regulating IEGs-mediated hippocampal synaptic plasticity.",
