     "AB": "Although past research has described changes in the density of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in brain and in peripheral organs in response to stressors and steroid hormone exposure, their combined influence had yet to be determined. This study examined the effect of swim-stress as a function of ovarian hormone administration on the binding of an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative, [3H]PK 11195, in brain and peripheral tissues. In olfactory bulb and adrenal gland, stress increased peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density in ovariectomized rats with and without estradiol and progesterone replacement injection, even when compared with unstressed animals treated with hormones, where estradiol + progesterone decreased peripheral benzodiazepine receptor number in olfactory bulb, but estradiol and estradiol + progesterone increased it in adrenal gland. In frontal cortex, stress decreased peripheral benzodiazepine receptor number, an effect that was reversed by estradiol. In hippocampus estradiol decreased peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density in unstressed animals and estradiol + progesterone decreased peripheral benzodiazepine receptor number in unstressed and stressed animals. In cerebellum, stress, estradiol and estradiol + progesterone alone decreased peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density. In uterus of unstressed controls, estradiol + progesterone increased peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density, and stress produced a further increase in steroid-treated females. Stress did not affect peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density in kidney, except in animals that received estradiol + progesterone injections, where swim-stress produced a significant decrease in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density. Thus, steroid hormones regulate peripheral benzodiazepine receptor density in endocrine organs and brain, and the hormonal state of the organism modifies the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor response to stress in a tissue- and brain region-specific manner, suggesting that the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor may play a pivotal role in an integrated response to stress.",
