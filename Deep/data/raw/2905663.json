     "AB": "The electrophysiological and cAMP responses to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol were measured in the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation. Subtype-selective antagonists were used to evaluate the specificity of these responses. The beta 1-selective antagonist ICI 89,406 was 60-fold more potent than was the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 at antagonizing the electrophysiological response. ICI 89,406 was 200 times more potent in its antagonism of the cAMP response. These results suggest that the electrophysiological and cAMP responses in this preparation are primarily mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors.",
