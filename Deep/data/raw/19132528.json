     "AB": "Hypoglycaemic coma and brain injury are potential complications of insulin therapy. Hippocampal neurons are particularly vulnerable to hypoglycaemic stress leading to memory impairment. In the present article, we have investigated the dopamine (DA) content, homovanillic acid (HVA)/DA turnover ratio, DA D(1) and DA D(2) receptors in the hippocampus of insulin-induced hypoglycaemic (IIH) and streptozotocin induced diabetic rats where brain functions are impaired. The DA content decreased significantly in hippocampus of diabetic, diabetic +IIH and control +IIH rats compared to control. The HVA/DA turnover ratio also increased significantly in diabetic, diabetic +IIH and control +IIH rats compared to control. Scatchard analysis using [(3)H] DA in the hippocampus showed a significant increase in DA receptors of diabetic, diabetic +IIH and control +IIH rats with decreased affinity. Gene expression studies using Real-time PCR showed an increased expression of DA D(1) and DA D(2) receptors in the hippocampus of hypoglycaemic and diabetic rats. Our results indicate that the dopaminergic system is impaired in the hippocampus of hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic rats impairing DA related functions of hippocampus. We observed a prominent dopaminergic functional disturbance in the hypoglycaemic condition than in hyperglycaemia compared to control. This dopaminergic dysfunction in hippocampus during hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia is suggested to contribute to cognitive and memory deficits. This will have clinical significance in the treatment of diabetes.",
