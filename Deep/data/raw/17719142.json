     "AB": "In the present study we investigated whether serotonin release in the hippocampus is subject to regulation via cannabinoid receptors. Both rat and mouse hippocampal slices were preincubated with [3H]serotonin ([3H]5-HT) and superfused with medium containing serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram hydrobromide (300 nM). The cannabinoid receptor agonist R(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazi nyl]-(1-naphthalenyl) methanone mesylate (WIN55,212-2, 1 microM) did not affect either the resting or the electrically evoked [3H]5-HT release. In the presence of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5, 50 microM) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione-disodium (CNQX, 10 microM) the evoked [3H]5-HT release was decreased significantly. Similar findings were obtained when CNQX (10 microM) was applied alone with WIN55,212-2. This effect was abolished by the selective cannabinoid receptor subtype 1 (CB1) antagonists N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole -3-carboxamide (SR141716, 1 microM) and 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-methyl-N-1-piperidinyl-1H-pyrazole-3-ca rboxamide trifluoroacetate salt (AM251, 1 microM). Similarly to that observed in rats, WIN55,212-2 (1 microM) decreased the evoked [3H]5-HT efflux in wild-type mice (CB1+/+). The inhibitory effect of WIN55,212-2 (1 microM) was completely absent in hippocampal slices derived from mice genetically deficient in CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1-/-). Relatively selective degeneration of fine serotonergic axons by the neurotoxin parachloramphetamine (PCA) reduced significantly the tritium uptake and the evoked [3H]5-HT release. In addition, PCA, eliminated the effect of WIN55,212-2 (1 microM) on the stimulation-evoked [3H]5-HT efflux. In contrast to the PCA-treated animals, WIN55,212-2 (1 microM) reduced the [3H]5-HT efflux in the saline-treated group. Our data suggest that a subpopulation of non-synaptic serotonergic afferents express CB1 receptors and activation of these CB1 receptors leads to a decrease in 5-HT release.",
