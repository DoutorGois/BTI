     "AB": "The effects of various adrenergic agents on the release of endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and of [3H]GABA were studied in superfused synaptosomal preparations from rat hippocampus. Noradrenaline (NA) enhanced in a concentration-dependent way the release of endogenous GABA but did not affect the release of the radioactive amino acid. The effect of NA was mimicked by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, but not by the alpha 1-agonist, phenylephrine. Accordingly, NA was antagonized by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, but not by the alpha 1-antagonist, prazosin. Both (+)-mianserin and (-)-mianserin, used as alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockers, counteracted the NA-evoked release of endogenous GABA. The results suggest that GABA released from hippocampus crude synaptosomes is modulated by alpha 2-adrenoceptors pharmacologically different from the alpha 2-autoreceptors that modulate NA release and previously found to be blocked by (+)-mianserin but not by the (-) enantiomer (Raiteri et al., 1983).",
