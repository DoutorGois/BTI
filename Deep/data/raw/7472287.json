     "AB": "Local administration of di-isopropyl-fluorophosphate (DFP) and physostigmine into the preoptic area produced a marked elevation of plasma corticosterone level in male albino rats. The drugs failed to change the pituitary-adrenocortical function if they were administered into the septum, hippocampus and posterior hypothalamus. The injections were performed through chronically implanted cannulas and the plasma corticosterone level was measured by competitive protein-binding assay. Atropine pretreatment inhibited the physostigmine-induced increase of plasma corticosterone level but it did not prevent the changes induced by DFP administration. Dexamethasone pretreatment blocked the plasma corticosterone response level evoked by local application of acetylcholineesterase inhibitors into preoptic area.",
