     "AB": "In the present study we investigated the effects of lipoic acid (LA) on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and Na+, K+-ATPase activities in rat hippocampus during seizures. Wistar rats were treated with 0.9% saline (i.p., control group), lipoic acid (20 mg/kg, i.p., LA group), pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, i.p., P400 group), and the association of pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, i.p.) plus LA (20 mg/kg, i.p.), 30 min before of administration of P400 (LA plus P400 group). After the treatments all groups were observed for 1 h. In P400 group, there was a significant increase in GPx activity as well as a decrease in AChE and Na+, K+-ATPase activities after seizures. In turn, LA plus P400 abolished the appearance of seizures and reversed the decreased in AChE and Na+, K+-ATPase activities produced by seizures, when compared to the P400 seizing group. The results from the present study demonstrate that preadministration of LA abolished seizure episodes induced by pilocarpine in rat, probably by increasing AChE and Na+, K+-ATPase activities in rat hippocampus.",
