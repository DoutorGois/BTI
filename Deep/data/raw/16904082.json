     "AB": "Streptozotocin is a natural antibiotic produced by Streptomyces achromogenes able to induce diabetes in experimental animals. Among various toxic properties, streptozotocin is a potent source for reactive oxygen species. In this paper, we report the biological response of brain, upon treatment with streptozotocin in terms of metal ions dismetabolism and metallothionein expression. In addition, important information on the preventive effect of zinc in eliciting the pharmacological effect of the drug are reported, in relation to the effective role of the metal ions in inducing metallothionein synthesis. In the brain, streptozotocin treatment affects mostly the hippocampus and cerebellum as shown by a high GAFP and MT-I-II immunopositivity of glial cells. The Zn pre-treatment reduces significantly, as a general effect, the occurrence of hyperglycaemic status. At the brain level, the observed astrocytosis is strongly reduced. The high inducibility of MT represents a rapid and convenient response able to prevent the deleterious effects consequent to the oxidative stress. All together these results support the efficacy of the Zn treatment in order to prevent streptozotocin effects, including brain tissues.",
