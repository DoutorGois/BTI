     "AB": "Aged rats may be behaviorally classified as either cognitively impaired or unimpaired based upon their performance in the Morris water maze task. In aged Long-Evans rats, emergence of functional deficits has been related to the increase in the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subtype in most hippocampal subfields, not observed in other brain structures. As AMPA receptors expressed in astrocytes may participate in the delayed and long-term glial response to injury, we investigated whether astrocytes participate in the increase of AMPA receptor observed in these aged rats. To this end, distribution of monoamine oxidase B, used as an astroglial marker, was characterized by quantitative autoradiography in the hippocampus and septum of young adults (six months) and aged (24-25 months) rats using [3H]lazabemide. Specific binding to brain sections of young, aged unimpaired, and aged impaired animals were calculated densitometrically. Compared to young animals, all hippocampal subfields in the aged unimpaired group showed a significant age-related increased labeling, which was not present in the aged impaired group. This contrasts with the increased glial transcription described in this last group. We propose that increase in AMPA receptors in the aged memory-impaired animals may be related to an atypic astrocytic reactivity.",
