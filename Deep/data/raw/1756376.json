     "AB": "The present study examines whether tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) can improve the deterioration in passive avoidance (PA) retention performance induced by medial septal (MS) and fimbria-fornix (FF) lesions in young rats or by aging. Retention of young MS-lesioned rats was improved by pretraining injection of THA at 3 mg/kg, but not by THA at 1 mg/kg or by either of the posttraining doses of THA (1 and 3 mg/kg). Pretraining injections of THA at 1 or 3 mg/kg had no effect on the PA retention performance of FF-lesioned rats. Age-induced PA failure was alleviated by pretraining administration of THA at 1 and 3 mg/kg. Posttraining injections of THA (1 or 3 mg/kg) had no effect on PA retention performance of aged rats. These results demonstrate that 1) THA may improve hippocampal cholinergic denervation-induced functional deficits and 2) some of the age-related PA deficits may be due to a cholinergic deficit and can be reversed with THA.",
