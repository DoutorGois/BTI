     "AB": "Using a new rat conflict test it was found that 30% of the subjects failed to respond to benzodiazepines and other anxiolytic agents. This value is similar to that reported using more classical procedures such as the Geller-Seifter and Vogel conflict tests. Biochemical analysis of various brain regions from responder (R) and non-responder (NR) subjects revealed no significant differences in 5-HT1, 5-HT2, GABA receptor binding or GABA-activated benzodiazepine binding. However, a small, but significant, increase in basal benzodiazepine binding was noted in the hippocampus of NR rats. These findings suggest that the insensitivity of these animals to anxiolytics is probably unrelated to an alteration in serotonin, GABA or benzodiazepine binding sites in brain.",
