     "AB": "N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play a critical role in the brain stimulating synaptic plasticity and mediating neurodegeneration; a neuroprotective role has also been described, but its molecular mechanisms in hippocampus are under study. Here, we report that in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons exposure to low micromolar NMDA concentrations are neuroprotective against excitotoxic insults, while high micromolar NMDA concentrations provoke neuronal death. Molecular analysis reveals that a toxic concentration of NMDA induced a transient phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (pCREB) in 2 min that rapidly decreased below basal levels. In contrast, a nontoxic NMDA concentration gave up to longer (20 min) rise of pCREB, suggesting that neuroprotection could be associated to a relatively prolonged presence of pCREB in the neurons. In support of this tenet, rolipram, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase IV that increases the levels of cAMP and pCREB, protected against NMDA-induced neuronal death. Similar results were obtained with dibutyrate-cAMP (a cAMP analogue with membrane permeability) that also abrogated NMDA excitotoxicity. Conversely, N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide (H89), an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), that prevents the formation of pCREB induced by nontoxic NMDA concentrations, reverted the neuroprotection achieved by preincubation of low micromolar NMDA concentrations. These results substantiate the notion that induction of pCREB via PKA plays an important role in NMDA-mediated neuroprotection.",
