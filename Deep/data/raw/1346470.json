     "AB": "The \"modified host protein\" model of scrapie proposes that the transmissible agent is composed of the degradation-resistant protein, Sp33-37, and that clinical and pathologic signs result from neurotoxic accumulations of this protein. Sp33-37 is an abnormal, amyloidogenic isoform of the normally occurring cellular protein Cp33-37. This study investigated the tissue distribution of Cp33-37 in hamster. In brain, Cp33-37 was most concentrated in the hippocampal formation. Immunohistochemical studies localized Cp33-37 to neurons and surrounding neuropil in hippocampus; septal, caudate, and thalamic nuclei; dorsal root ganglia cells; and large-diameter dorsal root axons. In non-neuronal hamster tissues, Cp33-37 was detected in circulating leukocytes, heart, skeletal muscle, lung, intestinal tract, spleen, testis, ovary, and some other organs. The presence of Cp33-37 in extracerebral tissues indicates that its function is not unique to brain. These results indicate that the molecular substrate for the production of Sp33-37, the scrapie agent, and scrapie amyloid is present in a variety of cerebral and extracerebral sites.",
