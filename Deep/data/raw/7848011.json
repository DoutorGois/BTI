     "AB": "The protective effects of a novel dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with platelet-activating factor-antagonistic action, F-0401, on ischemic brain damage were investigated using experimental ischemia models in rats and gerbils. F-0401 (1 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented increases in water content, determined by the wet-dry method, in ischemic areas 24 hr after 1 hr of middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. Pretreatment with F-0401 (1 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented extravasation of Evans blue dye in the brain following 2 hr of bilateral carotid artery occlusion and 2 hr of reperfusion in the rat. Pretreatment with F-0401 (1 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) protected against neuronal damage to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells following 3 and 5 min of forebrain ischemia in the gerbil. Immunostaining against microtubule-associated protein-2 also demonstrated preservation of CA1 neurons in F-0401-treated animals. Thus, this study shows that F-0401 prevents the occurrence of brain edema, disruption of blood-brain barrier and neuronal damage caused by cerebral ischemia. The results demonstrate that F-0401 may be a powerful candidate as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of acute stroke in man.",
