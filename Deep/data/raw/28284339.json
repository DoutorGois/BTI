     "AB": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection that may affect the brain. We investigated the role of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1/2) inhibition on long-term memory and energetic metabolism after experimental sepsis by caecal ligation and perforation (CLP). Experimental sepsis increased the activity of complexes I, II-III and IV at 24h after CLP, and IDO-1/2 inhibition normalized the activity of these complexes in the hippocampus. Wistar rats presented impairment of habituation and aversive memories 10days after CLP. Adjuvant treatment with the IDO inhibitor prevented long-term cognitive impairment triggered by sepsis.",
