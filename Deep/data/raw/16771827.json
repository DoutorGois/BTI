     "AB": "Beta amyloid protein (Abeta) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) have been shown to be closely implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In the current study, we investigated the effects of bis(7)-tacrine, a novel dimeric AChE inhibitor, on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in primary cortical neurons. Bis(7)-tacrine, but not other AChE inhibitors, elicited a marked reduction of both fibrillar and soluble oligomeric forms of Abeta-induced apoptosis as evidenced by chromatin condensation and DNA specific fragmentation. Both nicotinic and muscarinic receptor antagonists failed to block the effects of bis(7)-tacrine. Instead, nimodipine, a blocker of L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs), attenuated Abeta neurotoxicity, whereas N-, P/Q- or R-type VDCCs blockers and ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists did not. Fluorescence Ca2+ imaging assay revealed that, similar to nimodipine, bis(7)-tacrine reversed Abeta-triggered intracellular Ca2+ increase, which was mainly contributed by the extracellular Ca2+ instead of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria Ca2+. Concurrently, using whole cell patch-clamping technique, it was found that bis(7)-tacrine significantly reduced the augmentation of high voltage-activated inward calcium currents induced by Abeta. These results suggest that bis(7)-tacrine attenuates Abeta-induced neuronal apoptosis by regulating L-type VDCCs, offers a novel modality as to how the agent exerts neuroprotective effects.",
