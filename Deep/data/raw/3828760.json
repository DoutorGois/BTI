     "AB": "One hour after long-term potentiation (LTP) in the intact hippocampus, a selective increase in protein F1 in vitro phosphorylation was observed in homogenate prepared from dorsal hippocampus. Protein F1 phosphorylation was directly related to the magnitude and persistence of potentiation. No other phosphoprotein studied exhibited a relationship with synaptic enhancement. Low-frequency, non-potentiating stimulation did not increase protein F1 phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of F1 was not elevated when high-frequency stimulation did not produce potentiation. We also confirmed our earlier demonstration of a similar pattern of results 5 min after LTP. In related work we have previously observed: that protein F1 is a substrate for protein kinase C (PKC); that membrane PKC activity was increased by translocation from the cytosol following LTP; and that membrane PKC activity was directly related to the persistence of enhancement. We therefore predicted in the present study that protein F1 phosphorylation in a dorsal hippocampal membrane fraction would be related to LTP. Hippocampal membrane protein F1 was found to be directly related to both the magnitude and persistence of response enhancement. Thus the molecular events leading to prolonged potentiation may involve increased PKC/protein F1 association. Persistence of potentiation may be related to synaptic growth processes involving the growth-associated function of protein F1.",
