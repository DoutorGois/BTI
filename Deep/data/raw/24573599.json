     "AB": "This study aimed to compare the regional distribution of insulin receptor in various portions of newborn rat hippocampus on postnatal days 0 (P0), 7 (P7), and 14 (P14) between male/female and right/left hippocampi. We found that the number of insulin receptor (InsR)-immunoreactive-positive (InsR+) cells in CA1 continued to increase until P7 and remained unchanged thereafter. A marked increase in distribution of InsR+ cells in CA3 from P0 to P14 was observed, although there was a significant decline in the number of InsR+ cells in dentate gyrus (DG) at the same time. No differences between the right/left and male/female hippocampi were detected at P0 (P > 0.05). Seven-day-old female rats showed a higher number of labeled cells in the left than in the right hippocampus. Moreover, the differences between the number of InsR+ cells in area CA1 and CA3 were statistically significant between males and females (P < 0.05). At P14, the number of InsR+ cells was significantly higher in CA1 and DG of males, especially in the right one (P < 0.05). These results indicate the existence of a differential distribution pattern of InsR between the left/right and male/female hippocampi. Together with other mechanisms, these differences may underlie sexual dimorphism and left/right asymmetry in the hippocampus.",
