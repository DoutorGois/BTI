Here we describe immunohistochemical staining procedures for detection and identification of the cellular localization of phospho-STAT2 in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice. The procedures include single and dual/triple labeling immunostaining of phospho-STAT2 in the hippocampus of mice following entorhinal cortex lesion.",
