     "AB": "1. The identity of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor associated with the observed inhibition of neuronal Ca2+ currents (ICa) in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells has been established on the basis of agonist responses to analogues and carboxy terminal (C-terminal) fragments of the NPY molecule. 2. Whole cell barium currents (IBa) in DRG cells were reversibly inhibited by 100 nM NPY, 100 nM PYY and C-terminal fragments of NPY in a manner that correlated with the length of the NPY fragments (for inhibition of the IBa NPY = PYY greater than NPY2-36 greater than NPY13-36 greater than NPY16-36 greater than NPY18-36 much greater than NPY25-36). 3. C-terminal fragments of NPY were also effective in reversibly reducing the ICa, the associated increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) and the increased [Ca2+]i produced by evoked action potentials in the DRG cells. In addition, a Ca(2+)-activated Cl- conductance was also reversibly reduced by NPY fragments only when accompanied by a reduction in Ca2+ entry. 4. We conclude that the Y2 receptor for neuropeptide Y is coupled to inhibition of Ca2+ influx via voltage-sensitive calcium channels in DRG cells.",
