     "AB": "A quantitative investigation has been carried out on the age-related morphological changes of the synaptic junctions in the cerebellar glomeruli and in the supragranular layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus of young (3 months), adult (12 months) and old (28-30 months) rats. The numerical (Nv) and surface (Sv) density as well as the average length (L) of E-PTA stained synapses was calculated by means of morphometric methods. The results we obtained showed a similar trend in both these areas of the CNS. Nv significantly increased between young and adult rats and significantly decreased in the old group, when compared both to young and adult animals. Sv appeared to be unchanged comparing young and adult animals, whereas it was significantly reduced in the old group. L showed a decrease between 3 and 12 months of age and appeared to be markedly increased in the old animals when compared to adult values. From the present findings it can be inferred that number (Nv) and size (L) of the synapses are in a close inverse relationship which, through the organism's life span, aims to maintain the constancy of the surface contact area (Sv) among the dendritic network. By considering Nv, L and Sv altogether per age group, we were able to obtain a reliable measurement of the morphological aspect of synaptic plasticity through different periods of the life. With regard to aging we found that, despite the 'compensative synaptogenesis' brought about by the increased size (L) of the synaptic appositions, the reactive capacity of old nerve cells is seriously impaired.",
