     "AB": "The aim of the present study was to determine the potential therapeutic value of 21-aminosteroid U-74389G, on blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and edema in association with the changes in synaptosomal Na(+)/K(+) and Mg(2+)/Ca(2+)-ATPase activities in rat brain subjected to post-ischemic reperfusion injury. Brain ischemia was achieved by means of four-vessel occlusion model for 25 min and animals were sacrificed after 12 h reperfusion. An increase of cerebral tissue water content, blood-brain disruption and the changes of synaptosomal Na(+)/K(+) and Mg(2+)/Ca(2+)-ATPases activities were evaluated. U-74389G was given intraperitoneally at two times as 5 mg/kg at 10 min prior to ischemia and at the beginning of reperfusion. Edema was determined by means of wet-dried weight method, and BBB of extravasation of Evan's blue dye. Extravasation of Evan's blue dye into brain following ischemia and reperfusion was 2.4-fold of control value and brought close to control levels by the effect of U-74389G (p<0.001). Post-ischemic reperfusion injury caused an increase of 3.7% in tissue water content of whole brain and administration of U-74389G lowered the cerebral edema (p<0.001). The loses in the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and Mg(2+)/Ca(2+)-ATPase activities occurred as 42.1% (p<0.01) and 65.7% (p<0.001) of control value, respectively. While Mg(2+)/Ca(2+)-ATPase activity was enhanced compared to vehicle-treated group of animals (p<0.01), Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity was fully recovered when compared to control by U-74389G (p>0.05). U-74389G also significantly attenuated neuronal necrosis (p<0.001) which was determined in the hippocampal CA1 subfield. Blood-brain barrier protection, attenuation of brain edema and neuronal necrosis concomitant with the stabilizing of membrane-bound enzymes brought about by the effect of U-74389G suggest that 21-aminosteroids are worthy of consideration in the acute treatment of cerebral ischemia.",
