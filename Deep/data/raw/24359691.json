     "AB": "Prolonged epileptic seizures during status epilepticus (SE) are known to cause neuronal death and lead to brain damage. Lesions in various brain regions can result in memory and cognitive impairment, thus searching of new neuroprotective drugs is important. We evaluated effects of single and chronic administration of ginseng extract on early and late changes in MRI measurements in the rat brain after lithium-pilocarpine SE. Butanol extract of ginseng root cell culture DAN-25 was administered after termination of SE. MRI study of the rat brain was performed 2, 7, and 30 days after SE. High-resolution T2-weighed images and T2-maps were obtained, and total damaged area, hippocampal volume, and T2 relaxation time in several brain structures were calculated. Single administration of ginseng extract attenuated early changes in brain structures found on day 2 after SE. Both single and chronic treatment with ginseng extract decreased brain damage on day 7 after SE. An increase in T2-relaxation time in the hippocampus on day 2 after SE was less prominent in ginseng-treated rats than in saline-treated rats. 30 days after SE, the reduction of hippocampal volume was found both in saline-treated and ginseng-treated rats; however, it was less pronounced in ginseng-treated rats. We conclude that administration of ginseng extract after SE termination reduced brain damage caused by prolonged seizures. Ginseng extract was effective during early period after SE and had a specific protective effect on the hippocampus.",
