     "PG": "101-5",
     "AB": "[3H]Tryptamine binding sites were measured in 4 areas of rat brain following treatment with either pargyline or reserpine for 12 days, or 5 days and 30 days following intraventricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. Pargyline treatment decreased [3H]tryptamine binding in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum and hypothalamus. Reserpine treatment increased binding in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, but not in the striatum or hypothalamus. Neither 6-hydroxydopamine nor 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine altered [3H]tryptamine binding in any of the 4 brain areas. These results indicate that [3H]tryptamine binding sites in brain may be modified by drugs that can potentially affect tryptamine metabolism, and that the sites are not located on catecholamine or serotonin axons.",
