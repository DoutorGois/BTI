     "AB": "The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of co-exposure to static magnetic field (SMF) and cadmium (Cd) on the antioxidant enzymes activity and DNA integrity in rat brain. Sub-chronic exposure to CdCl (CdCl(2), 40 mg/L, per os) for 30 days resulted in a significant reduction in antioxidant enzyme activity such as the glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in frontal cortex and hippocampus. Total GSH were decreased in the frontal cortex of the Cd-exposed group. Cd exposure induced an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, the same exposure increased 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2-desoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) level in rat brain. Interestingly, the combined effect of SMF (128 mT, 1 hour/day for 30 consecutive days) and CdCl (40 mg/L, per os) decreased the SOD activity and glutathione level in frontal cortex as compared with the Cd group. Moreover, the association between SMF and Cd increased MDA concentration in frontal cortex as compared with Cd-exposed rats. DNA analysis revealed that SMF exposure failed to alter 8-oxodGuo concentration in Cd-exposed rats. Our data showed that Cd exposure altered the antioxidant enzymes activity and induced oxidative DNA lesions in rat brain. The combined effect of SMF and Cd increased oxidative damage in rat brain as compared with Cd-exposed rats.",
