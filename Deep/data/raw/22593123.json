     "AB": "BACKGROUND: It is important to have a replicable easy method for monitoring atrophy progression in Alzheimer's disease. Volumetric methods for calculating hippocampal volume are time-consuming and commonly used in research. Visual assessments of medial temporal lobe atrophy (vaMTA) is a rapid method for clinical use. This method has not been tested in a large non-demented population in comparison with volumetry measurements. Since hippocampal volume decreases with time even in normal aging there is also a need to study the normal age differences of medial temporal lobe atrophy. PURPOSE: To compare visual assessment of medial temporal lobe atrophy (vaMTA) with hippocampal volume in a healthy, non-demented elderly population. To describe normal ageing using vaMTA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Non-demented individuals aged 60, 66, 72, 78, 81, 84, and >/=87 years old were recruited from the Swedish National study on Ageing and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K), Sweden. Standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, vaMTA, and calculations of hippocampal volumes were performed in 544 subjects. RESULTS: Significant correlation (r(s) = -0.32, P < 0.001, sin; and r(s) = -0.26, P < 0.001, dx) was found between hippocampal volume measurements and vaMTA. In normal ageing, almost 95% of </=66-year-olds had a medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) score </=1, with possible scores ranging from 0 to 4. Subjects aged 72, 78, and 81 years scored </=2, while the two oldest age groups had scores </=3. CONCLUSION: There was a highly significant correlation between volumetric measurements of the hippocampus and MTA scoring. In normal ageing, there is increasing MTA score. For non-demented elderly individuals </=70 years, an MTA score of 0-1 may be considered normal, compared with MTA </=2 for 70-80-years and MTA 3 for >80-year-old individuals.",
