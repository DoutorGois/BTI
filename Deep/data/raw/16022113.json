     "AB": "The article is dedicated to the influence of sex hormones, especially estrogens, on the central nervous system. The author summarizes literature data and the results of his own research into the mechanism of estrogen action, both via cell receptors and neuromediator systems. The latter include cholinergic, catecholaminergic, and serotonergic systems of various brain structures, such as the hypothalamus, hippocamp, forebrain, substantia nigra etc. The article demonstrates differences between the action of estrogens in male and female subjects, both under physiological conditions and in cases of psychopathological disorders (depression, more often observed in women, and aggressive and anti-social behavior, more typical of men). The data presented in the article demonstrate the scope of the influence of sex hormones on various systemic reactions, such as mood, mental ability display, and sexual behavior. The data on neuroprotector estrogen effects and the discovery of estrogen-independent synaptogenesis in the hypothalamus and hippocamp are related with postmenopausal changes in the brain functioning. Postmenopausal therapy with estrogens may be effective in protection against Alzheimer disease.",
