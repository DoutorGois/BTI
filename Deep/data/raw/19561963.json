     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to investigate the role of a mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) on the severity of brain injury, and the effects of pyruvate treatment in rats with traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHODS: We examined rats subjected to closed head injury using a fluid percussion device, and treated with sodium pyruvate (antioxidant and substrate for PDH enzyme). At 72 h post injury, blood was analyzed for blood gases, acid-base status, total PDH enzyme using a dipstick test and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as a marker of oxidative stress. Brain homogenates from right hippocampus (injured area) were analyzed for PDH content, and immunostained hippocampus sections were used to determine the severity of gliosis and PDH E1-infinity subunit. RESULTS: Our data demonstrate that TBI causes a significant reduction in PDH enzyme, disrupt-acid-base balance and increase oxidative stress in blood. Also, lower PDH enzyme in blood is related to the increased gliosis and loss of its PDH E1-infinity subunit PDH in brain tissue, and these effects of TBI were prevented by pyruvate treatment. CONCLUSION: Lower PDH enzyme levels in blood are related to the global oxidative stress, increased gliosis in brain, and severity of brain injury following TBI. These effects can be prevented by pyruvate through the protection of PDH enzyme and its subunit E-1.",
