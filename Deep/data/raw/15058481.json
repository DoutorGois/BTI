     "AB": "Thyroid hormone activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and ERK2), which are important in late long-term potentiation (L-LTP). The aim of this study was to determine the possible mechanism underlying the impairment of L-LTP as a result of hypothyroidism. We investigated the effect of hypothyroidism on L-LTP of the two associative pathways in the hippocampus: the Schaffer collateral synapses and the perforant path synapses. We also examined the effect of hypothyroidism on ERK1 and ERK2 levels in both the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus. Electrophysiological recordings from hippocampi of anesthetized rats show that hypothyroidism impairs L-LTP in CA1 region, but not in the DG. Western blot analysis of the CA1 region shows that hypothyroidism decreases phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 levels without affecting their total levels. In the DG of the hypothyroid rat, however, there was no significant change in the levels of phosphorylated or total ERKs. The correlation between the effect of hypothyroidism on L-LTP and enzyme levels suggests that hypothyroidism-induced impairment of L-LTP in CA1 may be due to decreased levels of phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2.",
