     "AB": "The exquisite performance of the highly specialized mammalian inner ear requires a multitude of specific proteins. Yet, only a subset of these proteins has been identified and studied in detail. Here, we describe a novel gene expressed in the organ of Corti that encodes a membrane-associated protein of 106 kDa. The new protein, termed Cod106, lacks sequence homology to characterized gene products. As shown by in situ hybridization, it is expressed in auditory and vestibular hair cells, as well as in distinct sets of CNS neurons with particularly high abundance in hippocampus and cerebellum. Immunohistochemistry detected Cod106 at the basal, synaptic pole of cochlear outer hair cells and vestibular hair cells. In cultured hippocampal neurons, Cod106 immunofluorescence co-localized with the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), indicating a postsynaptic localization. Cell-type specificity and subcellular localization may be consistent with an involvement of Cod106 in synaptic processes.",
