     "AB": "Tongluojiunao (TLJN) is an herbal medicine consisting of two main components, geniposide and ginsenoside Rg1. TLJN has been shown to protect primary cultured hippocampal neurons. However, its mechanism of action remains unclear. In the present study, primary cultured hippocampal neurons treated with Abeta1-42 (10 micromol/L) significantly increased the release of lactate dehydrogenase, which was markedly reduced by TLJN (2 microL/mL), specifically by the component geniposide (26 micromol/L), but not ginsenoside Rg1 (2.5 micromol/L). The estrogen receptor inhibitor, ICI182780 (1 micromol/L), did not block TLJN- or geniposide-mediated decrease of lactate dehydrogenase under Abeta1-42-exposed conditions. However, the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase or mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibitor, LY294002 (50 micromol/L) or U0126 (10 micromol/L), respectively blocked the decrease of lactate dehydrogenase mediated by TLJN or geniposide. Therefore, these results suggest that the non-classical estrogen pathway (i.e., phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase or mitogen-activated protein kinase) is involved in the neuroprotective effect of TLJN, specifically its component, geniposide, against Abeta1-42-mediated cell death in primary cultured hippocampal neurons.",
