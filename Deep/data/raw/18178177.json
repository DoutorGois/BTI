     "AB": "The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is known to be involved in emotional and stress responses, while the dentate gyrus (DG), a subfield of the hippocampus, is implicated in learning and memory. Together, the BLA-DG neuronal pathway is thought to link memory with emotional and physiological stress responses. To assess whether neonatal isolation, a known early life stressor, has enduring effects on bidirectional neuroplasticity in adulthood, changes in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of BLA-DG synapses were recorded in neonatally isolated and non-handled freely behaving adult male rats. Rats isolated (ISO) from their mother and each other for 1 h daily from postnatal days 2-9 were allowed to mature to adulthood at which time they were chronically implanted with stimulating electrodes in the BLA and recording electrodes in the DG via stereotaxic surgery. A second group of rats which received no isolation treatment and which were not handled (NH) during the neonatal period underwent the same surgical procedures and served as the control group. Following a 1-week postsurgical recovery period, either LTP (100-pulse, 5-Hz theta-burst stimulation [TBS]) or LTD (900-pulse, 1-Hz low-frequency stimulation [LFS]) was induced in the DG of both groups. ISO rats showed significantly enhanced levels of both LTP and LTD compared to NH counterparts. These results indicate that neonatal isolation stress alters bidirectional neural plasticity in BLA-DG synapses, which may help to clarify the development of neural mechanisms linking emotional and stress responses in the amygdala with memory consolidation and information processing in the hippocampus.",
