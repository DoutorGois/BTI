     "AB": "We report here that release of glutamate, inositol phospholipid metabolism, and protein kinase C (PKC) activity are increased in synaptosomes prepared from hippocampi of rats that had been trained in a spatial learning task. In hippocampi obtained from animals that were untrained, activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor by the specific agonist trans-1-amino-cyclopentyl-1,3-dicarboxylate (ACPD) increased release of glutamate but only in the presence of a low concentration of arachidonic acid. A similar interaction between arachidonic acid and ACPD was observed on inositol phospholipid turnover and on PKC activity. However, the synergistic effect of arachidonic acid and ACPD on glutamate release was occluded in hippocampal synaptosomes prepared from trained rats. Occlusion of the effect on inositol phospholipid turnover and PKC activation was also observed. These data suggest that the molecular changes that underlie spatial learning may include activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in the presence of arachidonic acid and that the interaction between arachidonic acid and ACPD triggers the presynaptic changes that accompany learning.",
