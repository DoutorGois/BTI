     "AB": "An autopsied case of juvenile parkinsonism and dementia is described. The patient is a 48-year-old man who had a ten-year history of parkinsonian syndrome and progressive dementia. Neuropathological examination revealed a widespread occurrence of Lewy bodies and spheroids in the central nervous system. Lewy bodies were found not only in the brain stem and diencephalon, but also in the cerebral cortex. Massive numbers of small spheroids were observed in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, mamillary bodies and hippocampus. Electron microscopical examination showed that most spheroids were composed of degenerative organelles with only a few neurofilaments, and were different from those of Hallervorden-Spatz disease. There was also marked neuronal loss with gliosis in the CA3-4 of the hippocampus. Some neurofibrillary tangles occurred in the hippocampus, subcortical and brain stem nuclei, but senile plaques were absent. This case may represent an atypical form of pure diffuse Lewy body disease.",
