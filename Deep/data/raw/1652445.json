     "AB": "The effect of U-50,488H, a selective kappa-opioid agonist, on carbachol-stimulated phosphoinositide (PI) turnover response in rat hippocampal slices was examined. U-50,488H which stimulates PI turnover response in this preparation (Periyasamy and Hoss, 1990, Life Sci. 47, 219), inhibited carbachol-stimulated PI turnover in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 33 +/- 9.0 microM. The inhibitory effect of U-50,488H was not blocked by the kappa-selective antagonists, e.g., nor-binaltorphimine (10 microM), and MR2266 (10 microM), or tetrodotoxin (1 microM) suggesting that the effect of U-50,488H was mediated neither through the kappa-receptors nor through the release of an endogenous neurotransmitter(s). A Lineweaver-Burke plot of the stimulation of PI turnover by carbachol in the presence and absence of U-50,488H showed that the Km was not changed (11.4 +/- 3.4 and 11.5 +/- 2.6 microM) whereas the Vmax was reduced from 3849 +/- 460 to 1534 +/- 31 cpm indicating that the inhibition was non-competitive. U-50,488H also inhibited guanosine 5'-[beta, gamma-imido]triphosphate (Gpp[NH]p)-stimulated PI turnover in rat hippocampal membranes in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 33 +/- 12 microM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
