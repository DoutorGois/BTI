The method of free hand dissection of neurons and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) slab gel microelectrophoresis in our modifications were used. Polypeptide peculiarities for each class of investigated neurons have been found. Most of these polypeptides belong to the low molecular weight range (8.8-24.3 KD) of the polypeptide spectra and only some of them to the high one (64.6-75.3 KD).",
