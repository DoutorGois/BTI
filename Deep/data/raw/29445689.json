     "AB": "Background: 3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a chemical derivative of amphetamine that can induce learning and memory impairment. Due to the effect of neurotrophins on memory and learning, the impact of MDMA was evaluated on the brain - derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin- 4 (NT-4), and tropomyosin- related kinase B (Trk- beta) expression in the hippocampus. Methods: In this study, 20 adult male Wistar rats (200-250 g) received saline (1 mL) or 10 mg/kg of MDMA intraperitoneally as single or multiple injection for 2 consecutive days per week for 2 months. Expression of BDNF, Trk-beta, and NT4 were assessed using Western blotting and RT PCR methods. Results: Our results revealed that the expression of BDNF, Trk- beta, and NT4 proteins and genes significantly decreased in MDMA groups compared to the sham group (p<0.05). Furthermore, the acute group showed the lowest expression of these proteins. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that ecstasy administration may downregulate the expression of BDNF, Trk- beta, and NT-4 in hippocampus, which is more extensive in case of acute treatment. It seems that in the chronic group, hippocampus was able to compensate the ecstasy- induced neurotoxicity.",
