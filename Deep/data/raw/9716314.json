     "AB": "We assessed the neuroprotective capabilities of S12024 (R,S 1-methyl 8-(2-morpholinylmethoxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoleine methane sulphonate) in a model of neuronal degeneration in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus. Specific degeneration of a large part of neurons in the lateral blade of the gyrus dentatus occurred after small intrahippocampal injections of water with or without amyloid-beta 1-28 fragment. S12024 reduced the number of animals with neuronal loss in the hippocampus, diminished the extent of the lesion, and reversed deficits of passive avoidance learning acquisition in animals with deposits of amyloid-beta 1-28. These results suggest that S12024 has neuroprotective effects on hippocampal cells and that the neurodegeneration by fluid injection combined with deposit of amyloid-beta 1-28 may be used to assay the neuroprotective activity of pharmacological compounds.",
