     "AB": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) functions in a bimodal capacity in the nervous system, acting as a mitogen in neuronal stem cells and a neurotrophic factor in differentiated adult neurons. Thus, it is likely that EGF signal transduction, as well as receptor expression, differs among various cell types and possibly in the same cell type at different stages of development. We used hippocampal neuronal cell lines capable of terminal differentiation to investigate changes in EGF receptor expression, DNA synthesis, and stimulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase by EGF before and after differentiation. H19-7, the line that was most representative of hippocampal neurons, was mitogenically responsive to EGF only before differentiation and increased in EGF binding after differentiation. MAP kinase was stimulated by EGF in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells, as well as in primary hippocampal cultures treated with either EGF or glutamate. These results indicate that the activation of MAP kinase by EGF is an early signaling event in both mitotic and postmitotic neuronal cells. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate the usefulness of hippocampal cell lines as a homogeneous neuronal system for studies of EGF signaling or other receptor signaling mechanisms in the brain.",
