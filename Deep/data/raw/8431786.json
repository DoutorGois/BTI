     "AB": "Quantitative autoradiography was used to determine the effect of acute serotonergic denervation with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) or serotonin 5HT1a and 5-HT1b receptors in male rats. Seven days after intrahypothalamic 5,7-DHT injection there was a significant increase in the density of 5HT1a receptors in the ventromedial and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei (VMN and DMN) of male rats. In adjacent sections. 5-HT1b receptors were significantly increased only in the VMN. No changes in receptor density were observed in the lateral hypothalamic area or hippocampus even though binding of [3H]paroxetine, which labels the presynaptic transporter site, was significantly decreased in all evaluated brain regions in 5,7-DHT-treated animals. In addition to demonstrating that 5-HT1a and 5-HT1b receptors are differentially regulated in different brain areas, these results show that in the brain regions examined both 5-HT1a and 5-HT1b receptors are primarily post-synaptic.",
