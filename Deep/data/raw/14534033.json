     "AB": "Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC) are important in control of neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and many other cellular process. Even the slightest alteration in Ca2+ currents can have a considerable impact on the neuronal function. However, it is still unknown whether Ca2+ currents are affected by neurotoxic drugs such as lead, cobalt, zinc, cadmium, thallium, lanthanum, and aluminum. We have characterized the effects of neurotoxic drugs on Ca2+ homeostasis in CA1 hippocampal C57BL mice. Fura 2-AM fluorescence photometry was used to measure intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the presence and absence of neurotoxic drugs (10 microM) in response to KCl application. The peak [Ca2+]i due to KCl application was reduced in the presence of lead (60%), cobalt (35%), zinc (62%), cadmium (71%), thallium (27%), and lanthanum (66%). By contrast, in the presence of aluminum the peak [Ca2+]i was either increased (46%) or it was not affected. These results indicate that neurotoxic drugs could block the entry of calcium into CA1 neurons via VDCC.",
