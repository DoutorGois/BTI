     "AB": "1. The authors investigated the ambulatory activity and water intake of rats during each 12 hr light and dark cycle for one week following four s.c. injections of 4 or 8 mg/kg of methamphetamine (METH). 2. Administration of the higher METH dose caused an increase in activity during the dark cycle on days 1 through 6 with the maximal increase on day 3 while the increase in activity during the light cycle was observed only on day 1. 3. Water intake increased the first day after administration of both METH doses, but returned to baseline by day 3. 4. Administration of both METH doses induced hyperthermia and the 8 mg/kg dose produced depletions of striatal dopamine and striatal, hippocampal and hypothalamic serotonin on day 3 but only in hippocampal serotonin by day 7. 5. These results demonstrate that high doses of METH produce a long-lasting increase in activity during the dark cycle and a transient increase in water intake. The behavioral changes which occurred during the dark cycle appear to be related to the depletion of central dopamine and/or serotonin.",
