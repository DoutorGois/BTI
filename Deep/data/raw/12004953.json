     "AB": "Besides transmitting and processing, neurons may also store information for prolonged periods of time (e.g. by use-dependent change in synaptic strength). In 1966 long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission was discovered in the hippocampus, an area implicated in learning and memory. Recent studies show that similar mechanisms apply to pain pathways, at least in the spinal cord, and may account for some forms of clinical problems like hyperalgesia, allodynia, and deafferentation pain states, such as phantom pain. In this review, we briefly summarize key aspects of synaptic plasticity known from the brain and in the spinal cord. Then we describe and discuss related changes in spinal nociceptive neurons based on results from our own laboratory.",
