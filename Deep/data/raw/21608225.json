     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the learning and memory ability, expressions of hippocampal N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) subunit NR2A and NR2B, and EphB2 receptor in fatigue rats, and to observe effects of Sini Powder, Shenghui Decoction, and Sihui Mixture on them. METHODS: The central nervous system fatigue model was duplicated by paradoxical sleep deprivation for 168 h using multiple platform method. Experimental rats were randomly divided into the normal control group, the model group, the Sini Powder group, and the Shenghui Decoction group, ten in each. Corresponding medicines and distilled water were given to them by gastrogavage at 6, 30, 54, 78, 102, 126, and 150 h after sleep deprivation. Changes of the learning and memory ability were observed using Y maze. mRNA expressions of NMDA subunit NR2A and NR2B, and EphB2 receptor in fatigue rats were quantitatively analyzed using Real-time PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, the Y maze correct percentage in the model group obviously decreased (P<0.05), mRNA expressions of NR2B and EphB2 obviously decreased (P<0.901), with no obvious change in NR2A. Compared with the model group, Sihui Mixture could obviously improve Y maze results and mRNA expressions of NR2A and NR2B, and EphB2 (P<0 01). No statistical difference was found between the Sini Powder group and the Shenghui Decoction group. Compared with the Sini Powder group, mRNA expressions of EphB2 obviously increased in the Sihui Mixture group (P<0 01). mRNA expression of NR2A could be more obviously increased in the Shenghui Decoction group than in the model group (P <0 01). CONCLUSION: The central nervous system fatigue could result in decreased Y maze results and gene expressions of hippocampal NR2B and EphB2. Sihui Mixture could improve rats' learning and memory ability, which might be possibly achieved through up-regulating mRNA expressions of hippocampal EphB2 and NR2B.",
