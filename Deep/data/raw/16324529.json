     "AB": "The present state of clinical regenerative medicine with adult stem cells in the cardiology, digestive, corneal and neurological fields are reviewed. From the cardiology point of view, there is clinical experience with bone marrow stem cells and peripheral blood cells and with skeletal myoblasts. At present, the adult stem cells (bone marrow hematopoietic or mesenchymal) constitute the best option for the regeneration of heart tissue, the clinical studies showing favorable results without ethical or safety problems. Most of the studies with skeletal myoblasts have also been demonstrated to significantly contribute to improve heart function, above all, the systolic one. However they have the disadvantage that has not been totally clarified that they induce malignant ventricular arrhythmias. In either case, the clinical studies are in the initial phase and new studies, above all randomized, are necessary. In the digestive field, there is the pioneer experience of the Hospital La Paz on the use of stem cells from abdominal fat in the treatment of fistulous condition of patients with Crohn's disease. In ophthalmology, the limbal corneal transplant is a recognized practice, using cells from the contralateral eye when the damage is in a single eye and cells from a donor when the damage is bilateral. Finally, in the neurological field, different zones of the adult mammal brain where there are stem cells have been identified: the hippocampus, subventricular zone, olfactory bulb and periependymal zone of the spinal cord. On the other hand, neurons may be obtained from adult stem cells from other tissues, such as the bone marrow or adipose tissue, which means a practically unendable source of neural precursors, either by direct implant after their selection or after their in vitro culture. However, most of the experimentation is animal up to now, clinical trails on safety in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are now being initiated.",
