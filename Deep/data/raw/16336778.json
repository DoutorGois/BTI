     "AB": "Human neuronal growth inhibitory factor (GIF), a metalloprotein classified as metallothionein-3, is specifically expressed in mammal central nervous system (CNS). In these Studies the specific antibody to human GIF was prepared and used to search the epitope of human GIF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and sequence comparison. The result of ELISA showed the epitope of human GIF may locate on a octapeptide (EAAEAEAE) in the alpha-domain of human GIF, and the result of nerve cell culture indicated that the biological activity of GIF may be affected by the specific antibody.",
