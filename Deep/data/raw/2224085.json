     "AB": "The peptide-containing fraction was emitted from the hippocampal and ventral mesencephalic region tissue of rats kindled with subconvulsant doses of corazol. Extracts were prepared by the help of hot acetic acid on the stage of generalized clonic-tonic seizure development. The intraventricular injection of VMR-extracts in relatively high dose increased seizure reactions which were induced in intact recipient rats by intraperitoneal corazol injection. The intraventricular injection of the extract in relatively low dose (100 times less) suppressed corazol-induced seizures in recipients. Data are discussed from the point of view of pathological epileptic system formation and the role played by peptides in supporting it's activity during pharmacological kindling.",
