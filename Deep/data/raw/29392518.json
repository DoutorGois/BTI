     "AB": "Maintenance of synaptic plasticity reserve is crucial to contrast clinical deterioration in MS and PDGF plays a key role in this phenomenon. Indeed, higher cerebrospinal fluid PDGF concentration correlates with improved clinical recovery after a relapse, and the amplitude of LTP-like cortical plasticity in relapsing-remitting MS patients. However, LTP-like cortical plasticity varies depending on the individual level of inhibitory cortical circuits. Aim of this study was to explore whether PDGF-CSF concentration correlates with inhibitory cortical circuits explored by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients affected by relapsing-remitting MS. We further performed electrophysiological experiments evaluating GABAergic transmission in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) hippocampus. Our results reveal that increased CSF PDGF concentration correlates with decreased short afferent inhibition in the motor cortex in MS patients and decreased GABAergic activity in EAE. These findings show that PDGF affects GABAergic activity both in MS patients and in EAE hippocampus.",
