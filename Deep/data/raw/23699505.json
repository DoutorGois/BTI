     "AB": "The control of neurotransmitter release at nerve terminals is of profound importance for neurological function and provides a powerful control system in neural networks. We show that the balance of enzymatic activities of the alpha isoform of the phosphatase calcineurin (CNAalpha) and the kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) has a dramatic influence over single action potential (AP)-driven exocytosis at nerve terminals. Acute or chronic loss of these enzymatic activities results in a sevenfold impact on single AP-driven exocytosis. We demonstrate that this control is mediated almost entirely through Cav2.2 (N-type) voltage-gated calcium channels as blocking these channels with a peptide toxin eliminates modulation by these enzymes. We found that a fraction of nerve terminals are kept in a presynaptically silent state with no measurable Ca(2+) influx driven by single AP stimuli attributable to the balance of CNAalpha and CDK5 activities because blockade of either CNAalpha or CDK5 activity changes the proportion of presynaptically silent nerve terminals. Thus, CNAalpha and CDK5 enzymatic activities are key determinants of release probability.",
