     "AB": "We studied N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated synaptic potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons using hippocampal slices of gerbils after transient forebrain ischemia. In the presence of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and bicuculline, stimulation of Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers induced field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) activated by NMDA receptors. We found that in many slices after ischemia, prolonged low-frequency stimulation (0.1-10 Hz) caused repeated depression and potentiation of the NMDA-mediated fEPSP. Changes in fEPSP amplitude were dependent on stimulus frequency and the cycle frequency ranged from 0.08 to 2.5 cycles/min. These cyclic changes were blocked by application of BAPTA-AM, a membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator, but were little affected by application of verapamil or by lowering the Ca2+ in bathing solution. Intracellular recordings from CA1 neurons revealed that low-frequency stimulation caused periodic depolarizations of membrane potential accompanied by depression of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials. The cyclic changes of fEPSPs were blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) but were unaffected by inhibitors of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) or myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). These results suggest that stimulus-dependent NMDA-receptor activation, mediated by PKC, takes place in the postischemic CA1 neurons and that the cyclic change may reflect abnormal intracellular Ca2+ signaling processes leading to neuronal degeneration.",
