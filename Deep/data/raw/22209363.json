     "AB": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) is a drug of abuse that induces learning and memory deficit. However, there are no experimental data that correlate the behavioral evidence with models of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD). Using field potential recordings in rat hippocampal slices of young rats, we found that acute application of MDMA enhances LTP in CA3-CA1 synapses without affecting LTD. Using specific antagonists and paired-pulse facilitation protocols we observed that the MDMA-dependent increase of LTP involves presynaptic 5-HT(2) serotonin receptors and postsynaptic D1/D5 dopamine receptors. In addition, the inhibition of PKA suppresses the MDMA-dependent increase in LTP, suggesting that dopamine receptor agonism activates cAMP-dependent intracellular pathways. We propose that MDMA exerts its LTP-altering effect involving a polysynaptic interaction between serotonergic and dopaminergic systems in hippocampal synapses. Our results are compatible with the view that the alterations in hippocampal LTP could be responsible for MDMA-dependent cognitive deficits observed in humans and animals.",
