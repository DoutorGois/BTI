     "AB": "Hippocampal function was analysed by making recordings from hippocampal neurons in monkeys actively walking in the laboratory. 'Spatial view' cells, which respond when the monkey looks at a part of the environment, were analysed. It is shown that these cells code for the allocentric position in space being viewed and not for eye position, head direction or the place where the monkey is located. This representation of space 'out there' would be an appropriate part of a primate memory system involved in memories of where in an environment an object was seen, and more generally in the memory of particular events or episodes, for which a spatial component normally provides part of the context.",
