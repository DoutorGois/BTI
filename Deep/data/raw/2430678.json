     "AB": "Specific and extensive neonatal depletions of norepinephrine were produced in 3-day-old rats by combined administration of GBR-12909 (40 mg/kg, i.p.), a specific inhibitor of dopamine uptake, and the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (125 micrograms, i.c.). Norepinephrine concentrations in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were reduced by more than 95%, and hypothalamic concentrations were reduced by 57%. Concentrations of dopamine, serotonin, and their respective metabolites were not affected in these regions or in the striatum.",
