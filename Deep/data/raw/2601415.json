     "AB": "The brain gangliosides from young adult to senescent mice (BDF1 and C57BL/6) were studied. The total ganglioside concentrations of the whole brains were almost constant from young adulthood until the beginning of senescence, but decreased constant from young adulthood until the beginning of senescence, but decreased during senescence to about 80% of the constant level observed at the period before the beginning of senescence. In spite of the constancy of the ganglioside concentrations at the period before the beginning of senescence, the composition gradually changed, with an increase of GM1 and decreases of GD1b, GT1b and GQ1b. During the senescence, all of the gangliosides decreased in their concentrations, but GD1a, GT1b and GQ1b decreased to a markedly greater extent (GT1b greater than GD1a greater than GQ1b). The regional gangliosides in olfactory bulb, cerebrum cortex, cerebrum white matter, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum and medulla oblongata were compared between 3- and 30-month-old mice of both strains. Significant changes in ganglioside concentrations were observed in both strains in the cerebrum and the hippocampus. In the cerebrum white matter, cerebellum and medulla oblongata, GM1 and GM4 contents significantly increased in the senescent mice.",
