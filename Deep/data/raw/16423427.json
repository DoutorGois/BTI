     "AB": "Environmental influences during early life periods, particularly those provided by the mother or parents, are generally considered to have a strong impact on the development of brain and behaviour of the offspring. In the semi-precocial South American species Octodon degus, a rodent becoming increasingly popular in different laboratory research fields, the present study aimed to examine the consequences of the disturbance of the parent-offspring interaction induced by parental separation on the serotonergic neurotransmission. Based on a quantitative neurochemical approach using brain homogenates obtained from cortical regions and the hippocampus our results revealed that (i) the tissue levels of serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid showed in both sexes a moderate, around two-fold increase until adulthood, indicating relatively matured cortical and hippocampal serotonergic systems at birth. In addition, we found an age-, region- and sex-specific pattern of changes in the serotonergic system induced by (ii) an acute stress challenge early in life (1-h parental separation at the postnatal day 3, 8, 14 or 21) with the most pronounced effects at earlier ages (between postnatal days 3 and 14) in the female cortex and (iii) repeated stress exposure (1h daily) during the first 3 weeks of life affecting cortical regions of both sexes. Taken together, these data indicate that early life stress (i.e. parental separation) influences the developing serotonergic system in the semi-precocial O. degus, even if the brain is relatively well matured at the early stages of postnatal development.",
