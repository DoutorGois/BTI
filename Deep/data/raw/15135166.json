     "AB": "Three different classes of NMDA receptor antagonists were compared for their effectiveness in terminating prolonged status epilepticus (SE), induced by continuous hippocampal stimulation. Animals were treated after 150 min of SE by intraperitoneal administration of increasing doses of 3-((R,S)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP), MK-801 (dizocilpine), ifenprodil, or saline. EEG recordings were used to determine seizure termination. The first experiment (n = 57 animals) determined the most effective anticonvulsant dose of each agent by determining its ability to terminate SE within the next 300 min. Five control rats treated with normal saline after 150 min of SE continued to exhibit continuous seizures for the next 300 min. All drugs were administered after 150 min of SE. CPP terminated seizures with an ED(50) of 6.4 mg/kg; the maximal effective dose was 15 mg/kg. MK-801 has an ED(50) of 1.4 mg/kg; the maximal effective dose was 2 mg/kg. Ifenprodil was maximally effective at 30 mg/kg. However, an ED(50) could not be calculated. In a subsequent experiment, the NMDA antagonists were compared for their ability to terminate prolonged SE within 60 min of their administration at the most effective dose. MK-801 (2.0 mg/kg) terminated SE in 6 of 10 animals within 60 min, CPP (15 mg/kg) terminated it in 1 of 9 animals; ifenprodil (30 mg/kg) did not terminate it in any of 9 animals treated. In the 300 min following administration, CPP (6/9) and MK-801 (6/10) were equally efficacious in terminating SE but ifenprodil (2/7) was less effective (P = 0.065, chi-square test). The results indicate that the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 was superior to the competitive antagonist CPP and the pH-sensitive site antagonist ifenprodil, in terminating prolonged experimental SE.",
