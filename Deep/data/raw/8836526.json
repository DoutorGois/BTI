     "AB": "The purpose of this research was to characterize morphologically and electrophysiologically tissue slices obtained from the hippocampus of homing and non-homing pigeons. When hippocampal slices from the brain of homing and non-homing pigeons are observed under the dissecting microscope, diffuse fiber paths can be seen. These fiber pathways appeared to be identical with the medial fiber tract (VM) previously described histologically in the hippocampus of homing pigeon. Visualization of these tracts in living slices allowed placement of stimulating and recording electrodes in corresponding locations in these slices in both homing and non-homing pigeons. Extracellular potentials recorded from VM regions of the brains of both homing and non-homing pigeons were sensitive to CNQX indicating that glutamate may be a neurotransmitter in this area of pigeon hippocampus. These potentials could undergo long-term potentiation (LTP) following high frequency stimulation. This LTP was blocked by NMDA receptor antagonist APV in the hippocampus of homing pigeon, but was APV-resistant in the hippocampus of non-homing pigeon. Extracellular potentials from the hippocampus of homing pigeons were increased in amplitude when slices were perfused with Mg(2+)-free Ringer, while potential recorded from hippocampal slices from non-homing pigeons wre unaffected by Mg(2+)-free solutions. Intracellular recordings from the hippocampal slices of homing pigeons revealed that about half the cells demonstrated excitatory synaptic potentials evoked by extracellular stimulation. The EPSP was sometimes large enough to trigger an action potential. Neurons filled with the fluorescent dye, Lucifer Yellow, in the hippocampus of homing pigeons showed multipolar structure. The response of these cells to extracellular stimulation provides the activity responsible for the extracellular potentials which can undergo LTP.",
