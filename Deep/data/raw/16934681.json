     "AB": "Oxidative stress markers and functional tests were studied to confirm early biochemical and functional changes in retina and hippocampus of diabetic mice. The effects of lutein treatment were also tested. Mice were induced diabetic by alloxan injection and divided into subgroups: control, control+lutein, diabetic, diabetic+lutein, diabetic+insulin, and diabetic+insulin+lutein. Treatments started on Day 4 after alloxan injection and animals were sacrificed on Day 14. Malondialdehyde and glutathione concentrations and glutathione peroxidase activity were measured as oxidative stress markers. The following functional tests for retina and hippocampus were performed: electroretinogram and Morris water maze test. NFkappaB activity was also measured. Oxidative stress and NFkappaB activity increase in the retina and hippocampus after 15 days of diabetes. Impairment of the electroretinogram and a correlation between latencies of the water maze test and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were observed. Lutein prevented all these changes even under hyperglycemic conditions. Retina appears to be affected earlier than hippocampus by diabetes-induced oxidative stress. Although a proper glycemic control is desirable in preventing the development of diabetic complications, it is not sufficient to prevent them completely. Lutein could be an appropriate coadjuvant treatment for the changes observed in this study.",
