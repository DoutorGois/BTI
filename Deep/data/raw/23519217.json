     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: Recent study shows that silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) regulation may be involved with depression. Electroconvulsive shock (ECS) has been used for the treatment of depression, but little is known about the effect of ECS on the changes in SIRT1 levels in the brain. The present study was designed to observe whether ECS dynamically regulates SIRT1 levels in the hippocampus and hypothalamus; both of these regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. METHODS: Male imprinting control region mice were given a single ECS via ear clip electrodes, and then killed 0.5, 2, 8, 24, or 48 hours after ECS. Changes in SIRT1 were observed by Immunohistochemistry, and obtained results were compared with sham controls that did not receive ECS. RESULTS: Silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog 1 immunoreactivity levels in the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus peaked 2 hours after ECS and then returned to control levels by 24 hours after ECS. Silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog 1 immunoreactivity levels in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus, hypothalamic paraventricular, dorsomedial, arcuate, and suprachiasmatic nuclei peaked 8 hours after ECS but had not completely returned to baseline levels 48 hours after ECS, except for the dentate gyrus. Electroconvulsive shock resulted in a gradual increase of SIRT1 immunoreactivity in the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus and lateral hypothalamic area, which appeared to be still rising or peaking at the 48-hour post-ECS time point. CONCLUSIONS: The present results demonstrate that a single ECS increases SIRT1 in the mouse hippocampus and hypothalamus differentially in a region-specific time-dependent manner.",
