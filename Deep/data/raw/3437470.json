     "AB": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is the best-characterized neurotrophic substance and has recently been shown to influence cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. Hippocampus and neocortex, the primary targets for these central neurons, have further been found to contain high levels of NGF. Using enzyme immunoassay and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) histochemistry we have now studied the levels of NGF and AChE after a specific cholinergic lesion, transection of the fimbria fornix comprising the major cholinergic input to hippocampus. Fimbriectomy in adult rats led to a marked decrease in AChE-positive nerve terminals in both hippocampus and neocortex 10 days later, and to an increase (40%) of NGF protein concentration in hippocampus. thirty days after surgery, NGF had returned to control levels and remained there after 90 days. Removal of superior cervical ganglion did not alter the results. The density of cholinergic terminals in both hippocampus and neocortex increased with time (90 days) after fimbrial transection. The results support the idea that cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain take up and retrogradely transport NGF from their target areas and suggest that transection of the pathway interrupts the transport thereby increasing NGF distal to the lesion. The return of NGF to control levels probably reflects reestablished cholinergic contracts in the hippocampus.",
