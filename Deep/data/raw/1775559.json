     "AB": "The effect of the influence of brain tissue transplantation on behavior avoidance as zoosocial and artificial stimuli was examined in rats after unilateral transplantation of embryonic tissue to the cortex parietal region. Pieces of neocortex and hippocampus (NC + HC) were introduced to one group of twenty rats. Pieces of amygdala and hypothalamus (AM + HT) were introduced to twenty other animals composing a second group. Ten intact animals served as a control group. In the group receiving transplants of AM + HT, by one week after surgery the number of animals avoiding zoosocial stimulus was significantly increased. In the group receiving transplants of NC + HC, by one week after transplantation, a considerable increase in the time of avoiding artificial aversive stimuli was observed for most of the animals.",
