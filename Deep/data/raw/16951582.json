     "AB": "Behavioral stress facilitates long-term depression but impairs long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. Recent evidence in vitro demonstrates that the NR2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype glutamate receptor antagonist Ro25-6981 prevents the behavioral stress-facilitated hippocampal long-term depression. It is, however, unknown whether Ro25-6981 influences hippocampal long-term depression and long-term potentiation induction in vivo under stressful condition. Here, we found that infusion of Ro25-6981 (2.3 microg in 6 microl, intracerebroventricular for 10 min) 30 min before low-frequency stimulation prevented the facilitation of hippocampal long-term depression by acute stress in anesthetized adult rats. Moreover, infusion of Ro25-6981 30 min before high-frequency stimulation reversed stress-impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation. These results suggest that the NR2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype glutamate receptors are crucial for the effects of behavioral stress on hippocampal long-term depression and long-term potentiation in vivo.",
