     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate non-Gaussian diffusion changes of the whole-brain and its correlation with cognitive performance in patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD), using diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). METHODS: Twenty-six patients with early AD and twenty-six normal controls underwent diffusion imaging. Seven parametric maps were calculated from multiple b-value diffusion data, including mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis (AK), radial kurtosis (RK), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AxD) and radial diffusivity (RD). Voxel-based analyses were performed to evaluate the group difference between the AD patients and normal controls. Then correlation between the diffusion parameters (MK, FA and MD) and cognitive performance were analyzed in AD patients. RESULTS: For AD patients, increased MD, AxD and RD were found in white matter (WM), including the genu of corpus callosum, bilateral cingulate bundle, bilateral temporal and frontal WM, and were also found in gray matter (GM), including the bilateral temporal GM, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, thalamus, and amygdala. These regions were partially overlapped with those showing decreased FA, MK, AK and RK. However, only kurtosis indices could detect the significant differences in the lentiform nucleus between AD patients and health control. DKI indices in AD patients significantly correlated with the clinical scores in genu of CC, cingulate bundle, temporal and frontal lobe, while the voxel number showing significant correlation with MK was more than that with FA and MD. CONCLUSIONS: Early AD patients already have microstructural changes in both WM and GM. DKI can provide supplementary information in reflecting these changes and may be sensitive in diagnosing early AD.",
