     "AB": "Corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and glucocorticoids affect hypophysiotrophic regions of the brain and influence limbic system activity. Since the latter mediates emotional responses, changes in gene expression in regions such as the hippocampus may provide new information on neural stress mechanisms. In this study, mRNA for CRH and selected ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) subunits (NR1, GluR2, GluR3) was quantified in the hippocampus of pigs in which stress was simulated by central administration of CRH (100 microg). Increases in hippocampal CRH mRNA were detected in the CA3 subfield 4 h later, and in the CA1, CA2 and CA3 subfields 24 h post-treatment. However, there were no associated changes in iGluR subunit mRNAs, although the ratio GluR3: GluR2 increased in the dentate gyrus after 4 h. These results, together with a recent similar finding in rats subjected to restraint, point to an involvement of hippocampal CRH in the neuronal response to stress.",
