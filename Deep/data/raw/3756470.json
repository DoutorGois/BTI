     "AB": "Hippocampal slices were taken from 7-day-old rats and maintained in vitro for 1-3 weeks. The organization of intrahippocampal connections in these explants was studied by placing onto the tissue small crystals of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) soaked with the detergent Nonidet. Antero- and retrograde transport of HRP was visualized by diaminobenzidine. The principal arrangement of intrinsic hippocampal connections closely resembles the in situ situation of the adult rat. The use of HRP crystals provides a fast and convenient tool for the study of connections in brain explants.",
