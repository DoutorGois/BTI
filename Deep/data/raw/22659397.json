     "AB": "The present study was aimed at investigating the behavioral and molecular effects of tianeptine. To this aim, Wistar rats were treated with tianeptine (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg) or imipramine (30 mg/kg) acutely and chronically. The results showed that both treatments reduced the immobility time. The BDNF levels were increased in the prefrontal cortex with tianeptine and decreased in the nucleus accumbens after acute treatment; in chronic treatment, BDNF levels were increased in the prefrontal and hippocampus with tianeptine. Acute treatment decreased the citrate synthase activity in the prefrontal cortex with tianeptine, and increased it in the amygdala with imipramine; chronic treatment increased the citrate synthase in the hippocampus with tianeptine. The creatine kinase was increased in the prefrontal cortex with tianeptine and in the amygdala with imipramine after acute treatment; chronic treatment increased the creatine kinase activity in the hippocampus with imipramine and tianeptine. The complex I activity was decreased in the prefrontal cortex with imipramine and increased in the hippocampus with tianeptine. The other complexes were increased with imipramine and tianeptine at all doses, but were related to the treatment given and the brain area studied. Chronic treatment increased the malate dehydrogenase activity in the amygdala with tianeptine. Acute treatment decreased the succinate activity in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala with tianeptine; chronic treatment increased the succinate activity in the hippocampus with tianeptine at all doses. In conclusion, tianeptine exerted antidepressant-like behavior which can be attributed to its effects on pathways related to depression, such as BDNF and metabolism energy.",
