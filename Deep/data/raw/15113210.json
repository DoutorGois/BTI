     "AB": "This paper describes a simple method for the preparation and characterization of protein density gradients on solid supports. The method employs colloidal metal nanoparticles as protein carriers and optical tags and is capable of forming linear, exponential, 1D, 2D, and multiprotein gradients of varying slope without expensive or sophisticated surface patterning techniques. Surfaces patterned with proteins using the procedures described within are shown to support cell growth and are thus suitable for studies of protein-cell interactions.",
