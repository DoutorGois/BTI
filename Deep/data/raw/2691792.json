     "AB": "The incorporation of labeled precursors in phospholipids and glycolipids was studied in discrete brain areas of rats with innate vasopressin deficiency (Brattleboro, DI) and intact Long Evans animals (LE). Tracer incorporation was found to be reduced in septal, hypothalamic and hippocampal phospholipids, but enhanced in the glycolipid fraction isolated from the hypothalamus and hippocampus of Brattleboro rats. The results indicate that inherited vasopressin deficit seems to be associated with altered lipid synthesis in some brain areas of the Brattleboro rat, suggesting a probability for impaired translation of chemical signals.",
