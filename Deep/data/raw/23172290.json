     "AB": "RNA editing by adensosine deaminases is a widespread mechanism to alter genetic information in metazoa. In addition to modifications in non-coding regions, editing contributes to diversification of protein function, in analogy to alternative splicing. However, although splicing programs respond to external signals, facilitating fine tuning and homeostasis of cellular functions, a similar regulation has not been described for RNA editing. Here, we show that the AMPA receptor R/G editing site is dynamically regulated in the hippocampus in response to activity. These changes are bi-directional, reversible and correlate with levels of the editase Adar2. This regulation is observed in the CA1 hippocampal subfield but not in CA3 and is thus subfield/celltype-specific. Moreover, alternative splicing of the flip/flop cassette downstream of the R/G site is closely linked to the editing state, which is regulated by Ca(2+). Our data show that A-to-I RNA editing has the capacity to tune protein function in response to external stimuli.",
