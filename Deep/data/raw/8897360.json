     "AB": "The purpose of the study was to determine whether diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) could identify focal lesions that develop in ischemia-sensitive cerebral tissues during reperfusion following global brain ischemia. Localized 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) measurements were also obtained to determine whether abnormal spectroscopic markers were associated with focal lesions and to define time correlations between DWI and metabolic changes. Brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging measurements were made in a cat model of repetitive global cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Five animals were exposed to three episodes of 10 min vascular occlusions at hourly intervals. Three animals were evaluated as controls. DWI, T2WI, and 1H-MRS data were acquired for up to 12 h. Transient focal DWI hyperintensity was detected in the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cortical watershed areas. These focal abnormalities usually appeared during the final reperfusion and eventually spread to encompass all of the gray matter. Spectroscopic measurements demonstrated the expected elevation of the lactate signal intensity during vessel occlusion, which returned to normal during early reperfusion. A subsequent rise in the lactate signal occurred approximately 3-4 h after the beginning of the third reperfusion. This late lactate elevation occurred after focal hyperintensities were identified by DWI. No significant signal changes were seen in spectroscopic metabolites other than lactate. The study illustrates that DWI and 1H-MRS are sensitive to focal cerebral lesions that occur during reperfusion following global cerebral ischemia.",
