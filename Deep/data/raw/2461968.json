     "AB": "Efferent projections of the medial cortex of the lizards Podarcis hispanica and Gallotia stehlinii were studied by examining the transport of horseradish peroxidase; results were correlated with those from Timm-stained sections. Two efferent systems were found. The first reaches the distal part of the outer plexiform layer in the medial, dorsomedial, and dorsal cortices, i.e., zones that are negative to Timm staining, and possibly originates from horizontal fusiform neurons. The second reaches the Timm-positive zones in the cortex and septum and is topographically arranged: the vertical portion of the intermediate and caudal medial cortex and the entire rostral medial cortex project to the inner two-thirds of the outer plexiform layer of the dorsomedial cortex and of the medial subfield of the dorsal cortex; to the paraventricular zone of the inner plexiform layer of the medial cortex; and bilaterally to the dorsal part of the dorsal precommissural septum. The dorsal part of the intermediate and caudal medial cortex and the ventralmost folded part of its caudal edge project rostrally to the juxtasomatic zone of the outer plexiform layer and the entire inner plexiform layer of the intermediate and lateral subfields of the dorsal cortex and to the ventral part of the dorsal septum. In its intense Timm reaction and its ultrastructural properties, as reported in earlier studies, the Timm-positive fiber system of the lizard brain shows a close resemblance to the mossy fiber system of the mammalian hippocampus.",
