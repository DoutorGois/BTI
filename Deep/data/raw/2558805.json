     "AB": "The neuroanatomical distribution of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors was studied in Japanese quail by quantitative in vitro autoradiography using the specific antagonist [3H]prazosin as the ligand. The presence of saturable (Bmax less than 200 fmol/mg protein) high affinity (Kd less than 0.12 nM) binding sites was detected by saturation analysis. High concentrations of [3H]prazosin binding sites were detected in the archistriatum/pars ventralis, the hippocampus, the cortex piriformis, the area corticoidea dorsolateralis, the dorsal thalamus, and the nucleus praetectalis. Lower concentrations were seen in the intercollicular nucleus, the lateral septum, and the posterior and tuberal hypothalamus. Very little binding was seen in the preoptic and anterior hypothalamic areas. The relatively high number of binding sites identified in the telencephalic structures agrees well with previous mammalian studies. This is in contrast with the pattern in the anterior hypothalamus where, in mammals, a number of nuclei have been reported to contain a high receptor density.",
