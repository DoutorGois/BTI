     "AB": "Stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) protects patients from focal cerebral ischemic injury, and transection of the cervical sympathetic trunk (TCST) in a rat model can mimic SGB in humans. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of TCST on neuronal damage in the hippocampus in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in an attempt to elucidate the neuroprotective effects of SGB. The modified method of Zea Longa was used to establish the permanent MCAO model. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham-operated group, MCAO group, and TCST group. The animals in TCST group were sacrificed 48 h after TCST which was performed after the establishment of the MCAO model. Proteins were extracted from the ipsilateral hippocampus and analyzed by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF). The levels of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) were measured as well. The results showed that 11 types of proteins were identified by 2D-DIGE. The expressions of eight proteins were changed both in the sham-operated and TCST groups, and the expressions of the other three proteins were changed in all three groups. Moreover, the expression of NSF was higher in the TCST group than in the MCAO group but lower in the MCAO group than in sham-operated group. The ratio of NSF expression between the MCAO group and shamoperated group was -1.37 (P<0.05), whereas that between the TCST group and MCAO group was 1.35 (P<0.05). Our results imply that TCST increases the expression of NSF in the hippocampus of adult rats with focal cerebral ischemia, which may contribute to the protection of the injured brain. Our study provides a theoretical basis for the therapeutic application of SGB to patients with permanent cerebral ischemia.",
