     "AB": "The objective of the present study was to examine the role of selenium in the metabolism of A beta and in A beta-induced neuronal death. Selenium treatment significantly reduced A beta 40, A beta 42, and sAPP beta production by reducing A beta producing beta-secretase and gamma-secretase activities. The lipid peroxidation product 4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE)-induced transcription of beta-secretase (BACE1) was blocked by selenium. Finally, our data show that selenium protects against HNE and A beta-mediated toxicity in primary cultured neurons. The present study suggests that selenium may be able to salvage the neuronal degeneration of Alzheimer's disease, thereby limiting beta-amyloid production and neuronal death.",
