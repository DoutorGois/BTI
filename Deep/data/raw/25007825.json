     "AB": "Mical is a reduction-oxidation (redox) enzyme that functions as an unusual F-actin disassembly factor during Drosophila development. Although three Molecule interacting with CasL (MICAL) proteins exist in vertebrate species, their mechanism of action remains poorly defined and their role in vivo unknown. Here, we report that vertebrate MICAL-1 regulates the targeting of secretory vesicles containing immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs) to the neuronal growth cone membrane through its ability to control the actin cytoskeleton using redox chemistry, thereby maintaining appropriate IgCAM cell surface levels. This precise regulation of IgCAMs by MICAL-1 is essential for the lamina-specific targeting of mossy fibre axons onto CA3 pyramidal neurons in the developing mouse hippocampus in vivo. These findings reveal the first in vivo role for a vertebrate MICAL protein, expand the repertoire of cellular functions controlled through MICAL-mediated effects on the cytoskeleton, and provide insights into the poorly characterized mechanisms underlying neuronal protein cell surface expression and lamina-specific axonal targeting.",
