     "AB": "beta-amyloid (A beta) deposition in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) was studied in elderly non-demented (ND) cases and in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, A beta deposits were present throughout the MTL although density was less in the hippocampus than the adjacent cortical regions. In the ND cases, no A beta deposits were recorded in 6 cases and in the remaining 8 cases, A beta deposits were confined to the cortical regions adjacent to the hippocampus. The mean density of A beta deposits in the cortical regions examined was greater in AD than in the ND cases but there was a significant overlap between the two groups. The ratio of mature to diffuse A beta deposits was greater in the ND than the AD cases. In both patient groups, A beta deposits formed clusters in the cortex and many tissues exhibited a regular distribution of clusters along the cortex parallel to the pia. The mean dimension of the A beta clusters was greater in AD than in the ND cases. Hence, few aspects of A beta deposition appeared to consistently separate AD from ND cases. However, the spread of A beta pathology between modular units of the cortex and into regions of the hippocampus could be factors in the development of AD.",
