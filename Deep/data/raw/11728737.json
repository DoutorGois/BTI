     "AB": "The problem of post-mortem assessment of short central fear reaction preceding death has been obscure till now. The preliminary results obtained by authors have encouraged them to further research on this topic. Time of aversive sensory stimulation in the presented study was considerably decreased in comparison to the preliminary investigations. The concentration of glutamate was assayed in the selected structures of limbic system and in the cerebellum. The rats were subjected to different simultaneous modalities of sensory stimulation. The involvement of the hippocampi and the cerebellum was revealed as measured by glutamate concentration increase in the whole structures homogenates. The dominant role of mechanical stimulus has been suggested based on the measured increase of glutamate concentration in the whole cerebellum homogenate. By using the presented experimental paradigm a possible application of the biochemical assessment of human brain tissue might be developed in the future for implementing in the field of forensic pathology. The biochemical evaluation of \"frozen frames\" of neurotransmission can possibly help reconstruct the events which had happened just before sudden and violent death.",
