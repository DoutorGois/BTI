     "AB": "Animal models may be useful in investigating the fundamental mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders, and may contribute to the development of new medications. A computerized literature search was used to collect studies on recently developed animal models for anxiety disorders. Particular cognitive-affective processes (eg, fear conditioning, control of stereotypic movements, social submissiveness, and trauma sensitization) may be particularly relevant to understanding specific anxiety disorders. Delineation of the phenomenology and psychobiology of these processes in animals leads to a range of useful models of these conditions. These models demonstrate varying degrees of face, construct, and predictive validity.",
