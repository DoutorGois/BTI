     "AB": "In the last two decades, the avian hippocampus has been repeatedly studied with respect to its architecture, neurochemistry, and connectivity pattern. We review these insights and conclude that we unfortunately still lack proper knowledge on the interaction between the different hippocampal subregions. To fill this gap, we need information on the functional connectivity pattern of the hippocampal network. These data could complement our structural connectivity knowledge. To this end, we conducted a resting-state fMRI experiment in awake pigeons in a 7-T MR scanner. A voxel-wise regression analysis of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations was performed in 6 distinct areas, dorsomedial (DM), dorsolateral (DL), triangular shaped (Tr), dorsolateral corticoid (CDL), temporo-parieto-occipital (TPO), and lateral septum regions (SL), to establish a functional connectivity map of the avian hippocampal network. Our study reveals that the system of connectivities between CDL, DL, DM, and Tr is the functional backbone of the pigeon hippocampal system. Within this network, DM is the central hub and is strongly associated with DL and CDL BOLD signal fluctuations. DM is also the only hippocampal region to which large Tr areas are functionally connected. In contrast to published tracing data, TPO and SL are only weakly integrated in this network. In summary, our findings uncovered a structurally otherwise invisible architecture of the avian hippocampal formation by revealing the dynamic blueprints of this network.",
