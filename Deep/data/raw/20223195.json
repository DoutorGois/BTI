     "AB": "Hippocampal place cells are active when the rat is at certain locations. The sequence of these active place cells is known to be rapidly replayed during sharp-wave-ripple events in the EEG. In this issue of Neuron, a study by Gupta et al. challenges previous notions that the replayed trajectories are solely a passive echo of past episodes. Rather, replay might also be an active process constructing a Tolmanian cognitive map of space, which makes flexible navigation possible.",
