     "AB": "This work aims at investigating the effects of hypoxic preconditioning on hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression in the hippocampus of mice during acute and repeated hypoxic exposures. The mice were randomly divided into three groups and exposed, respectively, to hypoxia for 4 runs (group H4), 1 run (group H1), and 0 run (group H0). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and chromatin immunoprecipitation were used to examine the HIF-1alpha responses in the mouse hippocampus following exposure to hypoxia. The tolerance of mice to hypoxia increased significantly following acute and repetitive exposure to autoprogressive hypoxia. Total mRNA, total protein, and nuclear protein were extracted from the hippocampus for RT-PCR, Western blot, and EMSA, respectively. The HIF-1alpha mRNA levels were found to be increased in group H1 and decreased in group H4. The HIF-1alpha protein levels and HIF-1 DNA-binding activities were increased in group H1 and markedly increased in group H4. One of the HIF-1 target genes, vascular endothelial growth factor, increased in group H4. HIF-1 activation is thought to be involved in the protection of the brain of hypoxic preconditioned mice.",
