     "AB": "The authors describe the results of stereotaxis treatment of epileptic patients with behaviour disturbances in developmental age. The indications to surgical treatment were established on the basis of stereo-EEG investigations. For the analysis 20 patients were selected and divided into two groups depending on the state of mental efficiency. Surgical treatment included selective amygdalotomy and hippocampotomy in different variants. The analysis of this material showed that the clinical improvement was greatest in patients with short period of epilepsy duration and with IQ above 90. This suggests that patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with behaviour disturbances in developmental age should be referred for stereo-EEG investions and stereotactic treatment possibly early.",
