     "PG": "87-93",
     "AB": "We have examined the effects of four dendrotoxin (DaTX) peptides, alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-DaTX, separated from the venom of the green mamba (Dendroaspis angusticeps), on field stimulation-evoked [3H]noradrenaline (NA) release from rat hippocampus and compared their effects with those of two other inhibitors of K+ channels, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and tetraethylammonium (TEA). 4-AP (10-300 microM) and TEA (0.1-5 mM) facilitated the evoked [3H]NA release in a concentration-dependent manner. The evoked [3H]NA release was reduced to about half by alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation (UK 14,304; 100 nM) and this reduction was antagonized by 4-AP (10-100 microM), whereas TEA even at 5 mM was a poor inhibitor of alpha 2-effects. alpha-DaTX (10-200 nM) mimicked 4-AP in increasing the electrically evoked [3H]NA release and diminishing the inhibitory effects of UK 14,304 in a concentration-dependent manner. delta-DaTX did not itself alter the electrically evoked [3H]NA release, but at 200 nM, it reduced the effects of alpha 2-receptor stimulation. beta- and gamma-DaTX (up to 200 nM) had no significant effects. 4-AP, 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP), TEA and the four dendrotoxins displaced the binding of [3H]p-aminoclonidine ([3H]PAC) from alpha 2-receptors. The IC50 values were 6.6 x 10(-4), 1.42 x 10(-3), 5.6 x 10(-2) for 4-AP, 3,4-DAP and TEA, respectively, and 3.19 x 10(-6) M for alpha-DaTX. Thus, their potency as inhibitors of alpha 2-receptors is apparently too low to account alone for the antagonism by K+ channel inhibitors of alpha 2-effects on NA release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
