     "AB": "This work sets out to investigate fast and slow dynamic processes and how they effect the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Functionally, the fast process will work as a time window to take a spatial coincidence among various inputs projected to the hippocampus, and the slow process will work as a temporal integrator of a sequence of dynamic events. Firstly, the two factors were studied using a \"burst\" stimulus and a \"long-interval patterns\" stimulus. Secondly, we propose that, for the induction of LTP, there are two dynamic processes, fast and slow, which are productively activated by bursts and long-interval patterns. The model parameters, a time constant of short dynamics and one of long dynamics, were determined by fitting the values obtained from model simulation to the experimental data. A molecular factor or cellular factors with these two time constants are likely to be induced in LTP induction.",
