     "AB": "Environmental manipulation alters hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in neonatal rats, but effects in adults have not been documented. Chronic environmental enrichment (EE) increases nerve-growth factor (NGF) concentrations in the adult rat hippocampus. Here we demonstrate that EE induces GR, but not mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) gene expression in specific hippocampal subfields (CA1 and CA2). This is accompanied by increased expression of mRNA encoding the (NGF-induced) immediate early gene NGFI-A in CA2, whereas expression of NGFI-B mRNA decreased in CA1 and CA2. The nature of any relationship between NGF, the transcription factors and GR remains to be determined, but the results demonstrate that chronic environmental manipulations alter hippocampal GR gene expression in adult rats.",
