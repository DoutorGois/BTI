     "AB": "Several organosulfur compounds found in garlic extract promoted the survival of rat hippocampal neurons in vitro. From the analysis of structure-activity relationship, thioallyl group in these compounds is essential for the manifestation of neurotrophic activity. S-Allyl-L-cysteine (SAC), one of the organosulfur compounds having thioallyl group in garlic extract, also promoted the axonal branching of cultured neurons. These results suggest that thioallyl compounds make a unique group of neurotrophic factors.",
