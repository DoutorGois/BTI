     "AB": "In vitro experiments demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of dipeptide pGlu-Asn-NH2, which corresponded to the N-terminal fragment of the major vasopressin metabolite AVP(4-9). The dipeptide in concentrations of 10(-5)-10(-7) M prevented death of HT-22 immortalized hippocampal neurons under conditions of oxidative stress and protected PC-12 rat pheochromocytoma cells from neurotoxic compound 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. pGlu-Asn-NH2 in a concentration of 10(-6) M increased the content of endogenous neuroprotective substances, neurotrophin NGF and heat shock protein HSP70 in HT-22 cells. Our results indicate that this dipeptide can be used for the therapy of Parkinson's disease.",
