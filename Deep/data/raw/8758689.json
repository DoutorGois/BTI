     "AB": "In the present investigation, the behavior of learning and memory of 1-month and 6-month-old mice was studied by using Y-maze and one-trial passive avoidance response device. The synaptosomal free [Ca2+]i of four main brain regions (Hippocampus, Cerebral cortex, Cerebellum, Tectum of midbrain) of these mice were measured by fluorescent probe Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 and an AR-CM-MIC cation measurement system. The results showed that, in comparison with 1-month-old mice, the ability of discrimination learning and memory of 6-month-old ones were attenuated, and the synaptosomal free [Ca2+]i of hippocampus was increased.",
