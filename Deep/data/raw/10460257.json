     "AB": "Disruption of the disabled-1 gene (Dab1) results in aberrant migration of neurons during development and disorganization of laminar structures throughout the brain. Dab1 is thought to function as an adapter molecule in signal transduction processes. It contains a protein-interaction (PI) domain similar to the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of the Shc oncoprotein, it is phosphorylated by the Src protein tyrosine kinase, and it binds to SH2 domains in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. To investigate the function of Dab1, we searched for binding proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system. We found that the PI domain of Dab1 interacts with the amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1). The association of Dab1 with APLP1 was confirmed in biochemical assays, and the site of interaction was localized to a cytoplasmic region of APLP1 containing the amino acid sequence motif Asn-Pro-x-Tyr (NPxY). NPxY motifs are involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and they have been shown to bind to PI domains present in several proteins. This region of APLP1 is conserved among all members of the amyloid precursor family of proteins. Indeed, we found that Dab1 also interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and APLP2 in biochemical association experiments. In transiently transfected cells, Dab1 and APLP1 colocalized in membrane ruffles and vesicular structures. Cotransfection assays in cultured cells indicated that APP family members increased serine phosphorylation of Dab1. Dab1 and APLP1 are expressed in similar cell populations in developing and adult brain tissue. These results suggest that Dab1 may function, at least in part, through association with APLP1 in the brain.",
