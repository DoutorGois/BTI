     "AB": "The efflux of mitochondrial protein cytochrome C to cytoplasm is one of the key events of mitochondrial dysfunction observed in post-ischemic pathology. We investigated the effect of intra-carotid infusion of 5-10 mg/kg of cyclosporin A (CsA) on the neuronal survival in CA1 sector of hippocampus and on the subcellular localization of cytochrome C in the model of 5 min gerbil brain ischemia. To discriminate between the immunosuppressive and the mitochondria protecting component of CsA action, we compared the effect of CsA with one other immunosuppressant FK506. Almost 75% of neurons in ischemia-affected brain area were saved after CsA but not after FK506 treatment. This protective effect was only observed when the drug was infused immediately upon reperfusion. Early CsA treatment was able to block an initial phase of cytochrome C release, occurring transiently at 30 min post-ischemia, an effect never observed after FK506 administration. We assessed the neuroprotective potency of CsA vs. FK506 in rat cortical primary culture treated with compounds that mimic destructive signals induced by brain ischemia. In all cases, neuronal death and cytochrome C release were evidently suppressed by CsA applied not later than 30 min after the initial insult. Thus, early treatment with CsA in vitro and after bolus intra-carotid injection in vivo can save neurons by inhibition of cytochrome C efflux to cytoplasm.",
