     "AB": "Many neurodegenerative diseases involve oxidative stress and excitotoxic cell death. In an attempt to further elucidate the signal transduction pathways involved in the cell death/cell survival associated with excitotoxicity, we have used an in vivo model of excitotoxicity employing kainic acid (KA)-induced neurotoxicity. Here, we show that extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 2, but not ERK 1, is phosphorylated and thereby activated in the hippocampus and cerebellum of kainic acid-treated mice. Phosphorylation and hence inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta), a general survival factor, is often a downstream consequence of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation. Indeed, GSK-3beta phosphorylation occurred in response to kainic acid exclusively in the affected hippocampus, but not as a consequence of ERK activation. This may represent a compensatory attempt at self-protection by the cells in this particular brain region. A role for GSK-3beta inhibition in cell survival was further supported by the fact that pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3beta using lithium chloride was protective against kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity in hippocampal slice cultures. This work supports a role for GSK-3beta in cell death in response to excitotoxins in vivo and further confirms that GSK-3beta plays a role in cell death/cell survival pathways.",
