     "AB": "A comment by Rudy and Sutherland [Rudy, J. R., & Sutherland, R. J. (2008). Is it systems or cellular consolidation? Time will tell. An alternative interpretation of the Morris Group's recent Science Paper. Neurobiology of Learning and Memory] has suggested an alternative account of recent findings concerning very rapid systems consolidation as described in a recent paper by Tse et al [Tse, D., Langston, R. F., Kakeyama, M., Bethus, I., Spooner, P. A., & Wood, E. R., et al. (2007). Schemas and memory consolidation. Science, 316, 76-82]. This is to suppose that excitotoxic lesions of the hippocampus cause transient disruptive neural activity outside the target structure that interferes with cellular consolidation in the cortex. We disagree with this alternative interpretation of our findings and cite relevant data in our original paper indicating why this proposal is unlikely. Various predictions of the two accounts are nonetheless outlined, together with the types of experiments needed to resolve the issue of whether systems consolidation can occur very rapidly when guided by activated neural schemas.",
