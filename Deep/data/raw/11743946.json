     "AB": "This study examined the expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) mRNA and the cellular localization of GDNF production in rats subjected to transient forebrain ischemia induced by four-vessel occlusion. Transient forebrain ischemia induced GDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus from 3 h to 3 days after the ischemic episode, with peak expression at 6 h. The GDNF mRNA increase in the cerebral cortex was similar to that in the hippocampus, whereas no increase in GDNF mRNA was observed in the striatum and brainstem. Western blot analysis showed that GDNF in the hippocampal CA1 region was increased slightly from 3 to 24 h after the ischemia, and then subsequently declined to below the baseline level. In the hippocampus, GDNF was evenly produced in pyramidal neurons of both sham-operated rats and normal rats, as determined by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, we found that ischemia-induced reactive astrocytes, as well as surviving neurons, produced GDNF in 3-7 days after the ischemia. On the other hand, in other regions, such as the cerebral cortex, striatum, and brainstem, there was no change in GDNF-positive cells secondary to ischemia. These findings suggest that expression of GDNF mRNA is regulated in part via ischemia-induced neuronal degeneration. They also suggest that ischemia-induced reactive astrocytes may produce GDNF to protect against neuronal death. Therefore, GDNF may play an important role in ischemia-induced neuronal death in the brain.",
