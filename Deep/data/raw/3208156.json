     "AB": "Quantitative in-vitro autoradiographic study was performed to localize two prominent second-messenger systems (the adenylate cyclase and phosphoinositide systems) in the normal gerbil brain. [3H] Forskolin and [3H] phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate (PDBu) were used to identify the regional distribution of adenylate cyclase and protein kinase C, respectively. The localization of the forskolin binding was not uniform, being particularly concentrated in the striatum, the accumbens nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, the substantia nigra, the CA3 region of the hippocampus and the molecular layer of the cerebellum. On the other hand, the PDBu binding was rather uniform, although the superficial layer of the cerebral neocortices, the strata oriens of the CA1 region of the hippocampus and the molecular layer of the cerebellum showed relatively dense binding. Quantitative autoradiography of the second-messenger systems in the brain is expected to provide important information concerning the role of neurotransmitters in the pathophysiology of various conditions.",
