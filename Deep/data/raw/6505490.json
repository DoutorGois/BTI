Injections were made in cingular and parietal cortex and hippocampal formation. Large projection from the LD to the cingular and subicular cortex were visualized as reciprocal connections. No pathway to parietal area 7 was found. The course of the fibers is via the fornix, the cingular bundle and the retro-lenticular portion of the internal capsule. The result of this study make it necessary to reconsider neuropathological hypotheses on memory.",
