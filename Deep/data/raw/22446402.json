     "AB": "In this study, we investigated diabetic stage dependent cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic rats. The animals were sacrificed at 2, 3 and 4 weeks after STZ treatment. Blood glucose levels were increased after STZ treatment. COX-2 immunoreactivity in dentate gyrus was significantly increased in these regions 3 weeks after STZ treatment and restored to its basal level to 4 weeks after STZ treatment. In contrast, COX-2 immunoreactivity was not changed in CA3 region in all groups. These results suggest that STZ-induced type 1 diabetes transiently, but not permanently, decreased synaptic transmission and plasticity 3 weeks after STZ treatment in the dentate gyrus.",
