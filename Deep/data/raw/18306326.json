     "AB": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused by mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2. While patients with RTT show widespread changes in brain function, relatively few studies document changes in brain structure and none examine in detail whether mutations causing more severe clinical phenotypes are linked to more marked changes in brain structure. To study the influence of MeCP2-deficiency on the morphology of brain areas and axonal bundles, we carried out an extensive morphometric study of two Mecp2-mutant mouse models (Mecp2B and Mecp2J) of RTT. Compared to wildtype littermates, striking changes included reduced brain weight ( approximately 13% and approximately 9%) and the volumes of cortex ( approximately 11% and approximately 7%), hippocampus (both by approximately 8%), and cerebellum ( approximately 12% and 8%) in both mutant mice. At 3 weeks of age, most (24 of 47) morphological parameters were significantly altered in Mecp2B mice; fewer (18) were abnormal in Mecp2J mice. In Mecp2B mice, significantly lower values for cortical area were distributed along the rostrocaudal axis, and there was a reduced length of the olfactory bulb ( approximately 10%) and periaqueductal gray matter ( approximately 16%). In Mecp2J mice, while there was significant reduction in rostrocaudal length of cortex, this parameter was also abnormal in hippocampus ( approximately 10%), periaqueductal gray matter ( approximately 13%), fimbria ( approximately 18%), and anterior commissure ( approximately 10%). Our findings define patterns of Mecp2 mutation-induced changes in brain structure that are widespread and show that while some changes are present in both mutants, others are not. These observations provide the underpinning for studies to further define microarchitectural and physiological consequences of MECP2 deficiency.",
