     "AB": "Mild alterations in cognitive function are present in normal aging and severe cognitive alterations are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cognitive change in AD has been correlated to the characteristic pathologic lesions in the brain, senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles. Senile plaques are the most consistent correlative marker in AD. We present preliminary data indicating that abundant SP are found in the brains of nondemented patients dying with or as a result of critical coronary artery disease (cCAD) compared to nonheart disease (non-HD) subjects; 15 of 20 cCAD patients contained SP and only two of 16 non-HD patients contained SP.",
