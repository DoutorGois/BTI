     "AB": "The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of selenium (Se) and iodine (I) for expressions of c-fos and c-jun mRNA and their proteins in cultured rat hippocampus cells in selenium- and iodine-containing medium. With cultured rat hippocampus cells, the different doses of Se and I were added into the medium. The expressions of c-fos/c-jun in cultured rat hippocampus cells (1 d, 3 d, 5 d, 7 d, and 10 d) were studied by using both in situ hybridization histochemistry and SABC immunohistochemistry techniques. Both Se and I could enhance expressions of c-fos and c-jun mRNA and their proteins, especially c-jun mRNA expression in the Se and I united group. Se and I could promote the expressions of c-fos and c-jun and thus may affect the differentiation and development of hippocampus neurons.",
