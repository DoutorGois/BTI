     "AB": "The pattern of dendritic branching, together with the density of synapses and receptor composition, defines the electrical properties of a neuron. The development of the dendritic arbor and its additional stabilization are highly orchestrated at the molecular level and are guided by intrinsic mechanisms and extracellular information. Although protein translation is known to contribute to these processes, the role of its local component has not been fully explored. For local translation, mRNAs are transported to dendrites in their dormant form as ribonucleoparticles (RNPs). We hypothesized that disturbing spatial mRNA distribution via RNP targeting may result in severe underdevelopment of the dendritic arbor. Zipcode binding protein 1 (ZBP1) controls beta-actin mRNA transport and translation in dendrites. We showed that proper cellular levels of ZBP1, its ability to engage in mRNA binding, and Src-dependent release of mRNA cargo from ZBP1 are vital for dendritic arbor development in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Moreover, beta-actin overexpression significantly alleviated the effects of ZBP1 knockdown. These results suggest that ZBP1-dependent dendritic mRNA transport contributes to proper dendritic branching.",
