     "AB": "There are few clues as to the processes that underlie recovery of function from human amnesia. Evidence is offered from the perspective of a study of recovery of function during an episode of transient global amnesia (TGA) that occurred as a complication of a cerebral angiographic procedure being carried out in a neurosciences centre, and where there was therefore a unique opportunity to examine acute changes in memory function. This allowed us to conduct the first quantitative study where shrinkage of anterograde and retrograde memory loss was plotted at four separate intervals throughout the acute recovery process, and also 24 hr later. Recovery of retrograde amnesia preceded recovery from anterograde amnesia. Resolution of a naming deficit more closely paralleled recovery from retrograde amnesia rather than anterograde amnesia. Within retrograde amnesia for public events, there was a temporal gradient of memory loss, with more recent events affected to a greater degree than earlier events. Within anterograde amnesia, picture recognition memory preceded recovery of story recall memory. On the basis of these findings, and related observations in the published literature, it is proposed that recovery from some types of human amnesia, such as that associated with TGA, follows a 'lateral-to-medial' rule--lateral inferotemporal areas that play a major role in retrograde amnesia recover first from hypometabolism related to the TGA attack, followed by 'interface' areas such as the rhinal and parahippocampal cortices that are considered to have a role in both anterograde and retrograde memory functioning, with the last areas to recover physiological integrity being discrete limbic-diencephalic structures such as the hippocampus.",
