     "AB": "The growth-associated protein GAP-43 is a presynaptic membrane phosphoprotein that plays a key role in guiding the growth of axons and in modulating the formation of new synapses. To identify the cells that synthesize GAP-43 mRNA, we applied direct in situ reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (in situ RT-PCR) in cerebellum and hippocampus of adult rat brain. In situ RT-PCR revealed GAP-43 mRNA in cerebellar granule cells, in Purkinje cells and in some interneurons of the molecular layer. Previous in situ hybridization studies had demonstrated a dense label throughout the granular layer of the cerebellar cortex but no labeling of other cerebellar neurons. Hippocampal cells showing distinct GAP-43 mRNA signal after in situ RT-PCR were CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, CA4 hilar cells, and dentate gyrus granule cells, whereas in situ hybridization studies had detected GAP-43 mRNA only in CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our data indicate that GAP-43 mRNA is widely distributed, suggesting that many cell types are potentially involved in synaptic plasticity events. (J Histochem Cytochem 49:1195-1196, 2001)",
