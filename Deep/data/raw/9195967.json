     "AB": "Three novel subunit-specific antisera to the beta1, beta2, and beta3 subunits of rat gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors have been used to study the native receptor in the rat brain. Affinity-purified anti-beta1, anti-beta2, and anti-beta3 antibodies recognized in immunoblots protein bands of 57, 55, and 57 kDa, respectively. Quantitative immunoprecipitation of solubilized GABAA receptors from various rat brain regions showed that the beta2 subunit was the most abundant isoform in cerebellum (in 96% of the GABAA receptors) and cerebral cortex (64%) but that it was the least abundant isoform in hippocampus (44%). The beta3 subunit was found most abundant in hippocampus (64%) followed by cerebral cortex (48%) and cerebellum (33%). The beta1 subunit was present in a very small proportion of the cerebellar GABAA receptors (3%), but it was present in a high proportion of the GABAA receptors from the hippocampus (49%) and cerebral cortex (32%). Quantitative receptor immunoprecipitation or immunopurification followed by immunoblotting experiments have revealed the existence of colocalization of two different beta subunit isoforms in a significant proportion of the brain GABAA receptors. Thus, in the rat cerebral cortex 33% of the GABAA receptors have both beta2 and beta3 subunits, and 19% of the receptors have both beta1 and beta3 subunits. The extent of colocalization of beta subunit isoforms varied among brain regions, being highest in hippocampus and lowest in cerebellum. These and other results taken together suggest that the number of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits (stoichiometry) in the brain GABAA receptor pentamers might not be unique. It might vary depending on receptor type.",
