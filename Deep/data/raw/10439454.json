     "AB": "The neonatal destruction of the ventral hippocampus was introduced as a model to recreate features of schizophrenia in the rat. While behavioral consequences of this intervention have been studied in detail, less is known about the cellular processes underlying the deviant behavior. We studied in rats (neonatally or adult lesioned, controls) brain areas receiving or not receiving hippocampal projections. The number of neurons and the expression of the cell markers L-ornithine decarboxylase, nitric oxide synthase/NADPH diaphorase, calretinin and GFAP were estimated. Reduced numbers of neurons and increased immunostaining for ornithine decarboxylase and nitric oxide synthase in the prefrontal, perirhinal and entorhinal cortex of neonatally but not adult lesioned rats or controls demonstrate persistent cellular changes after ventral hippocampus damage.",
