     "AB": "The aim of the present study was to find optimal protocol of immunocytochemical reaction to NeuN nuclear protein for light and laser confocal microscopy, which would exclude the antigen heat unmasking procedure that results in deteriorating the state of the tissue and requires expensive adhesive-coated slides. Best preservation of the antigen was found to be provided by fixation in zinc-formalin and Bouin's fixative (for a period of less than 24 hrs). Two protocols allowing to avoid antigen heat unmasking procedure during demonstration of the NeuN neuronal label in paraffin sections by the light and confocal microscopy are presented.",
