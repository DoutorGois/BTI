     "AB": "Qifu-Yin (QFY), a widely used formula of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) derived from \"Jingyue Quanshu\", is one of the most commonly used TCM prescriptions for the clinical treatment of Alzheimer disease. The role of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and its receptor RAGE have attracted increasing attention as the pivotal role of Abeta has been questioned. The present study was designed to test the neuroprotective effects of QFY, and the possible mechanism in AGE-induced Alzheimer model rats. After injection of AGE in the CA3 area of the hippocampus, QFY (8.6, 4.3, and 2.15 g.kg(-1)), and a positive control drug donepezil (2 mg.kg(-1)) were administrated through gastric intubation to rats once daily for thirty consecutive days. Another positive control group was the AGE + anti-RAGE group, which was simultaneously injected with anti-RAGE antibody before AGE treatment. The control group, sham-operated group, as well as the AGE + anti-RAGE group received saline at the same dosage. The Morris water maze test and the step-down passive avoidance test were conducted to evaluate the cognitive function of the rats. The expression of RAGE and NF-kappaB were assayed by immunohistochemical staining. The levels of Abeta, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta in the hippocampus were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that QFY could significantly attenuate the memory impairment induced by AGE, decrease the expressions of RAGE and NF-kappaB, and reduce the levels of Abeta, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta in the hippocampus in a dose-dependent manner. Also, the blockage of RAGE could significantly reduce the impairments caused by AGEs. In conclusion, QFY could attenuate AGEs-induced, Alzheimer-like pathophysiological changes. These neuroprotective effects might be related to the RAGE/NF-kappaB pathway and its anti-inflammatory activity.",
