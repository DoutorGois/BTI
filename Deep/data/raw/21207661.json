     "AB": "AIM: To investigate the effect of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) on the nuclear translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) following NMDA administration in the primary cultured hippocampal neurons. METHODS: (1) PKCGAMMA or PKCepsilon- immunocytochemistry staining method was used after treating neurons with NMDA or CNTF. (2) The gray of the nucleus of the PKC-positive neurons were measured under the image pattern analysis system. RESULTS: (1) After NMDA administration of different concentration and time, Nucleus appear PKCgamma and PKCepsilon activities, especially the 100 micromol/L NMDA 30 min group. (2) The gray of nucleus in CNTF + 500 micromol/L NMDA group is similar to control group. CONCLUSION: NMDA can induce nuclear translocation of PKC in the primary cultured hippocampal neurons, and CNTF can inhibit the translocation. It suggests that the inhibition of PKC translocation induced by NMDA is one of the important reasons for the neuro-protective effects of CNTF.",
