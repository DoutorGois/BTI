     "AB": "Hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP) induces the synthesis of acetylcholine in the medial septal nucleus in vitro and in vivo. The precursor, HCNP-pp, is a multifunctional protein participating in important signaling pathways, such as MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). We recently demonstrated that HCNP-pp colocalizes with collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) at presynaptic terminals in the hippocampus, suggesting that HCNP-pp may play an important role in presynaptic function in association with CRMP-2. To clarify the involvement of phosphorylation in regulating the interaction between HCNP-pp and CRMP-2, we investigated the colocalization of HCNP-pp with unphosphorylated- and/or phosphorylated-CRMP-2 (pCRMP-2) at presynaptic terminals. We further determined if the phosphorylation of CRMP-2 affects the binding between those proteins. Here, we demonstrate that HCNP-pp predominantly colocalizes and associates with unphosphorylated and/or pSer-522-CRMP-2 at presynaptic terminals in the hippocampus. Interestingly, HCNP-pp does not associate with pThr-509/514-CRMP-2, which is primarily localized at postsynaptic terminals. These findings suggest that HCNP-pp, in association with unphosphorylated and/or pSer522-CRMP-2, plays an important role in presynaptic function in the mature hippocampus.",
