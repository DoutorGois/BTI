     "AB": "Trimethyltin (TMT) is an organotin neurotoxicant with effects that are selectively localized to the limbic system (especially the hippocampus), which produces memory deficits and temporal lobe seizures. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a beta-galactoside-binding lectin that is important in cell proliferation and regulation of apoptosis. The present study evaluated the temporal expression of Gal-3 in the hippocampus of adult BALB/c mice after TMT treatment (i.p., 2.5mg/kg). Western blotting analyses showed that Gal-3 immunoreactivity began to increase days after treatment; the immunoreactivity peaked significantly within days after treatment but significantly declined between days 4 and 8. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that Gal-3 expression was very rare in the hippocampi of vehicle-treated controls. However, Gal-3 immunoreactivity appeared between 2 and 8 days after TMT treatment and was primarily localized to the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), in which neuronal degeneration occurred. The immunoreactivity was detected predominantly in most of the Iba1-positive microglia and in some GFAP-positive astrocytes of the hippocampal DG. Furthermore, Gal-3 expression co-localized with the pro-inflammatory enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the hippocampal DG. Therefore, we suggest that Gal-3 is involved in the inflammatory process of neurodegenerative disorder induced by organotin intoxication.",
