     "AB": "BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that chronic treatment with antidepressants increases hippocampal neurogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms underlying their effects are unknown. Recently, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3beta)/beta-catenin signaling was shown to be involved in the mechanism of how antidepressants might influence hippocampal neurogenesis. METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine whether GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling is involved in the alteration of neurogenesis as a result of treatment with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The mechanisms involved in fluoxetine's regulation of GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway were also examined. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that fluoxetine increased the proliferation of embryonic neural precursor cells (NPCs) by up-regulating the phosphorylation of Ser9 on GSK-3beta and increasing the level of nuclear beta-catenin. The overexpression of a stabilized beta-catenin protein (DeltaN89 beta-catenin) significantly increased NPC proliferation, while inhibition of beta-catenin expression in NPCs led to a significant decrease in the proliferation and reduced the proliferative effects induced by fluoxetine. The effects of fluoxetine-induced up-regulation of both phosphorylation of Ser9 on GSK-3beta and nuclear beta-catenin were significantly prevented by the 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100635. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that fluoxetine may increase neurogenesis via the GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway that links postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor activation.",
