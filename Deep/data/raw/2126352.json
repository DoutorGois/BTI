     "AB": "The release of luteinizing hormone (LH) in response to electrical stimulation of septal nuclei (the diagonal band of Broca, DBB, and dorsal septal nucleus) and the subcallosal fornix has been studied in gonadectomized female cats. The cats were anesthetized with Althesin. Electrodes were placed on the medial and lateral aspects of the subcallosal fornix and paired bipolar stimulating electrodes were aimed at the DBB or dorsal septal nucleus. The effect of electrical stimulation of these regions on the secretion of LH was studied by radioimmunoassay of LH in serial blood samples taken before, during and after stimulation. Stimulation in the DBB or in the dorsal septal nucleus resulted in a peak of LH release during stimulation followed by further spontaneous peaks. All peaks showed an exponential decline. The frequency of spontaneous peaks following stimulation could reach the level found in unanesthetized cats. Stimulation of the subcallosal fornix produced a significant depression in the amplitude of LH release. The effects of DBB, dorsal septal and fornix stimulation are all exerted, we suggest, by projections to LHRH containing neurons in the preoptic region.",
