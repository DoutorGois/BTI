     "AB": "With the mouse pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), we showed a progressive loss of both principal cells and calbindin (CB)-, calretinin (CR)-, and parvalbumin (PV)-immunopositive interneurons in layers II-III of lateral entorhinal cortex (LEnt) from 2 months to 1 year after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PISE). In the efferent pathway of LEnt, more Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L)-labelled en passant and terminal boutons with larger diameters were shown in the hippocampus and subiculum; in the prefrontal, piriform, and perirhinal cortices; and in the amygdaloid complex in experimental mice at the two time points compared with the control after iontophoretical injection of an anterograde tracer PHA-L into the LEnt. Furthermore, the numbers of CB- or CR-immunopositive neurons contacted by PHA-L-labelled en passant and terminal boutons decreased in most of these areas at 2 months or 1 year after PISE. In the afferent pathway of LEnt, the numbers of retrogradely labelled neurons were reduced significantly in the ipsilateral piriform cortex and endopiriform nucleus at 2 months and 1 year and in the reuniens thalamic nucleus only at 1 year after injection of a retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) into the LEnt. The percentages of the number of CTB and CB or CR double-labelled neurons of all the retrogradely labelled neurons were also decreased in the reunions thalamic nucleus at 1 year after PISE. It is concluded that both cytoarchitectonic change and reorganization of afferent and efferent pathways in LEnt may be involved in the occurrence of TLE.",
