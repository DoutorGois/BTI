     "AB": "The influence of learning local protein synthesis was studied in the rat hippocampal synaptosomes. It is found that elaboration of two-way avoidance conditioned reflex causes a decrease in ability of hippocampal synaptosomes to include H3-leucin into proteins in experiments in vitro. It is suggested that cyclic adenosin 3'5'-monophosphate plays a definite role in controlling protein synthesis in the nerve endings during different influences including learning because its addition to the incubation medium activates sharply this process.",
