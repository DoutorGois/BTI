     "AB": "BACKGROUND: To establish a simple, economic, and reliable alternating current (AC)-induced cardiac arrest (ACCA) model in rabbits for cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation research. METHODS: Ventricular fibrillation was induced in 27 New Zealand rabbits by external transthoracic AC, which were randomly divided into three groups according to the duration of untreated ACCA (ACCA-3 minutes, ACCA-5 minutes, and ACCA-8 minutes). After ACCA, all animals received cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 2 minutes and subsequent defibrillation until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The troponin I levels were measured at 4 hours after ROSC. Animals died spontaneously or were killed at 72 hours after ROSC. The hippocampus were removed and fixed in 3% formalin. TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling and Nissl stainings were performed in 10-mum thickness coronal sections. Furthermore, two rabbits (without induction of ventricular fibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and defibrillation) served as normal control group. RESULTS: Mean survival times after ROSC were 48.57 hours +/- 24.70 hours, 18.0 hours +/- 15.13 hours, and 3.88 hours +/- 2.39 hours for groups ACCA-3 minutes, ACCA-5 minutes, and ACCA-8 minutes, respectively. Survival was significantly different between ACCA-3 minutes and other two groups (p = 0.002 and p = 0.01). Neuronal necrosis and apoptosis were found in the hippocampus CA1, CA2, and CA3 areas of group ACCA-3 minutes. In contrast, neuronal necrosis and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling positive cells were fewer in control animals. CONCLUSIONS: The rabbits in group ACCA-3 minutes had significant neuronal damage with apoptosis in hippocampus CA1, CA2, and CA3 areas at 72 hours after ROSC and survived longer than those in other groups. The model we describe may be a simple, economic, and reliable model for experimental investigation on cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation.",
