     "AB": "gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) in tissue extracts from five brain regions, the kidney and pancreas of 50-day-old rats was examined for its specific activity and affinity to immobilized concanavalin A (Con A). According to their descending GGT activity, the tissue extracts were classified in the following order: kidney >> pancreas >> olfactory bulbs > medulla oblongata > hippocampus > cerebellum > frontal cortex. Using different concentrations of methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside for the elution of GGT from Con A-Sepharose column, the enzyme from brain regions could be separated into five fractions, two of which contained about 75% of the total GGT activity without regional differences in elution profiles. Almost complete GGT activity in kidney tissue extracts was eluted in a single peak whereas the enzyme from pancreas exhibited two peaks.",
