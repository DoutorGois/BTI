     "AB": "The effects of intrahippocampal administration of a neuropeptide (TS-8F toxin) isolated from Tityus serrulatus scorpion venom have been determined on behavior, limbic seizures, and neuronal degeneration in rats. Behavioral observation showed orofacial automatism, wet dog shakes, and myoclonus. Concomitantly, the electroencephalographic record showed high-frequency and high-voltage spikes that evolved to seizure activity in the hippocampus and cortex. Seven days after TS-8F toxin microinjection, neuronal damage was observed in CA1 and CA2 pyramidal cells and in granular cells of the dentate gyrus. The results suggest that TS-8F toxin may be responsible, at least in part, by the epileptic effects observed with the crude venom. Thus, this toxin may be a useful tool in the study of some neurobiological process.",
