     "AB": "The effect of chronic ethanol administration, 5 g/kg per day for 2 or 4 weeks, on the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA was investigated in rats. An increase in GABA was found in the striatum, hippocampus, and substantia nigra, 8 or 12 h after the last ingestion of ethanol, this being masked by injection of barbiturate. In addition an increase of glutamate has been found in the examined brain areas. This is consistent with the known effect of ethanol on brain Dopa metabolism and release. Finally, the relevance of the results for the pathogenesis of withdrawal seizures and delirious states is discussed.",
