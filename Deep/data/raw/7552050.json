     "AB": "We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate possible molecular mechanisms by which electroconvulsive therapy, a commonly used treatment for depression, may exert its adverse effects such as amnesia. We assessed the effects of repeated electroconvulsive shocks (ECS) alone and in combination with low-level radiograph irradiation on DNA single-strand breaks in cells in the rat brain, using a sensitive alkaline microgel electrophoresis assay method. Our results show that ECS, when administered alone, had no significant effects on DNA single-strand breaks in cells in either the hippocampus or the rest of the brain. However, repeated ECS when combined with a low-level radiograph irradiation produced a small but significant increase in DNA single-strand breaks in rat brain cells.",
