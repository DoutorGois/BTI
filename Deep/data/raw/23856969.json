     "AB": "Stress occurs in everyday life and persistence of it causes memory loss. Bioflavonoids like quercetin are reported to have poor bioavailability and limited therapeutic potential against stress induced neurological disorders. Therefore, the present study is an attempt to elucidate the therapeutic potency of combination of quercetin with piperine; a bioavailability enhancer against chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced behavioral and biochemical alterations. Laca mice were subjected to a series of stressful events for a period of 28 days. Quercetin (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg, p.o.), piperine (20 mg/kg, p.o.) and their combinations were administered daily 30 min before CUS procedure. Piracetam (100 mg/kg, i.p.) served as a standard control. CUS caused impaired spatial navigation in Morris water maze test and poor retention in elevated plus maze task. Further, there was significant increase in brain oxidative stress markers and neuro-inflammation (TNF-alpha). This was coupled with marked rise in acetylcholinesterase and serum corticosterone levels. Co-administration of piperine with quercetin significantly elevated their potential to restore these behavioral, biochemical and molecular changes associated with mouse model of CUS. These results suggest that piperine enhances the neuroprotective effects of quercetin against CUS-induced oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation and memory deficits.",
