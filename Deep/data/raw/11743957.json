     "AB": "Clinical experience suggests that both hypothyroidism and stress interfere with mental concentration and memory. This electrophysiological study examined the effect of hypothyroidism and stress, separately or combined, on long-term potentiation (LTP), a widely accepted cellular model for learning and memory. Measurements of early LTP (E-LTP) were carried out in the hippocampus of urethane-anesthetized adult Wistar rats. Hypothyroidism was achieved by thyroidectomy, and the 'intruder' stress was used as a model of chronic psychosocial stress. Stimulating electrodes were placed in the left CA3 region and right angular bundle and a recording electrode was placed in the right CA1 or the dentate gyrus (DG). The results showed that in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, hypothyroid or stress partially blocked E-LTP. However, when hypothyroidism and stress were combined, they eliminated E-LTP. In contrast, no significant change in E-LTP was seen in the DG of the three groups of rats. These results suggest that impaired memory because of hypothyroidism or stress may be related to impairment of the E-LTP in the Schaffer collateral synapses but not of that of the perforant path synapses.",
