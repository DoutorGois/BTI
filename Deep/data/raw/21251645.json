     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists are widely used as pharmacological models of schizophrenia. Their neurobiological actions are still poorly understood, although the prefrontal cortex (PFC) appears as a key target area. METHODS: We examined the effect of phencyclidine (PCP) on neuronal activity of the mediodorsal (MD) and centromedial (CM) thalamic nuclei, reciprocally connected with the PFC, using extracellular recordings (n = 50 neurons from 35 Wistar rats) and c-fos expression. RESULTS: Phencyclidine (.25 mg/kg intravenous [IV]) markedly disorganized the activity of MD/CM neurons, increasing (424%) and decreasing (41%) the activity of 57% and 20% of the recorded neurons, respectively (23% remained unaffected). Phencyclidine reduced delta oscillations (.15-4 Hz) as assessed by recording local field potentials. The subsequent clozapine administration (1 mg/kg IV) reversed PCP effects on neuronal discharge and delta oscillations. Double in situ hybridization experiments revealed that PCP (10 mg/kg intraperitoneal [IP]) markedly increased c-fos expression in glutamatergic neurons of several cortical areas (prefrontal, somatosensory, retrosplenial, entorhinal) and in thalamic nuclei, including MD/CM. Phencyclidine also increased c-fos expression in the amygdala; yet, it had a small effect in the hippocampus. Phencyclidine did not increase c-fos expression in gamma-aminobutyric acidergic cells except in hippocampus, amygdala, somatosensory, and retrosplenial cortices. Clozapine (5 mg/kg IP) had no effect by itself but significantly prevented PCP-induced c-fos expression. CONCLUSIONS: Phencyclidine likely exerts its psychotomimetic action by increasing excitatory neurotransmission in thalamo-cortico-thalamic networks involving, among others, PFC, retrosplenial, and somatosensory cortices. The antipsychotic action of clozapine includes, among other actions, an attenuation of the neuronal hyperactivity in thalamocortical networks.",
