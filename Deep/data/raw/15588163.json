     "AB": "Melatonin has recently been suggested as an antioxidant that may protect neurons from oxidative stress. Acute ethanol administration produces both lipid peroxidation as an indicator of oxidative stress in the brain and impairs water-maze performance in spatial learning and memory tasks. The present study investigated the effect of melatonin against ethanol-induced oxidative stress and spatial memory impairment. The Morris water maze was used to evaluate the cognitive functions of rats. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), which are the indicators of lipid peroxidation, and the activities of antioxidative enzymes (glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) were measured in the rat hippocampus and prefrontal cortex which form interconnected neural circuits for spatial memory. Acute administration of ethanol significantly increased TBARS levels in the hippocampus. Combined melatonin-ethanol treatment caused a significant increase in glutathione peroxidase activities and a significant decrease of TBARS in the rat hippocampus. In the prefrontal cortex, there was only a significant decrease of TBARS levels in the combined melatonin-ethanol receiving group as compared to the ethanol-treated group. Melatonin did not affect the impairment of spatial memory due to acute ethanol exposure, but melatonin alone had a positive effect on water maze performances. Our study demonstrated that melatonin decreased ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation and increased glutathione peroxidase activity in the rat hippocampus.",
