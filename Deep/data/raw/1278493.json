     "AB": "In cats, the effect of low-frequency electric stimulation of the caudate nucleus on electric activity of neo- and archipaleocortex and on wakefulness-sleep cycle, was studied. The data obtained suggest: 1) at threshold and suprathreshold single electric shocks applied to the caudate nucleus they evoked potential occurs more readily in the sensorimotor area of the neocortex than in the dorsal hippocampus. At 2-6/sec stimulation the evoked potentials in the hippocampus are facilitated and become very stable, whereas in the sensorimotor cortex the most obvious responses occur at the 6-8/sec frequency. However, the evoked potentials are variable in the sensorimotor cortex, and at prolonged 8-12/sec stimulation spindle activity soon develops; 2) behavioral correlate of the synchronized activity in the neo- and archipaleocortical structures during low-frequency stimulation of the caudate nucleus, may involve development of drowsiness with the cessation of stimulation, however, both the EEG and behavioral signs of the drowsiness disappear. The onset of drowsiness following withdrawal of the caudate stimulation, is a rare phenomenon only occurring because of an occasional coincidence of the stimulation with the spontaneous onset of natural sleep; 3) low-frequency caudate stimulation entailing the ECoG synchronization does not cause the transition of paradoxical phase into the slow-wave phase of sleep, and as soon as the stimulation ceases its normal structure recovers. However, if the stimulation of the caudate nucleus is repeated several times in one paradoxical phase, this would shorten the subsequent slow-wave phase and accelerate the onset of the next paradoxical phase; 4) prolonged low-frequency stimulation of the caudate nucleus causing the ECoG synchronization results in a considerable change of wakefulness-sleep cycle in the post-stimulation period: a decrease in the total time of slow-wave sleep due to shortening of its different phases, and an increase in the total amount of paradoxical sleep because of the onset of its phases is rendered more frequent. This effect is more obvious in the first half of the 8-hr cycle.",
