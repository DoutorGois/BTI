     "AB": "Rats were either undernourished or fed normally during the suckling period, then at 1 and 5 months of age littermates were housed in enriched or impoverished environments for 30 days. The undernutrition caused lasting reductions in the weight and size of the cerebrum and in parameters of the hippocampus, but significant deficits were not observed in the thickness and area of the occipital cortex. Differential housing differed from early undernutrition in that its largest effects were on cortical parameters, but the effects of the two conditions did partly overlap. This meant that some nutritionally induced deficits could be modified later by manipulating environmental complexity. The cerebral response of the previously undernourished rats to differential environments was not distinguishable from that of well-fed controls on the basis of the gross anatomical changes that were measured. Furthermore, no significant differences were found between the environmental effects in young and mature rats, although the latter's response tended to be somewhat less for most parameters.",
