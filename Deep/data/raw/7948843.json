     "AB": "MUSCARINIC, NMDA and metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists were tested for anticonvulsant effects in a continuous hippocampal stimulation model in rats in order to identify the receptors involved in the initiation of electrically induced status epilepticus (SE). Whereas the muscarinic receptor antagonists scopolamine and atropine and the metabotropic receptor antagonist L(+)-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (AP3) did not affect SE initiation, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801) (1 mg kg-1 i.p.) and the non-NMDA ionotropic receptor antagonist 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo(F)-quinoxaline (NBQX) (two doses of 50 micrograms i.c.v.) prevented the induction of SE. It has been shown in a previous study that non-NMDA ionotropic receptors are involved in SE maintenance and it is now suggested that activation of NMDA receptors may principally initiate electrically induced SE, although non-NMDA ionotropic receptors may also be involved.",
