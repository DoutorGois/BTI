     "AB": "Effect of low level in utero exposure to deltamethrin (DT) (1mg /kg wt.) during gestation day 14-20 was studied on selected neurobehavioral, neurochemical, immunohistochemical parameters in rats at 6 and 12 weeks postnatal period. The significant increase in acetylcholinesterase activity and decrease in (3)H-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding in the hippocampal region of DT exposed animals, suggesting impairment in cholinergic (muscarinic) receptors. A significant decrease in the learning and memory performances was also observed both at 6 and 12 weeks, which is directly correlated with decrease in muscarinic receptor binding. Immunohistochemistry and image analysis of growth associated protein-43, a neuron specific protein present in axonal growth cone and a marker for neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis, exhibit aberrant increase in its expression in the hippocampus in DT exposed rats at both time periods. The data suggests that low level exposure to DT in utero during brain growth spurt period adversely affects the developing brain and the changes persist even up to 12 weeks postnatal period in rats. Although there is no significant recovery at 12 weeks assessment but still significant impairment persist on biochemical and behavioural parameters.",
