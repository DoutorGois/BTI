     "AB": "Depression induces anorexia, leading to suppressed feeding behaviors and energy intake. Previously, we revealed that chronic social defeat induced a mild suppression of feeding in rats with elevated levels of hypothalamic malonyl-CoA which regulates feeding. Therefore, we attempted to elucidate the effects of chronic mild food restriction on behavior and on hypothalamic malonyl-CoA. The chronic mild food restricted rats were fed a restricted diet approximately 80% to 90% amount of diet compared to the control for 5 weeks. Ratios of restriction were adjusted with feed consumption in the chronic social defeat stressed rats. Chronic mild food restricted rats exhibited a suppression of body weight gain similar to that of the chronic social defeat stressed rats. Also these rats showed increased time spent in the center area of an open field (OF), prolonged immobility time in forced swim, increased phosphorylation of hypothalamic adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase and a decreased concentration of hypothalamic malonyl-CoA. Weight of the adrenal glands, locomotion in an OF, mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II in the hippocampus were not affected by chronic mild food restriction. Our findings suggest that chronic mild food restriction activates AMPK following a decreased hypothalamic malonyl-CoA.",
