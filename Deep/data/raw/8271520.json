     "AB": "We measured changes in [Ca2+]i and [Na+]i in the dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje cells and hippocampal pyramidal cells using high speed imaging of the fluorescence changes of intracellularly injected fura-2 and SBFI. These transients were detected in synchrony with intracellular recordings of membrane potential. In this way rapid calcium or sodium transients could be associated with specific electrical events. Using this technique we could determine the spatial distribution and source of transients evoked either intrasomatically or synaptically and could relate them to electrically recorded sodium and calcium spikes.",
