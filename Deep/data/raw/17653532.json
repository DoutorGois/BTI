OBJECTIVES: This study determined whether [(11)C]mirtazapine is an appropriate molecular tool for use with PET to estimate the magnitude of neuroreceptor occupancy produced by daily intake of mirtazapine. METHODS: This study used a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, within-subject design. Eighteen healthy volunteers were PET-scanned twice with [(11)C]mirtazapine; once under baseline condition and again after receiving either placebo or mirtazapine (7.5 or 15 mg) for 5 days. We determined kinetic parameters of [(11)C]mirtazapine in brain regions by the simplified reference region method and used binding potential values to calculate receptor occupancy produced by mirtazapine. RESULTS: Serum concentrations of mirtazapine ranged from 33 to 56 nmol/l after five daily doses of 7.5 mg mirtazapine and were between 41 and 74 nmol/l after 15 mg mirtazapine. Placebo treatment failed to alter the binding potential of [(11)C]mirtazapine from baseline values, whereas daily intake of mirtazapine markedly decreased the binding potential in cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. Receptor occupancy ranged from 74 to 96% in high-binding regions of the brain after five daily doses of 7.5 mg or 15 mg mirtazapine, whereas 17-48% occupancy occurred in low-binding regions. CONCLUSIONS: [(11)C]Mirtazapine together with PET can determine the degree of receptor occupancy produced by daily doses of mirtazapine in regions of the living human brain.",
