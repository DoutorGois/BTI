     "AB": "Normal prion protein (PrP(C)) is a copper binding protein and may play a role in cellular resistance to oxidative stress. Recently, copper-bound recombinant PrP(C) has been shown to exhibit superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity. However, as PrP(C) affinity for copper is low in comparison to other cupro-proteins, the question remains as to whether PrP(C) could contribute SOD activity in vivo. To unravel this enigma, we compared the SOD activity in lysates extracted from different regions of the brain from wild-type mice before and after the depletion of PrP(C). We found that removal of PrP(C) from the brain lysates reduced the levels of total SOD activity. The level of contribution to the total SOD activity was correlated to the level of PrP expressed and to the predominant form of PrP present in the specific brain region. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that PrP(C) differentially contributes to the total SOD activity in vivo.",
