     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Nogo-A is a member of the reticulon family of membrane-associated proteins and plays an important role in axonal remodeling. The present study aimed to investigate alterations in Nogo-A expression following traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced inflammation and neuronal damage. METHODS: A weight-drop device was used to deliver a standard traumatic impact to rats. Western blot, RT-PCR and ELISA were used to analyze the expression of Nogo-A and IL-1beta. Nogo-A antisense, and an irrelevant control oligonucleotide was intracerebroventricularly infused. We also performed H & E staining and luxol fast blue staining to evaluate the neuronal damage and demyelination resulting from TBI and various treatments. RESULTS: Based on RT-PCR and western blot analyses, the expression of Nogo-A was found to be significantly upregulated in the hippocampus beginning eight hours after TBI. In addition, TBI caused an apparent elevation in IL-1beta levels and severe neuronal damage and demyelination in the tested animals. All of the TBI-associated molecular and cellular consequences could be effectively reversed by treating the animals with the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. More importantly, the TBI-associated stimulation in the levels of both Nogo-A and IL-1beta could be effectively inhibited by a specific Nogo-A antisense oligonucleotide. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the suppression of Nogo-A expression appears to be an early response conferred by indomethacin, which then leads to decreases in the levels of IL-1beta and TBI-induced neuron damage.",
