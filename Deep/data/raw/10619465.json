     "AB": "Magnetic resonance imaging and in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of lamotrigine and MK-801 on rat brain lesions induced by 3-nitropropionic acid. Systemic administration of 3-nitropropionic acid (15 mg/kg per day) to two-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10 for each group) for five consecutive days induced selective striatal and hippocampal lesions and specific behavioral change. Pretreatment with lamotrigine (10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg per day) or MK-801 (2 mg/kg per day) attenuated the lesions and behavioral change. There were no significant differences in T2 values of the striatum and hippocampus among rats pretreated with MK-801, lamotrigine (20 mg/kg) and sham controls. Significant elevations of succinate/creatine and lactate/creatine ratios and decreases of N-acetylaspartate/creatine and choline/creatine ratios were observed after 3-nitropropionic acid injections (P < 0.001). The changes were nearly prevented after pretreatment with lamotrigine (20 mg/kg). However, the N-acetylaspartate/creatine in rats pretreated with lamotrigine (10 mg/kg) (P < 0.01) and MK-801 (P < 0.05) still showed significant reduction as compared with sham controls. Thus we conclude that both lamotrigine and MK-801 are effective in attenuation of brain lesions induced by 3-nitropropionic acid. A higher dose of lamotrigine provides a better neuroprotective effect than MK-801. With a better therapeutic effect and fewer side effects, lamotrigine is more promising for potential clinical application.",
