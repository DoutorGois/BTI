     "AB": "Morphofunctional studies of animals with associated electrolytic orbitofrontal and hippocampal brainstem lesions as compared to variants of isolated brainstem coagulation showed participation and specific role of orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus in adaptive-compensatory brain reactions of rats with brainstem lesions. Associated brainstem-orbitofrontal damages result in aggravation of the animals' condition and highly probable lethality within the first two weeks after surgery due to blood circulation dysregulation of hemorrhagic type and probably due to secondary hypothalamus dysfunction. Associated brainstem-hippocampal coagulation intensifies primarily brainstem neurologic symptoms and prolongs time of their reverse development, i.e. supports the brainstem centre of stable pathological activity.",
