     "AB": "The metabolic enzyme CYP1B1 is a recently cloned member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, expressed widely throughout primate tissue, including the CNS. Although CYP1B1 protein is known to metabolize estradiol to catecholestrogens in the uterus, its localization and function in brain have not yet been described. To better understand CYP1B1 distribution, we have combined in situ hybridization (ISH) for its mRNA with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the CYP1B1 protein in selected brain regions of male and female adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Blocks of formalin-fixed tissue obtained from the frontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and amygdala were processed and embedded in paraffin. They were then sectioned and stained as described for human tissue [Muskhelishvili, L., Thompson, P.A., Kusewitt, D.F., Wang, C., Kadlubar, F.F., 2001. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis of cytochrome P450 1B1 expression in human normal tissues. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 49, 229-236]. Results indicated widespread distribution of CYP1B1 mRNA in both male and female monkey frontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and amygdala. In contrast, although CYP1B1 protein was co-localized with its mRNA in the female brains, it was primarily restricted to hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the male brains. These results suggest that CYP1B1 may subserve widespread metabolic functions in the female primate brain but have more restricted actions within the hippocampal pyramidal neurons of the male.",
