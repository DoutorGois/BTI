     "AB": "It is undisputed that terpene lactones and flavonoid glycosides of Ginkgo biloba are responsible for most of the extracts (e.g., EGb 761(R)) pharmacological actions. This investigation focused on the pharmacokinetic and the ability of the flavonoid constituents to cross the blood-brain barrier in rats, after single (600 mg/kg) or repeated (8 days, 100, or 600 mg/kg) oral administration of EGb 761(R), and their distribution in different areas of the brain. For this purpose, we developed an HPLC-fluorescence method for the determination of the Ginkgo flavonoid metabolites (quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin derivatives) in the brain and plasma. A single dose of 600 mg/kg EGb 761(R) resulted in maximum plasma concentrations of 176, 341, and 183 ng/mL for quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin/tamarixetin, respectively and in maximum brain concentrations of 291 ng/g protein for kaempferol and 161 ng/g protein for isorhamnetin/tamarixetin. In comparison, the repeated administration of the same dose for 8 days led to an approximate 4.5-fold increase in the plasma concentration for quercetin, 11.5-fold increase for kaempferol, and 10-fold increase for isorhamnetin/tamarixetin. In the brain, an approximate 2-fold increase was observed for kaempferol and isorhamnetin/tamarixetin. About 90% of the determined flavonoids were distributed in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, striatum, and cerebellum, which together represent only 38% of the whole brain.",
