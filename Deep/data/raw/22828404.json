     "AB": "We hypothesize that the beneficial effects of estradiol on cognitive performance may be mediated through GPR30, a putative membrane target of estrogens. Recently we showed that administration of a selective GPR30 agonist (G-1) to ovariectomized rats enhanced acquisition of a delayed matching-to-position (DMP) T-maze task and increased potassium-stimulated acetylcholine release in the hippocampus, similar to estradiol (E2) (Hammond et al., 2009). The present study tested whether treating with a selective GPR30 antagonist (G-15) would impair spatial learning in gonadally intact rats and in ovariectomized (OVX) rats treated with E2. As predicted, G-15 dose-dependently impaired DMP acquisition both in gonadally intact rats and in OVX rats treated with E2. G-15 specifically reduced the rate of acquisition, and this effect was associated with an increased predisposition to adopt a persistent turn. In contrast, G-15 alone at the highest dose had no significant effect on DMP acquisition in OVX controls. The effects were task dependent, as similar effects of G-15 were not observed in gonadally intact rats tested on an operant discrimination/reversal learning task motivated by the same food reward. This suggests that the effects on DMP acquisition were not due to effects on motivation for food. Effects of G-15 on DMP acquisition were similar to previously published work showing significant impairment produced by selective cholinergic denervation of the hippocampus. These data suggest that GPR30 can play an important role in mediating the effects of estradiol on spatial learning, possibly by mediating estradiol effects on basal forebrain cholinergic function.",
