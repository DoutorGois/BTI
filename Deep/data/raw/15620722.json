     "AB": "The abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau protein is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies; as yet the exact role of various tau kinases in this pathology is not fully understood. Here, we show that injection of isoproterenol, an activator of cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA), into rat hippocampus bilaterally results in the activation of PKA, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and cyclin-dependent kinase-5, inhibition of protein phosphatase-2A, hyperphosphorylation of tau at several Alzheimer-like epitopes and a disturbance of spatial memory retention 48 h after the drug injection. These findings suggest the involvement of PKA and PKA-mediated signaling pathway in the Alzheimer-like tau hyperphosphorylation and memory impairment.",
