     "AB": "CART (Cocaine-Amphetamine-Regulated Transcript) has been shown to be regulated by corticosteroids in the hypothalamus, but its regulation by corticosteroids and stress has not been well examined in the hippocampus or the amygdala. Further, CART has been implicated in the transition to puberty. In this study we examine the effects of acute (30 min) stress on CART mRNA in prepubescent and adult rats. In addition, we examined chronic (21 day x 6 h) restraint stress upon the expression of CART mRNA in the hippocampus and the amygdala and the effects of 7 days of adrenalectomy and corticosteroid replacement upon CART expression in these regions of the adult rat brain. We found an up-regulation of CART mRNA in the central amygdala induced by acute but not chronic stress and an up-regulation in the dentate gyrus induced by chronic but not acute stress. Adrenalectomy reduced CART expression in the dentate gyrus but not the amygdala and this effect was blocked by corticosterone but not RU28,362 or aldosterone replacement, suggesting a synergism of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors. Our data establish that CART expression is regulated by stress in a regionally and time specific manner and that CART is regulated by corticosteroid actions in the hippocampus.",
