     "AB": "In this paper, we studied differences in the density of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor GluN2B subunits in the brains of low (LR) and high (HR) anxiety rats subjected to extinction trials and re-learning of a conditioned fear response, modeling a natural course of anxiety disorders. Classifications of animals as LR or HR was determined by fear-induced freezing responses in the contextual fear test. Increased basal concentrations of GluN2B subunits were observed in the amygdala of HR rats as compared to the unconditioned control group by Western blot analysis. Re-exposure of HR animals to the fear-conditioned context resulted in elevated concentrations of GluN2B subunits in the amygdala, hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex compared to LR rats as well as in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex vs. the control group. In addition, it was shown that re-test of a conditioned fear increased the number of cells expressing GluN2B subunits in the basolateral amygdala, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and secondary motor cortex (M2) in the HR group relative to the LR group. Together, these data suggest that animals that are more anxious have altered patterns of GluN2B subunit expression in the frontal cortex and limbic structures, which control emotional behaviour.",
