     "AB": "Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an antagonist of (+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and it blocks the glycine site of the NMDA receptor preferentially (IC50 = 7.9 microM). KYNA is produced endogenously by transamination of its precursor L-kynurenine (L-KYN). We tested the hypothesis that effects of endogenous, de novo produced KYNA, following bath-application of L-KYN to slices, would be different than effects of commercially-synthesized (exogenous) KYNA. The ability to block spontaneous epileptiform activity, induced by lowering extracellular magnesium, was examined in area CA3 of hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. At a concentration of 200 microM L-KYN, which produced 0.89 +/- 0.20 microM KYNA, there were fewer slices with spontaneous epileptiform activity than slices exposed to 2 microM exogenous KYNA. The results indicate a more potent neuromodulatory action of endogenous KYNA than has been previously realized.",
