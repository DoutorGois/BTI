     "AB": "Binding sites for excitatory amino acids have been determined by autoradiographical procedures in the rat hippocampus and striatum during hippocampal kindling. The binding sites measured were the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-sensitive sites for L-[3H]glutamate and [3H]MK-801 sites (transmitter recognition site and ion channel of the NMDA receptor, respectively), [3H]alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) sites (quisqualate receptor), [3H]kainate sites (kainate receptor) and NMDA-insensitive sites for L-[3H]glutamate. In general, little change was apparent in the hippocampus or striatum for any of these binding sites when assessed 48 h after attaining stages 1/2, 3 or 5 of kindling. These results suggest that hippocampal kindling does not bring about a change in the excitatory amino acid receptor binding sites examined, and that the appearance of an NMDA receptor-mediated component to synaptic responses in the hippocampus produced by kindling, cannot be explained on this basis.",
