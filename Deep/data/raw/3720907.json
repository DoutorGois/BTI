     "AB": "The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the neurochemical changes in the levels of gangliosides, total lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, esterified fatty acids and triglyceride of the hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdaloid nucleus, midline nuclei of thalamus, gyrus cinguli and olfactory bulbs following the intramuscular administration of ethinylestradiol (100 mcg) to each female rabbit daily for 30 days. Remarkable increment in the concentration of gangliosides was discernible in hippocampus, amygdaloid nucleus and olfactory bulbs. Interestingly, these levels showed significant decrement in the hypothalamus. The contents of total lipids, triglyceride and esterified fatty acids exhibited significant decrease in the hypothalamus. On the other hand, these levels showed a remarkable increment in olfactory bulbs with a significant elevation in the levels of phospholipids. The concentration of phospholipids was, however, markedly depleted in amygdaloid nucleus. The contents of esterified fatty acids exhibited decrement in hippocampus but the midline nuclei of thalamus showed increment. A significant elevation was also discernible in the levels of triglyceride in gyrus cinguli. The results suggest that the lipid contents are affected differentially in the various parts of the brain.",
