     "AB": "We have recorded the firing activities of hippocampal pyramidal cells throughout the classical conditioning of eyelid responses in alert cats. Pyramidal cells (n = 220) were identified by their antidromic activation from the ipsilateral fornix and according to their spike properties. Upper eyelid movements were recorded with the search coil in a magnetic field technique. Latencies and firing profiles of recorded pyramidal cells following the paired presentation of conditioned (CS) and unconditioned (US) stimuli were similar, regardless of the different sensory modalities used as CS (tones, air puffs), the different conditioning paradigms (trace, delay), or the different latency and topography of the evoked eyelid conditioned responses. However, for the three paradigms used here, evoked neuronal firing to CS presentation increased across conditioning, but remained unchanged for US presentation. Contrarily, pyramidal cell firing was not modified when the same stimuli used here as CS and US were presented unpaired, during pseudoconditioning sessions. Pyramidal cell firing did not seem to encode eyelid position, velocity, or acceleration for either reflex or conditioned eyelid responses. Evoked pyramidal cell responses were always in coincidence with a beta oscillatory activity in hippocampal extracellular field potentials. In this regard, the beta rhythm represents a facilitation, or permissive time window, for timed pyramidal cell firing. It is concluded that pyramidal cells encode CS-US associative strength or CS predictive value.",
