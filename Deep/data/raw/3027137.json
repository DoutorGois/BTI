     "AB": "We report here on the fine structure and synaptic connections of neurons and axon terminals in the rat fascia dentata displaying immunoreactivity to antibodies against cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK). In the fascia dentata and hilar region, CCK-immunoreactivity was confined to nonpyramidal neurons that were similar in appearance to basket cells known to use gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as neurotransmitter. These neurons exhibited dense accumulations of endoplasmic reticulum and infolded nuclei, and established asymmetric and symmetric synaptic contacts with presynaptic terminals. Among those terminals that formed asymmetric synaptic contacts, giant mossy fiber boutons arising from granule cell axons were identified. Cholecystokinin-immunoreactive terminals established symmetric synaptic contacts on the cell bodies and dendrites of granule cells. Similar contacts were formed on nonimmunoreactive hilar neurons. Some of these hilar cells were identified as commissural neurons by retrograde filling with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) following injection of the tracer into the contralateral fascia dentata. Synaptic contacts were rarely observed between immunolabeled pre- and postsynaptic elements. The results are discussed with regard to inhibitory processes in the fascia dentata since other studies have shown that CCK is coexistent with GABA in hippocampal nonpyramidal neurons.",
