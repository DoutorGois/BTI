     "AB": "The present study examined the changes in 26S proteasome activity and the signal molecule mechanism regulating 26S proteasome activity in long term potentiation (LTP) in rat hippocampal slices. The results are as follows: 26S proteasome activity was 190+/-14.3 cpm/(100 microg.2 h) before tetanus, a significant increase in 26S proteasome activity (273+/-18.3 cpm/(100 microg.2 h) was found 10 min after tetanus, when the slope of fEPSP was markedly increased. Interestingly, 26S proteasome activity returned to baseline level (210+/-12.8 cpm/(100 microg.2 h) 60 min after tetanus. Moreover, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor inhibitor AP-5, which blocked LTP, prevented the increase in the 26S proteasome activity. The results suggest that NMDA receptors contribute to the transient increase in 26S proteasome activity during induction of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region.",
