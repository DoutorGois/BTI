     "AB": "Prenatal stress induced neuronal dysfunction is multifactorial, including suppressed neurogenesis in developing brain. Resveratrol is known to exert its neuroprotective potential by enhancing neurogenesis. But the efficacy of resveratrol against prenatal stress was not addressed in detail. Hence in the present study we evaluated the neuroprotective action of resveratrol on prenatal stress-induced impaired neurogenesis. Pregnant rats were subjected to restraint stress during early or late gestational period. Another sets of rats received resveratrol during entire gestational period along with early or late gestational stress. The study parameters included neuronal assay of doublecortin positive neurons (DCX +ve) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) estimations in 40th postnatal day rat brain. Both early and late gestational stress resulted in significant decrease in generation of new born neurons and BDNF expression in hippocampus. The decrease in number of DCX +ve neurons and hippocampal BDNF expression was more profound in the offspring who received late gestational stress compared to early gestational stress. Resveratrol treatment has improved the expression of DCX +ve neurons and BDNF expression. These data suggest the neuroprotective efficacy of resveratrol against prenatal stress induced impaired neurogenesis.",
