     "AB": "Rats with dorsal hippocampal (HIPP) and cortical (CX) lesions and control animals were tested for acquisition of a differential reinforcement of low rate of responding (DRL-20 s) task in a 6-compartment apparatus that permitted running, drinking and other activities. HIPP and CX animals and one group of control rats (NOR) were trained in an 'open' condition which allowed a variety of activities, while another control group (CON) were trained while confined to the food and lever area of the apparatus. In the second stage of the experiment conditions were reversed. DRL performance was significantly better in the 'open' condition for all groups: more pellets were gained with fewer lever presses. Groups HIPP performed worse than groups NOR and CX in both conditions. When NOR and CX rats were confined to the food area they developed a jumping behaviour, (attempts to leave the food area) which increased throughout the testing period, coupled with a progressive deterioration of performance. Rats initially trained in the 'confined' condition did not develop jumping. HIPP animals were significantly more active; they produced more lever presses, entered the different compartments more frequently and showed higher activity in the running wheel. The schedule-induced interim behaviour in the open condition was wheel-running in all groups. In the HIPP group the number of jumps was significantly less than in the NOR and CX groups i.e. they were less affected by confinement. These findings suggest that previous experience in the 'open' condition has a strong anterograde, seemingly irreversible, consequence on subsequent behaviour in the 'confinement' condition for normal and cortical control rats and this anterograde effect is less pronounced in animals with hippocampal damage.",
