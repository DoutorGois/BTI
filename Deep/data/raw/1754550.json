     "AB": "The present study was conducted to determine the effect of thiamin deficiency (TD) on amino acids in brain, liver, and plasma. Twenty-seven 1-wk-old female turkeys were assigned to TD or control groups. Experimental birds were fed a TD diet; control birds received the same diet with thiamin at levels recommended by the National Research Council. Chromatographic analysis at 12 days of age found altered levels of amino acids in selected brain areas and liver of TD birds. Proline was increased in the TD archistriatum and liver. Leucine was elevated in the TD hypothalamus, medulla-pons, midbrain thalamus, and cerebellum. Threonine was lower in the hippocampus, but was increased in the liver of TD birds. Glutamine declined in the TD hippocampus, but glutamate increased in the TD liver only. Urea decreased and valine increased in the TD medulla-pons. Aspartic acid and serine decreased in the TD liver. These results indicate that dietary TD does alter amino acids in these tissues.",
