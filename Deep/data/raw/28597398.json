     "AB": "Conventional protein kinase C (cPKC)gamma participated in cerebral hypoxic preconditioning-induced neuroprotection and affected the neurological outcome of ischemic stroked mice. As an independent predictor of ischemic stroke, the internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAO)-caused brain-regional ischemic injury may worsen the neurological outcome of patients. However, the brain-regional ischemic vulnerability and its underlying mechanism remain unclear. In this study, the bilateral ICAO (BICAO) model was applied in cPKCgamma wild type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice to determine the cPKCgamma impact on brain-regional ischemic vulnerability. The arterial spin labeling (ASL) imaging results showed that 7 days BICAO-induced global ischemia could cause significant blood perfusion loss in prefrontal cortex (69.13%), striatum (61.69%), hypothalamus (67.36%), hippocampus (69.82%) and midbrain (40.53%) of WT mice, along with neurological deficits. Nissl staining and Western blot results indicated that hypothalamus and midbrain had more severe neural cell loss than prefrontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus, which negatively coincided with endogenous cPKCgamma protein levels but not blood perfusion loss and cPKCgamma membrane translocation levels. Furthermore, we found that cPKCgamma KO significantly aggravated the neuron loss in prefrontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus and abolish the regional ischemic vulnerability by using immunofluorescent staining with neuron-specific marker NeuN. Similarly, cPKCgamma KO also significantly increased Caspase-3, -8 and -9 cleavage levels in prefrontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus and midbrain of mice with 24 h BICAO. These results suggested that hypothalamus and midbrain are more vulnerable to ischemia, and endogenous cPKCgamma affects the regional ischemic vulnerability through modulating Caspase-8 and -9 dependent cell apoptosis.",
