     "AB": "The use of nicotine via cigarette smoking forms long-lasting memories that are recalled in response to environmental cues associated with previous nicotine use. However, the changes in brain memory systems that underlie these long-lasting memories are not well understood. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is critical for long-lasting modifications of synapses. Here we show that in vivo nicotine exposure induces the enhancement of NR2B-containing NMDAR-mediated currents in the hippocampus, a brain region associated with the formation of memories. This nicotine effect is maintained during continued nicotine exposure and is accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B. Furthermore, long-term potentiation (LTP), which is considered to be a cellular substrate of learning and memory, induced in nicotine-exposed hippocampi contains a protein synthesis-independent long-lasting component. An NR2B-selective antagonist blocks a long-lasting component of LTP, but not LTP. These results suggest that exposure to nicotine provides conditions that promote the induction of long-lasting modifications of synapses, which may be involved in the formation of memories involving nicotine use.",
