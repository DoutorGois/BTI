     "AB": "Cognitive performance in aging Wistar rats was monitored using the radial arm maze and the latter was correlated with the density of muscarinic receptors in the CNS, using quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. Significant working memory deficits were observed in 12, 17 and 24-month-old rats as compared to 3-month-old animals. In addition, the number of the muscarinic receptors declined significantly with age (from 27 to 42% depending on the brain region sampled) utilising [3H]QNB and [3H]PZ receptor binding assays. The above trend became evident already at the age of 12 months. The present findings support the association of central cholinergic activity with memory processes.",
