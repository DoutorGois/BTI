     "AB": "Synaptosomal protein SNAP-25 is involved in the process of transmitting nerve spikes in the CNS and in the consolidation of memory traces in the hippocampus. Two independent studies have demonstrated associations between SNAP-25 gene polymorphisms and intellectual functions in a group of mentally healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia. The aim of the present work was to perform a comparative study of the association between the MnlI polymorphism of SNAP-25 and cognitive functions (verbal memory, attention/executive functions) in 66 patients with endogenous psychoses, 75 of their mentally healthy relatives, and 136 healthy control subjects. Statistical analysis showed that the effectiveness of performing cognitive tests was significantly affected by group assignment (p = 0.00001) and genotype (p = 0.012). The interaction between genotype and group assignment also had an influence (p = 0.02). In all groups, carriers of the TT genotype had worse measures than carriers of other genotypes. The similar nature of the influences of the MnlI polymorphism on variations in measures in all groups indicates that this gene is related to overall intellect.",
