     "PG": "183-90",
     "AB": "Benzodiazepine receptor binding was examined in rats at 3 stages of amygdaloid kindling (i.e., initial afterdischarge, Stage 3 and Stage 5) immediately or 24 hr after seizure. 3H-diazepam binding site density (Bmax) was significantly increased 24 hr after Stage 3 and Stage 5 kindled seizures in the hippocampus but not in the amygdala. There were no significant differences in the dissociation constants (KD) between kindled and control rats at any time point examined for either brain region. These results demonstrate that changes in benzodiazepine binding are observed with partial kindled seizures (i.e., Stage 3), indicating that generalized seizures are not prerequisite to increased benzodiazepine receptor site density.",
