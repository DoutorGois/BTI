     "AB": "In a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we suggested that in left medial temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE) poor verbal episodic memory performances were sustained by abnormal neocortical and mesiotemporal activations. In the present study, we attempted to examine the evolution of these abnormal neocortical and mesiotemporal activations over 24 h. We thus observed the fMRI brain regions activated during the 24-h-delayed retrieval of a word list in the same sample of healthy control subjects and LTLE patients. In control subjects, a similar left occipitotemporofrontal network was activated during both immediate and 24-h-delayed retrieval conditions. In addition, the 24-h-delayed retrieval also activated a larger parietal region and the right hippocampus. This distributed neocortical and mesiotemporal network was very poorly activated during the 24-h-delayed retrieval in LTLE patients, suggesting the inability to reactivate areas that are keys to retrieving stored information.",
