     "AB": "We have independently in our two laboratories re-examined the report by Stanton and Sejnowski (Nature, 339, 215-218, 1989) that single stimuli to a test pathway in area CA1 of the hippocampal slice, when delivered between short bursts of stimuli to a second, convergent pathway, produce an associative long-term depression (LTD) in the test pathway. While robust associative LTP was observed when stimuli to the two inputs were correlated in time, the anti-correlation procedure failed to induce LTD; rather, a trend towards potentiation was observed. This result was obtained using both submerged and interface chambers, and in two different strains of rat. A transient depression lasting for a few minutes could usually be elicited by strong tetanic stimulation; this depression was not restricted to activated pathways.",
