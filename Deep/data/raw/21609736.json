     "AB": "Previous studies have shown that synthetic tuftsin analogue Selank causes a transcriptomic response in the rat hippocampus and in spleen cells and may participate in the regulation of inflammatory processes in the body. In this work we studied the effect of Selank and two of its fragments on the expression of genes involved in processes of inflammation. We analyzed the expression of 84 genes involved in processes of inflammation (e.g., chemokines, cytokines, and its receptors) in mouse spleen 6 and 24 h after Selank single intraperitoneal injection (100 mug/kg) using real-time PCR method. We found significant changes in the expression of 34 genes involved in inflammation processes. The detailed analysis of quantitative data showed that the Bcl6 gene, which plays a main role in the formation and development of the immune system, exhibited significant changes in its expression levels in response to injection of each of the peptides. Also, we observed expression changes for Bcl6 target and corepressor genes under the influence of Selank and its fragments. Our results showed that Selank and its fragments caused a number of alterations in the expression of genes involved in inflammation. The data obtained confirmed the participation of Selank in the processes of regulation of inflammation in the body. The complex biological effect of Selank may be partially determined by the systematic effect of this peptide on genomic expression.",
