     "AB": "Temporal lobe epilepsy in children has been less well studied compared to that seen in adults. Whereas hippocampal sclerosis is the most common etiology for the adult temporal lobe epilepsy syndromes, tumors and malformations of cortical development are more commonly seen in children. Differences in seizure semiology are also apparent. Temporal lobe epilepsy in very young infants may exhibit prominent motor manifestations reminiscent of extra-temporal seizures. These motor manifestations however decrease with increasing age and are less abundant in adults. Automatisms, which are commonly seen in temporal lobe epilepsy in all age groups, are simple at a younger age and become increasingly more complex and discrete with age. Several case studies, illustrated on the video are included in this review. They highlight the differences in temporal lobe seizure semiology between children and adults.
