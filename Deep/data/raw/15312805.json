     "AB": "The present study evaluated the potential effect of geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), which is known as an antiulcer agent, against the delayed neuronal death (DND) of hippocampal neurons an otherwise lethal ischemic insult. Pretreatment with single oral GGA (800 mg/kg, 2 days before ischemia) significantly attenuated DND in gerbil hippocampus. These effects of GGA were prevented by the coinjection of MK801, a noncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist, which indicates that the protection was indeed glutamate receptor activation mediated.",
