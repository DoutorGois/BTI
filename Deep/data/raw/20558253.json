     "AB": "Aversive olfactory learning was established in young rats after odor exposure paired with foot shock through a classical conditioning paradigm. Using behavioral pharmacology and Western blotting, we previously reported that plasticity in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) underlies aversive olfactory learning. Since long-term potentiation (LTP) observed in the hippocampus is believed to be a cellular substrate for aspects of memory, we attempted to induce LTP in the MOB. Using brain slices containing the MOB, we found that five tetani of the lateral olfactory tract evoked LTP that was blocked by the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist AP5. Although three tetani induced no significant changes in control slices, with noradrenaline (NA) application they produced clear LTP (NA-mediated LTP), which was not dependent on NMDA receptors. NA's facilitating effect on LTP induction was blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist timolol but not by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine, and was mimicked by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol. The l-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine completely blocked LTP as well as NA-mediated LTP. In addition, we found that aversive olfactory learning was impaired by beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, timolol but not by alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine, and only odor training established olfactory learning by isoproterenol infusion. Moreover, we found that nifedipine but not AP5 prevented olfactory learning formation. These common properties provided evidence for neural correlates between NA-mediated LTP aversive olfactory learning in young rats.",
