     "AB": "The expression of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (InsP3R1) in the mouse central nervous system (CNS) was studied by in situ hybridization. The receptor mRNAs were widely localized throughout the CNS, predominantly in the olfactory tubercle, cerebral cortex, CA1 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, caudate putamen, and cerebellar Purkinje cells, where phosphoinositide turnover is known to be stimulated by various neurotransmitter receptors. In the most abundantly expressing Purkinje cells, InsP3R1 mRNA appeared to be translocated to the distal dendrites, since a strong hybridization density was observed in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. InsP3R protein is known to form tetrameric receptor-channel complex. Our preliminary hybridization data using probes for three distinct InsP3R subtypes showed preferential expression of InsP3R1 in many parts of the CNS. The expression of other receptor subtypes (InsP3R2 and InsP3R3) is less efficient, suggesting that a homotetramer formed of InsP3R1 subtype may play a central part in InsP3/Ca2+ signalling in the neuronal function, whereas a homotetramer of other subtypes and a possible heterotetramer among subtypes may be involved in differential InsP3/Ca2+ signalling. The chromosomal localization of the gene coding for InsP3R1 was confirmed on chromosome 6 but was found to be genetically independent of the Lurcher (Lc) mutation.",
