     "AB": "We have investigated the role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) in the induction of homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD) and depotentiation (DP) in the dentate gyrus of the adult rat. Perfusion of the mGluR agonist (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD) for a prolonged period (20 min) induced long-term depression (LTD) of field excitatory postsynaptic field potentials (epsps) from the baseline level and also depotentiation (DP) from the long-term potentiated level. Both the ACPD-and the low frequency stimulation (LFS)-induced LTD and DP were inhibited in the presence of the mGluR antagonist (+)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), demonstrating the necessity for the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in the induction of LTD/DP. The LFS and ACPD-induced LTD were independent of the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, as they were not blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phophonopentanoate (AP5).",
