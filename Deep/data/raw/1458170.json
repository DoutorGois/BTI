     "AB": "A study was made of the influence of adapromine on bioelectrical activity of the brain, sensorimotor cortex, dorsal hippocamp and lateral hypothalamus in freely moving wakeful rats. Adapromine was established to evoke a decrease of the amplitude of the dominant peak and dominant theta-activity in power spectra of the EEG in the cortex and hippocamp, with an increase of rapid wave activity in the beta 2 range in the right cortex and hippocamp. These changes attained maximum after 1 to 1.5 hour and lasted up to 4-5 hours after adapromine administration. These changes can be viewed as activation of the cortex and hippocamp, which may attest to the presence of antidepressive and psychostimulant effects in the action spectrum of adapromine. The specific influence of adapromine on catecholaminergic processes of the brain may lie at the basis of the above effects.",
