     "AB": "Visualizing brain anatomy in vivo could provide insight into normal and pathophysiology. Here it is demonstrated that neuroarchitecture can be detected in the rodent brain using MRI after systemic MnCl2. Administration of MnCl2 leads to rapid T1 enhancement in the choroid plexus and circumventricular organs, which spreads to the CSF space in ventricles and periventricular tissue. After 1 day, there was MRI enhancement throughout the brain with high intensity in the pituitary, olfactory bulb, cortex, basal forebrain, hippocampus, basal ganglia, hypothalamus, amygdala, and cerebellum. Contrast obtained enabled visualization of specific features of neuroarchitecture. The arrowhead structure of the dentate gyrus as well as the CA1-CA3 region of the hippocampus and layers in cortex, cerebellum, as well as the olfactory bulb could be readily observed. Preliminary assignments of olfactory bulb layers, cortical layers in frontal and somatosensory cortex, and cerebellum were made. Systemic MnCl2 leads to MRI visualization of neuroarchitecture nondestructively.",
