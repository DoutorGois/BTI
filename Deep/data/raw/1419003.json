     "AB": "The mechanisms responsible for long-lasting, activity-dependent decreases in synaptic efficacy are not well understood. We have examined the initial steps required for the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in CA1 pyramidal cells by repetitive low frequency (1 Hz) synaptic stimulation. This form of LTD was synapse specific, was saturable, and required activation of post-synaptic NMDA receptors. Loading CA1 cells with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA prevented LTD, whereas lowering extracellular Ca2+ resulted in the induction of LTD by stimulation that previously elicited long-term potentiation. Following LTD, synaptic strength could be increased to its original maximal level, indicating that LTD is reversible and not due to deterioration of individual synapses. Induction of homosynaptic LTD therefore requires an NMDA receptor-dependent change in postsynaptic Ca2+ which may be distinct from that required for long-term potentiation.",
