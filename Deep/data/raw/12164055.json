     "AB": "Immunohistochemical study of the cholinergic innervation of the parvalbumin- and calbindin-containing cells in the hippocampus was conducted on 30 rat brains of various postnatal ages: P0, P4, P7, P14, P21, P30, P60 and P180. Sections with double immunostaining for vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT; the marker of cholinergic cells, fibres and terminals) and parvalbumin (PV) or calbindin (CB) were analysed using confocal laser-scanning microscope. Obtained data demonstrate that the pattern of cholinergic innervation of calbindin- and parvalbumin-immunoreactive hippocampal neurones shows some differences. During development as well as in the adult species cholinergic terminals preferentially innervate CB-containing neurones, while cholinergic terminals on PV-containing cells were observed rarely. Cholinergic endings on the CB-ir neurones are localised both on their somata and dendrites, whereas on PV-ir cells they form synaptic contact predominantly with processes. In spite of the unquestionable cholinergic influence particularly on CB-ir cells, the number of cholinergic endings suggests that this input seems not to be crucial for the activity of the studied cell populations.",
