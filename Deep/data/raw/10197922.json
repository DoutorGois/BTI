     "AB": "The role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the acquisition of learning and memory using fear conditioning as a behavioral model was examined. The mGluR antagonist (R, S)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG) was infused into the hippocampus 30 min before fear conditioning, and freezing was measured during both acquisition and retention tests. The results show that pretraining antagonism of MCPG-sensitive mGluRs in the hippocampus impaired context-specific memory for an aversive event during testing. The memory for tone-specific fear, however, remained intact despite pretraining infusion of MCPG. Treating rats with MCPG did not affect context- or tone-specific fear during acquisition. Results suggest that mGluR activation may play an important role in hippocampally mediated memory consolidation.",
