     "AB": "Manganese (Mn) is a metal required by biological systems. However, environmental or occupational exposure to high levels of Mn can produce a neurological disorder called manganism, which has similarities to Parkinson's disease. Diethyl-2-phenyl-2-tellurophenyl vinylphosphonate (DPTVP) is an organotellurium compound with a high antioxidant activity, especially in the brain. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of long-term low-dose exposure to Mn in drinking water on behavioral and biochemical parameters in rats and to determine the effectiveness of vinylic telluride in attenuating the effects of Mn. After 4 months of treatment with MnCl(2) (13.7 mg/kg), rats exhibited clear signs of neurobehavioral toxicity, including a decrease in the number of rearings in the open field and altered motor performance in rotarod. The administration of DPTVP (0.150 micromol/kg, ip, 2 weeks) improved the motor performance of Mn-treated rats, indicating that the compound could be reverting Mn neurotoxicity. Ex vivo, we observed that Mn concentrations in the Mn-treated group were highest in the striatum, consistent with a statistically significant decrease in mitochondrial viability and [(3)H]glutamate uptake, and increased lipid peroxidation. Mn levels in the hippocampus and cortex were indistinguishable from controls, and no significant differences were noted in the ex vivo assays in these areas. Treatment with DPTVP fully reversed the biochemical parameters altered by Mn. Furthermore, DPTVP treatment was also associated with a reduction in striatal Mn levels. Our results demonstrate that DPTVP has neuroprotective activity against Mn-induced neurotoxicity, which may be attributed to its antioxidant activity and/or its effect on striatal Mn transport.",
