     "AB": "The expression of c-Fos is induced by a variety of stimuli and is sometimes used as a marker for increased neuronal activity. In the present study, the effect of treadmill running on c-Fos expression in the hippocampus and the involvement of opioid receptors were investigated via c-Fos immunohistochemistry. It was shown that c-Fos expression in the CA1 region, the CA2 and CA3 regions, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was significantly increased by treadmill running and naloxone, a nonselective opioid receptors antagonist, treatment enhanced treadmill exercise-induced increase of hippocampal c-Fos expression. Base on the present results, it can be suggested that treadmill running increases hippocampal neuronal activity and that endogenous opioids curtail the exercise-induced increase.",
