     "AB": "It has long been known that Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) run in families with substantial heritability. Determining the specific genetic underpinnings of these disorders has been challenging because of the clinical heterogeneity and variable expression across the lifespan. The search for endophenotypic biological variation associated with the AUD and related substance use disorder (SUD) phenotypes is based on the belief that an endophenotype is more proximal to the causative gene. Identification of genes conferring increased susceptibility has important implications for treatment through the potential development of medications that target specific genetic pathways. High risk family designs that contrast offspring with and without a familial/genetic background have provided valuable insights into the psychological characteristics (executive control, affective regulation, decision making and social cognition) that differentiate such individuals. The current chapter will review these with a focus on brain morphology of specific regions, the coordinated activity of neural networks, and developmental trajectories of electrophysiological activity.",
