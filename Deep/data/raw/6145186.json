     "AB": "Tissue homogenates were prepared from brains of four week old Lewis rats. 5HT receptors were prepared from three brain regions and labelled with 3H-5HT and 3H-spiperone. Alpha-receptors were prepared from rat forebrains and labelled with 3H-WB4101 and 3H-clonidine. Incubations were carried out at seven concentrations for each of twelve benzodiazepines. IC50 values were derived from specific binding versus log (drug concentration) plots. The benzodiazepines appeared to have little affinity for 5HT or NA post-synaptic receptors in rat brain.",
