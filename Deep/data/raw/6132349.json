     "AB": "In previous experiments we have studied the development of grafts of embryonic septal tissues implanted alongside the hippocampal formation of neonatal rats. In the present study we examined intracerebral implants of corpus striatum, a brain region that contains acetylcholinesterase-positive cells and does not normally project to the hippocampal formation, in order to evaluate the possibility that neurotransmitter identity may be involved in mechanisms guiding patterns of afferent growth and connectivity. Implant cavities were made in the entorhinal cortices of neonatal rat recipients and 3-6 days later embryonic striatal tissues were grafted to these preformed cavities. Implants were examined with acetylcholinesterase histochemistry one month after implantation. Grafts of embryonic striatal tissues did not survive implantation when the implant was introduced at the same time as the cavity was made. Grafts of corpora striata containing acetylcholinesterase-positive neurons were found in 7 of 11 rats in the delayed implant paradigm and, in all but one of these animals, acetylcholinesterase was present within those terminal laminae in the ipsilateral hippocampus and dentate gyrus that normally receive cholinergic input from the septal area. These findings suggest that cues underlying the development of specific connections between native (and implanted) septal efferents and hippocampal target neurons may be recognized by ingrowing acetylcholinesterase-reactive fibers from striatal implants.",
