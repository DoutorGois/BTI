     "AB": "Resection of a left temporal neocortical tumor, preserving the amygdala and hippocampus, permanently abolished ictal illusions in a 20-year-old man, suggesting that neocortical epileptic discharge is essential in the production of the experiential phenomena of seizures. In light of other works demonstrating amygdala and hippocampal participation, we propose that ictal experiential phenomena represent simultaneous epileptic discharge of the temporal neocortex and the limbic system.",
