     "AB": "Brains were obtained at autopsy from 24 patients with Down's syndrome, ranging in age from 13 to 71 years. Neurofibrillary tangle containing neurones of the hippocampus were stained using a Palmgren silver method and immunocytochemically (PAP) using antisera to paired helical filament protein, human tau protein and ubiquitin, as primary antibody. Counts of cells stained by each method were compared. In patients under 50 years of age, in whom only a limited number of tangle bearing cells were present, the number of profiles visualized with silver, anti-paired helical filament and anti-tau methods were similar. However, in patients over 50 years of age (and in certain of those under 50), in whom numerous tangles were present, the number of cell profiles visualized with silver and anti-paired helical filament methods were still similar though anti-tau detected fewer positive cells. This was because of the increased presence, in such patients, of extracellular tangles which had \"lost\" anti-tau immunoreactivity. Such data suggest that although tau protein forms a major antigenic determinant of neurofibrillary tangles in Down's syndrome (as it does in Alzheimer's disease) this protein may only decorate the basic paired helical filament protein skeleton, and is removed by macrophagic activity upon neuronal death. In all patients, anti-ubiquitin revealed fewer tangles than any other method. It is possible that ubiquitin may be present only transiently, within tangles perhaps following initial formation and lasting only as long as the normal protein degradation processes remain viable within the diseased neurone.",
