     "AB": "Inositol monophosphatase (EC 3.1.3.25) is a key enzyme in the phosphoinositide cell-signalling system. Its role is to provide inositol required for the resynthesis of phosphatidylinositol and polyphosphoinositides. It is the probable pharmacological target for lithium action in brain. Using probes derived from the bovine inositol monophosphatase cDNA we have isolated cDNA clones encoding the human and rat brain enzymes. The enzyme is highly conserved in all three species (79% identical). The coding region of the human cDNA was inserted into a bacterial expression vector. The expressed recombinant enzyme was purified and its biochemical properties examined. The human enzyme is very similar to the bovine enzyme.",
