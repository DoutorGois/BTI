     "AB": "1. Ca2+ and cAMP both act as intracellular second messengers of receptor activation. In neuronal tissue, Ca2+ acting via calmodulin can elevate cAMP levels. This regulation by Ca2+ provides a means whereby the elevation of intracellular [Ca2+] might modulate cAMP generation. 2. In the present studies, the impact of the Ca2+/calmodulin regulation on receptor-mediated stimulation of activity is compared in striatum and hippocampus--regions of differing sensitivity to Ca2+/camodulin. Ca2+/calmodulin stimulated striatal and hippocampal adenylate cyclase activity by 1.4- and 2.7-fold respectively, while dopamine and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) stimulated the enzyme activity of these respective regions by 1.3- and 2-fold. 3. In the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin, the dopamine dose-response curve in the striatum was shifted upward, without alteration of the slope of the curve or of the maximal stimulation of activity elicited by dopamine. In the hippocampus, the ability of VIP to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity was reduced by the presence of calmodulin. 4. The dose dependence of these actions of calmodulin was examined. In the striatum, the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by 0.1 to 0.3 microM calmodulin obscured dopamine stimulation, while 1 to 10 microM was additive with the dopamine stimulation. In the hippocampus, all concentrations of calmodulin (0.1 to 10 microM) reduced VIP-mediated stimulation of enzyme activity. 5. These data suggest that the ratio of calmodulin-sensitive to calmodulin-insensitive adenylate cyclase activity varies in different rat brain regions and that, in those regions in which this ratio is low (e.g., rat striatum and most peripheral systems), calmodulin- and receptor-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase activity will be additive, while in those systems in which this ratio is high (e.g., most of the central nervous system), calmodulin will reduce receptor-mediated stimulation of enzyme activity.",
