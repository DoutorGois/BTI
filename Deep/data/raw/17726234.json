     "AB": "In the mammalian brain, the hippocampus is involved in memory formation and storage and has an enriched level of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaM kinase II). CaM kinase II has a number of downstream targets and is shown to play a role in memory development, axonal transport, and signaling across the synapse. The shiverer mutant mouse is a knockout lacking myelin basic protein. As a result, the axons of the central nervous system (CNS) of the shiverer have no or very thin myelin sheath, neurons in their CNS have distorted shapes, and synaptic signaling is impaired. shiverer mice develop symptoms similar to those experienced by patients with multiple sclerosis. In this study, proteins from the hippocampus, cerebellum, pons, medulla, and olfactory bulbs of shiverer and wild-type mice were extracted. Western blot analysis was used to compare the expression levels of CaM kinase II in these regions of the two types of mice. Analysis shows that at least two (50 and 58-59 kDa) of the four CaM kinase II isoforms are expressed in the brain, with one isoform (50 kDa) expressed in all regions examined. shiverer brain contains a decreased level of the two isoforms of CaM kinase II, an indication that the cognitive function of these mice might also be impaired.",
