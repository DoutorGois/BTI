     "AB": "Previous work has established that D-amino acids including D-serine (D-Ser) and D-aspartic acid (D-Asp) fulfill specific biological functions in the brain. In this work, the levels and anatomical distribution of d-amino acids in rat brain were determined by using an advantageous liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric analytical method. The study was focused on D-Ser, D-Asp, and D-glutamic acid (D-Glu) because of the significance of L-Asp, L-Glu, and D-Ser in the nervous system. Prenatal, postnatal pups, and 90-day old rats were studied. Results indicated that D-Asp and D-Ser occurred in rat brain at the microg/g tissue level. However, D-Glu was not detected (< 110 ng/g tissue). Throughout the developmental stages d-Asp content in rat brain decreased rapidly from 9.42% of total Asp in 5-day prenatal rats to an undetectable level (< 150 ng/g tissue) in 90-day old rats. In contrast, D-Ser level increased gradually throughout the developmental stages. D-Ser percentage (D-Ser/(D-Ser + L-Ser)) changed from 4.94% in 5-day prenatal rats to 13.7% in 90-day old rats. Regional levels of D-Ser were found to be significantly higher in cortex, striatum, and hippocampus than in thalamus. D-Ser was not detected in cerebellum (< 172ng/g tissue).",
