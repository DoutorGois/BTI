     "AB": "The extracellular levels of aspartate, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and acetylcholine (ACh) were investigated by microdialysis, coupled with HPLC, in the ventral hippocampus of rats during two 30-min exploration periods. Motor activity was monitored. During exploration I, an increase in motor activity associated with a 315% increase in aspartate, 181% in glutamate, and 264% in ACh levels, occurred during the first 10 min. The increase in GABA level reached a maximum of 257% during the second 10 min. The neurotransmitter levels returned to basal values within 40 min. During exploration II, 1 h later, a smaller increase in neurotransmitter levels and motor activity was observed. In both explorations, the increase in neurotransmitter levels was completely abolished by 1 and 3 microM TTX. A statistically significant relationship was found between neurotransmitter extracellular levels and motor activity, for aspartate and glutamate in exploration I, and for ACh in exploration I and II. In conclusion, exploratory activity is associated with or depends on the activation of neuronal systems in the ventral hippocampus releasing aspartate, glutamate, GABA, and ACh. The activation is dampened by habituation.",
