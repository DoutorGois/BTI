     "AB": "The effect of lead exposure in nitric oxide synthase containing neurons (nNOS) within rat cortex and hippocampus was studied. Lead administration (1 g% lead acetate in drinking water) was commenced prior to mating and continued until 30 postnatal (PN) days. Immunohistochemical studies using antibody to nNOS showed, after lead treatment at PN21-PN30, a reduction in neuronal size and optical density (OD) of nNOS+ cells. In both regions, non-pyramidal immunoreactive neurons exhibited smaller soma size and less developed dendrites. A significant difference in cell areas and OD of lead exposed versus control rats and no variation in the number of nNOS+ neurons was seen. Morphological modifications after early lead exposure, induced nNOS reduction in NOS expressing neurons thereby interfering in NO synthesis.",
