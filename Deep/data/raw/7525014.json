     "AB": "The effects of short-term fluoxetine administration on monoamine levels and turnover were assessed in discrete brain nuclei. Adult male rats received fluoxetine HCl (10 mg/kg) or saline injections intraperitoneally for 4 days and monoamine levels determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The major metabolite of 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), was decreased by fluoxetine treatment in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN), the lateral hypothalamic area and the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Fluoxetine treatment significantly increased serotonin (5-HT) levels in the VMN but did not change 5-HT levels in any other area examined. Norepinephrine (NE) levels were higher in fluoxetine-treated rats in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus and parietal motor cortex (MCTX). 5-HT and NE turnover were also determined by the pargyline method. Fluoxetine treatment decreased 5-HT turnover in the VMN and increased 5-HT turnover in the median raphe. NE turnover was decreased in the preoptic area, the MCTX and parietal sensory cortex by fluoxetine administration. These results demonstrate that brain areas with similar 5-HT innervation respond differently to fluoxetine administration and fluoxetine, which selectively alters 5-HT uptake, also affects NE levels and turnover in several brain nuclei.",
