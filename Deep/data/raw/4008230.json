     "AB": "Subcutaneous administration of high doses of glutamate to rats during their first 10 days after birth produced a great reduction of GABA content and GAD activity in the adult mediobasal hypothalamus, both in male and female. In addition GABA content and GAD activity showed a slight significant decrease in female cerebellum and male striatum. Glutamate treatment was also followed by a significant increase in GABA content and GAD activity of male substantia nigra, cerebellum, hippocampus and of female olfactory bulb. No reduction in GABA-T activity was observed in different brain areas studied except in mediobasal hypothalamus. The results support the view that glutamate treatment had a direct toxic effect on GABA-ergic neurons in mediobasal hypothalamus. The changes in GAD activity observed in all areas studied may reflect the neuroendocrine changes determined by nucleus arcuate lesions.",
