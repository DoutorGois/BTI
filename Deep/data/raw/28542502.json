     "AB": "Many mechanisms or pathways are involved in secondary post-traumatic brain injury, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP), axonal degeneration and neuronal cell apoptosis. UCH-L1 is a protein that is expressed in high levels in neurons and may have important roles in the UPP, autophagy and axonal integrity. The current study aims to evaluate the role of UCH-L1 in post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its potential therapeutic effects. A novel protein was constructed that fused the protein transduction domain (PTD) of trans-activating transduction (TAT) protein with UCH-L1 (TAT-UCH-L1) in order to promote neuronal transduction. The TAT-UCH-L1 protein was readily detected in brain by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry after i.p. administration in mice. TBI was induced in mice using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model. TAT-UCH-L1 treatment significantly attenuated K48-linkage polyubiquitin (polyUb)-protein accumulation in hippocampus after CCI compared to vehicle controls, but had no effects on K65-linkage polyUb-protein. TAT-UCH-L1 treatment also attenuated expression of Beclin-1 and LC3BII after CCI. TAT-UCH-L1-treated mice had significantly increased spared tissue volumes and increased survival of CA3 neurons 21 d after CCI compared to control vehicle-treated mice. Axonal injury, detected by APP immunohistochemistry, was reduced in thalamus 24 h and 21 d after CCI in TAT-UCH-L1-treated mice. These results suggest that TAT-UCH-L1 treatment improves function of the UPP and decreases activation of autophagy after CCI. Furthermore, TAT-UCH-L1 treatment also attenuates axonal injury and increases hippocampal neuronal survival after CCI. Taken together these results suggest that UCH-L1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cell death and axonal injury after TBI.",
