     "AB": "The human diagonal band of Broca is connected to other parts of the limbic system, such as the hippocampus, that are involved in the pathology of schizophrenia. This study aimed to characterize the volume and anterior-to-posterior distance of the human diagonal band of Broca (vertical limb) from post-mortem brains obtained from three groups: healthy control subjects (N = 17), patients with schizophrenia (N = 26), and patients with affective disorders (N = 12). There were no significant differences in the volume or anterior-to-posterior distance in the patients with schizophrenia or affective disorders compared with the healthy control subjects. To date, this is the first post-mortem investigation measuring the volume and the anterior-to-posterior distance of the diagonal band of Broca (vertical limb) in patients with schizophrenia or affective disorders compared with healthy control subjects.",
