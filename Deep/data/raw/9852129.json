     "AB": "The Rab3 small G protein subfamily (Rab3) consists of four members, Rab3A, -B, -C, and -D. We have recently isolated and characterized the Rab3 regulators, GDP/GTP exchange protein (GEP) and GTPase activating protein (GAP), both of which are specific for the Rab3 subfamily. Rab3 GEP stimulates the conversion of the GDP-bound inactive form to the GTP-bound active form, whereas Rab3 GAP stimulates the reverse reaction. Of the four members of the Rab3 subfamily, evidence is accumulating that Rab3A is involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, particularly in neurotransmitter release. We first analyzed the subcellular localization of Rab3 GEP and GAP in rat brain. Subcellular fractionation analysis showed that both Rab3 GEP and GAP were enriched in the synaptic soluble fraction. Immunocytochemical analysis in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons showed that both Rab3 GEP and GAP were concentrated at the presynaptic nerve terminals. We then examined whether Rab3 GEP and GAP were involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis by use of human growth hormone (GH) co-expression assay system of cultured PC12 cells. Overexpression of the deletion mutant of Rab3 GEP possessing the catalytic activity reduced the high K+-induced GH release without affecting the basal GH release, whereas that of the deletion mutant lacking the catalytic activity showed no effect on the high K+-induced GH release. In contrast, overexpression of Rab3 GAP or its deletion mutant possessing the catalytic activity did not affect the high K+-induced GH release or the basal GH release. These results indicate that Rab3 GEP and GAP are colocalized with Rab3A at the synaptic release sites and suggest that they regulate the activity of Rab3A and are involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis.",
