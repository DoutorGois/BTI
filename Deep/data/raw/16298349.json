     "AB": "Defects in serotonergic transmission, including serotonin transporter (SERT) function, have been implicated in depression, anxiety disorders and some aspects of schizophrenia. The sex steroid hormone estrogen is known to modulate functional SERT activity, but whether it is up- or down-regulated is unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a low estrogen state in mice on the behavioral effect of drugs acting through the SERT, serotonin uptake kinetics and SERT density in the hippocampus. We compared control mice, ovariectomized (OVX) C57BL/6J mice and aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice that are unable to produce estrogen. Fluoxetine treatment, but not fenfluramine treatment, significantly increased prepulse inhibition (PPI), a measure of sensorimotor gating, in C57BL/6J mice. The effect of fluoxetine was greater in OVX compared to sham-operated mice. In ArKO and J129 wild-type mice, fluoxetine increased PPI to the same extent while fenfluramine increased PPI more in ArKO mice compared to controls. Measurement of the time-course for diffusion and reuptake of exogenous serotonin in the CA3 region of the hippocampus showed that, in OVX mice, the fluoxetine-induced slowing of signal decay after application of serotonin was enhanced when compared to sham-operated controls. Similarly, in ArKO mice, the effect of fluoxetine was enhanced, suggesting that SERT function was greater than in J129 wild-type controls. Measurement of SERT density by [3H]-citalopram autoradiography, revealed an 18% decrease in hippocampus of OVX mice compared to intact controls. SERT density was also significantly reduced in nucleus accumbens (26%) but not in other regions, such as the raphe nuclei. Together, these results suggest that a low estrogen state increases SERT activity in the hippocampus despite an apparent reduction in SERT density. The behavioral consequences of these changes depend on the model of estrogen state used.",
