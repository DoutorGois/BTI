     "AB": "The inhibitory effect of an adenosine analogue, R-N6-phenylisopropyl adenosine (R-PIA), of the cholinergic agonist carbachol, and of morphine on 3H efflux from [3H]choline-labeled field-stimulated rat hippocampal slices was compared with that produced by two inhibitors of N- and L-type Ca2+ channels, omega-conotoxin (CgTx; conotoxin GVIA) and cadmium chloride. 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) caused a dose-dependent increase in evoked transmitter release, with a maximal effect (an almost threefold increase) at 100 microM. 4-AP (100 microM) did not affect the actions of CgTx, cadmium chloride, and R-PIA but almost abolished the effect of carbachol and morphine. The present results indicate that presynaptic muscarinic and opiate receptors reduce acetylcholine release by a mechanism that is somewhat different from that used by adenosine A1 receptors. Furthermore, the results indicate that presynaptic A1 receptors on hippocampal cholinergic neurons do not primarily regulate 4-AP-dependent potassium channels, but that they might act directly on a Ca2+ conductance.",
