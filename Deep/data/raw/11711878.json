     "AB": "The objective of this study was to investigate whether changes in Abeta and ERAB exist in the brain of diabetic mice, and to observe the effects of APP17 peptide. The numbers of neurons stained by APP17 peptide Abeta1-40 Abeta1-42 Abeta1-16 and ERAB antibodies in the brain of diabetic mice was increased compared with normal mice. Staining in APP17 peptide-protected mice was similar to normal mice. We conclude that increased Abeta1-42 and ERAB is an important cause of neuronal degeneration in diabetic encephalopathy. APP17 peptide retards neuronal degeneration by regulating the metabolism of Abeta.",
