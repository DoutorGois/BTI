     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Huanglian Jiedutang (HLJDT) on hippocampal protein expressions in senescence accelerated mouse-prone/8 (SAMP8). METHOD: The 12-month-old senescence accelerated mice (SAM) were divided into three groups: SAM-resistance/1 (SAMR1), SAM-prone/8 (SAMP8) and SAMP8 treated with HLJDT. The effect of HLJDT on expressions of hippocampal proteins was analyzed by two dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). RESULT: Compared with same age SAMR1, there were 29 differential expressed hippocampal proteins in SAMP8. After treated with HLJDT, the expressions of 38 hippocampal proteins of SAMP8 were changed significantly. 12 reactive proteins of HLJDT were chosen to be identified by MALDI-TOF-MS and the results were searched in MASCOT database. Among 12 reactive proteins, the expressions of 4 hippocampal proteins which expressed differentially between SAMR1 and SAMP8 could be improved by HLJDT. CONCLUSION: HLJDT may improve the aging of SAMP8 by regulating the expressions of proteins related with energy metabolism, signal transduction, cytoskeletal, amino acid metabolism and so on.",
