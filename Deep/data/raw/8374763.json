     "AB": "Changes in the levels of endogenous zinc and amino acids released from rat hippocampus due to one-hour restraint stress were measured using brain microdialysis. The zinc concentration in the perfusate of restrained rats increased to 167.3% of the mean basal level during the first 15-min period. Similar data were obtained for glutamate (Glu) release, which was increased to 210.5% of the basal level by restraint stress. These results indicated that hippocampal zinc release could be stimulated by restraint stress, and that this release may be related to the excitatory amino acids of Glu release.",
