     "AB": "Administration of endogenous corticosterone to intact animals induces calbindin-D28k protein in the hippocampal CA1-CA2 subfields. The fact that this effect on calbindin-D28k was shown to be specific for the hippocampus argues for a receptor-mediated effect on gene expression. In addition, chronic pretreatment with corticosterone aggravates ischemia-induced neuronal damage in the CA3-CA4 subfields. This effect is similar to that of preischemic hyperglycemia, which also induces postischemic seizures and aggravates brain damage, since corticosterone raises blood glucose level and enhances tissue lactic acidosis during ischemia. The energetically compromising qualities of corticosterone indicates that it is a key factor in hippocampal vulnerability. We assume that the increase of calbindin-D28k expression in the CA1-CA2 subfields in corticosterone-treated animals is an adaptive response to the exogenous stress. The lack of adaptive response in CA3-CA4 neurons endangers them by impairing the ability of these neurons to counteract the deleterious effects of calcium. This finding, supports: (1) the hypothesis that corticosterone treatment, when paired with an ischemic insult, causes a prolonged elevation of neuronal [Ca2+]i, in an energy dependent manner, probably through the reduction of calcium efflux and (2) that neurons which do contain calbindin-D28k are particularly predisposed to ischemic insults. The CA1-CA2 neurons express high amounts of calbindin-D28k under stress conditions because their activity may involve a high rate of calcium buffering.",
