     "AB": "We cloned the mouse ortholog of DISC1 (Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1), a candidate gene for schizophrenia. Disc1 is 3163 nucleotides long and has 60% identity with the human DISC1. Disc1 encodes 851 amino acids and has 56% identity with the human protein. Disc1 maps to the DISC1 syntenic region in the mouse, and genomic structure is conserved. A Disc1 splice variant deletes a portion of Disc1 beginning at amino acids orthologous to the human truncation. Bioinformatic analysis and cross-species comparisons revealed sequence conservation distributed across the genes and conservation of leucine zipper and coiled-coil domains in both orthologs. In situ hybridization in adult mouse brain revealed a restricted expression pattern, with highest levels in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and lower expression in CA1-CA3 of the hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulbs. Identification of Disc1 will facilitate the study of DISC1's function and creation of mouse models of DISC1 disruption.",
