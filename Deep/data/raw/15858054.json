     "AB": "The mechanism by which physiological synaptic NMDA receptor activity promotes neuronal survival is not well understood. Here, we show that that an episode of synaptic activity can promote neuroprotection for a long time after that activity has ceased. This long-lasting or \"late phase\" of neuroprotection is dependent on nuclear calcium signaling and cAMP response element (CRE)-mediated gene expression. In contrast, neuroprotection evoked acutely by ongoing synaptic activity relies solely on the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. This \"acute phase\" does not require nuclear calcium signaling and is independent of activation of the CRE-binding protein (CREB) family of transcription factors. Thus, activity-dependent neuroprotection comprises two mechanistically distinct phases that differ in their spatial requirements for calcium and in their reliance on the CREB family.",
