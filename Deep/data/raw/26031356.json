     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain cytochrome P450 2D (CYP2D) metabolises exogenous neurotoxins, endogenous substances and neurotransmitters. Brain CYP2D can be regulated in an organ-specific manner, but the possible regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated the involvement of miRNAs in the selective regulation of brain CYP2D by testosterone and the corresponding alteration of the pharmacological profiles of tramadol by testosterone. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The regulation of CYP2D and brain-enriched miRNAs by testosterone was investigated using SH-SY5Y cells, U251 cells, and HepG2 cells as well as orchiectomized growth hormone receptor knockout (GHR-KO) mice and rats. Concentration-time curves of tramadol in rat brain were determined using a microdialysis technique. The analgesic action of tramadol was assessed by the tail-flick test in rats. KEY RESULTS: miR-101 and miR-128-2 bound the 3'-untranslated region of the CYP2D6 mRNA and decreased its level. Testosterone decreased CYP2D6 catalytic function via the up-regulation of miR-101 and miR-128-2 in SH-SY5Y and U251 cells, but not in HepG2 cells. Orchiectomy decreased the levels of miR-101 and miR-128-2 in the hippocampus of male GHR-KO mice, indicating that androgens regulate miRNAs directly, not via the alteration of growth hormone secretion patterns. Changes in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of tramadol by orchiectomy was attenuated by either testosterone supplementation or a specific brain CYP2D inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The selective regulation of brain CYP2D via brain-enriched miRNAs, following changes in androgen levels, such as in testosterone therapy, androgen deprivation therapy and/or ageing may alter the response to centrally active substances.",
