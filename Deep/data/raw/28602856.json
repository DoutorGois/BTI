     "AB": "How a seizure spreads from a focal onset zone to other regions of the brain is not well understood, and animal studies suggest that there is a genetic influence. To understand how genetic factors may influence seizure spread, we examined whether the kindling resistance of WAG/Rij rats, which are slow to develop kindled motor seizures, is independent of the site of seizure induction and thus a global phenomenon, or whether it is circuit specific. We compared the kindling rates (number of stimulations to induce kindled motor seizures) of WAG/Rij rats to the rates of kindling in Sprague Dawley rats. Both groups underwent a standard hippocampal kindling protocol and a separate group was kindled from the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, a site that has been previously demonstrated to result in the very rapid development of motor seizures. To examine whether there were differences in the interaction in a circuit involved with the motor seizures, evoked responses were obtained from the prefrontal cortex following stimulation of the subiculum or medial dorsal thalamic nucleus. The WAG/Rij rats once again demonstrated resistance to kindling in the hippocampus, but both strains kindled rapidly from the medial dorsal nucleus. In the WAG/Rij rats there was also a reduction in the duration of the afterdischarge in the frontal cortex during hippocampal stimulation, but there was no reduction during thalamic kindling. The prefrontal cortex evoked responses were reduced following stimulation of the subiculum in the WAG/Rij rats, but the evoked responses to thalamic stimulation were the same in both strains. These findings suggest that there are genetic influences in the strength of the input from the subiculum to the prefrontal cortex in WAG/Rij rats that could explain the resistance to limbic kindling because of reduced excitatory drive onto a key target region.",
