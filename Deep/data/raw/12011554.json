     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Recent evidence from animal models has demonstrated that tPA can be neurotoxic to the hippocampus and cerebellum. Since tPA is used in patients with myocardial infarction and has been approved for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, we carried out a pilot study to investigate whether its administration could result in any clinically relevant neuropsychological dysfunction, with particular attention to those structures most involved in the animal model. PATIENT AND METHODS: Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who were subjected to thrombolysis with r-tPA and without evidence of prior or concomitant neurological-neuropsychological damage, were eligible. Controls consisted of patients with AMI not candidate for thrombolysis or patients with severe angina admitted to the intensive care unit. A detailed neurological and neuropsychological evaluation was performed, which included mood, visual and verbal memory, psychomotor speed processing and motor dexterity and visuomotor sequence learning. RESULTS: Ten patients and 13 controls were included. No significant differences between both groups were found, although all the subjects performed in the lower limits of the normal range on the Purdue pegboard test (motor dexterity) and digit-symbol test (psychomotor speed). There was no evidence of depression, as assessed by the Hamilton scale, that could have interfered with performance. Declarative memory (Rey auditory-verbal learning test) as well as visual memory (Rey-Osterrieth figure copy) and visuomotor sequence learning (serial reaction time task) were normal, without between-group differences. CONCLUSIONS: tPA administration at the usual doses did not result in detectable neuropsychological abnormalities in patients with myocardial ischemia.",
