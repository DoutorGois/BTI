     "AB": "This study investigated in vitro and in vivo antioxidant potential of carvacryl acetate (CA), a derivative of carvacrol, monoterpenic component of oregano. The correlation between in vitro and in vivo CA effects was also determined. In vitro tests measured thiobarbituric acid reactive species content, nitrite formation and hydroxyl radical levels. In vivo tests measured thiobarbituric acid reactive species content, nitrite concentration and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, as well as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities were measured, using mice hippocampus. The CA administrations for in vivo tests were intraperitoneally and acutely improved. CA reduced lipid peroxidation, nitrite and hydroxyl radical contents in vitro as well as lipid peroxidation and nitrite content in vivo. It also increased reduced GSH levels and GPx as well as catalase activities. Moreover, CA required a lower concentration to inhibit 50 % of free radicals measured in vitro than trolox. There was significant negative correlation between in vitro nitrite levels and in vivo reduced GSH levels; in vitro nitrite content and in vivo GPx activity as well as in vitro hydroxyl radical levels and in vivo SOD activity. To date, this is the first study which suggests vitro and in vivo antioxidant potential to this monoterpene and the correlation between these parameters.",
