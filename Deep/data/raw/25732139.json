     "AB": "The cholinergic pathways, which originate in the basal forebrain and are responsible for the control of different cognitive processes including learning and memory, are also regulated by some neuropeptides. One of these neuropeptides, galanin (GAL), is involved in both neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions. The present study has evaluated in rats the effects on cognition induced by a subchronic treatment with GAL by analyzing the passive avoidance response, and the modulation of muscarinic cholinergic receptor densities and activities. [(3)H]-N-methyl-scopolamine, [(3)H]-oxotremorine, and [(3)H]-pirenzepine were used to quantify the density of muscarinic receptors (MRs) and the stimulation of the binding of guanosine 5'-(gamma-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate by the muscarinic agonist, carbachol, to determine their functionality. Some cognitive deficits that were induced by the administration of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) (i.c.v. aCSF 2 mul/min, once a day for 6 days) were not observed in the animals also treated with GAL (i.c.v. 1.5 mmol in aCSF, 2 mul/min, once a day for 6 days). GAL modulates the changes in M1 and M2 MR densities observed in the rats treated with aCSF, and also increased their activity mediated by G(i/o) proteins in specific areas of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. The subchronic administration of the vehicle was also accompanied by an increased number of positive fibers and cells for GAL around the cortical tract of the cannula used, but that was not the case in GAL-treated rats. In addition, the increase of GAL receptor density in the ventral hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in the aCSF group was avoided when GAL was administered. The number of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-positive neurons was decreased in the nucleus basalis of Meynert of both GAL- and aCSF-treated animals. In summary, GAL improves memory-related abilities probably through the modulation of MR density and/or efficacy in hippocampal areas.",
