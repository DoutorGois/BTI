     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of microwave irradiation on hippocampus cell. METHOD: Changes of ATPase activity and voltage dependent ion channel of hippocampus cell membrane were observed in mice exposed to 2 450 MHz microwave irradiation of 10 mW/cm2 from a physical therapy machine. Histochemical method and patch clamp method were used to determine the activity of Na+, K(+)-ATPase, Ca2+, Mg(2+)-ATPase and voltage dependent Na+, K+, Ca2+ channels respectively. RESULT: 1) Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity of microwave irradiated mice showed no significant change as compared with the control, but the activity of Ca2+, Mg(2+)-ATPase decreased significantly (P< 0.05); 2) In microwave irradiated mice, Na+, K+, Ca2+, current inducement rate in hippocampus neuron decreased significantly, the membrane voltage of Na+ current peak shifted to depolarization, and the attenuation rate of Na+ current and current A inducement rate decreased significantly as compared with control mice. CONCLUSION: Irradiation of 2 450 MHz microwave at a doze of 10 mW/cm2 was not fatal to mice hippocampus cell. But Ca2+, Mg(2+)-ATPase activity of hippocampal cell membrane and voltage dependent Na+, K+, Ca2+ ion channel of hippocampal nervous were affected which would affect study and memory.",
