     "AB": "In a rat kindling model, we examined expression patterns of NKCC1, KCC1, KCC2, and CLC-2. In the dentate granule cell layer, there was an activity-dependent increase in NKCC1 mRNA but significant decreases in KCC1 and CLC-2 mRNAs. In addition, CLC-2 mRNA expression was markedly decreased in CA1 pyramidal layer. These results suggest that an increase in [Cl-]i and a resultant reduction in GABAergic inhibition may occur in hippocampus of epileptic rats.",
