     "AB": "Transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) and microbubble contrast agent, applied at parameters known to transiently increase blood-brain barrier permeability, were tested for the potential to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis. In adult mice, FUS treatment significantly increased the number of proliferating cells and newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of the dorsal hippocampus. This provides evidence that FUS with microbubbles can stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis, a process involved in learning and memory and affected in neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.",
