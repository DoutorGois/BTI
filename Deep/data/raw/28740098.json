     "AB": "The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant-like effects of puerarin via the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) procedure in rats. Similar to Sertraline (Ser), Chronic treatment of puerarin (60 and 120 mg/kg, i.g) elicited the antidepressant-like effects by reversing the decreased sucrose preference in sucrose preference test (SPT), by blocking the increased latency to feed in novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT) and the increased immobility time in forced swimming test (FST) without affecting locomotor activity. However, acute puerarin treatment did not ameliorate the antidepressant- and anxiolytic- like effects in FST and NSFT, respectively. In addition, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) showed that chronic treatment of puerarin (60 and 120 mg/kg, i.g) reversed the decreased levels of progesterone, allopregnanolone, serotonin (5-HT) and 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of post-CUS rats. Furthermore, puerarin (60 and 120 mg/kg, i.g) blocked the increased corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), corticosterone (Cort) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Collectively, repeated administration of puerarin alleviated the behavioral deficits induced by chronic stress which was associated with the biosynthesis of neurosteroids, normalization of serotonergic system and preventing HPA axis dysfunction.",
