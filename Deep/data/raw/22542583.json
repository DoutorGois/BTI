     "AB": "Inflammation has recently been implicated as a critical mechanism responsible for neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, paeonol (1-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)ethanone) isolated from the sea horse Hippocampus kuda Bleeler was studied as an agent to suppress LPS induced activation of BV-2 microglial and RAW264.7 macrophage cells. The results obtained showed that paeonol significantly suppressed LPS induced release of pro-inflammatory products such as nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)), and cytokines; tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Furthermore, the compound down regulated the protein and gene expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 in both cell lines. Molecular signaling pathway studies showed that paeonol inhibited the translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 and p50 subunits to the nucleus by blocking IKKalpha/beta (IkappaB kinase alpha/beta) mediated degradation of IkappaBalpha. Moreover, it suppressed the phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway molecules; c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 in both cell lines. Collectively these results indicate that paeonol blocked the LPS stimulated inflammatory responses in BV-2 and RAW264.7 cells via modulating MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Therefore, paeonol could be a promising candidate to be used in neuro-inflammatory therapy.",
