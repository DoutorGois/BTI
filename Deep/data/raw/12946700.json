     "AB": "Correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity is thought to promote maturation of excitatory synapses in the developing brain by directing AMPA receptors to pure NMDA synapses. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo. Here, we have performed such test by inhibiting correlated neural activity in vivo using a single injection of tetanus toxin into the rat hippocampal CA1 area at postnatal day 1. When examined in the acute slice preparation (1-7 days post-injection), there was a strong reduction, down to 20% of control level, in the frequency of glutamatergic and GABAergic spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs). This activity deprivation led to a growth retardation of CA1 pyramidal neurons and to markedly faster decay kinetics of NMDA sPCSs. However, it did not alter the relationship between AMPA and NMDA sPSCs with respect to either their frequency or amplitude. Thus, although critical for certain aspects of neuronal development, correlated neural activity in the neonatal hippocampus does not seem to promote incorporation of AMPA receptors at pure NMDA synapses.",
