     "AB": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Volatile anesthetic isoflurane contributes to postoperative cognitive dysfunction and inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP), a synaptic model of learning and memory, but the mechanisms are uncertain. Central neuronal alpha4beta2 subtype nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are involved in the induction of LTP in the hippocampus. Isoflurane inhibits alpha4beta2 nAChRs at concentrations lower than those used for anesthesia. Therefore, we hypothesized that isoflurane-inhibited LTP induction of hippocampal CA1 neurons via alpha4beta2 nAChRs subtype inhibition. METHODS: Transverse hippocampal slices (400mum thick) were obtained from male rats (6-8 weeks old). Population spikes were evoked using extracellular electrodes by electrical stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway of rat hippocampal slices. LTP was induced using high frequency stimulation (HFS; 100Hz, 1s). Clinically relevant concentrations (0.125-0.5mM) of isoflurane with or without nicotine (nAChRs agonist), mecamylamine (nAChRs antagonist), 3-[2(S)-2-azetidinylmethoxy] pyridine (A85380) and epibatidine (alpha4beta2 nAChRs agonist), dihydro beta erythroidine (DHbetaE) (alpha4beta2 nAChRs antagonist) were added to the perfusion solution 20min before HFS to test their effects on LTP by HFS respectively. RESULTS: A brief HFS induced stable LTP in rat hippocampal slices, but LTP was significantly inhibited in the presence of isoflurane at concentrations of 0.125-0.5mM. The inhibitive effect of isoflurane on LTP was not only reversible and could be prevented by nAChRs agonist nicotine and alpha4beta2 nAChRs agonist A85380 and epibatidine, but also mimicked and potentiated by nAChRs antagonist mecamylamine and alpha4beta2 nAChRs antagonist DHbetaE. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of alpha4beta2 nAChRs subtype of hippocampus participates in isoflurane-mediated LTP inhibition.",
