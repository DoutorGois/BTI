     "AB": "[3H]Palmitic acid and [14C]arachidonic acid were injected together into the cerebral ventricle of 4-month and 24-month-old rats. At different time intervals from the injection, the distribution of these fatty acids in the lipids from different brain areas was examined. The fatty acids were rapidly incorporated into the lipids through different mechanisms. The time-specific activity relationship indicate that the utilization of the fatty acid differs according to the different areas and aging decreases the utilization of both the fatty acids. The decline of arachidonic acid incorporation into phospholipids is particularly evident, indicating that aging affects mainly the utilization of polyunsaturated fatty acids.",
