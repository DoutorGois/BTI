     "AB": "Glucocorticoids are the main product of the adrenal cortex and participate in multiple cell functions as immunosupressors and modulators of neural function. Within the brain, glucocorticoid activity is mediated by high-affinity mineralocorticoid and low-affinity glucocorticoid receptors. Among brain cells, hippocampal cells are rich in glucocorticoid receptors where they regulate excitability and morphology. Also, elevated glucocorticoid levels suppress hippocampal neurogenesis in adults. The pineal neuroindole, melatonin, reduces the affinity of glucocorticoid receptors in rat brain and prevents glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Here, the ability of melatonin to prevent glucocorticoid-induced cell death in hippocampal HT22 cells was investigated in the presence of neurotoxins. Results showed that glucocorticoids reduce cellular growth and also enhance sensitivity to neurotoxins. We found a G(1) cell cycle arrest mediated by an increase of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) protein after dexamethasone treatment and incremental change in amyloid beta protein and glutamate toxicity. Melatonin prevents glucocorticoids inhibition of cell proliferation and reduces the toxicity caused by glucocorticoids when cells were treated with dexamethasone in combination with neurotoxins. Although, melatonin does not reduce glucocorticoid receptor mRNA or protein levels, it decreases receptor translocation to nuclei in these cells.",
