     "AB": "It has been proposed by Yamada et al. [Neurosci. Lett. 118: 128-131 (1990); J. Pharmacobiodyn. 14: 351-355 (1991)] that subchronic i.c.v. infusion of the NMDA receptor agonist quinolinic acid may serve as a model for some aspects of neurodegenerative dementia. In the present study, quinolinic acid (9 mM) was infused i.c.v. by ALZET osmotic minipumps for 2 weeks. This treatment produced a short-term working memory deficit in the T-maze (alternation) but no change in reversal learning in the same test. The working memory deficit in the T-maze was progressive i.e. seen after 14, but not 3 days of infusion and persisted for at least for 3 weeks after the termination of the infusion. Histological examination revealed a modest decrease in the number of cells in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis but not in the striatum, entorhinal cortex, or hippocampus. However, in most of the structures studied, morphological changes such as swollen somata and irregular shape were observed indicative of alterations in neuronal function. Autoradiography in the hippocampus revealed a decrease in [3H]hemicholinium and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) binding to choline uptake sites and muscarinic receptors respectively. Surprisingly no change was observed in [3H]MK-801 binding to NMDA receptor channels in the hippocampus and cortex. The subchronic infusion of quinolinic acid may serve as a model of progressive deterioration of cognitive functions.",
