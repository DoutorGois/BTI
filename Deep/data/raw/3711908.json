     "AB": "Regional amino acid concentrations were measured in rat brain fixed by microwave irradiation at three levels of elevated atmospheric pressure corresponding to different phases of the high-pressure neurological syndrome [20 atmospheres absolute (ATA), no clinical signs; 60 ATA, tremor; 85 ATA, severe tremor and myoclonic jerks]. No changes in amino acid content occurred at 20 or 60 ATA. At 85 ATA glutamine content increased in hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum, and substantia nigra, and gamma-aminobutyric acid content increased in hippocampus. It is suggested that enhanced glutamate release in various subcortical structures contributes to the myoclonic activity observed at 85 ATA.",
