     "AB": "We investigated the functional connectivity of brain regions activated during opiate craving. Previously we used recorded autobiographical scripts to induce opiate craving in 12 abstinent opiate-dependent subjects while they were undergoing positron emission tomography (PET) scanning using the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) tracer H2 15O. SPM99 was used to examine the connectivity patterns associated with the primary brain regions activated in response to drug-craving memories (anterior cingulate, AC) and correlated with opiate craving (orbitofrontal cortex, OFC). Two separate connectivity patterns were identified associated with the OFC and AC regions. The AC region was associated with activity in the left temporal region. The left OFC region activity correlated with activity in the right OFC, and left parietal and posterior insular regions. There was also a positive association with the hippocampus and brainstem. Both the AC and OFC regions showed a negative association with posterior visual areas. We suggest that the patterns of functional connectivity reflect the ability of drug-related stimuli to activate attentional and memory circuits to a greater degree than non-drug-related stimuli. This argues that neural circuits of dependence and craving are not specific \"craving\" or \"addiction\" brain regions but are \"normal\" circuits activated to a greater degree.",
