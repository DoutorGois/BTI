     "AB": "The feather crest on the head of the White Crested Polish Chicken covers a bony protuberance, a skull modification typical of crested chickens. The telencephalon is displaced into this protuberance, giving the brain the shape of an hour-glass. Allometric comparison (i.e., consideration of the influence of body weight on brain size) shows that the brain is relatively larger in crested chickens. This enlargement is partly due to enlarged ventricles, which are observed in some individuals. Among the brain structures measured, the tegmentum, cerebellum, tectum, paleostriatum, hippocampus, septum and olfactory bulb are not significantly larger in White Crested Polish chickens in comparison to those structures in seven uncrested chicken breeds; the optic tract, diencephalon, telencephalon, accessory hyperstriatum, dorsal and ventral hyperstriatum, and neostriatum, however, are significantly enlarged in this breed.",
