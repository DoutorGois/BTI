     "AB": "GABAergic interneurons have major roles in hippocampal function and dysfunction. Here we provide evidence that, in mice, virtually all of these cells originate from progenitors in the basal telencephalon. Immature interneurons tangentially migrate from the basal telencephalon through the neocortex to take up their final positions in the hippocampus. Disrupting differentiation in the embryonic basal telencephalon (lateral and medial ganglionic eminences) through loss of Dlx1/2 homeobox function blocks the migration of virtually all GABAergic interneurons to the hippocampus. On the other hand, disrupting specification of the medial ganglionic eminence through loss of Nkx2.1 homeobox function depletes the hippocampus of a distinct subset of hippocampal interneurons. Loss of hippocampal interneurons does not appear to have major effects on the early development of hippocampal projection neurons nor on the pathfinding of afferrent tracts.",
