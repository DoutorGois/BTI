     "AB": "The influence of metaphit, a phencyclidine derivative, on the amplitude of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) in the mouse hippocampus was investigated. Mice (C57BL/6) of both sexes were injected with metaphit (80 mg/kg) and hippocampal slices were prepared at 3, 24, 48 hrs and 6 days following injection. The extracellular evoked potentials were recorded from the pyramidal cell layer following Schaffer collateral stimulation. The threshold value, defined as the minimum strength of the stimuli to evoke a 0.1 mV potential, was about 5 fold greater in metaphit slices than in control slices 3 hr following injection, and then declined to the control value within 6 days. The magnitude of LTP was also amplified by metaphit in a time-dependent fashion. The effect was visible three hours after injection, reached its maximum at 48 hr and then declined to a level slightly higher than control at 6 days following injection. These results demonstrate that metaphit, a compound known to induce audiogenic seizures, is able to modify synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Presented results are also in agreement with our previous data which demonstrated an interaction between the mechanisms of LTP and audiogenic seizure.",
