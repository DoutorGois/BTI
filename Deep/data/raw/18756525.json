     "AB": "Cell survival is a critical issue in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases and following pathological events including ischemia and traumatic brain injury. Oxidative stress is the main cause of cell damage in such pathological conditions. Here, we report that adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) protects hippocampal astrocytes from hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-evoked oxidative injury in astrocyte monocultures. The effect of ATP was prevented by a selective antagonist of or siRNAs against P2Y(1)R. Interestingly, in astrocyte-neuron cocultures, ATP also produced neuroprotective effects against H(2)O(2)-evoked neuronal cell death, whereas ATP did not produce any neuroprotective effects in monocultures. The ATP-induced neuroprotection in cocultures was completely inhibited by silencing of astrocytic P2Y(1)R expression, indicating that ATP acts on astrocytes and enhances their neuroprotective functions by activating P2Y(1)R. Furthermore, this neuroprotective effect was mimicked by applying conditioned medium from astrocytes that had been stimulated by ATP, implying an involvement of diffusible factors from astrocytes. We found that, in both purified astrocyte cultures and astrocyte-neuronal cocultures, ATP and the P2Y(1)R agonist 2-methylthioadenosine 5' diphosphate (2MeSADP) induced the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6), but this did not occur in neuron monocultures. Moreover, exogenous IL-6 produced a neuroprotective effect, and the neuroprotection induced by P2Y(1)R-stimulated astrocytes was prevented in the presence of an anti-IL-6 antibody. Taken together, these results suggest that P2Y(1)R-stimulated astrocytes protect against neuronal damage induced by oxidative stress, and that IL-6 is a crucial signaling molecule released from astrocytes. Thus, activation of P2Y(1)R in astrocytes may rescue neurons from secondary cell death under pathological conditions.",
