     "AB": "Blood platelets resemble 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) with regard to uptake kinetics of 5HT at the plasma membrane and potencies of 5HT uptake inhibitors at this membrane. Furthermore, by comparing 5HT uptake in normal and reserpinized platelets the site of action of uptake inhibitors (plasma membrane, intracellular amine storage organelles) may be determined. The specific 5HT receptors of platelets whose stimulation induces a reversible shape change of platelets seem to react to drugs in a similar way as 5HT receptors of some CNS-regions such as spinal cord, cortex and possibly reticular formation. In other CNS areas e.g. those with dense 5HT innervation and the hippocampus the 5HT receptors show a reaction to drugs which is partially different from that of the platelet receptors. In other respects e.g. the synthesis and turnover of 5HT platelets do not resemble 5HT neurons. It is concluded that platelets may be used with caution as models for 5HT-neurons with regard to some aspect of 5HT-dynamics.",
