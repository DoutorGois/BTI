     "AB": "We have previously reported that intraventricular insulin is ineffective in decreasing the body weight of obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats. In the present study, we report that insulin at concentrations of 1 and 5 nM significantly stimulates incorporation of 3H-myoinositol into inositol phosphates (29 +/- 5% and 20 +/- 6% stimulation over control levels) and membrane inositol lipids (29 +/- 4% and 20 +/- 6% stimulation over control levels) within hippocampal slices from lean (Fa/Fa) Zucker rats (n = 3 preparations). Smaller but significant stimulations were observed in the Fa/fa Zucker rat (n = 5) hippocampus [10 +/- 3 and 13 +/- 4% stimulation over control levels (inositol phosphates) and 10 +/- 4 and 14 +/- 3% stimulation over control levels (inositol lipids) with 1 and 5 nM insulin]. Insulin had no effect on 3H-inositol incorporation into hippocampal slices from obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats (n = 5). No difference in insulin binding to hippocampal membranes was observed among the three genotypes. These findings confirm the behavioral observation of insulin insensitivity within the fa/fa Zucker CNS and suggest that this insensitivity may be gene-dose-related.",
