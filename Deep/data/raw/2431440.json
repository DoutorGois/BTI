     "AB": "The effect of immobilization stress (IM-stress) on the concentration and the receptor binding of substance P (SP), methionine-enkephalin (ME) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was determined in eight brain regions and the spinal cord. The concentration of SP was decreased in the septum, striatum and hippocampus, and SP receptor binding was decreased in the septum, amygdala + pyriform cortex and hypothalamus. Scatchard analysis indicated that the decrease in the SP binding is mainly due to the decrease in the number of receptors. The concentration of ME was not changed, but ME receptor binding was decreased in the septum. The concentration of TRH was decreased in the frontal cortex, septum, amygdala + pyriform cortex and pons + medulla oblongata, but increased in the spinal cord. TRH receptor binding was decreased in the septum, amygdala + pyriform cortex and hypothalamus. Scatchard analysis indicated that the decrease in TRH binding is due to the decrease in the number of receptors. These results show that IM-stress affects the neuropeptide receptor as well as neuropeptide concentration, and that the septum is a very important region under IM-stress.",
