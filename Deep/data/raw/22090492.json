     "AB": "Previous studies have shown that neuron-specific deletion of serum response factor (SRF) results in deficits in tangential cell migration, guidance-dependent circuit assembly, activity-dependent gene expression, and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Furthermore, SRF deletion in mouse embryonic stem cells causes cell death in vitro. However, the requirement of SRF for early neuronal development including neural stem cell homeostasis, neurogenesis, and axonal innervations remains unknown. Here, we report that SRF is critical for development of major axonal tracts in the forebrain. Conditional mutant mice lacking SRF in neural progenitor cells (Srf-Nestin-cKO) exhibit striking deficits in cortical axonal projections including corticostriatal, corticospinal, and corticothalamic tracts, and they show a variable loss of the corpus callosum. Neurogenesis and interneuron specification occur normally in the absence of SRF and the deficits in axonal projections were not due to a decrease or loss in cell numbers. Radial migration of neurons and neocortical lamination were also not affected. No aberrant cell death was observed during development, whereas there was an increase in the number of proliferative cells in the ventricular zone from embryonic day 14 to day 18. Similar axonal tract deficits were also observed in mutant mice lacking SRF in the developing excitatory neurons of neocortex and hippocampus (Srf-NEX-cKO). Together, these findings suggest distinct roles for SRF during neuronal development; SRF is specifically required in a cell-autonomous manner for axonal tract development but is dispensable for cell survival, neurogenesis, neocortical lamination, and neuronal differentiation.",
