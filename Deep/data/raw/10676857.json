     "AB": "The stereoselectivity of the serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptor compound 8-hydroxy-2(di-N-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) on forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was investigated in membranes from human 5-HT pre-synaptic (raphe nuclei) and post-synaptic (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) regions of autopsy brains. After sample incubation with agonists and antagonists, results showed that both the racemic mixture of 8-OH-DPAT or its (+) and (-) enantiomers behaved as full agonists in the tested brain regions. Enantiomer potency (EC50, nM) and efficacy (percentage of maximal inhibition, %) values were similar in all regions under investigation. However, some inter and intra-region variations in racemic 8-OH-DPAT potency and efficacy have been observed. In particular, the potency of racemic 8-OH-DPAT was higher in the prefrontal cortex and raphe nuclei than in the hippocampus, where it was in fact lower than either single enantiomers. Agonist effects were competitively reversed by 5-HT1A antagonists, although once again a different profile was revealed in the hippocampus. The data underscores the lack of stereospecificity of 8-OH-DPAT-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in either pre- or post-synaptic human brain regions. Moreover, such results have significant implication, as they support the notion that human 5-HT1A receptors might vary from one brain region to the other.",
