     "AB": "The forebrain medial septum, which is an integral part of the septo-hippocampal network, is implicated in sensorimotor integration, fear and anxiety, and spatial learning and memory. A body of evidence also suggests that the septal region affects experimental pain. Indeed, some explorations in humans have raised the possibility that the region may modulate clinical pain as well. This review explores the evidence that implicates the medial septum in nociception and suggests that non-overlapping circuits in the region facilitate acute nociceptive behaviors and defensive behaviors that reflect affect and cognitive appraisal, especially in relation to persistent nociception. In line with a role in nociception, the region modulates nociceptive responses in the neuraxis, including the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex. The aforementioned forebrain regions have also been implicated in persistent/long-lasting nociception. The review also weighs the effects of the medial septum on nociception vis-a-vis the known roles of the region and emphasizes the fact that the region is a part of network of forebrain structures which have been long associated with reward, cognition and affect-motivation and are now implicated in persistent/long-lasting nociception.",
