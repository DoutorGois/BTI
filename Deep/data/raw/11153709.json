     "AB": "Cell recognition molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily are involved in the formation, establishment, and plasticity of neural circuits in the central nervous system (CNS). We used a polymerase chain reaction-based approach to specifically amplify molecules with conserved sequence elements of immunoglobulin-like domains. This approach enabled us to isolate Kilon, a novel immunoglobulin that has been described by Funatsu et al. (J Biol Chem 1999;274: 8224-8230) from the hippocampus. The sequence of Kilon shows a high degree of homology to that of the chicken protein neurotractin, a molecule involved in neurite outgrowth and capable of interacting with LAMP. In situ hybridization analysis was performed to analyze the Kilon mRNA distribution in the developing and adult rat brain and to compare it to that of LAMP mRNA. Kilon mRNA was found to be specifically expressed in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the adult rat, whereas LAMP transcripts were present in all regions of the hippocampal formation. These results were corroborated by RT-PCR semiquantification of gene expression in microdissected tissue prepared from the DG and the CA1 region of the hippocampus. We also performed mRNA expression analysis of both genes following hippocampal deafferentation and seizure, but neither Kilon nor LAMP gene expression showed significant alterations after lesioning on the in situ hybridization level. Our results show that the expression patterns of Kilon and LAMP during development and in the mature hippocampus are clearly distinguishable from one another, which suggests different roles for these related molecules in the hippocampus.",
