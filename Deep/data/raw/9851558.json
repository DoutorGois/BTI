     "AB": "A cDNA clone has been isolated from a human hippocampal cDNA expression library by relying on the selectivity of two antisera that are specific for imidazoline binding proteins. A 1789 bp cDNA clone was sequenced and shown to contain a single open-reading frame that predicts a 66 kDa polypeptide, but it is truncated based on its lack of a stop codon and poly-A+ tail. Two regions of homology exist for the predicted amino acid sequence in common with chromogranin-A and B proteins, a zinc finger protein, and the ryanodine receptor. Northern blot analyses of poly-A+ mRNA from 36 human tissues indicated two differentially expressed transcripts of 6.0 and 9.5 kb. The 6.0 kb mRNA form was enriched in brain and endocrine tissues as compared to other tissues, but not in strict concordance with I1-imidazoline binding sites. The highest overall amounts of the combined transcripts were found in pituitary. In situ hybridization histochemistry revealed an enrichment of the message in neuronal cell bodies of the rat hippocampus and cerebellar cortex. This clone has some of the properties expected of an imidazoline receptor.",
