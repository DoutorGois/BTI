     "AB": "This study reports the effects of alloxan induced diabetes on glucose metabolism enzymes viz. Hexokinase, Lactate dehydrogenase, and Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from discrete brain regions. Enzymes activity was assayed from hypothalamic areas such as medial preoptic area and median eminence-arcuate region which have gonadotropin releasing hormone cell bodies and their terminals, respectively and other brain regions like septum, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus. In all the areas studied, induction of diabetes resulted in a significant decrease in particulate bound HK activity, whereas soluble HK, LDH and G6PDH activity showed increase at 3, 8, 15 and 28 days intervals. Insulin treatment of diabetic rats led to recovery in enzyme activity. Blood glucose levels increased significantly after induction of diabetes and recovery was seen after insulin treatment. The present results suggest that altered cerebral glucose metabolism may also be responsible for reproductive failure observed in diabetic rats.",
