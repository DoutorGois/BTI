     "AB": "Spatiotemporal patterns of action potentials are considered to be closely related to information processing in the brain. Auto-generating neurons contributing to these processing tasks are known to cause multifractal behavior in the inter-spike intervals of the output action potentials. In this paper we define a novel relationship between this multifractality and the adaptive Nernst equilibrium in hippocampal neurons. Using this relationship we are able to differentiate between various drugs at varying dosages. Conventional methods limit their ability to account for cellular charge depletion by not including these adaptive Nernst equilibria. Our results provide a new theoretical approach for measuring the effects which drugs have on single-cell dynamics.",
