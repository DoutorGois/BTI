     "AB": "Seizures were kindled in the amygdala and ventral hippocampus of rats until a stage 5 (clonic convulsion) was elicited. Stage 5 thresholds were than determined. Animals were then injected with either saline, or a 600 mg/kg, or 1600 mg/kg dose of 25% ethanol. The effect of each of these injections on seizure thresholds was assessed. The 1600 mg/kg dose caused a significant elevation in both AD and motor seizure thresholds, relative to the 600 mg/kg dose and saline, which did not differ. The elevation of seizure thresholds was significantly greater for animals with seizures kindled in the ventral hippocampus.",
