     "AB": "This study argues that, in contrast to accepted excitotoxicity theory, O2/glucose deprivation damages neurons acutely by eliciting ischemic spreading depression (SD), a process not blocked by glutamate antagonists. In live rat hippocampal slices, the initiation, propagation, and resolution of SD can be imaged by monitoring wide-band changes in light transmittance (i.e., intrinsic optical signals). Oxygen/glucose deprivation for 10 minutes at 37.5 degrees C evokes a propagating wave of elevated light transmittance across the slice, representing the SD front. Within minutes, CA1 neurons in regions undergoing SD display irreversible damage in the form of field potential inactivation, swollen cell bodies, and extensively beaded dendrites, the latter revealed by single-cell injection of lucifer yellow. Importantly, glutamate receptor antagonists do not block SD induced by O2/glucose deprivation, nor do they prevent the resultant dendritic beading of CA1 neurons. However, CA1 neurons are spared if SD is suppressed by reducing the temperature to 35 degrees C during O2/glucose deprivation. This supports previous electrophysiologic evidence in vivo that SD during ischemia promotes acute neuronal damage and that glutamate antagonists are not protective of the metabolically stressed tissue. The authors propose that the inhibition of ischemic SD should be targeted as an important therapeutic strategy against stroke damage.",
