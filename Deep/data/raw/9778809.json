     "AB": "The persistent negative potential (PNP) developed after a single wave of cortical spreading depression (SD) in the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and caudate nucleus. The PNP lasted for about 3-4 hours, its amplitude was 6-7 mV in the ipsilateral and 3-4 mV in the contralateral structures. After development of bilateral primary cortical SD waves the amplitudes of the respective PNP were summed up and reached 9-11 mV. However, after the repeated waves of cortical SD produced with 15-30-min intervals, the PNP level remained unchanged. We think that the PNP is an electrographic manifestation of the well known persistent vasoconstriction after a single wave of cortical SD. It seems to be related with reticular activation due to functional decortication.",
