     "AB": "The effect of leupeptin, an inhibitor of thiol-proteases, was tested on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in field CA1 of hippocampal slices. Two h of drug application did not produce substantial changes while a greater than 3-h application caused a sizeable reduction in the degree of LTP induced. Leupeptin had no obvious effects on the facilitation of postsynaptic responses occurring within or between the short high frequency bursts used to induce LTP, suggesting that the drug acted on cellular chemistries occurring after the initial physiological events that normally trigger LTP. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a calcium-activated thiol protease (calpain) is involved in the induction of LTP.",
