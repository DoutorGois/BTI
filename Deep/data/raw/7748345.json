     "AB": "There was a significant increase in potassium-stimulated release of 3H-[5-HT] from hippocampal slices taken from rats withdrawn from chronic ethanol treatment, compared with control-treated rats. The anxiogenic behaviour observed 12 h after ethanol withdrawal was inhibited by the 5-HT1A partial agonist, buspirone (200 micrograms/kg s.c.), indicating that the increased 5-HT release might underlie the anxiogenic response. The ex-ethanol treated rats showed impaired habituation of motor activity in the holeboard and a reduced exploratory response. The latter, but not the former, were reversed by the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron (0.01 microgram/kg i.p.). Ondansetron was without effect on working memory errors, but significantly increased the number of reference memory errors made by the ex-ethanol group. It also had a significantly anxiogenic effect in this group. These results suggest that the chronic ethanol treatment changes the 5-HT system and has long-lasting effects on the function of 5-HT3 receptors.",
