     "AB": "To understand the relationship among cholesterolemia, hyperglycemic stage in non obese type 2 diabetes mellitus, and histological perturbations on liver, retina, hippocampus, and Harderian gland, we maintained rat on a diet high in cholesterol for fourteen weeks, then analyzed blood lipid profiles, blood glucose, hepatic enzymes, and microscopic lesion of those tissues. We observed that high cholesterol-treated rat elevated in cholesterol and low density lipoprotein with not correlated to hyperglycemia. Histopathological changing in Goto-Kakizaki rat on liver (microvesicular steatosis) and Harderain gland (tubular lesions) were related to hyperglycemic effect rather than cholesterolemic effect. These may be related to hypoinsulinemic characteristic of this diabetic model. However increasing pyknotic nuclei on hippocampus and reducing of retinal ganglionic cell were related to the high level of cholesterol loaded with synergized effect due to diabetic stage.",
