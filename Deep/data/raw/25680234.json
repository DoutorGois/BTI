     "AB": "Enhancement of tonic inhibition mediated by extrasynaptic alpha5-subunit containing GABAA receptors (GABAARs) has been proposed as the mechanism by which a variety of anesthetics, including the general anesthetic etomidate, impair learning and memory. Since alpha5 subunits preferentially partner with beta3 subunits, we tested the hypothesis that etomidate acts through beta3-subunit containing GABAARs to enhance tonic inhibition, block LTP, and impair memory. We measured the effects of etomidate in wild type mice and in mice carrying a point mutation in the GABAAR beta3-subunit (beta3-N265M) that renders these receptors insensitive to etomidate. Etomidate enhanced tonic inhibition in CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus in wild type but not in mutant mice, demonstrating that tonic inhibition is mediated by beta3-subunit containing GABAARs. However, despite its inability to enhance tonic inhibition, etomidate did block LTP in brain slices from mutant mice as well as in those from wild type mice. Etomidate also impaired fear conditioning to context, with no differences between genotypes. In studies of recombinant receptors expressed in HEK293 cells, alpha5beta1gamma2L GABAARs were insensitive to amnestic concentrations of etomidate (1 muM and below), whereas alpha5beta2gamma2L and alpha5beta3gamma2L GABAARs were enhanced. We conclude that etomidate enhances tonic inhibition in pyramidal cells through its action on alpha5beta3-containing GABAA receptors, but blocks LTP and impairs learning by other means - most likely by modulating alpha5beta2-containing GABAA receptors. The critical anesthetic targets underlying amnesia might include other forms of inhibition imposed on pyramidal neurons (e.g. slow phasic inhibition), or inhibitory processes on non-pyramidal cells (e.g. interneurons).",
