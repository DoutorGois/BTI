     "AB": "To understand how memory information is encoded in the hippocampus, we build classification models to decode memory features from hippocampal CA3 and CA1 spatio-temporal patterns of spikes recorded from epilepsy patients performing a memory-dependent delayed match-to-sample task. The classification model consists of a set of B-spline basis functions for extracting memory features from the spike patterns, and a sparse logistic regression classifier for generating binary categorical output of memory features. Results show that classification models can extract significant amount of memory information with respects to types of memory tasks and categories of sample images used in the task, despite the high level of variability in prediction accuracy due to the small sample size. These results support the hypothesis that memories are encoded in the hippocampal activities and have important implication to the development of hippocampal memory prostheses.",
