     "AB": "The results of several studies, employing various tissue preparations, have demonstrated that in vitro Pb exposure has similar effects on the release of several different transmitter substances. Pb has been observed to attenuate depolarization-evoked release and increase spontaneous (depolarization-independent) release. The current study confirms that Pb in vitro increases the spontaneous release of [3H]acetylcholine (ACh) from superfused synaptosomes prepared from rat hippocampus. Additionally, hippocampal synaptosomes, preloaded with 45Ca, were superfused under conditions similar to those used in the [3H]ACh-release studies. Exposure to 1-30 microM Pb produced a concentration-dependent increase in the efflux of 45Ca that was quantitatively and temporally related to the Pb-induced release of [3H]ACh from the hippocampal synaptosomes. Depolarization-evoked [3H]ACh release with high potassium did not produce a corresponding increase in 45Ca efflux. It is concluded that the Pb-induced increase in spontaneous transmitter release is apparently due to either an increase in intraneuronal ionized calcium or the stimulation by Pb of Ca-activated molecules mediating transmitter release.",
