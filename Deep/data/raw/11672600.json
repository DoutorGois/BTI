     "AB": "The role of Orphanin-FQ/nociceptin in synaptic plasticity was assessed by its potency in modulating kindling epileptogenesis in vivo, and feed-forward inhibition in hippocampal recordings in vitro. In addition, a specific rabbit antiserum against this peptide was obtained and the immunohistochemical distribution of nociceptin was determined in rat brain slices. After the establishment of kindling epilepsy, by daily electrical stimulation of the piriform cortex, the i.c.v. injection of nociceptin, 20 min before the kindling stimulation, was not able to block the generation of the generalized seizures, nor to alter their duration. However, the i.c.v. injection of nociceptin, 20 min before each stimulation along the kindling process, depressed its development in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was specific since the nociceptin antagonist [Phe1psi(CH2-NH)Gly2]NC(1-13)NH2, but not the broad-spectrum opiate antagonist, naloxone, was able to completely block nociceptin actions. The inhibitory role of nociceptin was assessed by in vitro recordings from entorhinal cortex-hippocampal slices. By single pulses applied over the Schaffer collaterals, we found that synaptic transmission was facilitated onto CA1, but using a paired-pulse protocol, we found that nociceptin potentiated feed-forward inhibition. The immunohistochemical data show that nociceptin is expressed in limbic cortical regions, including the piriform cortex and the hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that nociceptin exerts a modulatory role in limbic excitability and suggest that it provides an inhibitory control in the development of epilepsy by possibly inhibiting the spread of excitation through the system, by favoring feed-forward inhibition.",
