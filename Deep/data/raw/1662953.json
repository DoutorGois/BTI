     "AB": "Clinical studies suggest that carbamazepine may attenuate effects of alprazolam discontinuation. Since discontinuation of chronic alprazolam in a mouse model is associated with behavioral alterations and upregulation at the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor, we studied the effects of carbamazepine administration after alprazolam (2 mg/kg/day) discontinuation. Open-field activity was increased in mice 4 days after alprazolam discontinuation, but this effect was reduced significantly by continuous infusion of carbamazepine, 25 or 100 mg/kg/day. Benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo was increased in cortex at 2 and 4 days after alprazolam discontinuation, and in hypothalamus at 4 days; with carbamazepine, 100 mg/kg/day, binding in both regions at these time points was similar to control values. Similar results were observed in cortex with benzodiazepine receptor binding in vitro. GABA-dependent chloride uptake was also increased at 4 days alprazolam administration. Treatment with carbamazepine attenuated (P less than 0.10) this increase. Carbamazepine alone after vehicle did not alter benzodiazepine binding or GABA-dependent chloride uptake. These results indicate that carbamazepine administration after alprazolam discontinuation attenuates behavioral and neurochemical alterations associated with discontinuation.",
