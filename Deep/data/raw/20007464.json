     "AB": "Cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells are considered important effector cells contributing to neuronal damage in inflammatory and degenerative CNS disorders. Using time-lapse video microscopy and two-photon imaging in combination with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we here show that major histocompatibility class I (MHC I)-restricted neuronal antigen presentation and T cell receptor specificity determine CD8(+) T-cell locomotion and neuronal damage in culture and hippocampal brain slices. Two separate functional consequences result from a direct cell-cell contact between antigen-presenting neurons and antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. (1) An immediate impairment of electrical signaling in single neurons and neuronal networks occurs as a result of massive shunting of the membrane capacitance after insertion of channel-forming perforin (and probably activation of other transmembrane conductances), which is paralleled by an increase of intracellular Ca(2+) levels (within <10 min). (2) Antigen-dependent neuronal apoptosis may occur independently of perforin and members of the granzyme B cluster (within approximately 1 h), suggesting that extracellular effects can substitute for intracellular delivery of granzymes by perforin. Thus, electrical silencing is an immediate consequence of MHC I-restricted interaction of CD8(+) T cells with neurons. This mechanism is clearly perforin-dependent and precedes, but is not causally linked, to neuronal cell death.",
