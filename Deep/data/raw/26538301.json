     "AB": "AIMS: A hexanucleotide expansion in C9orf72 is the major genetic cause of inherited behavioural variant Frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and motor neurone disease (MND), although the pathological mechanism(s) underlying disease remains uncertain. METHODS: Using antibodies to poly-GA, poly-GP, poly-GR, poly-AP and poly-PR proteins, we examined sections of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, cerebellum and spinal cord, from 20 patients with bvFTD and/or MND bearing an expansion in C9orf72 for aggregated deposits of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPR). RESULTS: Antibodies to poly-GA, poly-GP and poly-GR detected numerous rounded cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI) within granule cells of hippocampal dentate gyrus and those of the cerebellum, as well as 'star-burst' shaped NCI in pyramidal neurones of CA3/4 region of hippocampus. NCI were uncommon in Purkinje cells, and only very rarely seen in anterior horn cells. Poly-PA antibody detected occasional NCI within CA3/4 neurones alone, whereas poly-PR antibody did not identify any NCI but immunostained the nucleus of anterior horn cells, CA3/4 neurones and Purkinje cells, in patients with or without expansion in C9orf72, as well as in normal controls. Poly-GA antibody generally detected more DPR than poly-GP, which in turn was greater than poly-GR. All patients with bvFTD + MND or MND showed plentiful p62/TDP-43 positive inclusions in remaining anterior horn cells. CONCLUSION: Degeneration and loss of anterior horn cells associated with expansions in C9orf72 occurs in the absence of DPR, and implies that changes involving loss of nuclear staining for and a cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 are more likely to be the cause of this.",
