     "AB": "In a total of 25 cattle persistently infected with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) the distribution of viral antigens in the central nervous system was studied. Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (anti pestivirus C16; anti cytophathic BVDV C38; anti cytopathic and non-cytopathic BVDV C42; anti gp53 BVDV CA-1 and CA-3) and the indirect immunoperoxidase technique, BVDV antigen was located exclusively in neurons. Predilection sites for viral persistence were cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Morphological cellular alterations were not seen. Reactive perivascular lymphocytic infiltrations were occasional findings.",
