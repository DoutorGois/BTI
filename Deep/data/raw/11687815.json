     "AB": "Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity triggered by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation is a fundamental property of many glutamatergic synapses and may be critical for the shaping and refinement of the structural and functional properties of neuronal circuits during early postnatal development. Using a combined morphological and electrophysiological approach, we showed that chronic blockade of NMDA receptors in hippocampal slice cultures during the first two weeks of postnatal development leads to a substantial increase in synapse number and results in a more complex dendritic arborization of CA1 pyramidal cells. Thus, the development of excitatory circuitry in the hippocampus is determined by two opposing processes: NMDA receptor-independent synapse formation and NMDA receptor-dependent attenuation of synaptogenesis.",
