     "AB": "In 1953, 27-year-old H.M. underwent bilateral medial temporal lobes resection to control his seizures; however, he suffered from severe amnesia as a result. For the next five decades until his death in December 2008 at the age 82, he was the subject of numerous studies performed by over 100 investigators. The reason why research on H.M. continued for so long is mostly attributed to the efficient organization of excellent researchers. The principal findings of H.M. study encouraged the concept of medial temporal lobe memory system and multiple memory systems, and suggested the slow acquisition of semantic knowledge without medial temporal lobe memory system through repeated experience. By the grace of H.M.'s lifelong contribution, the neuroscience of memory is in full flourish.",
