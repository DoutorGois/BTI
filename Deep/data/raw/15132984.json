     "AB": "The accumulation of misfolded proteins in intracellular inclusions is a generic feature of neurodegenerative disorders. Although heavily ubiquitylated, the aggregated proteins are not degraded by the proteasomes. A possible reason for this phenomenon may be a modification of deposited proteins by transglutaminases forming gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine (GGEL) cross-links between distinct proteins. Here, we show that the frequency of GGEL cross-links is an order of magnitude higher in Alzheimer's brain cortex than in age-matched or younger controls. This difference is due to the accumulation of GGEL cross-links in ubiquitin-immunopositive protein particles present in both Alzheimer's brains and those from aged individuals. The highly cross-linked protein aggregates show immunoreactivity to antibodies against tau and neurofilament proteins, and partially also to alpha-synuclein, indicating that these structures are inherent in Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles and Lewy bodies. Using mass sequence analysis, we identified the same six pairs of peptide sequences cross-linked in both senile and Alzheimer's specimens: Gln31 and Gln190 of HSP27 protein are cross-linked with Lys29 and Lys48 of ubiquitin and HSP27 therefore may cross-link two (poly)ubiquitin chains. One lysine residue of parkin and one of alpha-synuclein were also found to be cross-linked. The data suggest that cross-linking of (poly)ubiquitin moieties via HSP27 may have a role in the stabilization of the intraneuronal protein aggregates by interference with the proteasomal elimination of unfolded proteins.",
