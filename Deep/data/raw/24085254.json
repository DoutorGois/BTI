     "AB": "Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) may occur with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as with normal aging. Prior studies suggest that HS/MTS may be more closely associated with FTLD but have not directly compared the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HS/MTS between neuropathologically confirmed early-onset (age </= 65) cohorts of FTLD and AD. We identified patients with early-onset FTLD (n = 136) and AD (n = 267) from National Alzheimer's Center Consortium databases and compared neuropathological and clinical data between these 2 groups. The FTLD group had a significantly higher prevalence of HS/MTS than that of the AD group. However, HS/MTS was associated with increasing age and memory impairment in the AD group but not in the FTLD group. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that HS/MTS in FTLD occurs as part of the primary pathological process, rather than as a secondary, nonspecific effect of aging on memory and hippocampal function.",
