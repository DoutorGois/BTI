     "AB": "The performance of conditioned responses (CRs) is diminished when trained subjects are tested in a novel context. This study tested the hypothesis that the flow of contextual information along the disynaptic \"ESA\" (entorhinal cortex-ventral subiculum-nucleus accumbens) pathway is responsible for context-related modulation of CRs. Rabbits received electrolytic or sham lesions of the ventral subiculum followed by discriminative avoidance conditioning and counterbalanced extinction sessions in the original training context, a novel context, and the original training context with a novel cue. Neuronal activity was recorded simultaneously in the nucleus accumbens, cingulate cortex, and basolateral amygdala. The lesions did not affect the acquisition of avoidance behavior or prevent the reduction of CRs in response to a novel cue. However, the lesions did reduce CR incidence during extinction, and they did eliminate a further novel-context-induced CR reduction found in controls. In addition, lesions disrupted context-dependent neuronal responses in the nucleus accumbens but not in the cingulate cortex or amygdala. These findings are interpreted as supportive of the hypothesis that the ESA pathway mediates contextual modulation of CRs during extinction.",
