     "AB": "The distribution of GABA fibers within the dentate gyrus was immunohistochemically examined following lesions of the entorhinal cortex in the adult rat. A major change in the pattern of the GAD immunoreactive fibers within the molecular layer, characterized by a marked increase in the density of fibers in the outer molecular layer, was observed. This change in the lamination of the dentate GABA fibers following entorhinal lesions appeared very similar to the changes which occur in acetylcholinesterase staining following entorhinal denervation of the dentate. These results provide morphological support for the sprouting of GABA fibers in the dentate gyrus in response to perforant path destruction.",
