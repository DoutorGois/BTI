     "AB": "Neuronal activity was recorded extracellularly in subiculum of unanaesthetized rabbits during stimulation of the medial septal nucleus and hippocampal field CA1. According to the pattern of the background activity subicular cells were divided into three groups: cells with theta-modulation, cells with delta-modulation and complex spikes, cells with irregular single-spike activity. The theta-cells were specifically related to the septal input: their reactivity to septal stimulation was higher and the latencies of their responses significantly shorter than those of the other groups of cells. Stability of the theta-modulation was increased during and after septal stimulation. Reactivity to CA1 stimulation, as well as latencies of responses were identical for all groups of subicular cells. Rhythmic theta-modulation was damped after CA1 stimulation. The data indicate specific properties of the septal input to the subicular cells with theta-modulation.",
