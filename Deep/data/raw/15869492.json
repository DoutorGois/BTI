     "AB": "The amygdala is thought to enhance long-term memory for emotionally arousing events by modulating memory formation and storage in the hippocampus and in neocortical areas. Recent animal studies have raised the possibility that cooperativity between amygdala and hippocampus contributes to the retrieval of fear memories. The functional contributions of the amygdala to the retrieval of emotional memories in humans are less well known. Here, in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, 20 healthy subjects studied neutral words in the context of a fearful or a neutral human face. In a subsequent test, they made 'remember' (conscious recollection of the study context), 'know' (familiarity in the absence of conscious recollection) and 'new' judgements on the studied and newly presented neutral words, in the absence of face stimuli. At test, bilateral amygdala, hippocampus and fusiform face area (FFA) were more strongly activated during recollection than during familiarity. Higher activity for fearful than for neutral study context was found in bilateral FFA during recollection but not during familiarity. This difference recapitulated higher activity for fearful than for neutral context in the FFA during study. These data suggest that the amygdalae and hippocampi contribute to the retrieval of emotion-laden context memories by coordinating the reactivation of stored representations in neocortical areas, such as the FFA. However, there also was a recapitulation of emotional study context in the right amygdala during familiarity only, which might therefore be related to affective implicit memory.",
