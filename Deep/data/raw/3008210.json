     "AB": "The peripheral BDZ receptor ligand Ro 5-4864 was administered to rabbits in doses ranging from 0.2 to 7 mg/kg IV. Changes in electrocortical activity appeared within 1 min after administration, characterized by trains of slow waves in the posterior sensorimotor and optic cortices (0.6-2 mg/kg) and by grand mal seizures (2-10 mg/kg). The low doses also induced alterations in the basic rhythms both of the hippocampus (reduced amplitude and spike-like waves) and of the nucleus ventralis of thalamus (trains of slow waves), not associated with observable behavioural changes. The paroxysmal EEG activity observed at higher doses of the drug was first recorded in the cortical areas and then spread to the subcortical structures. No change in electrical activity could be observed in the spinal cord. The paroxysmal activity was associated with tonic-clonic convulsions and scialorrea. The EEG and behavioural manifestations were inhibited by administration of Ro 15-1788. This drug at doses of 0.6 and 6 mg/kg antagonized the effects of Ro 5-4864 at doses of 0.6-5 mg/kg and 6-7 mg/kg, respectively. This effect began 1-3 min after administration of the antagonist, and led to EEG synchronization. These data suggest that in rabbits the convulsant effect of Ro 5-4864 is due to interference of the drug at the GABA-BDZ-picrotoxin receptor oligomeric complex. Such an effect seems to be mediated at least in part by central BDZ receptors.",
