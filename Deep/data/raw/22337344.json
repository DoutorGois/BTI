     "AB": "The gene encoding dystrobrevin-binding-protein-1 (dysbindin) is expressed in many areas of the central nervous system and plays a role in intracellular vesicle trafficking, synaptic vesicle trafficking, and neurotransmitter release. At a cellular level, dysbindin is thought to mediate presynaptic glutamatergic transmission. Using Western blotting and immunofluorescence, we investigated dysbindin expression in brain tissues of the patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and rats with TLE (lithium chloride pilocarpine model) to explore its possible role in epileptogenesis. Twenty-five samples of temporal neocortex from patients undergoing surgery for drug-refractory TLE epilepsy and 10 histologically normal temporal lobes tissues from control subjects were used in our study. We also examined dysbindin expression in the hippocampus and adjacent cortex from experimental Sprague-Dawley rats. Dysbindin was expressed in the cytoplasm of neurons from epileptic specimens, and levels of dysbindin proteins were significantly increased in patients with TLE. Dysbindin was also expressed in the neurons of the hippocampus and adjacent cortex from experimental and control rats. Western blotting of rat brain tissue showed that dysbindin was upregulated gradually from 6 h after kindling. Maximal expression was seen around 2 months in chronic epileptic phase. These results demonstrated that the increased expression of dysbindin might play a role in the pathogenesis of drug-refractory TLE.",
