     "AB": "Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) significantly influences cognitive processes. Treatments which raise the level of IL-1beta in the brain impair memory consolidation in contextual fear conditioning. However, the effect of IL-1beta on memory reconsolidation has not yet been established. The melanocortin alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) exerts potent anti-inflammatory actions by antagonizing the effect of proinflammatory cytokines. Five subtypes of melanocortin receptors (MC1R-MC5R) have been identified, of which MC3R and MC4R are predominant in the central nervous system. The present experiments show that the injection of IL-1beta (5 ng/0.25 mul) in dorsal hippocampus up to 30 min after re-exposition to the context decreases freezing during the contextual fear test. Impairment of memory reconsolidation was reversed by treatment with alpha-MSH (0.05 mug/0.25 mul). Administration of the MC4 receptor antagonist HS014 (0.5 mug/0.25 mul) blocked the effect of alpha-MSH. These results suggest that IL-1beta may influence memory reconsolidation and that activation of central MC4R could lead to improve cognitive performance.",
