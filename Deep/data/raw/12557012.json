     "AB": "Mutations within the Abeta sequence of the AbetaPP gene are associated with familial forms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). One mutation, Abeta D23N, was identified in a family in Iowa with a clinical history of early-onset dementia. We analyzed the pattern of Abeta deposition in the hippocampus of an individual with Iowa CAA. In addition to strong amyloid angiopathy, we found unusual diffuse Abeta deposits in the CA4, and in the parenchyma near amyloid-laden vessels. ELISA of cortical brain extracts showed that Abeta40 was nearly 20-fold higher than Abeta42, in both soluble and insoluble fractions. We identified an Abeta antibody that recognized wild-type Abeta but not Iowa Abeta. With this antibody, we found that wild-type Abeta was present in the Abeta deposits, but limited to the strongest deposits in the cerebrovasculature. Previous in vitro studies suggested that the presence of an asparagine at position 23 of Abeta favored formation of an isoAsp residue, which was associated with increased Abeta fibrillogenesis. Using isoAsp-specific antibodies in immunohistochemical studies, we examined the distribution of isoAsp Abeta in the Iowa brain. IsoAsp7 Abeta was present in both the parenchymal and vascular deposits, whereas isoAsp23 Abeta was present only in vascular deposits. These data suggest that alteration of Abeta Asn23 to isoAsp may be an important determinant in the deposition of Abeta in cerebral blood vessels.",
