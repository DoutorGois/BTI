     "AB": "In the present study, we measured the levels of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) protein and mRNA by ELISA and quantitative RT-PCR, and examined TrkC-immunoreactive structures using immunohistochemical method. In the nervous system of the adult monkey, higher levels of NT-3 were found in the hippocampus and cerebellum. During the development of the primary visual cortex, detected amounts of NT-3 protein peaked at embryonic day 140 and then gradually decreased. TrkC imunoreactivity was observed in the neurons in layer VI of the primary visual cortex of an embryonic monkey. These results support the hypothesis that NT-3 is involved in the specification of axon targeting from layer VI to layer IV during the late embryonic stages.",
