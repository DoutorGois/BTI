     "AB": "The hippocampus may be functionally differentiated along its dorsoventral axis. In contrast to the wealth of data available on synaptic plasticity mechanisms in the dorsal hippocampus, little is known about synaptic plasticity processes in the intermediate hippocampus. Behavioral data suggest that this structure may play a distinct role in learning and memory. Here, we compared amplitudes, frequency-dependency and persistency of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in the dorsal (DDG) and intermediate dentate gyrus (IDG). In freely moving rats, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) at 200 Hz (10 burst of 15 stimuli) elicited LTP of similar magnitude in both structures that persisted for over 24 h. The intermediate dentate gyrus is more likely to exhibit persistent LTP than its dorsal counterpart, however: HFS at 200 Hz (3 or 1 burst(s)) or 100 Hz elicited short-term potentiation (STP) in DDG, unlike in the IDG, where LTP could be recorded for at least 4 h. Whereas low frequency stimulation (LFS) at 1 Hz elicited long-lasting LTD (>24 h) in the DDG, it had no significant effect on fEPSP profile in the IDG. LFS at 2 Hz elicited short-term depression in DDG and had no effect in IDG. LTP in both IDG and DDG required activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Paired-pulse and input-output responses differed in IDG and DDG. Our data suggest that afferent input from the entorhinal cortex generates a different response profile in the dorsal vs. intermediate DG, which may in turn relate to their postulated distinct roles in synaptic information processing and memory formation.
