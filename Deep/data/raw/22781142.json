     "AB": "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common type of human epilepsy and has been related with extensive loss of hippocampal pyramidal and dentate hilar neurons and gliosis. Many characteristics of TLE are reproduced in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy in mice. This study analyzed the neuronal damage, assessed with Fluoro-Jade (FJB) and cresyl violet, and gliosis, investigated with glial fibrilary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry, occurring in the hippocampal formation of mice at 3, 6, 12 and 24h, 1 and 3 weeks after the pilocarpine-induced status-epilepticus (SE) onset. The maximum neuronal damage score and the FJB-positive neurons peak were found in the hilus of dentate gyrus 3 and 12 h after SE onset (P<0.05), respectively. At 1 week after SE onset, the greatest neuronal damage score was detected in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer and the greatest numbers of FJB-positive neurons were found both in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers (P<0.05). The molecular, CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cell layers expressed highest presence of GFAP immunoreaction at 1 and 3 weeks after SE onset (P<0.05). Our findings show that, depending on the affected area, neuronal death and gliosis can occur within few hours or weeks after SE onset. Our results corroborate previous studies and characterize short time points of temporal evolution of neuropathological changes after the onset of pilocarpine-induced SE in mice and evidences that additional studies of this temporal evolution may be useful to the comprehension of the cellular mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis.",
