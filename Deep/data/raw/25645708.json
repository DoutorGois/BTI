     "AB": "AIMS: In previous studies, transplantation of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) in epileptic animals has been found to be neuroprotective. However, the mechanism by which the BMMCs act remains unclear. We hypothesize that BMMCs may provide neuroprotection to the epileptic brain through trophic support. To test our hypothesis, we studied the temporal expression of neurotrophins after BMMC transplantation in the epileptic rat hippocampus. METHODS: Chronically epileptic rats were intravenously transplanted with 1 x 10(7) BMMCs isolated from GFP transgenic mice. Expression levels of BDNF, GDNF, NGF, VEGF, and TGF-beta1, and their receptors, were evaluated by ELISA and/or qRT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Our data revealed increased protein expression of BDNF, GDNF, NGF, and VEGF and reduced levels of TGF-beta1 in the hippocampus of transplanted epileptic animals. Additionally, an increase in the mRNA expression of BDNF, GDNF, and VEGF, a reduction in TGF-beta1, and a decrease in mRNA levels of the TrkA and TGFR-beta1 receptors were also observed. CONCLUSION: The gain provided by transplanted BMMCs in the epileptic brain may be related to the ability of these cells in modulating the network of neurotrophins and angiogenic signals.",
