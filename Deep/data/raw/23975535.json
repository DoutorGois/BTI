     "AB": "Exposure to 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) leads to spatial memory impairment and hippocampal cell death. In the present study we have examined the protective effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) on MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. A total of 56 male Sprague Dawley rats (200-250 g) received twice daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg MDMA plus NAC (100 mg/kg). Rectal temperatures were recorded before and after daily treatment. We used a Morris water maze (MWM) to assess spatial learning and memory. At the end of the study rats' brains were removed, cells were counted and the level of Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3 expression in the hippocampi were measured. NAC pretreatment significantly reduced MDMA-induced hyperthermia. In the MWM, NAC significantly attenuated the MDMA-induced increase in distance traveled; however the observed increase in escape latency was not significant. The decrease in time spent in the target quadrant in MDMA animals was significantly attenuated (p < 0.001, all groups). NAC protected against MDMA-induced cell death and the up -regulation of Bax and Caspase-3, in addition to the down-regulation of Bcl-2. This data suggested a possible benefit of NAC in the treatment of neurotoxicity among those who use MDMA.",
