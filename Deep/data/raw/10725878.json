     "AB": "1H spectroscopic imaging of N-acetyl-aspartate, creatine, and choline has proven to be a sensitive indicator for the lateralization of seizure foci in temporal lobe epilepsy. Previous studies have used right-left comparisons to identify the epileptogenic tissue assuming that alterations due to the disease process outweigh the effects of tissue heterogeneity. To evaluate the effectiveness of tissue heterogeneity corrected analyses, we evaluated three criteria for lateralization of the seizure focus: 1) a statistically driven method adjusted for tissue composition, 2) a single valued threshold, and 3) a single global index of the hippocampus. The statistically driven analysis lateralized all eight patients correctly, whereas the single threshold method incorrectly lateralized one case and the global index failed to identify a significant difference in two cases. These findings indicate that increased accuracy and sensitivity can be obtained by correcting for tissue heterogeneity when analyzing spectroscopy studies of temporal lobe epilepsy.",
