     "AB": "Pretraining i.p. administration of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) at doses of 10 and 20mg/kg dose-dependently facilitated performance in a water T-maze learning task in rats. The effect of NMDA was inhibited by the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist CGP37849 [(DL)-E(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid] (CGP) at a dose of 6mg/kg, and by the NMDA receptor complex glycine site antagonist 1-hydroxy-3-amino-2-pyrrolidone (HA-966) at a dose of 10mg/kg. The NMDA site antagonist, when given alone, did not impair learning. The glycine precursor milacemide (2-N-pentylaminoacetamide HCl), at doses of 5 and 10mg/kg accelearted learning acquisition and its effect was antagonized by HA-966. The learning rate was impaired following the administration of NMDA 10mg/kg together with milacemide 5mg/kg when compared with the effect of 10mg/kg NMDA alone.The administration of 5mg/kg NMDA was associated with an elevated tissue concentration of aspartate in the hippocampus, an effect which was antagonized by 6mg/kg of CGP. NMDA at doses of 10 and 20mg/kg elevated the concentration of glycine but decreased the concentration of aspartate, glutamate and glutamine in the cortex and aspartate in the hippocampus. The cortical effects of NMDA 10mg/kg were antagonized by 6mg/kg of CGP. Milacemide at the dose of 10mg/kg elevated glycine, aspartate, glutamate and taurine concentrations. The coadministration of 5 mg/kg NMDA with 5mg/kg milacemide elevated the concentrations of glycine, glutamate and glutamine in the cortex and taurine in the hippocampus. These amino acid levels were higher than after administration of 5mg/kg either agent alone. The results demonstrate a dose-dependent facilitation effect on learning performance by NMDA and glycine receptor agonists. Antagonists at the NMDA and glycine sites counteracted the learning improvement of NMDA, and the glycine site antagonist the effect of milacemide.",
