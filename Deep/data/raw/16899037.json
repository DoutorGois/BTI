     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Once alcohol dependence is established, alcohol-associated cues may induce dopamine release in the reward system, which is accompanied by alcohol craving and may lead to relapse. In cocaine addicts, dopamine release in the thalamus was positively correlated with cocaine craving. We tested the effects of the atypical dopamine D(2/3) blocker amisulpride on cue-induced brain activation in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. METHODS: Alcohol-associated and neutral pictures were presented in a block design to 10 male abstinent alcoholics (1-3 weeks after detoxification) and 10 healthy men during fMRI. The fMRI scans were acquired before and 2 hours after the oral application of 400 mg amisulpride. Before and after each scan, alcohol craving was measured with visual analogue scales. RESULTS: Before the application of amisulpride, alcohol versus control cues elicited a higher blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the left frontal and orbitofrontal lobe, left cingulate gyrus, bilateral parietal lobe, and bilateral hippocampus in alcoholics compared with healthy controls. After amisulpride, alcoholics showed a reduced activation in the right thalamus compared with the first scan. Alcoholics no longer showed significant differences in their cue-elicited BOLD response after amisulpride medication compared with medication-free controls. Self-reported craving was not affected by amisulpride medication. CONCLUSIONS: Amisulpride medication was associated with reduced cue-induced activation of the thalamus, a brain region closely connected with frontostriatal circuits that regulate behavior and may influence relapse risk.",
