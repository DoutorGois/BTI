     "AB": "In whole-cell recordings from cultured rat hippocampal neurons (VH = -60 mV), 1,10-diaminodecane (DA10) and 1,12-diaminododecane (DA12) produced a concentration-dependent block of NMDA-induced current (IC50 = 30 and 7 microM, resp.). In contrast, the diamines failed to affect AMPA and kainate currents. The inhibition of NMDA currents was highly voltage-dependent and was substantially relieved at positive holding potentials. In outside-out patches, DA10 and DA12 produced a voltage-dependent flickery block of NMDA-activated single-channel currents. These results indicate that DA10 and DA12 antagonize NMDA responses via an open channel mechanism. DA10 and DA12 have been proposed to be inverse agonists at the spermine facilitatory site on the NMDA receptor. However, the channel blocking effects of the diamines complicate the interpretation of their actions at this site.",
