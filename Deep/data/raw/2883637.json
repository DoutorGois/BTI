     "AB": "Alprazolam, a new benzodiazepine from triazolobenzodiazepine group, produced anxiolytic action in the conflict test with potency similar to that of diazepam. The myorelaxant activity of the drug was relatively weak. Unlike desipramine, alprazolam failed to reduce the immobility of rats in the forced swim test and was unable to prevent clonidine-induced hypothermia. Alprazolam, unlike desipramine, failed also to potentiate behavioral effect of noradrenaline injected into the hippocampus. Alprazolam after acute but not chronic administration antagonized the synchronizing effect of clonidine on EEG pattern. On the other hand, alprazolam similarly to tricyclic antidepressants, prevented the suppression of dominance behavior by clonidine in rats competing for food. The results indicate that alprazolam acts only weakly upon noradrenergic mechanisms related to depression and to antidepressant action of drugs.",
