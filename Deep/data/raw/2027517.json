     "AB": "Microfluorometry was used to investigate distribution of hypoxia-induced release of glutamate. Mongolian gerbil hippocampal slice was perfused in a medium containing glutamate dehydrogenase and NAD+. Release of glutamate into extracellular space caused an increase in fluorescence due to the formation of NADH. The hypoxia-induced release of glutamate was gradually increased throughout the slice: no significant difference was detected among CA1 region, CA3 region and the dentate gyrus.",
