     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Decreased sensation of urge to defecate is often reported by children with functional constipation (FC) and functional nonretentive fecal incontinence (FNRFI). The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate cerebral activity in response to rectal distension in adolescents with FC and FNRFI compared with healthy controls (HCs). METHODS: We included 15 adolescents with FC, 10 adolescents with FNRFI, and 15 young adult HCs. Rectal barostat was performed prior to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine individual pressure thresholds for urge sensation. Subjects received 2 sessions of 5 x 30 seconds of barostat stimulation during the acquisition of blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signal differences were analyzed using SPM8 in Matlab. KEY RESULTS: Functional constipation and FNRFI patients had higher thresholds for urgency than HCs (P < .001). During rectal distension, FC patients showed activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and putamen. No activations were observed in controls and FNRFI patients. Functional nonretentive fecal incontinence patients showed deactivation in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus (FFG), lingual gyrus, posterior parietal cortex, and precentral gyrus. In HCs, deactivated areas were detected in the hippocampus, amygdala, FFG, insula, thalamus, precuneus, and primary somatosensory cortex. In contrast, no regions with significant deactivation were detected in FC patients. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Children with FC differ from children with FNRFI and HCs with respect to patterns of cerebral activation and deactivation during rectal distension. Functional nonretentive fecal incontinence patients seem to resemble HCs when it comes to brain processing of rectal distension.",
