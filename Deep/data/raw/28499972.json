     "AB": "Diabetes comes with an additional burden of moderate to severe hyperlipidemia, but little is known about the effects of lipid-lowering therapy on diabetic complications such as diabetes-associated cognitive decline. Herein we investigated the effects of statins on memory impairment and neurotoxicity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Our data indicated that oral administration of simvastatin at 10 or 20mg/kg for 4weeks significantly ameliorated diabetes-associated memory impairment reflected by performance better in the Morris water maze and Y-maze tests. The further study showed that these treatments caused significant increase of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma and decrease of NF-kappaB p65 in nucleus of hippocampus and cortex, and ameliorated neuroinflammatory response as evidenced by less Iba-1-positive cells and lower inflammatory mediators including IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha as well as suppressed neuronal apoptosis as indicated by decreased TUNEL-positive cells, increased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and decreased caspase-3 activity in the hippocampus and cortex. Moreover, simvastatin pronouncedly attenuated amyloidogenesis by decreasing amyloid-beta, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-site APP cleaving enzyme-1. As expected, treated with simvastatin, the diabetic mice exhibited significant improvement of hyperlipidemia rather than hyperglycemia. Our findings disclosed novel therapeutic potential of simvastatin for the diabetes-associated cognitive impairment.",
