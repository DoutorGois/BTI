Superfusion of either serotonin or 8-OH-DPAT in the bath was found to inhibit population responses in a dose-dependent manner in both regions, with a greater effect in the CA1. The effects of 8-OH-DPAT in both regions were attenuated significantly by the serotonergic antagonist methysergide, as were the effects of 5-HT on the population spike in the CA1. The application of DOI did not produce statistically significant effects in either region. These findings support an inhibitory role for the 5-HT1A receptor in both area CA1 and the dentate gyrus.",
