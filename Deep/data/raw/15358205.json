     "AB": "We examined the rapid effects of corticosterone (CORT) on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated Ca2+ signals in adult mouse hippocampal slices by using Ca2+ imaging technique. Application of NMDA caused a transient elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration followed by a decay to a plateau within 150s. The 30min preincubation of CORT induced a significant decrease of the peak amplitude of NMDA-induced Ca2+ elevation in the CA1 region. The rapid effect of CORT was induced at a stress-induced level (0.4-10microM). Because the membrane non-permeable bovine serum albumin-conjugated CORT also induced a similar rapid effect, the rapid effect of CORT might be induced via putative surface CORT receptors. In contrast, CORT induced no significant effects on NMDA-induced Ca2+ elevation in the dentate gyrus. In the CA3 region, CORT effects were not evaluated, because the marked elevation of NMDA-induced Ca2+ signals was not observed there.",
