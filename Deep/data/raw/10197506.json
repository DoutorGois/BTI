     "AB": "The ischemic tolerance is known to show protective effects on the neurons and the restricted Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels might be involved. In alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor, ribonucleic acid (RNA) editing of the GluR2 subunit determines receptor desensitization and Ca2+ permeability. The authors investigated the effect of ischemic tolerance on the messenger RNA editing of Q/R and R/G sites of GluR2 subunit in hippocampus. It was found that the rate of RNA editing in Q/R site showed no change (100% edited), whereas that in R/G site decreased significantly (83.3% normal editing level to 60.4%) at day 3 (preconditioning period) and returned to normal level at day 14 (after preconditioning period). Further investigation revealed that the decrease of editing rate in ischemic tolerance resulted mainly from the decrease of editing in CA1 area.",
