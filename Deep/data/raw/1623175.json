     "AB": "Five minutes of global ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil impaired acquisition of a Morris water maze task when testing began 72 h after surgery. In spite of extensive damage to CA1 pyramidal cells, ischemic animals eventually learned to locate a submerged platform and performed normally on a subsequent retention test. Animals that were allowed a more protracted recovery period (21 days) acquired the task as readily as control gerbils. These results suggest that undamaged structures within and external to the hippocampal formation allow spatial learning to proceed at a somewhat reduced rate.",
