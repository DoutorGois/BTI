     "AB": "In vivo fluctuations in gonadal hormones alter hippocampal excitability and modulate both physiological and pathological hippocampal processes. To assess hormonal effects on excitability within a functional hippocampal circuit, extracellular CA1 field responses were compared in slices from intact male, intact female, orchidectomized male, and ovariectomized female rats. Secondly, the effects of in vitro applications of 17-beta estradiol, progesterone, or testosterone on baseline excitability of slices from gonadectomized rats were assessed versus pre-hormone baseline measures. Finally, using the in vitro kindling model of slice epileptogenesis, steroid hormone effects on interictal-like activity were also examined. Significant sex differences in excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude were observed, with slices from males having larger excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes than those from females. Gonadectomy significantly decreased excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude in slices from male rats. Slices from gonadectomized male and female rats also showed a decreased dendritic excitatory postsynaptic potential slope relative to slices from intact male and females rats. In vitro application of testosterone significantly increased excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes in slices from both orchidectomized males and ovariectomized females and the population spike amplitude of slices from ovariectomized females. Following in vitro kindling, slices from intact males showed greater spontaneous burst rates than slices from intact females, further suggesting an excitatory effect of testosterone. These results suggest: (1) a sex difference in the level of baseline excitability between slices from intact males and females as measured by excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes, (2) testosterone has excitatory effects on baseline physiology and kindled hippocampal responses, and (3) slices from males show a greater level of excitability than those from females in the in vitro kindling model.",
