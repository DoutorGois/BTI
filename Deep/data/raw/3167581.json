     "AB": "The relationship between the focus of cobalt seizures in the cerebral cortex and neuron loss in the hippocampus, as well as the CD50 of pentylenetetrazol was examined in rats. Spike activity in EEG frequently appeared 4 days after cobalt application and reached a peak 8-16 days after cobalt application, which was sometimes accompanied by jerks in the limbs. Changes in the CD50 value showed a two-step pattern, i.e., the first decrease in CD50 appeared one day after application of cobalt and continued at the same value until the fourth day. Then a second gradual decrease of CD50 was observed from the fourth day to eighth day and continued at the same value until 20 days after cobalt application. Neuron loss in the CA1 area of the hippocampus was observed as early as two days after cobalt application and the degree of neuron loss progressively increased until the 20th day. These findings suggest that neuron loss in the hippocampus following cobalt-induced seizures is not a result of generalized convulsions.",
