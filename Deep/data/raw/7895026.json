     "AB": "In vitro ischemia (IVI) was simulated with rat hippocampal slices in medium lacking D-glucose, equilibrated with 95% nitrogen, 5% carbon dioxide. Within 5-8 min, synaptic potentials disappeared and a DC negative shift (5-15 mV) occurred. Prolonged application of 95% oxygen and D-glucose 12 min later did not allow synaptic potentials to recover. Slices pretreated with sodium channel blocking drugs allowed synaptic potentials to recover after IVI. Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 100-600 nM), the anticonvulsant phenytoin (5.0 to 100 microM) and the local anesthetic lidocaine (2.0 to 200 microM) each delayed or prevented negative DC shifts from IVI. Histological examination showed that drug treatments also prevented CA1 pyramidal cell damage from IVI. Neuroprotection occurred without blocking synaptic potentials or presynaptic fiber volleys, suggesting relevance for treatment of brain ischemia.",
