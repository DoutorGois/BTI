     "AB": "Brain metabolic activation after 6 Hz electrical stimulation (32 mA, 3s stimulus duration) was assessed by autoradiographic analysis of 14C-2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake. In addition, effects of the new antiepileptic drug lacosamide were examined on the stimulation-induced metabolic activation. The 6 Hz stimulation via corneal electrodes induced a robust increase 2-DG uptake in cerebral cortical regions, lateral amygdala, and the caudate-putamen. Many other brain regions were not affected by the stimulation, including the hippocampal formation, medial nuclei of the amygdala, thalamus, and hypothalamus. Lacosamide (20 mg/kg) injected i.p. 30 min before application of electrical stimulation antagonized completely the seizure-induced brain metabolic activation but did not affect basal 2-DG uptake. The data provide evidence that lacosamide antagonizes the neural activation induced by an electrical seizure stimulus, without suppressing normal brain metabolic activity.",
