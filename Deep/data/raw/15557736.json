     "AB": "In the present study, we investigated the effects of Uncariae Ramulus et Uncus (UR) on learning and memory in the Morris water maze task and the central cholinergic system of rats with excitotoxic medial septum (MS) lesion. In the water maze test, the animals were trained to find a platform in a fixed position during 6 days and then received a 60-s probe trial in which the platform was removed from the pool on the 7th day. Ibotenic lesion of the MS showed impaired performance of the maze test and severe cell losses in the septohippocampal cholinergic system (SHC), as indicated by decreased choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactivity and acetylcholinesterase-reactivity in the hippocampus. Daily administrations of UR (100 mg/kg, i.p.) for 21 consecutive days produced significant reversals of ibotenic acid-induced deficit in learning and memory. These treatments also reduced the loss of cholinergic immunoreactivity in the hippocampus induced by ibotenic acid. These results demonstrated that impairments of spatial learning and memory may be attributable to degeneration of SHC neurons and that UR ameliorated learning and memory deficits partly through neuroprotective effects on the central acetylcholine system. Our studies suggest that UR may be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",
