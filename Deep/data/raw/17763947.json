     "AB": "Glutamatergic activity of hypothalamus and hippocampus of young (3 months) male albino rats having normal diet [protein (20%)-carbohydrate (68%)] was increased with the increase of age. Long-term (60 consecutive days) feeding of low protein (8%)-high carbohydrate (80%) diet (LP-HC) increased glutamatergic activity in these brain regions of young rats and decreased that in aged (18 months). On the contrary, supplementation of high protein (50%)-low carbohydrate (38%) diet (HP-LC) under similar condition decreased glutamatergic activity in those brain regions of young and increased that in aged brain regions. Thus, prolonged exposure of LP-HC diet may damage young brain; whereas, HP-LC diet under similar condition causes excitotoxicity to aged brain. Therefore, considering the present scenario in relation to metabolism and receptor activity of glutamatergic system, it may be suggested that long-term consumption of LP-HC and HP-LC diets modulate the brain regional glutamatergic activity reversibly with age.",
