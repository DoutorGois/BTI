     "AB": "The functional role of the entorhinal cortex pars medialis in memory formation was investigated by lesioning this area with quinolinic acid, a selective agonist of the NMDA-subtype of glutamate receptors which has neurotoxic properties. With this technique \"en passant\" axons are spared and only neurons of the target area are destroyed. The effects of this lesion on learning abilities in the 8-arm maze were tested. Rats in the lesion group showed different exploring behavior: animals did not visit all arms, and previously visited arms were reentered. When orienting themselves on distal cues (allocentric tests) the animals showed working memory (WM) deficits and reduced speed of acquisition of reference memory (RM). When changing arms that were baited, the test group had difficulties learning the new task. Performance decreased after introduction of a delay. However, when orienting themselves on proprioceptive cues (egocentric tests), no deficits in memory formation were detectable. Animals appeared hypomotoric in all tests.",
