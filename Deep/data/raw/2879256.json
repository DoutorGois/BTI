     "AB": "Anxiolytic drugs share many of the common behavioural effects of septal and hippocampal lesions in animals. Gray attributes this to changes which the anxiolytics produce in septal generation of hippocampal rhythmical slow activity. However, lesions of the dorsal ascending noradrenergic bundle reproduce this electrophysiological effect of the anxiolytics while only reproducing part of the behavioural profile of the anxiolytics. The present paper reports what appears to be a second common effect of anxiolytic drugs on the generation of hippocampal slow waves which could underlie their behavioural effects. Freely moving rats, previously implanted with electrodes, received high frequency electrical stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation to elicit hippocampal rhythmic slow activity. The frequency of the slow waves produced increased linearly with increasing stimulation intensity as has been reported previously. A barbiturate (amylobarbitone, 15 mg/kg, i.p.) and three benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, 5 mg/kg; diazepam, 5 mg/kg; alprazolam, 1 mg/kg) all decreased the slope of the voltage-frequency function and decreased overall frequency of slow waves produced. Two antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol, 0.2 mg/kg; chlorpromazine, 2 mg/kg) produced similar behavioural sedation to the anxiolytics but did not decrease either the slope of the voltage-frequency function nor the overall frequency of slow waves. The results show that these barbiturates and benzodiazepines produce a common reduction in the frequency of hippocampal rhythmical slow activity. Given the importance attached to slow waves in current theories of hippocampal function, it is possible that this electrophysiological effect could have some relation to the behavioural effects of these anxiolytic drugs. If the effect can be shown to generalize to other classes of anxiolytic drug it could reflect changes in the substrate for the common effects of anxiolytic drugs on behaviour.",
