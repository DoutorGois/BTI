     "AB": "In focal ischemia, the fate of penumbral cells is closely linked to the infarcted tissue. Because of the release of cytosolic material from damaged cells, the biochemical and ionic alterations within the core are dramatic. Hence, adjacent cells ( infarct rim) are generally exposed to these changes and may be deleteriously affected. To mimic such conditions in vitro, we have employed a slice culture system and used an ischemic solution (IS) that resembles the milieu in the territory of infarct rim. In contrast to normal artificial cerebral spinal fluid, IS is characterized by low O(2), glucose, pH; excitotoxic levels of glutamate; and ionic alterations. In organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, we examined cell injury/death using propidium iodide following exposure to IS. Our data show significant cell injury starting at approximately 8 h following IS exposure with cell injury spreading as a function of exposure duration. We further studied the effect of each component in the IS separately, i.e., acidosis, hypoxia, ionic shifts or glutamate exitotoxicity and were able to isolate the contribution of each of these effectors to the IS-induced cell death. Our results suggest that in IS, acidosis exacerbates the potential for injury while ionic shifts, especially those of K(+) and Na(+), alleviate the potential for cell death.",
