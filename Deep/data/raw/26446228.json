     "AB": "UNLABELLED: The hippocampus (HPC) is known to play an important role in learning, a process dependent on synaptic plasticity; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this are poorly understood. DeltaFosB is a transcription factor that is induced throughout the brain by chronic exposure to drugs, stress, and variety of other stimuli and regulates synaptic plasticity and behavior in other brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens. We show here that DeltaFosB is also induced in HPC CA1 and DG subfields by spatial learning and novel environmental exposure. The goal of the current study was to examine the role of DeltaFosB in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory and the structural plasticity of HPC synapses. Using viral-mediated gene transfer to silence DeltaFosB transcriptional activity by expressing DeltaJunD (a negative modulator of DeltaFosB transcriptional function) or to overexpress DeltaFosB, we demonstrate that HPC DeltaFosB regulates learning and memory. Specifically, DeltaJunD expression in HPC impaired learning and memory on a battery of hippocampal-dependent tasks in mice. Similarly, general DeltaFosB overexpression also impaired learning. DeltaJunD expression in HPC did not affect anxiety or natural reward, but DeltaFosB overexpression induced anxiogenic behaviors, suggesting that DeltaFosB may mediate attentional gating in addition to learning. Finally, we found that overexpression of DeltaFosB increases immature dendritic spines on CA1 pyramidal cells, whereas DeltaJunD reduced the number of immature and mature spine types, indicating that DeltaFosB may exert its behavioral effects through modulation of HPC synaptic function. Together, these results suggest collectively that DeltaFosB plays a significant role in HPC cellular morphology and HPC-dependent learning and memory. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Consolidation of our explicit memories occurs within the hippocampus, and it is in this brain region that the molecular and cellular processes of learning have been most closely studied. We know that connections between hippocampal neurons are formed, eliminated, enhanced, and weakened during learning, and we know that some stages of this process involve alterations in the transcription of specific genes. However, the specific transcription factors involved in this process are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor DeltaFosB is induced in the hippocampus by learning, regulates the shape of hippocampal synapses, and is required for memory formation, opening up a host of new possibilities for hippocampal transcriptional regulation.",
