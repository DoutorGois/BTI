     "AB": "The substantial forward projection from hippocampal area CA1 to the subiculum has been comprehensively described, both anatomically and neurophysiologically. There are few data, however, regarding the existence of a backward projection from the subiculum to area CA1. We present here new electrophysiological evidence for the existence of this projection. We demonstrate a positive-going deflection in the evoked synaptic response in area CA1 following stimulation in dorsal subiculum. We also found a small, but significant, paired-pulse facilitatory effect at a 100-ms interstimulus interval. We were unable to induce long-term potentiation following high-frequency stimulation, but were able to induce short-term potentiation.",
