     "AB": "Several studies have demonstrated the involvement of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNOS) in the neurotoxic effects of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridin (MPTP) and methamphetamine (METH), so the contribution of altered nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme function can be suspected. In this study, about 50% increase in nitric oxide (NO) production in the mouse striatum was found between 4 and 12 h after a single MPTP injection, allowing an increased peroxynitrite (ONOO-) formation in the target brain region. However, METH injection induced a rapid decrease of NO formation both in mouse striatum and hippocampus, reaching its minimum level at 2 h, and restored to the control value after 6 h in the striatum and 12 h in the hippocampus. The uncoupled function of NOS with increased superoxide (O2*-) production after METH injection is suggested.",
