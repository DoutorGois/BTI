     "AB": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deposition of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) and progressive loss of neurons. Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) can proliferate and produce immature neurons even in the brain of AD patients. However, Abeta42 significantly decreased the expression of RhoC in NSPCs during the co-incubation (P < 0.01). Treating with RhoC siRNA prevented membrane from protrusion and led to a significant reduction in cell migration in responses to SDF-1. Compared with wild-type mice, the numbers of RhoC-immunoreactive cells in hippocampus and cortex were significantly down-regulated in APP/PS1 mice aged 9 months. The results suggest that Abeta42 down-regulates the expression of RhoC in NSPCs in vitro and in vivo; down-regulated RhoC expression results in decreased migration of NSPCs.",
