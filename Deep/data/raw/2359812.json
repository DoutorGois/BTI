     "AB": "Progesterone and 5 alpha-pregnane-3,20-dione (5 alpha-DHP) concentrations were measured in seven brain areas and in plasma during \"anesthesia\" induced by progesterone (1-2 mg IV) in female rats. The highest levels of progesterone were detected in the striatum and hypothalamus (23.3 +/- 5.27 and 22.7 +/- 4.30 micrograms/g +/- SEM, respectively); these concentrations were approximately 1000 times higher than those during the post-ovulatory phase. Highest levels of 5 alpha-DHP were detected in the striatum and hippocampus (11.5 +/- 1.74 and 10.4 +/- 3.15 micrograms/g +/- SEM, respectively). The ratio of 5 alpha-DHP to progesterone was approximately 100 times higher in brain tissue than in plasma. We conclude that a conversion of progesterone to 5 alpha-DHP occurs in the brain during the course of progesterone-induced \"anesthesia\". This metabolic step may be an important contributory factor to the anesthetic potency of progesterone.",
