     "AB": "Borderline personality disorder is a disorder with important social and clinical repercussions, which has been treated mainly by psychotherapy. In recent years, the syndromic analysis of this disorder has allowed us to identify different symptoms capable of being improved with psychopharmacology treatment. Thus, its complex symptomatology could be included in four clinical dimensions: impulsive-aggressive, affective instability, cognitive- perceptive and anxiety-inhibition. Antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, or more recently omega-3 fatty acids have shown efficacy in the treatment of symptomatic dimensions of this disease. We have reviewed scientific articles (reviews, clinical trials or clinical guidelines) published over the last ten years and have proposed therapeutic algorithms for psychopharmacology management in these patients.",
