     "AB": "Choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was measured in two brain regions of rat at different times of the day. A diurnal fluctuation of the CAT activity was found in the striatum with a high activity during the light period and a low activity during the dark period. In the hippocampus + cortex the CAT activity remained constant. A marked difference in the brain protein content was found between two strains of Sprague-Dawley rats. This finding emphasizes the importance of expressing enzyme activity both per g tissue and g protein especially when comparing data between different research groups.",
