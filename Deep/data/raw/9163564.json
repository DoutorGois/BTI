     "AB": "The effects of metrifonate were investigated in 4-6- and 22-24-month-old rats. Extracellular acetylcholine levels were measured by transversal microdialysis in vivo. Baseline extracellular acetylcholine levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were 42% and 60% lower, respectively, in old than in young rats. Old rats did not discriminate between familiar and novel objects. In old rats, metrifonate (80 mg/kg p.o.) brought about 85% inhibition of cholinesterase activity in the cortex and hippocampus, a 4-fold increase in extracellular acetylcholine levels in the cortex only, and restored object recognition. In young rats, metrifonate caused 75% cholinesterase inhibition in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, a 2-fold increase in cortical and hippocampal extracellular acetylcholine levels, and no effect on object recognition. The slight cholinesterase inhibition following metrifonate (30 mg/kg) in aged rats had no effect on cortical acetylcholine levels and object recognition. In conclusion, metrifonate may improve the age-associated cholinergic hypofunction and cognitive impairment.",
