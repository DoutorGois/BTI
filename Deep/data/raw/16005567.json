     "AB": "The abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in brain is attributed to a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. It has been reported that cold water stress (CWS) could cause rapid reversible tau phosphorylation in brain. To explore the possible long-tem effects of CWS on tau phosphorylation, we employed the immunoblot and immunohistochemical methods to analyze the phosphorylation of tau in the hippocampus of mice subjected to CWS. Results showed that CWS stimulation caused not only an early phase reversible tau phosphorylation, but also a later phase tau phosphorylation after 6h. The distribution pattern of phosphorylated tau (P-tau) in the later phase was different to that of early phase. At 1h after CWS, defined as early phase, P-tau was strikingly located in the mossy fibers and nerve terminals at the molecular layer of dentate gray (DG), whereas at 12h, defined as later phase, P-tau was dominantly located in the somatodendritic compartments of neurons in DG and CA3/CA1 regions, but obviously decreased in the mossy fibers and nerve terminals of molecular layer. These findings demonstrate that CWS leads to prominent changes of tau phosphorylation and P-tau localization in the hippocampus in a time dependent manner.",
