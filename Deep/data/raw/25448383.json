     "AB": "BACKGROUND: A central problem in neuroscience is elucidating synaptic connections, the connectome. Because mammalian forebrains contain many neurons, labeling specific neurons with unique tags is desirable. A novel technology, Brainbow, creates hundreds of hues by combinatorial expression of multiple fluorescent proteins (FPs). NEW METHOD: We labeled small numbers of neurons, and their axons, with unique hues, by expressing Brainbow from a helper virus-free Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1) vector. RESULTS: The vector expresses a Brainbow cassette containing four FPs from a glutamatergic-specific promoter. Packaging HSV-Brainbow produced arrays of seven to eight Brainbow cassettes, and using Cre, each FP gene was in a position to be expressed, in different cassettes. Delivery into rat postrhinal (POR) cortex or hippocampus labeled small numbers of neurons with different, often unique, hues. An area innervated by POR cortex, perirhinal (PER) cortex, contained axons with different hues. Specific axons in PER cortex were matched to specific cell bodies in POR cortex, using hue. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: HSV-Brainbow is the only technology for labeling small numbers of neurons with unique hues. In Brainbow mice, many neurons contain the same hue. Brainbow-adeno-associated virus vectors require transduction of the same neuron with multiple vector particles, confounding neuroanatomical studies. Replication-competent Brainbow-pseudorabies virus vectors label multiple neurons with the same hue. CONCLUSIONS: Attractive properties of HSV-Brainbow include each vector particle contains multiple cassettes, representing numerous hues, recombination products are stabile, and experimental control of the number of labeled neurons. Labeling neurons with unique hues will benefit mapping forebrain circuits.",
