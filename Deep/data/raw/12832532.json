     "AB": "Although the accumulation of the neurotoxic peptide beta amyloid (betaA) in the CNS is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, the mechanism of betaA neurotoxicity remains controversial. In cultures of mixed neurons and astrocytes, we found that both the full-length peptide betaA (1-42) and the neurotoxic fragment (25-35) caused sporadic cytoplasmic calcium [intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]c)] signals in astrocytes that continued for hours, whereas adjacent neurons were completely unaffected. Nevertheless, after 24 hr, although astrocyte cell death was marginally increased, approximately 50% of the neurons had died. The [Ca2+]c signal was entirely dependent on Ca2+ influx and was blocked by zinc and by clioquinol, a heavy-metal chelator that is neuroprotective in models of Alzheimer's disease. Neuronal death was associated with Ca2+-dependent glutathione depletion in both astrocytes and neurons. Thus, astrocytes appear to be the primary target of betaA, whereas the neurotoxicity reflects the neuronal dependence on astrocytes for antioxidant support.",
