     "AB": "The permeability-surface area product (PS) of [1-14C]arachidonate at the blood-retina and blood-brain barrier was determined by short carotid perfusion in young Wistar rats 1 or 6 h after recovery period following complete cerebral ischemia induced by temporary cardiac arrest. For the retina and structures of visual system, hypothalamus and olfactory bulb there was no significant difference over sham-operated rats among mean PSs. For cortex, hippocampus and striatum, significant increases were found at both time intervals of recovery after cardiac arrest. The ischemia-reperfusion model was characterized by a significant increase in tissue conjugated diene in the hippocampus and microsomal lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase activity in the cortex. Consistent with these findings, we also show ultrastructural evidence mainly represented by partial opening of interendothelial junctions and mild signs of tissue edema in surrounding neuropil, suggesting barrier leakiness predominantly in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum but almost absent in the retina microvessels. Our results indicate that ischemia-reperfusion does affect influex through blood-brain barrier into regional structures of rat central nervous system of arachidonate, a metabolic substrate and lipid mediator rapidly incorporated into microcapillary and brain lipids. The data also suggested that: (i) reactive oxyradicals were moderately generated during the early phase of ischemic-reperfusion process in the rat; (ii) after reperfusion, in vitro susceptibility of different brain regions to iron-induced peroxidation was highest in the hippocampus and lowest in the cortex and striatum; (iii) membrane phospholipid repair mechanisms were activated at the same time.",
