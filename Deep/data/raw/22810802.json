     "AB": "In the present study, we investigated whether sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) modifies Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity, mRNA expression, and cerebral edema in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rats and if antioxidant (ATX) treatment prevented the alterations induced by sepsis. Rats were subjected to CLP and were divided into three groups: sham; CLP-rats were subjected to CLP without any further treatment; and ATX-CLP plus administration of N-acetylcysteine plus deferoxamine. Several times (6, 12, and 24) after CLP or sham operation, the rats were killed and hippocampus and cerebral cortex were isolated. Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity was inhibited in the hippocampus 24 h after sepsis, and ATX treatment was not able to prevent this inhibition. The Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity also was inhibited in cerebral cortex 6, 12, and 24 h after sepsis. No differences on Na(+), K(+)-ATPase catalytic subunit mRNA levels were found in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex after sepsis. ATX treatment prevents Na(+), K(+)-ATPase inhibition only in the cerebral cortex. Na(+), K(+)-ATPase inhibition was not associated to increase brain water content. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that sepsis induced by CLP inhibits Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity in a mechanism dependent on oxidative stress, but this is not associated to increase brain water content.",
