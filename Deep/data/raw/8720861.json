     "AB": "Several previous studies have raised the possibility of sex differences in the distribution of corticosteroid receptors in the brain. The direction and magnitude of these differences have, however, remained controversial. In the present study, we have re-examined the concentrations of mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors in the brains of male and female rats at varying times (1 to 6 days) after combined gonadectomy (GDX) and adrenalectomy (ADX). Cytosol binding assays confirmed the presence of higher MR levels in short-term (3-day) GDX-ADX males. This difference disappeared by 6 days after surgery, as receptor levels in females rose to be equivalent to those in males. Using an improved in vitro autoradiographic method, the distribution of MR and GR was studied in males and females 3 days after GDX-ADX. The distribution of MR and GR in the brains of these rats was similar in the two sexes. MR binding in the male, however, was significantly greater than that in the female throughout the principal cell fields of the hippocampus. Measurements of circulating corticosterone levels at the time of GDX-ADX suggest that this sex difference may reflect a more rapid recovery of the MR system in males than in females following the stress-induced rise in corticosterone secretion occurring at the time of surgery.",
