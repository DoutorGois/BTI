     "AB": "ZPK is a recently identified human putative protein kinase gene that encodes an unusual serine/threonine kinase containing two potential leucine zipper motifs similar to those found in transcription factors as well as in members of the newly discovered mixed-lineage family of protein kinases. To study the normal biological function of ZPK, we have isolated a mouse ZPK cDNA and examined the pattern of ZPK mRNA expression in adult mouse tissues by Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses. The predicted open reading frame of this cDNA encodes an 888-amino-acid protein that shares 95% overall identity with its human counterpart. By Northern blot analysis, we detected expression of ZPK mRNA in the brain of adult mice, but not in any other tissue tested. In situ hybridization analysis of mouse brain sections revealed specific association of ZPK mRNA with neuronal cell populations, primarily in the hippocampus, the cerebral cortex, and the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum. Interestingly, a remarkable pattern of cell-type-specific expression was also found in the epithelial compartment of various organ systems, including stomach, small intestine, liver, and pancreas, as well as in the seminiferous tubules of mature testes. Taken together, these observations suggest that ZPK could play a role in development, function, and maintenance of a variety of specialized cells.",
