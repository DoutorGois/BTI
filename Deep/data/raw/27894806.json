     "AB": "Genetic factors that influence the transition from initial drinking to dependence remain enigmatic. Recent studies have leveraged chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) paradigms to measure changes in brain gene expression in a single strain at 0, 8, 72 h, and even 7 days following CIE. We extend these findings using LCM RNA-seq to profile expression in 11 brain regions in two inbred strains - C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) - 72 h following multiple cycles of ethanol self-administration and CIE. Linear models identified differential expression based on treatment, region, strain, or interactions with treatment. Nearly 40% of genes showed a robust effect (FDR < 0.01) of region, and hippocampus CA1, cortex, bed nucleus stria terminalis, and nucleus accumbens core had the highest number of differentially expressed genes after treatment. Another 8% of differentially expressed genes demonstrated a robust effect of strain. As expected, based on similar studies in B6, treatment had a much smaller impact on expression; only 72 genes (p < 0.01) are modulated by treatment (independent of region or strain). Strikingly, many more genes (415) show a strain-specific and largely opposite response to treatment and are enriched in processes related to RNA metabolism, transcription factor activity, and mitochondrial function. Over 3 times as many changes in gene expression were detected in D2 compared to B6, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) module comparison identified more modules enriched for treatment effects in D2. Substantial strain differences exist in the temporal pattern of transcriptional neuroadaptation to CIE, and these may drive individual differences in risk of addiction following excessive alcohol consumption.",
