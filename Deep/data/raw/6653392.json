The CuZn SOD activities were slightly lower and the Mn SOD activities were slightly higher in the brain pieces from chronic alcoholics compared to the controls. The slight differences found can hardly be assigned etiological importance in the degenerative processes in brain tissue connected with chronic alcoholism.",
