     "AB": "The release of exogenous histamine was studied by superfusing brain slices following incubation with the radiolabeled amine. Histamine was released in a calcium-dependent way by 40 mM potassium. This release was high in hypothalamus and striatum and low in hippocampus and cortex. Compound 48/80, a mast cell histamine releasing agent, also induced histamine release, but only from hypothalamic tissue slices. It is suggested that the potassium-induced release of accumulated exogenous histamine is mainly from glial cells.",
