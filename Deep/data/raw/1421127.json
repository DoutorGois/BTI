     "AB": "Age related changes in A1 adenosine receptor binding were investigated in mouse brain using the selective agonist, [3H]-cyclohexyladenosine ([3H]CHA). In the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of aged mice (28 months old), a significant decrease of about 44%, 50% and 12%, respectively, in [3H]CHA binding compared to young animals (3 months old) was observed. According to the Scatchard analysis of the binding data in the cortex, this decrease was due to a receptor density reduction and not to a Kd change. Since the weight and protein content of each tissue tested did not differ significantly between the old and the young animals, our findings may be partly explained by specific reductions of A1 receptors rather than a general cell degeneration in old age.",
