     "AB": "The antibiotic, puromycin, caused loss of memory of avoidance discrimination learning in mice when injected intracerebrally. Bilateral injections of puromycin involving the hippocampi and adjacent temporal cortices caused loss of short-term memory; consistent loss of longer-term memory required injections involving, in addition, most of the remaining cortices. Spread of the effective memory trace from the temporal-hippocampal areas to wide areas of the cortices appears to require 3 to 6 days, depending upon the individual animal. Recent reversal learning was lost while longer-term initial learning was retained after bilateral injections into the hippocampal-temporal areas.",
