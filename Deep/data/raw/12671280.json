     "AB": "To examine the regeneration capacity of dorsal septohippocampal neurons in the presence of an artificial growth-promoting substrate, biocompatible polymeric hydrogels were implanted between the septum and the hippocampus in a fimbria-fornix lesion cavity. Unmodified (control) or aminosugar-containing (glucosamines or N-acetyl-glucosamines) hydrogels were implanted immediately or ten days after the lesions. Six months later, brain sections were processed for cresyl-violet, acetylcholinesterase, and immunocytochemical (glial fibrillary acidic protein, protein S100, neurofilaments, laminin, fibronectin) staining. All hydrogels were well integrated in the brain, constituting a stable bridge between the septum and the hippocampus. Weak gliosis occasionally surrounded the hydrogel in rats from the immediate-implantation group, whereas a more pronounced gliosis was observed in those from the delayed-implantation group. The hydrogels contained blood vessels and were invaded by host cells including astrocytes. Astrocytes formed a loose tissue network filling the porous structure of the hydrogels. Within the hydrogels, laminin-, fibronectin- or neurofilaments-immunopositive networks were also observed. Moreover, numerous acetylcholinesterase-positive fibers penetrated into the hydrogels from the septal, cortical and striatal areas. Fibre penetration was most important in the N-acetylglucosamines-containing hydrogels. Despite these features, the hippocampus failed to show any increase of acetylcholinesterase-staining as compared to that seen in lesion-only rats. These results confirm the regeneration capacity of severed septohippocampal neurons into polymeric substrates used as a bridge inserted in a fimbria-fornix lesion cavity. As such, biomaterials might be of clinical interest not only in the case of spinal cord sections, but also in cases of brain trauma.",
