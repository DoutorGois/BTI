     "AB": "In order to explore the relationship between response to muscarinic agonists and brain muscarinic receptors, two mouse strains that differ in acute sensitivity (DBA and C3H) were injected chronically with DFP or infused with oxotremorine. Chronic DFP-treated DBA mice were not tolerant to DFP's effects on any measure, but they were cross-tolerant to the effects of oxotremorine on heart rate and body temperature. DFP-treated C3H mice were not tolerant to DFP or cross-tolerant to oxotremorine on any measure. Oxotremorine infusion resulted in tolerance to oxotremorine in both mouse strains, and chronically infused DBA mice were cross-tolerant to DFP on five of the six measures. Oxotremorine-infused C3H mice were cross-tolerant to DFP on two of the measures. These results suggest that genetic factors influence the development of tolerance or cross-tolerance. These genetic factors do not seem to be related to changes in brain QNB binding. Both mouse strains showed comparable changes in QNB binding following chronic DFP and oxotremorine with DFP eliciting reductions in QNB binding in striatum and hippocampus and oxotremorine eliciting reductions in nearly every brain region. However, tolerance and cross-tolerance did not seem to correlate with changes in binding which suggests that the relationship between receptor changes and responses to muscarinic agonists must be examined further.",
