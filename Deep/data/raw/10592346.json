     "AB": "Hypoxia preconditioning states that a sublethal hypoxia episode will afford neuroprotection against a second challenge in the near future. We describe and discuss a procedure for the development of global hypoxia preconditioning in adult male Wistar rats, using a mildly hypoxic (9% O(2), 91% N(2)) atmospheric exposure of 8 h. The persistence of neuroprotection was analyzed using a kainic acid (KA) model of brain injury. Rats were challenged with KA (14 mg/kg, i.p.) on 1-14 days post-hypoxia. The effects of hypoxia preconditioning on seizure score, weight loss, brain edema and histopathology were assessed. Brain edema, predominantly of vasogenic origin, was measured 24 h after KA administration using a reproducible and quantitative method based on the specific gravities of tissue samples. A density gradient column (1.0250-1.0650 g/cm(3)) comprised of kerosene and bromobenzene was used to assess the presence of edema in regions involved in seizure initiation and propagation that are normally extensively damaged (i.e., piriform cortex and hippocampus). Specific gravities of tissues were calculated through extrapolation with known NaCl standards. We found that hypoxia preconditioning prevented the formation of edema in these brain regions when KA challenge was given 1, 3, and 7, but not 14 days post-hypoxia exposure. Furthermore, neuroprotection was observed in animals that had robust seizures. The described procedure may be used to examine the neuroprotective mechanisms induced by global hypoxia preconditioning against many subsequent challenges reflecting a variety of experimental models of brain injury, and will provide a better understanding of the brain response to hypoxia and stress.",
