     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the curative effect of neural stem cells (NSCs), which are used in tissue-engineered artificial nerve, on repairing rabbit 10-mm facial nerve defects. METHODS: Thirty-six Oryctolagus cuniculi were randomly divided into three groups (each group with 12 Oryctolagus cuniculi). In group A, chitosan conduit, collagen protein sponge, nerve growth factor (NGF), and NSCs were used. In group B, chitosan conduit, collagen sponge, and NGF were used. In group C, nerve autograft was performed. Electrophysiologic detection, histologic observation, and BrdU and S100 immunohistochemical examination were performed 12 weeks after operation. RESULTS: All observation items in group A were better than those in group B (P < 0.01), and there were no significant differences between group A and group C (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: NSCs may be served as seed cells of peripheral nerve tissue engineering and be used in artificial nerve to repair facial nerve defects.",
