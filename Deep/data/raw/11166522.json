     "AB": "The use of neonatal ventral hippocampal nVH lesioned rats is well established in animal models of schizophrenia. Moreover, the dysfunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) neurotransmission may play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. To examine the effect of glycine (GLY) in this animal model, we compared the effects of GLY (0.8 and 1.6 g/kg, IP) on locomotor activity induced by a novel environment (NOVEL) and methamphetamine (MAP, 1.5 mg/kg, IP) in lesioned and sham-operated rats. Compared with sham rats, GLY significantly reduced NOVEL- and MAP-induced locomotor activity in lesioned rats (p <.001 and p <.05, respectively). It is suggested that GLY attenuated nVH-induced hyperactivity, and that this effect was evident both in the presence and absence of MAP. The nVH lesions may result in a form of hyperactivity that differs from normal locomotion in the degree to which it is highly sensitive to regulation by GLY.",
