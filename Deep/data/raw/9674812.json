     "AB": "Two patients with the Kennedy's disease (KD) mutation have been identified in the Newcastle Brain Tissue Bank. One of these patients had presenile dementia as a prominent clinical feature, previously undescribed in KD. The pathologic substrate underlying the cognitive changes in this patient included neuronal depletion and gliosis in the hippocampus and subcortical gliosis in the prefrontal region. Immunostaining for macrophage markers showed evidence for subtle corticospinal tract pathology in both cases. In contrast to the molecular pathologic features found in ALS, surviving motor neurons in the two KD cases showed no evidence of ubiquitinated inclusions or alterations in neurofilament phosphorylation.",
