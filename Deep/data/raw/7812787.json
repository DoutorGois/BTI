     "AB": "Multiple lines of evidence indicate dopamine is a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the cerebellum and hippocampus. In this study, we explored the utility of 3-methoxytyramine as an index of dopamine release in these regions. We found that: (1) cerebellar and hippocampal 3-methoxytyramine levels can be measured by combined gas chromatography-mass fragmentography with negative chemical ionization; (2) basal 3-methoxytyramine accumulation rates following monoamine oxidase inhibition, but not the steady-state tissue levels, are several times lower in these regions than in the frontal cortex; (3) accumulation of 3-methoxytyramine in the hippocampus and cerebellum can be enhanced following electroconvulsive shock, but not acute haloperidol (0.4 mg/kg) treatment. We conclude that 3-methoxytyramine accumulation may be a useful index of dopamine release in the cerebellum and hippocampus, but dopamine release is regulated differently in these regions than in the frontal cortex and striatum.",
