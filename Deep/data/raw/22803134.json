It was shown that prenatal stress reduces the numerical density of neurons in hippocampal CA3 field in 24-day-old and adult (3 months) low excitable animals and chromocenter area in cells of developing hippocampus in embryos of both strains. The difference in chromocenter areas in offspring of stressed females was retained on postnatal day 24.",
