     "AB": "The aim of this study was to investigate if p-chloroamphetamine (PCA), which is neurotoxic to serotonin (5-HT) nerve terminals, was able to induce, like 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, a region-specific regulation of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression. The effect of PCA on the expression of 5-HT7 receptors, which share some pharmacological properties with 5-HT1A receptors, was comparatively studied. PCA (2 x 5 mg/kg) produced a lasting depletion of 5-HT content in the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus. In the hippocampus, the maximal 5-HT depletion was found on day 21 (-70%), whereas in the cortex, the highest 5-HT depletion was found on day 14 (-73%), with a partial but significant recovery on day 21. At the latter time point, 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression was increased by 80% in the cortex and decreased by 50% in the hippocampus. The 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression was also enhanced after exposure to PCA of rat cortical but not of hippocampal primary cultures. In regard to 5-HT7 receptor mRNA expression, the most remarkable change after PCA was the great increase (+200%) in the brain-stem. Binding studies to 5-HT1A receptors matched the changes in receptor mRNA expression. Gel shift assays revealed enhanced nuclear protein binding to the KB sequence with use of cortical but not hippocampal extracts of PCA-treated rats. Overall, the data show region-specific changes in 5-HT receptor-type expression that may not be entirely dependent on the neurotoxic effect of PCA on 5-HT terminals.",
