     "AB": "Estradiol is synthesized in the hippocampus and is known to increase intrinsic hippocampal excitability and capacity for synaptic plasticity. A picture emerges that at least part of these effects are due to a complex modulation of GABAergic system in developing and adult hippocampus. During development, GABAergic system undergoes profound alterations and is particularly prone to modulation. During this period, estradiol could modulate both phasic and tonic GABAergic currents and promote excitatory GABA actions. In contrast, in adult hippocampus, estradiol-induced formation of new dendritic spines in pyramidal cells is paralleled with a reduction in GABAergic drive to these neurons. Such estradiol actions could be mediated primarily through interneurons expressing estrogen receptors. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the in vitro and in vivo studies addressing the role of estradiol in regulating the GABAergic system in the hippocampal formation during development and in the adulthood. Although the mechanisms underlying such a regulation remain largely unknown, we make an attempt to present the major hypotheses and concepts related to this issue.",
