     "AB": "Treatment of male rats at birth with an aromatase inhibitor (Letrazole), followed by adult gonadectomy GDX, led to an increase in dendritic spine density on ventromedial hypothalamic neurons (VMN) when treated with estrogen as compared to a decrease when vehicle animals were given estrogen. In contrast, estrogen-treatment increased dendritic spine density on CA1 pyramidal neurons regardless of neonatal treatment. In addition, in CA1 there was a significant difference between the two estrogen groups. These results suggest that estrogen induction of dendritic spines in the VMN and CA1 is dependent on organizational effects of gonadal steroids.",
