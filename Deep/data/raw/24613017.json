     "AB": "Abnormal intrinsic functional connectivity, measured by resting-state functional MRI, has been reported in major depressive disorder (MDD). Our study is the first to demonstrate hypo- and hyperconnectivity between the hippocampus and cortical, subcortical regions in a genetic animal model of depression, similar to connectivity anomalies found in MDD.",
