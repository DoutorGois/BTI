     "AB": "OBJECTIVES: Xiaochaihutang (XCHT) has antidepressant effects in multiple animal models of depression in our previous studies. But the antidepressant effects and exact mechanisms of XCHT in a rat model of chronic social isolation stress (CSIS) have never been studied. We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of XCHT on depressive/anxiety-related behaviours of CSIS-exposed rats and understand the neurological mechanism involving neurogenesis. METHODS: We established the CSIS model and then investigated the effects of XCHT on behavioural change. HPLC-MS/MS was adopted to quantify neurotransmitter levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immunofluorescence technology was used to study the effects of XCHT on neurogenesis; while expressions of 5-HT1A receptor signalling pathway in the hippocampus were measured using Western blotting. KEY FINDINGS: Xiaochaihutang significantly alleviated depressive/anxiety-like behaviours of CSIS-exposed rats. XCHT significantly regulated levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the CSF without affecting Glu, GABA and ACh. XCHT also significantly increased neurogenesis in CSIS-exposed rats. Additionally, XCHT reversed CSIS-induced decrease of 5-HT1A receptor expression and promoted the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that XCHT could significantly regulate the depressive/anxiety-like behaviours induced by CSIS, which are likely attributed to the promotion of hippocampal neurogenesis and neurotrophin expressions through the activation of serotonergic system.",
