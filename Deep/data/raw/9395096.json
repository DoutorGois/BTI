     "AB": "We have cloned and sequenced the cDNA of the human brain ryanodine receptor (RyR3), which is composed of 4866 amino acids and shares characteristic structural features with the rabbit RyR3. Northern blot analysis shows that the human RyR3 mRNA is abundantly expressed in hippocampus, caudate nucleus and amygdala as well as in skeletal muscle. The human RyR3 mRNA is also detected in several cell lines derived from human brain tumors. Functional expression of RyR3 and a chimeric RyR suggests that RyR3 forms a calcium-release channel with a very low Ca2+ sensitivity.",
