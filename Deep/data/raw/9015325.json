     "PG": "397-409",
     "AB": "Recent data suggest that gp120, a human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) coat glycoprotein that is secreted by HIV-infected cells, is neurotoxic, and that this toxicity is mediated, at least in part, by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate-type excitatory amino acid receptors. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we examined the neurotoxicity of gp120 injected intrahippocampally, alone or co-injected with the selective excitatory amino acid agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate, in seven-day-old rats. Severity of injury in the lesioned hippocampus was assessed five days later, using three outcome measures: histopathology, hippocampal atrophy (derived from regional cross-sectional area measurements) and loss of [3H]glutamate receptor binding (based on in vitro autoradiography assays). To confirm that any observed effects were attributable to gp120 bioactivity, each group of experiments included controls that received equal amounts of heat-treated gp120. Gp120 (200 ng) elicited minimal focal pyramidal cell loss immediately adjacent to the injection track; there was no hippocampal atrophy or loss of [3H]glutamate binding. Co-injection of 50 ng gp120 with N-methyl-D-aspartate (5 nmol, threshold excitotoxic dose) increased the severity of hippocampal injury; hippocampal atrophy was greater in animals that received injections of 5 nmol N-methyl-D-aspartate in combination with 50 ng gp120 than in those that received either N-methyl-D-aspartate alone (5 nmol) or 5 nmol N-methyl-D-aspartate+50 ng heat-treated gp120 (mean+/-S.E.M. percentage reduction in injected hippocampal volume vs contralateral: N-methyl-D-aspartate, -19+/-3; N-methyl-D-aspartate+gp120, -26.8+/-2.1; N-methyl-D-aspartate+heat-treated gp120, -14.0+/-2.2; P<0.001, ANOVA). Treatment with the competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist 3-((RS)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (20mg/kg) markedly reduced the severity of injury elicited by the combination of gp120 with N-methyl-D-aspartate. These data support the hypothesis that locally secreted gp120 could exert neurotoxic effects, mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation, in vivo in the immature brain.",
