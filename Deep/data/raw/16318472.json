     "AB": "Although stroke is characterized by both a loss of mental and sensorimotor abilities, rehabilitation is particularly aimed at recovery from physical disabilities. In the case study reported in this article, it was hypothesized that a 30-min-a-day treatment with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) might improve memory and affective behavior in a stroke patient. The hypothesis was derived from animal experimental studies in which peripheral stimulation resulted in activation of the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Although treatment could be started only 6 months after onset, the results suggest that TENS has a beneficial influence on visual short-term memory, verbal long-term memory, and verbal fluency. Moreover, [he patient's independent and social functioning in daily life improved. The conflicting effects of TENS on the patient's affective behavior are discussed.",
