     "AB": "Anterogradely labeled projections from the medial septum to hippocampal somatostatin immunoreactive (SOM-i) neurons were studied with double-label immunocytochemistry under light (LM) and electron microscopic (EM) conditions. Medial septal projections were identified after injecting the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) followed by immunohistochemical visualization of PHA-L presynaptic terminal labeling and concurrent immunocytochemical staining of SOM in hippocampal target cell bodies. This double-label procedure yielded blue-black nickel enhanced DAB stained, PHA-L-immunoreactive terminals on light brown SOM-i neurons that were investigated by correlative LM and EM observations. PHA-L-labeled terminal contacts with often basket-like appearance were localized with highest densities on soma and proximal dendrites of SOM-i neurons in stratum oriens of Ammon's horn and hilus of dentate gyrus, and some minor projections to stratum pyramidale and radiatum. Most double-labeled contacts could be identified as symmetric type synapses equally divided over soma and proximal dendrites of several forms of SOM-i neurons. These data indicate monosynaptic regulation of the hippocampal intrinsic SOM system by septal input, which probably represents a peptidergic subpopulation of the hippocampal GABAergic system.",
