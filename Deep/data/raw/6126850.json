     "AB": "The irreversible labeling by [3H]flunitrazepam of three proteins with apparent molecular weights of 51,000 (P51), 55,000 (P55) and 59,000 (P59) was investigated using hippocampal membranes isolated from rats at various timepoints after birth. The present results indicate that [3H]flunitrazepam predominantly labels P55 and P59 in the early days after birth whereas labeling of P51 starts to increase significantly in the second postnatal week. A possible association of P55 and P59 with type 2 and of P51 with type 1 benzodiazepine receptors is suggested.",
