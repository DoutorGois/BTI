     "AB": "In animal experiments, hippocampal neurogenesis and the activity of thiamine-dependent transketolase decrease markedly under conditions of thiamine deficiency. To further investigate the effect of thiamine deficiency on the proliferation of hippocampal progenitor cells (HPCs) and the potential mechanisms involved in this effect, we cultured HPCs in vitro in the absence of thiamine and found that proliferation and transketolase activity were both significantly repressed. Furthermore, specific inhibition of transketolase activity by oxythiamine strongly inhibited HPC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. However, thiamine deficiency itself inhibited the proliferation to a greater degree than did oxythiamine. Taken together, our results suggest that modulation of transketolase activity might be one of the mechanisms by which thiamine regulates the proliferation of hippocampal progenitor cells.",
