     "AB": "Angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7 promote robust enhancing effects on learning and memory. These peptides are also competitive inhibitors of the insulin-regulated membrane aminopeptidase, suggesting that the biological actions of these peptides may result from inhibition of IRAP activity. However, the normal function of IRAP in the brain is yet to be determined. The present study investigated the sub-cellular distribution of IRAP in four neuronal cell lines and in the mouse brain. Using sub-cellular fractionation, IRAP was found to be enriched in low density microsomes, while lower levels of IRAP were also present in high density microsomes, plasma membrane and mitochondrial fractions. Dual-label immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of IRAP in vesicles co-localized with the vesicular maker VAMP2, in the trans Golgi network co-localized with TGN 38 and in endosomes co-localized with EEA1. Finally using electron microscopy, IRAP specific immunoreactivity was predominantly associated with large 100-200 nm vesicles in hippocampal neurons. The location, appearance and size of these vesicles are consistent with neurosecretory vesicles. IRAP precipitate was also detected in intracellular structures including the rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi stack and mitochondrial membranes. The sub-cellular localization of IRAP in neurons demonstrated in the present study bears striking parallels with distribution of IRAP in insulin responsive cells, where the enzyme plays a role in insulin-regulated glucose uptake. Therefore, we propose that the function of IRAP in neurons may be similar to that in insulin responsive cells.",
