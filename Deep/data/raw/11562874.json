     "AB": "INTRODUCTION: The limbic system, is associate to emotional behavior. Partial epileptic seizures are the expression of alterations of the temporal lobe, hippocampus and amygdala. In nonconvulsive episodes, autonomic alterations, visceral dysfunction and abnormal emotional states illustrate epileptic symptomatology. Fear responses, with possible connections to amygdala are presents in partial epileptic seizures. CLINICAL CASE: We present five patients with symptomatology mainly in emotional expression. Four had a structural lesion: one, multiple phacomatosis, two, tumors of the amygdala region (ganglioglioma) and one, a pineal cyst. The fifth child lacking a structural lesion, showed spike waves in the temporal lobe. CONCLUSION: It is essential to search for structural or functional alterations in patients with paroxysmal fear reactions, as probable partial crisis with psychoaffective manifestation.",
