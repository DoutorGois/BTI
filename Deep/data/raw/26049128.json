     "AB": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) is a key molecule in the neurodegenerative progression of Alzheimers disease (AD). It is critical to develop a treatment that can arrest the Abeta-induced pathologic progression of AD. Erythropoietin (EPO) has various protective effects in the nervous system. However, the effect of EPO on Abeta-induced Alzheimer-like cognitive deficits and pathological changes remains unclear. In the present study, we observed that the treatment of mice with EPO (1000 IU/kg) attenuated Abeta42-induced cognitive deficits and tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites through the regulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). We also observed that EPO attenuated the Abeta42-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in brain. These results indicate a potential role for EPO in AD therapy.",
