     "AB": "Knowledge about individual differences in behavioural traits and their neurostructural and neurochemical correlates should improve therapeutic approaches of corresponding psychopathology. The presented investigations are aimed to reveal interrelationships between central nervous serotonergic [5-HT] receptor densities and neurochemical as well as behavioural traits in two mice strains. Male AB-Halle [ABH] and AB-Gatersleben [ABG] mice differing in aggression were investigated after 6 weeks of isolation housing. 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors were analysed in different brain regions by in vitro autoradiography. HPLC determinations of aminergic transmission in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum as well as in the raphe-region and radioimmunoassay determination of serum corticosterone were done before (basal condition) and after behavioural tests (challenge condition). Receptor autoradiography revealed higher 5-HT1A receptor densities, especially in limbic regions, and lower 5-HT2A receptor densities in the basal ganglia of ABH mice. Furthermore, ABH mice characterized as behaviourally more active in the open field and plus maze as well as more reactive and aggressive during the social interaction test showed lower basal 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid [5-HIAA] concentrations in the hippocampus, cortex and raphe-region as well as a different activation pattern in serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic brain systems after challenge in comparison to ABG mice. Additionally lower corticosterone concentrations were found in ABH mice. Lower basal serotonergic and striatal dopaminergic, but higher basal cortical dopaminergic metabolism in contrast to enhanced challenge-induced central nervous serotonergic and cortical dopaminergic reactivities are discussed to be crucial for an enhanced reactive behavioural trait, which could secondarily result in aggression-related behaviours, where higher 5-HT1A receptor and lower 5-HT2A receptor densities may be essential.",
