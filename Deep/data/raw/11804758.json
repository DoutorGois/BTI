     "AB": "We selected 23 patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy characterized by ipsilateral hippocampal sclerosis and an apparently normal contralateral hippocampus on MR imaging. Images were acquired on a 0.28 T MR scanner using a conventional Carr-Purcell Meiboom Gill sequence in all patients and in 9 healthy subjects. Texture analysis was applied to axial MR images of the first and tenth echoes. Texture analysis detects macroscopic lesions and microscopic abnormalities that can not be observed visually. The presence of texture differences in the between normal (controls) and sclerotic hippocampi was ascertained by statistical discriminant analysis. The apparently normal contralateral hippocampi can be classified into three categories in terms of texture: 4 apparently healthy, 8 similar to sclerosis, and 11 different from either healthy or sclerosis. These findings are related to a certain degree of hippocampal alteration, which further investigation might help better characterize.",
