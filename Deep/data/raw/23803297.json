     "AB": "There is accumulating evidence showing that lifestyle factors like diet may influence the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous studies suggest that a multi-nutrient diet, Fortasyn, containing nutritional precursors and cofactors for membrane synthesis, viz. docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, uridine-mono-phosphate, choline, phospholipids, folic acid, vitamins B6, B12, C, E, and selenium, has an ameliorating effect on cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model. In the present study we analyzed learning strategies and memory of 11-month-old AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 (AbetaPP/PS1) mice in the Morris water maze (MWM) task performed after nine months of dietary intervention with a control diet or a Fortasyn diet to characterize diet-induced changes in cognitive performance. The Fortasyn diet had no significant effect on MWM task acquisition. To assess hippocampus-dependent learning, the strategies that the mice used to find the hidden platform in the MWM were analyzed using the swim path data. During the fourth day of the MWM, AbetaPP/PS1 mice on control diet more often used the non-spatial random search strategy, while on the Fortasyn diet, the transgenic animals exhibited more chaining strategy than their wild-type littermates. During the probe trial, AbetaPP/PS1 mice displayed no clear preference for the target quadrant. Notably, in both transgenic and nontransgenic mice on Fortasyn diet, the latency to reach the former platform position was decreased compared to mice on the control diet. In conclusion, this specific nutrient combination showed a tendency to improve searching behavior in AbetaPP/PS1 mice by increasing the use of a more efficient search strategy and improving their swim efficiency by decreasing the latency to reach the former platform position.",
