Chronic desmethylimipramine significantly reduced the number of 5HT2 binding sites in the frontal cortex but not hippocampus while chronic zimelidine did not affect 5HT2 binding in either brain region. The number and affinity of GABAB binding sites in the frontal cortex were unaltered by either drug.",
