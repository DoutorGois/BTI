     "AB": "Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injuries cause serious neurological sequelae, yet there is currently no effective treatment for them. We hypothesized that neurotrophic factors released into the medium by stem cells could supply hypoxia-damaged organotypic hippocampal slice cultures with regenerative abilities. We prepared organotypic slice cultures of the hippocampus of 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats based on the modified Stoppini method; slices were cultured for 14days in vitro using either Gahwiler's medium (G-medium) or stem cell-conditioned medium (S-medium) as culture medium. At day 14 in vitro, hippocampal slice cultures were exposed to 95% N2 and 5% CO2 for 3h to induce hypoxic damage, the extent of which was then measured using propidium iodide fluorescence and immunohistochemistry images. We performed dot blotting to estimate neurotrophic/growth factor levels in the G- and S-media. Organotypic hippocampal slices cultured using S-medium after hypoxic injury were significantly less damaged than those cultured using G-medium. GLUT1, NGF, GDNF, VEGF, GCSF, and IGF2 levels were higher in S-medium than in G-medium, whereas FGF1, HIF, and MCP3 levels were not significantly different between media. In conclusion, we found that stem cell-conditioned medium had a neuroprotective effect against hypoxic injury, and that, of the various neurotrophic factors in S-medium, NGF, GDNF, and VEGF can contribute to neuroprotection.",
