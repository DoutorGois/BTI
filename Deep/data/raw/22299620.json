     "AB": "In this study, we aimed to classify MR images for recognizing Alzheimer Disease (AD) in a group of patients who were recently diagnosed by clinical history and neuropsychiatric exams by using non-biased machine-learning techniques. T1 weighted MRI scans of 31 patients with probable AD and 31 age- and gender-matched cognitively normal elderly were analyzed with voxel-based morphometry and classified by support vector machine (SVM), a machine learning technique. SVM could differentiate patients from controls with accuracy of 74% (sensitivity: 70% and specificity: 77%) when the whole brain was included the analyses. The classification accuracy was increased to 79% (sensitivity: 65 % and specificity: 93%) when the analyses restricted to hippocampus. Our results showed that SVM is a promising tool for diagnosis of AD, but needed to be improved.",
