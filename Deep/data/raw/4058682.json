     "AB": "Recurring bursts of population spikes, a simple model of epileptiform activity, can be produced by exposing slices of rat hippocampus to saline containing 0.2 mM [Ca2+] and 4.0 mM [Mg2+], at which concentration chemical synaptic activity is blocked. Phenytoin at 7.3-73 microM shortened the duration of these bursts. At 73 microM the bursts were slowed and often eliminated. This model appears to be more sensitive to the action of phenytoin than the penicillin model of epileptiform bursting.",
