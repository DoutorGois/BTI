     "AB": "The activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the key enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis, dramatically increases after different types of brain injuries. The role of this induction is still unclear. We report here data on the temporal pattern of ODC induction caused by the excitotoxin kainic acid. After systemic administration, ODC activity increases severalfold peaking at 8 h in the prefrontal cortex and at 16 h in the olfactory cortex and hippocampus. After intrastriatal injection, the peak of induction is reached at 32 h, while a smaller and more transient increase is also observed in the contralateral, saline-injected striatum. We suggest that ODC induction is initially linked to overactivation of neural circuits and, later on, to the development of widespread neural damage.",
