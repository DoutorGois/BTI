     "AB": "BACKGROUND: alpha2-Adrenoceptor agonists are used frequently in human and veterinary anesthesia as sedative/analgesic drugs. However, they can impair cognition. Little is known about the concentration-dependent effects of alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists on synaptic plasticity, the neurophysiological basis of learning and memory. Therefore, we investigated the effects of different concentrations of medetomidine, an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, on basal excitatory synaptic transmission and on 2 forms of synaptic plasticity: paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and long-term potentiation (LTP). METHODS: Evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in Schaffer fibers-CA1 pyramidal cell synapses of mouse hippocampal slices, and the initial field excitatory postsynaptic potentials slope was measured. For basal synaptic transmission and PPF, increasing concentrations of medetomidine (1-200 muM) were applied to each slice. For LTP experiments, individual slices were used for each tested concentration of medetomidine (0.1-0.4 muM), where LTP induction and LTP maintenance were measured. RESULTS: The lower tested concentrations of medetomidine decreased LTP in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas greater concentrations were required to decrease fiber volley amplitude and basal excitatory synaptic transmission. PPF was only affected by the greatest concentration (200 muM). CONCLUSIONS: Medetomidine decreased LTP in the mouse hippocampus, in accordance with the ability of medetomidine to induce memory deficits.",
