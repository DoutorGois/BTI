     "AB": "In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of Ro25-6981 against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Ro25-6981 alone or in combination with rapamycin was intracerebroventricularly administered to rats which suffered transient forebrain ischemia inducing by 4-vessel occlusion and reperfusion. Nissl staining was used to determine the survival of CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, while immunohistochemistry was performed to measure neuron-specific enolase (NSE) expression. The expression of autophagy-related proteins, such as microtubule-associated protein l light chain 3 (LC3), Beclin 1, and sequestosome 1 (p62), was assessed by immunoblotting. Nissl staining showed that neuronal damage was reduced in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer in rats that received Ro25-6981. The protective effect of Ro25-6981 was dose-dependent, with a significant effect in the middle-dose range. The expression of NSE increased after Ro25-6981 treatment. Ro25-6981 significantly decreased LC3II (which is membrane bound) and Beclin 1, and increased p62. In addition, Ro25-6981 decreased rapamycin-induced neuronal damage and excessive activation of autophagy after I/R. Taken together, the results suggest that Ro25-6981 could suppress ischemic brain injury by regulating autophagy-related proteins during ischemia/reperfusion.",
