     "AB": "PURPOSE: It is becoming increasingly clear that genetic factors play a role in traumatic brain injury (TBI), whether in modifying clinical outcome after TBI or determining susceptibility to it. MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules involved in various pathophysiological processes by repressing target genes at the post- transcriptional level, and TBI alters microRNA expression levels in the hippocampus and cortex. This study was designed to detect differentially expressed microRNAs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of TBI patients remaining unconscious two weeks after initial injury and to explore related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). METHODS: We used a microarray platform to detect differential microRNA expression levels in CSF samples from patients with post-traumatic coma compared with samples from controls. A bioinformatic scan was performed covering microRNA gene promoter regions to identify potential functional SNPs. RESULTS: Totally 26 coma patients and 21 controls were included in this study, with similar distribution of age and gender between the two groups. Microarray showed that fourteen microRNAs were differentially expressed, ten at higher and four at lower expression levels in CSF of traumatic coma patients compared with controls (p<0.05). One SNP (rs11851174 allele: C/T) was identified in the motif area of the microRNA hsa-miR-431-3P gene promoter region. CONCLUSION: The altered microRNA expression levels in CSF after brain injury together with SNP identified within the microRNA gene promoter area provide a new perspective on the mechanism of impaired consciousness after TBI. Further studies are needed to explore the association between the specific microRNAs and their related SNPs with post-traumatic unconsciousness.",
