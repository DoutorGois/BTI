     "AB": "Little is known about the regulation and cellular distribution of androgen receptors (ARs) in female rodent brains at various stages of the oestrous cycle. This information is critical for further studies of androgen signalling in the regulation of brain function under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In this report, we show that the distribution of AR immunoreactivity in the female rat brain is consistent with reported AR mRNA hybridisation signals in the male brain, except for the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses performed herein revealed that the onset of region-specific changes in AR proteins was strongly correlated with circulating and ovarian levels of estradiol and testosterone across the oestrous cycle. During the metestrus and diestrus stages, however, the highest levels of AR expression were abolished by chronic dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment. This demonstrates that fluctuations in endogenous androgens are required for the regulation of AR expression in the female rat brain. Colocalisation studies revealed that: (1) anatomical variations in AR protein localisation existed between female and male brains, (2) AR immunoreactivity was both neuronal and non-neuronal, and (3) AR protein expression was lower in female rat brains at all stages of the oestrous cycle compared to age-matched males. Our results indicate the presence of regional sex differences in AR expression and changes in the proportion of AR between different subcellular compartments. Furthermore, DHT was found to down-regulate the level of AR in the subcellular compartment in females in a region-specific manner. As a whole, the present study provides the first step toward understanding the dynamics of AR expression and regulation in the brain during normal physiological conditions and for differences in neuronal androgen effects based on sex.",
