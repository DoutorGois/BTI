     "AB": "The excitatory glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus are modulated by inhibitory GABA-releasing interneurons. The neuromodulator adenosine is known to inhibit the presynaptic release of neurotransmitters and to hyperpolarize postsynaptic neurons in the hippocampus, which would imply that it is an endogenous protective agent against cerebral ischemia and excitotoxic neuronal damage. Interactions of the GABAergic and adenosinergic systems in regulating neuronal excitability in the hippocampus is of crucial importance, particularly under cell-damaging conditions. We now characterized the effects of adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists on the release of preloaded [3H]GABA from hippocampal slices prepared from adult (3-month-old) mice, using a superfusion system. The effects were tested both under normal conditions and in ischemia induced by omitting glucose and oxygen from the superfusion medium. Basal and K+ -evoked GABA release in the hippocampus were depressed by adenosinergic compounds. Under normal conditions activation of both adenosine A1 and A2A receptors by the agonists R(-)N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine and CGS 21680 inhibited the K+ -evoked release, which effects were blocked by their specific antagonists, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropyl-xanthine and 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine, respectively. Under ischemic conditions the release of both GABA and adenosine is markedly enhanced. The above receptor agonists then depressed both the basal and K+ -evoked GABA release, only the action of A2A receptors being however receptor-mediated. The demonstrated depression of GABA release by adenosine in the hippocampus could be deleterious to neurons and contribute to excitotoxicity.",
