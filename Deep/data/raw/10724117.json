     "AB": "This study examined whether prolonged hypothermia induced 1 hour after resuscitation from asphyxial cardiac arrest would improve neurologic outcome and alter levels of stress-related proteins in rats. Rats were resuscitated from 8 minutes of asphyxia resulting in cardiac arrest. Brain temperature was regulated after resuscitation in three groups: normothermia (36.8 degrees C x 24 hours), immediate hypothermia (33 degrees C x 24 hours, beginning immediately after resuscitation), and delayed hypothermia (33 degrees C x 24 hours, beginning 60 minutes after resuscitation). Mortality and neurobehavioral deficits were improved in immediate and delayed hypothermia rats relative to normothermia rats. Furthermore, both immediate and delayed hypothermia improved neuronal survival in the CA1 region of the hippocampus assessed at 14 days. In normothermia rats, the 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) and 40-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp40) were increased within 12 hours after resuscitation in the hippocampus. Delayed hypothermia attenuated the increase in Hsp70 levels in the hippocampus but did not affect Hsp70 induction in the cerebellum. Hippocampal expression of Hsp40 was not affected by hypothermia. These data indicate that prolonged hypothermia during later reperfusion improves neurologic outcome after experimental global ischemia and is associated with selective changes in the pattern of stress-induced protein expression.",
