     "AB": "The present study describes the spatial firing properties of neurons in the lateral septum (LS). LS neuronal activity was recorded in rats as they performed a spatial navigation task in an open field. In this task, the rat acquired an intracranial self-stimulation reward when it entered a certain place, a location that varied randomly from trial to trial. Of 193 neurons recorded in the LS, 81 showed place-related activity. The majority of the tested neurons changed place-related activity when spatial relations between environmental cues were altered by rotating intrafield (proximal) cues. The comparison of place activities between LS place-related neurons recorded in the present study and hippocampal place cells recorded in our previous study, using identical behavioral and recording procedures, revealed that spatial parameters (spatial information content, coherence, and cluster size) were smaller in the LS than in the hippocampus. Of the 193 LS neurons, 86 were influenced by intracranial self-stimulation rewards; 31 of these 86 were also place-related. These results, together with previous anatomical and behavioral observations, suggest that the spatial information sent from the hippocampus to the LS is modulated by and interacts with signals related to reward in the LS.",
