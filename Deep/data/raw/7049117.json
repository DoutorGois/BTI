     "AB": "The dense microsphere (DMS) is a newly delineated, nonautofluorescent gray-matter structure of constant morphology and unknown significance, which is found principally in cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus in the normal and diseased adult human brain. It resembles a nonperikaryal cytoplasmic inclusion body, and is acquired after birth. Is density (frequency) is constant in persons younger than 70 years, and significantly decreases in the brains of senile persons. Indirect immunohistochemical studies using guinea pig, goose, and rabbit antireovirus antisera demonstrated positive fluorescence of the DMS, which indicates the presence of an DMS, which indicates the presence of an anti-DMS antibody that may be an antireovirus antibody.",
