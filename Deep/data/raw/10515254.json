     "AB": "To study possible effects of physical training on the expression of neurotrophic factors and their receptors in the brain, we used a rat strain (spontaneously hypertensive rat, SHR), known to spontaneously run up to 20 km/night. We show that such long-distance running affects the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB system in hippocampus, and in particular that abrupt deprivation of habitual running leads to long-lasting decreases of BDNF/TrkB expression in hippocampus. Quantitative in situ hybridization demonstrates that running increases the expression of mRNA coding for BDNF and its high affinity receptor TrkB in hippocampus in a running length dependent manner. In addition, we show that an abrupt interruption of prolonged spontaneous exercise decrease expression of mRNA encoding BDNF and TrkB in certain hippocampal areas and that this decrease lasts at least 10 days. This down-regulation was most prominent in medial cornu ammonis 3 (CA3M). Several other trophic factors and receptors were investigated, including NGF, NT3, GDNF, trkC and p75. For these other probes investigated, no robust changes in mRNA expression were noted. Areas examined included sensorimotor cortex and hippocampus. For RET, p75, NT3, TrkB and BDNF we also examined the spinal cord without detecting any robust changes. We conclude that spontaneous running as well as its abrupt termination, leads to area-specific and trophic factor-specific changes in hippocampus.",
