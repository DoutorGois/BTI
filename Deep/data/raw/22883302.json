     "AB": "StarD6, which might be considered to be neuroprotective, and DNA repair proteins can play a role against oxidative damages by excitotoxin in the nervous system. In order to investigate the relationship between StarD6 and DNA repair proteins, excitotoxicity was induced by domoic acid in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Western blot analysis revealed transitorily elevated levels in StarD6, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE) and 8-oxoguanine DNA-glycosylase (Ogg1) in accord with the DNA damage marker phosphorylated H2AX. Immunohistochemistry revealed that increased intensity was transiently seen not only in the Stratum (Str.) radiatum and Str. lacunosum-moleculare with StarD6 and APE, but also in the Str. pyramidale with Ogg1. Intensities decreased 24h after domoic acid injection in CA3 with APE and Ogg1 as well as in the Str. radiatum and Str. lacunosum-moleculare with StarD6 and APE. These results suggested that StarD6 may not be closely related with DNA repair proteins in the hippocampus after domoic acid-induced excitotoxicity, although the activities of these proteins might be positively affected by excitotoxic stimuli.",
